That trend continued with third-quarter results Thursday morning for the high-end coat maker.But shares are tumbling intraday, with one pro pointing to high expectations overshadowing a solid performance.X Estimates: Per-share earnings of 36 cents on $188 million in revenue, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: Canada Goose reported revenue of $209.3 million with earnings per share of 46 cents. No guidance update was provided in the release.Stock: Shares tumbled 16.6% to 31.79 in the stock market today, after hitting a new intraday high of 38.25 on Wednesday.It wasn't immediately clear what was driving the stock lower. Analysts were looking for guidance, but Canada Goose said it will only do so on an annual basis, after the fiscal Q4 report.In trying to make sense of the plummet, Wells Fargo retail analyst Ike Boruchow noted that while the parka maker turned in another consecutive beat, with strong gross margins and continued growth potential, sales were softer than many bulls had hoped and there was ""expectation for a much more material beat, and hope for a raise.""""While results were very strong and fundamentals here remain extremely robust, they simply fell short of the extremely bullish view that most investors had coming into the print,"" he wrote.""That said, there is nothing that gives us pause on our fundamental stance on the name today, and actually today's pullback creates a healthy buying opportunity, in our view, for investors who feel they may have 'missed it' before.""The stock has been on a steady march higher since September, boasting a Relative Strength rating of 98, meaning it has outperformed 98% of all other publicly traded stocks.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Fellow premium fashion name Michael Kors (KORS) topped earnings forecasts Wednesday. Tapestry (TPR) (parent to Coach and Kate Spade) beat views on Tuesday. Ralph Lauren (RL) disappointed on revenue last week.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: These 2 Top Retail Stocks Are Hitting New Highs In Volatile MarketCheck Out These 5 Stocks In This Hot Industry GroupStocks Dive, But S&P 500 Earnings Beating Estimates By Most In YearsInvesting In IPO Stocks: Know The Risk With Snap, Future 'Unicorns'The Next New IPO Gems: Can You Find The Next Google, Facebook, Cisco Or Microsoft?

However, it still declined by 52.9 % year-over-year. Revenue slipped 4% to $921 million, but beat estimates by $31 million.Fossil, which also produces bags, wallets and jewelry, soared 88% to close at 16.97 in high volume on the stock market today.

Fitbit (FIT) jumped 9.4%, Movado Group (MOV) gained 4.9%, and Coach parent Tapestry (TPR) rallied 0.7%.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.However Wells Fargo senior analyst Ike Boruchow presented a contrasting interpretation in a research note to clients, rating the stock as underperform and raising the price target to $8 from $4.""While we acknowledge that the stock is likely to rally meaningfully in the near term given the stock hasn't had any type of good news in well over a year, valuation had compressed meaningfully (to 4.5x EBITDA) and shares have massively underperformed over the past 12 months (FOSL shares — 70% vs. SPX +20% in 2017), we would still contend that the fundamental story here remains extremely challenged,"" Boruchow said.He pointed out the legacy business has been lagging as the company focused on wearables, which had missed plan by about $20 million in the fourth quarter, leaving the company with excess inventories that will be liquidated this year. He also said the balance sheet is ""a significant concern.""Boruchow also said the company has a ""fundamental backdrop that remains one of the most challenged in our universe.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Best Opportunity For Apple Watch Still Ahead As Wearables Market Evolves Retail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry NewsNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

""Our innovative fashion luxury product offerings for the holiday season created excitement among consumers. At Jimmy Choo, we continued to deliver glamorous luxury product and engaging brand communications, which helped drive revenue during the quarter.""Outlook: Kors sees fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.11 billion to $1.13 billion, including $110 million to $115 million of incremental Jimmy Choo revenue.

The month prior, ex-Kors exec Anna Bakst boarded Kate Spade as chief executive and brand president.Coach has pivoted from large logos (although those are notably coming back in style, particularly in China), pulled back from department stores shelves, revamped certain stores, and partnered up with pop star Selena Gomez on a purse collection.Coach is still a favorite brand over Kors among women and those with household incomes of more than $100,000, which indicates ""brand prestige and potential for greater full-price selling,"" noted Chen.And the Kate Spade brand, acquired barely a year ago, is still hugely popular, especially with women and the key millennial demo.""The percentage of women who believe carrying a Kate Spade bag makes them feel 'put together' increased among the Broad Premium Market, and 85% of women believe Kate Spade bags are 'fashionable' and 'on trend,' "" he wrote back in February.When Tapestry reports next week, Zacks Investment Research analysts expect a 9% profit increase to 50 cents a share on 31% sales growth to $1.302 billion.Shares closed up 0.5% at 53.44 on the stock market today and have jumped around 30% so far in 2018, trading at levels not seen since the start of 2014.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

Sonys (SNE  -  Free Report) next generation console, PlayStation 3, will be available on Friday, Nov 17. Nintendos (NTDOY  -  Free Report) new system, Wii, will be released on Sunday, Nov 19. Both systems are expected to give the video game industry a boost. 
"
24,TPR,"Investors looking to take advantage of the hoopla surrounding the release of the PlayStation 3 and the Wii may want to research THQ (THQI). The video game maker is a Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stock and recently exceeded earnings expectations.
"
25,TPR,"THQ generated fiscal second-quarter profits of 19 cents per share, 20 cents above expectations. (Analysts had forecast a loss of a penny per share.)  Net sales rose 68% to $240.2 million, aided by strong sales of Saints Row and Cars. Looking forward, THQ anticipates generating net sales this fiscal year of $925 million to $975 million, versus previous guidance for sales of $900 million to $950 million. Earnings are expected to come in a range of 95 cents to $1.05 per share, excluding stock option expense of 18 cents per share. Four covering analysts adjusted their estimates in response to the revised guidance, resulting in a three-cent increase in the consensus estimate to 83 cents per share.
"
26,TPR,"Video game maker Activision (ATVI  -  Free Report) is also on the Zacks #1 Rank List. The company announced last week that fiscal second-quarter revenues totaled $188.2 million, a decrease from a year prior, but far above the companys projection of $130 million. ATVI also reaffirmed its previously raised guidance for fiscal 2007 revenues of $1.15 billion. However, the company withheld earnings data pending an internal review of historical stock option practice. (The Zacks Rank is a quantitative model that does not consider external factors such as a delay in reporting earnings.)
"
27,TPR,"Both THQI and ATVI are classified in Toys/Game/Hobby, a group I featured on Oct 25 following positive reports from Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) and Mattel (MAT  -  Free Report). Over the past few weeks, analysts have become even more bullish on HAS, pushing the consensus estimates for 2006 and 2007 up to $1.26 and $1.47 per share, respectively. When the company was last featured, analysts were anticipating profits of $1.22 and $1.44 per share, respectively. The consensus estimates for MAT have also been adjusted: $1.29 (a one-cent increase) and $1.42 (a two-cent increase) per share for 2006 and 2007, respectively. HAS is a Zacks #1 Rank stock and MAT is a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stock.
"
28,TPR,"Last week, I highlighted Textile Apparels. During the past seven days, another company within this group was added to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Polo Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report).
"
29,TPR,"Polo Ralph Lauren was added to the prestigious list after delivering a very good fiscal second-quarter earnings report. The companys profits totaled $1.28 per share, easily surpassing expectations for profits of $1.06 per share. Revenues, exclusive of the Polo jeans acquisition, grew 9%. (Overall revenues grew 14% to $1.17 billion.) More impressively, operating margins widened by 120 basis points to 18.4%. Both wholesale and retail sales drove topline growth and various initiatives helped to contribute to the better margins. RL expects the positive momentum to continue and increased its guidance for fiscal 2007 profits to a range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, from $3.25 to $3.35 per share. 
"
30,TPR,"Textile Apparel also contains another maker of luxury consumer goods, Coach (COH).
"
31,TPR,"COH is a Zacks #2 Rank stock. A few weeks ago, the company reported fiscal first-quarter profits of 34 cents per share, three cents above analysts expectations and four cents above the companys own guidance. Net sales rose to $554 million, thanks in part to what Coach described as rapid growth in the premium handbag market. The company also raised its guidance for fiscal 2007 earnings to at least $1.63 per share. Nearly all of the covering analysts adjusted their forecasts in response, causing the consensus estimate to rise to $1.65 per share, from $1.57 per share.
"
32,TPR,"Although the residential real estate market is slowing, demand for commercial real estate remains strong. One beneficiary of the strength within the commercial real estate market is The Genlyte Group (GLYT). This manufacturer of lighting fixtures and controls recently reported record third-quarter earnings of $1.32 per share, surpassing expectations by 25 cents per share. Revenues rose 26% to $410.4 million. Recent acquisitions helped to pace the rise in revenues, as did price increases and improvements in office vacancy rates and hospitality occupancy rates. Analysts responded by raising their projections for both this year and next. The new 2006 consensus estimate calls for earnings of $4.39 per share, versus the month old forecast of $4.08 per share. The new 2007 forecast calls for profits of $4.93 per share, versus the month old forecast of $4.64 per share.
"
33,TPR,"GLYT is a Zacks #1 Rank stock and belongs to Building Products-Lighting Fixtures. This group also includes three Zacks #2 Rank stocks.
"
34,TPR,"The total number of earnings estimate revisions for companies within the Zacks Rank universe1 continued to increase. Using a four-week rolling period, a total of 13,108 profit forecasts, nearly 10,000 more than what we saw that the end of September. The majority of these revisions are for 2006; however, since the numbers are based on fiscal year calendars, there are a growing number of 2007 estimates factored into this analysis. Therefore, the numbers are best referred to as simply F1. The ratio of positive to negative estimate revisions is 1.16, about even with a week ago.

37,TPR,"There are some trends which emerge in the fashion world and stick around forever. But then there are others which are merely fads, likely to fade over time. Fortunes can be made for those smart enough to invest in the early stages of a fad, but one could just as easily lose a fortune betting an old fad will return. One fad with a loyal following but a terrifying stock right now is our Bear of the Day, Crocs (CROX  -  Free Report).Crocs, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children worldwide. It offers various footwear products, including clogs, sandals, flips and slides, shoes, and boots. The company’s primary trademarks include the Crocs logo and the Crocs word mark. It sells its products in approximately 90 countries through domestic and international retailers and distributors, as well as directly to end-user consumers through company-operated retail stores, outlets, e-commerce store sites, and kiosks. As of December 31, 2016, Crocs, Inc. operated 228 retail stores; 98 kiosks and store-in-stores; 232 outlet stores; and 12 company-operated e-commerce sites. Crocs shares were a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) heading into earnings because analysts had gone out and recently dropped their earnings estimates for the current quarter, next quarter, current year and next year. Just a week before earnings, the drop in estimates took our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 10 cents to 3 cents.The good news for Crocs is next quarter looks much more promising, with our Zacks Consensus Estimate rising from 18 cents to 22 cents. There is also some optimism for next year where the number has gone from 24 cents to 33 cents.There really hasn’t been any optimism in the stock price though. Shares haven’t been north of $9 since August 2016. The stock has consistently come under pressure over the last year as most rallies were wiped out just days after they occurred. Now the stock is looking to carve out a bottom at $6. The Commodity Channel Index remains heavily oversold down at -156 and the 50-day moving average has a negative slop and is 33 cents above the current price.Crocs is in an industry that ranks in the Bottom 7% of our Zacks Industry Rank.

38,TPR,"Theres no doubt that most analysts are wary of retail.  August sales were sluggish, leading several retailers to quarterly numbers that leave much to be desired.  Concern over such factors are being exacerbated since we are at the beginning of the all-important back-to-school season.  Furthermore, hurricanes Charley, Frances, and now Ivan have further complicated matters.  But despite all of this, the textiles and apparel industry has a Zacks Industry Rank of 3.0, which places it 92nd out of more than 200 industries.  Thats a pretty good position considering all the nervousness surrounding retail and the larger implications on consumer confidence.  The bottom line is that strong opportunities still exist, but you may need a little help from the analysts to bring them into the light. 
"
39,TPR,"Early data suggests that discount retailers and wholesale club operators bore a good deal of the burden during August.  However, those companies with a compelling product have fared better.  One of the more recent examples has been Coach (NYSE: COH).  Earlier this month, as explained below, the accessories stalwart raised its fiscal first quarter guidance thanks to results tracking ahead of plan.  A Thomas Weisel Partners analyst stated: Coach continues to benefit from absence of strong competition, growing the overall market, continued increases in the average ticket due to strong response to higher price point items and solid overall execution.  Consumer reaction to the Fall product has continued to be strong.  
"
40,TPR,"Other apparel manufacturers that design and market a more specialized product have also been bucking the larger trend.  Companies such as Nike, which sells athletic footwear; Timberland, which sells outdoor-inspired footwear; Columbia Sportswear, and Quiksilver, which encompasses a board-riding heritage; have all put together strong numbers of late.  Meanwhile, Wal-Mart, the worlds largest retailer, announced earlier this month that its third quarter earnings would only reach the low end of its expected range.  
"
41,TPR,"Investors must be cautious at this time.  According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, same-store sales in August rose by an anemic +1.2%.  Thats below what many were expecting.  Consumers are keeping a tight strap on their pocketbooks due to factors such as high gas prices.  
"
42,TPR,"Given the current strains on the overall industry, many investors have decided to keep their distance from all retail exposure.  However, investors are a worried bunch by nature, and some deeper research could uncover solid opportunities to help you make headway in this space.  Wall Street analysts are your best resource in differentiating between those that can prosper thanks to a strong product, and those that will have to ride out the storm.

80,TPR,"Investors interested in stocks from the Retail - Apparel and Shoes sector have probably already heard of Shoe Carnival (SCVL  -  Free Report) and Tapestry (TPR  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Shoe Carnival and Tapestry are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that SCVL likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than TPR has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.SCVL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.17, while TPR has a forward P/E of 17.54. We also note that SCVL has a PEG ratio of 1.35. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TPR currently has a PEG ratio of 1.56.Another notable valuation metric for SCVL is its P/B ratio of 1.76. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TPR has a P/B of 4.18.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to SCVL's Value grade of B and TPR's Value grade of C.SCVL stands above TPR thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that SCVL is the superior value option right now.

81,TPR,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.7% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TPR due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Tapestry Q3 Earnings & Revenues Top EstimatesTapestry, Inc. posted better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Adjusted earnings of 54 cents a share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents, thereby resulting in a positive earnings surprise of 8% and marking the 17th straight quarter of earnings beat. The quarterly earnings improved approximately 17% year over year buoyed by top line growth.Net sales came in at $1,322.4 million, up 33% year over year. On a constant currency basis, net sales surged 30%. We noted that the total sales came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,304 million, marking the second successive quarterly beat.Tapestry is undergoing a brand transformation and is introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets. The acquisition of Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade & Company is being viewed as a significant step in its efforts toward becoming a multi-brand company. Moreover, management has undertaken transformation initiatives revolving around product, stores and marketing. Sales increase at Coach brand, contributions from recent buyouts and cost containment efforts favorably impacted the results.The company also relaunched Signature in retail and expanded offering in sport category. The company introduced footwear in directly operated stores worldwide and in North America wholesale with plans to expand distribution to important wholesale partners in Europe in fiscal 2019. The company also launched smartwatch with Fossil.However, investors became cautious following management’s remark on Stuart Weitzman results. The company highlighted that delay in production and lower sell-through of important carryover styles hurt sales and margins. Management hinted that some of these issues may persist through the Fall/Winter season and added that sales and profitability may continue to remain under pressure in the final quarter. Analysts also pointed that dismal comparable-store sales performance at Kate Spade and overall margin contraction might have also weigh on investor sentiment. The company also hinted that it will continue to pull back wholesale disposition and lower surprise sales for the Kate Spade brand.We note that consolidated adjusted gross profit surged roughly 29% to $913 million, however, gross margin decreased 190 basis points to 69%. The lower margin profile of the Kate Spade brand hurt gross margin by roughly 120 basis points. Further, adjusted operating income came in at $184.3 million, up 14% from the prior-year quarter figure but operating margin shrunk 240 basis points to 13.9%.During the quarter under review, the company concluded the acquisition of the Coach business in Australia and New Zealand as well as the Stuart Weitzman business in Northern China from its distributors. Management also took full control of the Kate Spade joint ventures for Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Such moves help the company to directly operate these businesses, look for growth opportunities in international markets and enhance brand development.Segment DetailsNet sales for Coach came in at $969.3 million, reflecting an increase of 6% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis. Comparable-store sales rose 3%, including a gain of about 100 basis points on account of rise in global e-commerce.Kate Spade sales came in at $269.3 million. Comparable-store sales declined 9%, including the adverse impact of about 800 basis points from a fall in global e-commerce. Net sales for Stuart Weitzman totaled $83.8 million, reflecting an increase of 5%.Store Update At the end of the quarter, the company operated 405 Coach stores, 188 Kate Spade outlets and 70 Stuart Weitzman stores in North America.

During the quarter, the company opened 9 new stores and closed 11.Tapestry plans to close approximately 5 net Coach locations and open 20 net new Kate Spade locations globally. The company has opened 2 net Stuart Weitzman locations year-to-date.Other Financial Details Tapestry ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,038.3 million, long-term debt of $1,599.5 million and shareholders' equity of $3,138 million.Management generated cash from operations of $156 million and incurred capital expenditures of $60 million, thereby resulting in free cash flow of roughly $95 million. The company projects capital expenditures of about $300 million for fiscal 2018.FY 2018 GuidanceManagement continues to expect fiscal 2018 revenue to increase approximately 30% year over year to $5.8-$5.9 billion with low-single digit organic growth and Kate Spade acquisition adding more than $1.2 billion in revenue.Tapestry now projects operating income growth of at least 22% on the back of mid-single digit organic growth, Kate Spade buyout and estimated synergies of $45 million. Interest expense is now expected to be about $75 million.Management now envisions earnings in the band of $2.57-$2.60, reflecting an increase of approximately 19-21%, comprising high single digit accretion from the Kate Spade buyout. The company had earlier projected earnings in the range of $2.52-$2.60 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been ten revisions lower for the current quarter.Tapestry, Inc. Price and Consensus  Tapestry, Inc. Price and Consensus | Tapestry, Inc.

However, we noticed that shares are down roughly 13% during pre-market trading hours.Stock Down: Here’s WhyThe stock came under pressure following management’s remark on Stuart Weitzman results. The company highlighted that delay in production and lower sell-through of important carryover styles hurt sales and margins. Management added that some of these issues may persist through the Fall/Winter season. Analysts also pointed that dismal comparable-store sales performance at Kate Spade and overall margin contraction might have also weigh on investor sentiment.We note that consolidated adjusted gross profit surged roughly 29% to $913 million, however, gross margin decreased 190 basis points to 69%. Further, adjusted operating income came in at $184.3 million, up 14% from the prior-year quarter figure but operating margin shrunk 240 basis points to 13.9%.Tapestry, Inc.

116,TPR,"The Q1 earnings season has crossed the halfway mark, with earnings and revenue growth well on track to mark the highest in seven years.However, two factors are dampening the optimism for this reporting cycle. First, estimates for the quarter under review have remained stagnant, as was the case at the start of the season. Second, though the positive surprises are trending beyond historical levels, they have so far failed to beat the previous earnings cycle, especially with respect to revenue surprises.Per Earnings Preview dated Apr 27, the total earnings for the S&P 500 index in the first quarter are projected to improve 22.6% year over year on revenue growth of 8.4%. In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings and revenues have increased 13.4% and 8.6%, respectively.The first-quarter 2018 earnings season has seen releases from nearly 267 S&P 500 members as of Apr 27. Per the latest report, the scenario looks compelling, with 76.8% of the members delivering positive earnings surprises and 73.8% trumping top-line expectations. In fact, the proportion of companies pulling off earnings and revenue beats is a stellar 61.4%. Also, earnings for the companies that have reported their financial numbers advanced 25.1% from the year-ago period, with revenues up 10%.The performance of the index is not restricted to a single sector, and of the 16 Zacks sectors, only the Autos space is expected to witness an earnings decline in the reporting season. While textile-apparel stocks like — Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) and Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) — form part of Consumer Discretionary sector, Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report) belongs to Retail/Wholesale sector.According to the above report, total quarterly earnings for the Consumer Discretionary sector are likely to grow 12.1% year over year, with revenues expected to increase 6.6%. In fact, margins are also estimated to edge up 0.6% year over year. This bullish projection can be attributed to gain from a buoyant U.S. economy characterized by rising consumer confidence, improving consumer spending and an accelerating labor market.Meanwhile, Retail/Wholesale sector has long been witnessing an evolving environment where retailers are adhering to various omni-channel techniques for providing a seamless shopping experience. Impressively, total earnings for the sector are likely to increase 17.8% year over year in Q1, courtesy of revenues growth of 7.8%. The sector’s margins are also expected move up 0.4% year over year.Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.All said, let’s find out where Under Armour, Hanesbrands and Tapestry stand ahead of their earnings releases on May 1.Key Predictions for UAA and HBI Under Armour has pulled off a positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 10.2%. However, the company missed the earnings estimate in the last reported quarter. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter of 2018 is pegged at a loss of 5 cents, wider than the loss of a penny reported a year ago. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.12 billion, almost flat with the year-ago quarter figure. Per management, revenues are likely to decline or remain flat year over year in Q1. Also, it envisions loss per share in the range 6-7 cents due to adjusted operating loss of nearly $15 million.Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Under Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Under Armour, Inc. Quote Moreover, prolonged weakness in the North American business and soft margins are likely to hurt the company’s quarterly results. Further, Under Armour has been struggling to keep interest expenses in check. However, sustained focus on brand development, restructuring plans, expansion of direct-to-consumer and technology-based fitness businesses remain encouraging. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +11.31.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, it pulled off a negative earnings surprise of 1.9% that is likely to continue in the first quarter of 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at 24 cents, mirroring a year-over-year decline of 17.2%. Moreover, the company has been battling higher cost of sales and marketing expenses due to a challenging U.S. wholesale landscape.Hanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hanesbrands Inc. Quote Nevertheless, Hanesbrands has been benefiting from its strong international performance and increasing organic sales, thus resulting in top-line growth. Apparently, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,431 million for the first quarter, up about 3.7% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Notably, the expectation lies within management’s forecast of net sales in the band of $1.42-$1.44 billion for the quarter.

(Read: Hanesbrands Q1 Earnings: Can Strategies Pare Cost Woes?)What Lies Ahead of TPR?Tapestry boasts an impressive earnings surprise history, with a beat in each of the trailing four quarters by an average of 11.9%.

The company is also undergoing a brand transformation and introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets. In this regard, management is viewing the acquisitions of Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade as a significant step toward becoming a multi-brand company. Moreover, Tapestry has undertaken transformation initiatives revolving around product, stores and marketing, alongside expanding its e-commerce platform. These are likely to have a favorable impact on its third-quarter results. It has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.15%.

117,TPR,"The luxury goods market had a lavish 2017 with impressive sales figures from top players. Given the continuing economic recovery, the momentum is likely to continue in 2018. Also, optimism surrounding steady economic growth, lower tax rates, strong wage growth and a robust earnings season hint at a brighter future for luxury stocks. Robust sales figures registered by a number of luxury brands in China along with an increasing number of millennials spending more on luxury goods bode well too. A Stunning 2017 U.S. luxury stocks witnessed a robust 2017. The S&P Global Luxury Index has risen 34.76% in the last year. Shares of PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) have surged 62.4%, while Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) has rallied 67.02% in the same time frame.  The last 12 months were also great for LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (LVMUY  -  Free Report), Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL  -  Free Report) and Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report), which gained 51.35%, 34.44% and 29.31%, respectively.While LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, Michael Kors Holdings Limited and Ralph Lauren Corp. carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), PVH Corp. and Tapestry have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Interestingly, it wasn’t only the domestic market but also the international space, particularly China, that saw companies coming up with a stellar show. Overall, the impressive performance of luxury goods was a global affair following a change in the tastes and habits of shoppers.The overall global economy too was strong, which helped luxury goods’ stocks to grow. A good start to the holiday season in 2017 gave an added thrust to the share price of luxury brands that range from wearables, to handbags, belts, eyewear, sportswear and shoes.Global Factors Influencing GrowthThe overall picture for luxury goods was quite rosy in 2017 with the big players going all out to make their presence felt in the global market. One of the primary reasons was that most brands focused more on millennials, who are splurging on luxury goods pretty early.According to a February 2018 survey report by Mindshare North America, 57% of shoppers are between the ages of 18 and 34, indicating that millennials are now the biggest shoppers.That said, the optimism surrounding steady economic growth, higher wages, business-friendly policies by the government and an appeal for luxury in emerging economies cannot be overlooked.Moreover, a number of luxury brands also expanded globally, which helped them come up with higher sales. While Tapestry acquired Kate Spade for $2.4 billion last year, Kors acquired Jimmy Choo for $1.2 billion to expand its presence in China.LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA registered record sales for 2017 with a like-for-like sales growth of 12%, double the rate of 2016. The growth was driven by the stupendous performance of its fashion and leather goods divisions. Moreover, one of the best U.S. holiday season in years helped Tiffany rev up its sales.China Powers Global ExpansionFor global luxury brands, China remains the hottest destination. Most big names reported of benefiting from the China market in 2017 and 2018 too won’t be any different. And those who are yet to explore that market are fast gearing up to set up shop in China.Per a January 2018 Bain & Co report, sales of luxury goods in China, which moved at a snail’s pace for years, escalated at the fastest rate in more than half a decade in 2017 and are expected to perform well in 2018. The report further says that sales of luxury goods in China touched 142 billion yuan ($22.07 billion) in 2017, increasing almost 20% from a year ago. The highly dynamic Chinese market helped brands like LVMH and Kors and Tapestry.Global luxury goods purchases by Chinese shoppers jumped 12% last year to €84 billion ($104 billion), per Bain & Co. This surge in consumer spending is being attributed to the changing demographics in China. Those born after the adoption of the one-child policy in 1979, today comprise the highest number of shoppers.Moreover, the millennials, who are setting new fashion trends, are the biggest spenders and most luxury brands are following them. At the same time, per a February 2018 BCG report, social media and word-of-mouth are the first and second sources of information for shoppers in China, with 49% and 30% share, respectively. Keeping that in mind, most global luxury brands are going the D2C (direct-to-customer) way in China. Last July, LVMH launched its directly operated online store that country. Prior to that, Kors and Burberry too opened e-commerce sites in China.Millennials & Boomers to Power 2018 GrowthMillennials are dominating the changing preferences and habits of consumers as they comprise the highest percentage of shoppers. Naturally, focus on millennials will be the key to success for luxury brands in 2018. Millennials’ tastes and preferences are increasingly blurring the gap between premium and luxury brands.According to Mindshare North America’s recent survey, 55% millennials are of the opinion that big luxury brands are losing their personal feel compared with 46% Gen X and 23% of Boomers. Hence most brands are addressing these perceptions and trying to meet the demands of millennials, who are trend setters.At the same time, Boomers cannot be neglected as they are the ones with great spending impact in the market right now. So, while millennials are setting trends, Boomers have more spending power. Most luxury brands are trying to strike a perfect balance between the two.Future PerfectWith positives such as a recovering economy, lower tax rates and business-friendly policies, luxury brands are poised for growth in 2018. The China market, which saw sluggish sales for years, is finally recovering with sales of luxury goods touching record highs. This certainly has made luxury brands optimistic about the China market and expansion plans are afoot for quite a few big names. Moreover, millennials have emerged as the biggest spenders and are expected to impact sales this year too. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

149,TPR,"Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report), which was formerly known as Coach, Inc., is expected to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 7. In the trailing four quarters, this designer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts as well as house of lifestyle brands, has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.9%. In the preceding quarter, the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 2%.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Tapestry surpasses earnings estimate in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Let’s delve deep and find out the factors impacting the results.How are Estimates Shaping Up?After registering an increase of 11% in the bottom line, Tapestry is likely to witness a year-over-year decline in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 36 cents compared with 45 cents posted in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days.Meanwhile, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues of $1,302 million up from $1,038 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase in the top line may come as a big relief for investors, as the company’s net sales have declined 1.8% and 4% in the fourth and third quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively.Factors at Play Sluggish mall traffic, increased online competition and aggressive pricing strategy are headwinds plaguing the industry, and Tapestry is not immune to it. These along with Kate Spade integration-related costs are likely to hurt the margins and consequently the bottom line.Nevertheless, Tapestry looks much more disciplined in its approach to adapt to the changing retail landscape. The company is undergoing a brand transformation and introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets. The acquisitions of Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade are being viewed as a significant step in efforts toward becoming a multi-brand company. Moreover, management has undertaken transformation initiatives revolving around product, stores and marketing, which are likely to have a favorable impact in the quarter to be reported.Tapestry also registered positive comps at its North American segment for the fifth consecutive quarter and sees growth prospects in China, Japan and Europe.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Tapestry is likely to beat estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Tapestry carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.65%. This makes us reasonably confident that bottom line is likely to outperform the estimate.Other Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.58% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.76% and a Zacks Rank #2.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

150,TPR,"Coach, Inc. (COH) has the wind at its back as sales and earnings continue to surge in this post-recession environment. 
"
151,TPR,"Growth rates and estimates are rising following the latest earnings surprise, keeping valuations at relatively attractive levels for this Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy). 
"
152,TPR,"Company Description
"
153,TPR,"Coach makes signature leather handbags and accessories for men and women. The company's price points are on the higher end of the spectrum, but not as high as brands like Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Marc Jacobs.
"
154,TPR,"Beat the Street
"
155,TPR,"Coach reported quarterly results on Oct 26 that included earnings per share of 63 cents, 8 cents higher than expected. This was the fifth consecutive earnings surprise. 
"
156,TPR,"Once again, the company reported ""double-digit"" growth in China. That is in quotes because they never give the actual number. I do like that strategy, because it transparent, but smoothes the volatility and focuses on the fact that China is going very well. 
"
157,TPR,"In any event, net sales came in at $912, up 20%, pushing operating income 28% higher, to $286 million. The CEO said the ""wind was once again at [Coach's] back."" Not too many retailers are feeling that way, so this a great sign. 
"
158,TPR,"Bullish Estimates
"
159,TPR,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year was already up a dime into the report and picked up another 8 cents after and is now $2.83. Next year's forecasts are averaging $3.21, up 26 cents in that time period. 
"
160,TPR,"If Coach can hit these targets, year over year growth will be 22% in fiscal 2011 and another 13% in fiscal 2012. 
"
161,TPR,"Valuations
"
162,TPR,"Like Coach's products, you will be paying a slight premium but shoppers and investors are both saying it is worth it. Shares are trading at just under 18 times this year estimates and around 15.5 times fiscal 2012 forecasts. The PEG ratio is 1.17, not a bargain but the growth is fairly priced. 
"
163,TPR,"The Chart
"
164,TPR,"As you would expect from a luxury retailer, the earnings estimates have formed a nice v-shape thanks to the recession. However, look at the estimates last time COH was trading at this level. In fact, the P/E is a discount compared to pre-recession levels.

"
166,TPR,"Don't look now, but just as summer fades away, the prime-time holiday shopping season is about to take flight. It kicks off with Halloween, gains momentum over Thanksgiving and then closes with a big bang on Christmas and New Years. 
"
167,TPR,"The importance of holiday spending for the retailers cannot be overstated, with many running at a loss for most of the year before ""Black Friday"" moves them into the right side of the ledger.
"
168,TPR,"So even though the economy is still a bit fragile and consumers lack the confidence and firepower of years past, there will most definitely still be plenty of spending. It just might look a little bit different this time around, with two segments of the market looking very well positioned to score big gains.
"
169,TPR,"Wealthy Consumers are Back
"
170,TPR,"The first would be high-end retailers that cater to the affluent. Selling to the wealthy is usually a good business when the stock market is strong, and that's exactly what we have seen over the last 18 months as the economy has emerged from a near-death experience. And we are already beginning to see that trend show up on the Street, with some very strong same-store sales numbers hitting the wire over the last few days.
"
171,TPR,"Value-Driven Consumers are on the Prowl Too
"
172,TPR,"The other group that stands to gain are the discount retailers, which cater to the vast majority of Americans that still feel a bit uneasy about the direction of the economy. This group has posted big gains since the recessionary environment of 2008 and 2009 as bargain-hungry consumers snap up great deals and search for value.
"
173,TPR,"Here is a list of two high-end retailers and two value-driven retailers with high Zacks ranks that look well positioned to rack up some solid gains over the holidays.
"
174,TPR,"2 High-End RetailersLululemon Athletica, Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) has been on fire over the last few years, recently hitting a new all-time high at $48.45 after reporting a solid Q3 earnings surprise of 25%. Estimates for this high-end yoga apparel retailer have since jumped higher, with the current year up 8 cents to $1.23. With a bullish growth projection of 20%, this Zacks #2 rank stock looks like a winner. Take a look below.
"
175,TPR,"Coach, Inc. (COH) has also been an all-star performer over the last year, recently hitting a new multi-year high of its own on a 14% Q3 earnings surprise, where the high-end fashion retailer has an average earnings surprise of 10% over the last four quarters. With a bullish growth projection of 13% and reasonable valuation, this Zacks #1 rank stock could be a holiday winner. Take a look below.
"
176,TPR,"2 Value-Driven RetailersFamily Dollar Stores (FDO) is one of those silver-bullet companies that actually benefited from the weak consumer environment, recently hitting a new all-time high as value-hungry consumers flock through its doors for cheap goods. This Zacks #1 rank stock has an average earnings surprise of 5% over the last four quarters and a bullish 14% growth projection. Take a look below.
"
177,TPR,"TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) is a discount retailer that I'm sure many are familiar with, scooping up big gains over the last year on delivering serious value to its loyal customers. This Zacks #2 rank stock offers great value and a bullish next-year estimate calling for 10% growth. Take a look below.
"
178,TPR,"Michael Vodicka is the Momentum Stock Strategist for Zacks.com. He is also the Editor in charge of the new Zacks Momentum Trader Service. 
"
179,TPR,"Stock fell again on relatively little news. For the most part, todays losses were a reaction to an analyst downgrade on Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), which served as reminder that the economy is not out of the woods yet.
"
180,TPR,"However, it cannot be overlooked that in some ways the market was poised to start dropping after several months of climbing to 1-year highs, and oil surpassing the $82 level during intraday trading on a falling dollar.            
"
181,TPR,"Crude ended up settling at $81.37 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a dip of $2.25.
"
182,TPR,"The Dow gave up 92.12 points, or 0.9%, closing at 9,949.36. This makes 3 down days out of the last 4 for the blue chip index. 
"
183,TPR,"The S&P 500 lost 9.66 points, or 0.9%, ending the session at 1,081.40. The Nasdaq slipped by 12.74 points, or 0.6%, to 2,150.73.
"
184,TPR,"The Fed released its Beige Book today. Get the whole story by reading the analyst blog titled Beige Book Improves Again.Focus List UpdatesFreeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter earnings of $2.07 per share. The result topped the year-prior $1.31 and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14. The stock climbed 1.4% for the day, resulting in a gain of 18% since being added to the portfolio just a little over a month ago. Well keep holding here, anticipating more advances. 
"
185,TPR,"The company also announced that it reinstated an annual cash dividend of 60 cents per share. Management said reinstating the dividend is a reflection of improved global market conditions and FCXs strong operating performance.     
"
186,TPR,"Fuel Systems (FSYS) posted a nearly 4% gain on rising energy prices. The alternative energy company saw crude settle at $81.37 per barrel on the NYMEX. While this was mainly due to a sliding dollar, the company will still benefit from higher energy prices. 
"
187,TPR,"Ambev (ABV) has posted excellent gains over the past few weeks. Estimates are dipping slightly, but growth rates remain strong. We are keeping an eye on this one. 
"
188,TPR,"Visa, Inc. (V  -  Free Report) also beat the market, adding .14% on the day on the heels of some better than expected results out of the financial sector. The company is moving into a critical time of the year as consumers get ready to pull out the plastic for holiday driven transactions. Visa is set to report its third-quarter results next Wed, the 27th.
"
189,TPR,"A Focus List DeletionSkyworks Solutions (SWKS  -  Free Report) was removed from the Focus List at the close of trading. Estimates for 2010 are being cut and the most recent forecasts are coming in below the Zacks Consensus Estimates. The cuts have not been drastic but shares are down sharply over the past few weeks while the rest of the industry is doing well, so we are going to book any remaining profit.
"
190,TPR,"Growth and Income UpdatesBuckeye Partners Ltd. (BPL  -  Free Report) bucked the market and finished with a respectable .47% gain on the heels of a surge in crude. Crude broke through a short-term level of resistance above $75 earlier this week and has followed through with that momentum, topping off above $82 today. 
"
191,TPR,"Lubrizol (LZ) preannounced third quarter earnings results after the bell of $2.46 per share. Excluding a restructuring and impairment charge of 6 cents, the company expects $2.52 per share. This blows by the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89 per share. Lubrizol doesn't report earnings until Oct 29 so expect analysts to raise estimates to be in line with the preliminary earnings announcement.
"
192,TPR,"This is the second quarter in a row that Lubrizol has preannounced far better than expected earnings results. The stock is a Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy.)A Growth and Income AdditionCoach Inc. (COH) will be added to the Growth & Income portfolio at the close today, Oct 21. The company is a specialty retailer of accessories and gifts including handbags, belts and watches. Coach reported fiscal first quarter results on Oct 20 that surprised on the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.82%. Earnings per share were 44 cents compared to estimates of 39 cents. Sales rose 1% to $761 million from $753 million in the year ago period. Same store North American sales declined 1% but direct-to-consumer sales, which included China, rose 10%. Coach is trading with a forward P/E of 17.1. The company is a Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stock.
"
193,TPR,"Stocks closed near even levels as consumer confidence data and earnings reports signaled that the economy is not out of the woods yet. 
"
194,TPR,"The Conference Boards Consumer Confidence index declined in July, falling to 46.6 down from 49.3 in June. For more in depth information on todays consumer confidence data, read the Analyst Blog titled, Consumer Confidence Down.
"
195,TPR,"Disappointing results from Office Depot (ODP  -  Free Report) and Coach (COH) is a sign that consumer spending is tepid. What the consumer does going forward is crucial. Companies need revenues for a recovery to place. While many companies have been posting profits because of cost cutting, such a trend can only work so long, and eventually real revenue will need to flow in.  
"
196,TPR,"Upbeat data on home price helped keep wider losses at bay in todays market. A 20-city index that was released today showed the value of U.S. homes increasing in May for the first time in nearly three years. The result was a month-over-month increase of 0.5%.
"
197,TPR,"Tuesdays Dow gave up 11.79 points, or 0.1%, closing at 9,096.72. The S&P 500 slipped by 2.56 points, or 0.3%, to 979.62. The Nasdaq advanced by 7.62 points, or 0.4%, to 1,975.51.

201,TPR,"One of the best pieces of advice I’ve ever gotten is the simple motto, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” It helps me resist meddling in things that may just get worse with my intervention. But sometimes, it is broke. And when it is broke, you better get in there and do everything you can to fix it. Fix it once, and fix it right.In case you missed it, Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) “is broke.” I don’t mean they are out of money or are going out of business, but they are broken. They have an identity crisis and are in need of direction. A true change in direction that cannot be fixed with corporate buzz words from MBAs like “innovation” or “optimization.” I’m talking a true change in focus and realignment of their goals.I understand that’s heavy talk from a guy hiding behind a keyboard. How dare I?! Who do I think I am?! Look buddy, this isn’t my opinion. You know how I know KORS is broken? The market told me, that’s how. Here’s a chart of how the market feels about your company…Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price and Consensus Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price and Consensus | Michael Kors Holdings Limited QuoteThe time for being defensive and sensitive about what’s going on is over. Don’t be a flat-Earther on this one, it’s Judgment Day. The identity crisis at KORS is simple. KORS tells the world it wants to be a luxury brand then turns around and makes business decisions like a Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report). Luxury brands are exclusive and rarely discounted. Somewhere along the line, someone at KORS thought it was a good idea to put a Michael Kors in every mall in America and have sales all the time. That’s fine if you admit what you are, not fine if you’re pretending to be a luxury brand.Not Luxury Brand BehaviorLuxury brands don’t have “25% the whole store” signs in front for every holiday. They also don’t find their goods on the sale rack at TJ Maxx (TJX  -  Free Report). Have you ever bought a Gucci belt at Marshalls? I don’t think so.You can put the slogan “The Champagne of Beers” on Miller High Life but you’re not fooling anybody. It’s not Champagne, it’s cheap beer. What’s happened at KORS is they are either the nicest brand in a cheap mall or they are the cheapest brand in a nice mall. That’s not luxury and it’s not a smart niche.Including licensed locations, there are 960 Michael Kors stores worldwide. Rather than putting KORS into the luxury space, they channeled their energy into stealing sales from department stores which were carrying their brand. A temporary shell game which ultimately caused immeasurable harm to the brand image. Trading wholesale sales for retail sales in malls KORS stores had no business being in the first place.KORS opened 159 net new stores in Q12017 and only increased retail sales by 50 bps. Comp sales were off 13.6%. Wholesale net sales were off 22.8%. So essentially what’s been happening is KORS is increasing retail sales by stealing wholesale sales from department stores in dying malls. That was a myopic strategy with no hope of long-term sustainability.The painful part of the story for KORS is that the aforementioned strategy of cutting in on wholesale sales with retail locations was a trap laid by Coach COH during its turnaround. When Victor Luis took the reins in January 2014 at Coach his plan was to close stores in smaller markets, focusing on getting better spots in department stores and high-touch flagship stores in 12 major US markets where it got half its sales. KORS seized the opportunity to cut in on Coach’s market share in the markets Coach left. By doing so, KORS brand image was watered down and they inherited the problems Coach skillfully disposed of. Coach 1, KORS zero.Coach's Rope-A-DopeThree years ago COH tricked KORS into entering these losing markets. Now KORS announced they are closing 100-125 stores. They are likely to make the business decisions to close the worst performing stores. On paper that makes sense, cut off the bleeding from the stores doing bad. However, the problem here is their worst performing stores are the ones in the luxury locations. Again, cheapest stores in the nicest malls. If they make this move, they are chopping off the highest end of their brand, and pushing themselves further away from the luxury brand they say they want to be. By doing this, KORS would thrust the brand deeper into the retail death spiral rather than differentiating itself as a luxury brand. Again, in the short-term this may work to calm shareholder angst but it is detrimental to brand.Meanwhile, at Coach…Coach, Inc. Price and Consensus Coach, Inc. Price and Consensus | Coach, Inc. QuoteEarnings troughed in late 2015, about a year after Luis implemented their turnaround strategy. Here we are about 18 months after earnings bottomed out. Since then, the stock has gone from $28 to $46. Current year EPS growth is on track for 8.55% while next year growth looks to be 11.7%. In case you were wondering, KORS is pacing a 16.39% contraction in earnings while next year the hopes are for 3% growth.Admit What You AreWhat should KORS do? First, choose an identity. Stop saying you are a luxury brand unless you are going to act like one. It’s fine to not be mentioned in the same breath as Louis Vuitton and Gucci, just stop pretending like you want to be. The only thing about KORS that says luxury right now is the corporate profile. Align your strategy with your profile or change your profile.When you realize that KORS is essentially watering down their brand image in order to gain market share in a shrinking market their main competitor left three-and-a-half years ago for greener pastures, it doesn’t make you want to invest in the company. At a trailing P/E 7.55 this is the value trap of the decade right here. What’s the key to this turnaround story right now? “Detailing and customization of merchandise.” Didn’t Lids do that in the late 90s?We’re going to find out more about KORS new turnaround initiative during its June 9th analyst day. Management is already viewing FY2018 as a transition period. They are going to formalize their game plan for production, distribution and marketing using the “Runway 2020” moniker. Let’s hope “Runway 2020” doesn’t really mean “Runaway Now!”<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like Run Did you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

208,TPR,"The gross margin expanded to a remarkable 74.2%, up from 72.3% a year ago. The operating margin was also outstanding, at 31.3%.
"
209,TPR,"Outlook
"
210,TPR,"Estimates revisions have begun trickling in, and so far they have all been higher. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2011 calls for earnings of $2.67 per share, representing a 15% increase of the 2010 EPS. The 2012 estimate is at $2.98, or 12% higher than 2011.
"
211,TPR,"Estimates have been trending higher for some time now as the economic recovery gains traction. This can be seen in the company's Price & Consensus Chart:
"
212,TPR,"Returning Value to Shareholders
"
213,TPR,"Coach produces very strong cash flow and carries very little debt, and has used this cash to return value to its shareholders. For instance, the company repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares in the quarter for a total of $137 million.
"
214,TPR,"Coach also began paying a dividend in 2009. It doubled it in the second quarter this year and currently yields 1.3%.
"
215,TPR,"Valuation
"
216,TPR,"Despite a nice run up in the share price recently, shares remain reasonably priced. The stock trades at 18.7x forward earnings, a premium to the industry average of 14.0x. Its PEG ratio is sensible, though, at 1.3.
"
217,TPR,"The company's high margins and excellent profitability justify higher multiples on a price to book and price to sales basis. For instance, Coach's return on investment of 42.2% trumps the industry average of 14.5%. Its net margin of 31.9% also crushes its peers, who average just 6.8%.
"
218,TPR,"About Coach
"
219,TPR,"Coach is headquartered in New York City and was founded in 1941. It has a market cap of $14.7 billion.
"
220,TPR,"The stock is up 50% since its addition to the Focus List on Oct 21, 2009. It is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock.
"
221,TPR,"The Retail sector is the only one where a significant number of Q2 earnings reports are still awaited at this stage; the reporting cycle has effectively come to an end for most of the other sectors, particularly in the large-cap S&P 500 index (plenty of small-cap reports are still to come).Almost 87% of the S&P 500 members have already reported Q2 results, though results from half of the retailers in the index are still to come. We have more than 525 companies coming out with quarterly results this week, including 26 S&P 500 members that consist of major retailers like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report). Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) and Coach (COH) are some of the other notable companies reporting results this week.    We have already seen Q2 results from exactly half of the Retail sector members in the S&P 500 index. These retailers that have reported already are mostly online vendors like Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) or restaurant operators like McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report). We will start seeing results from the traditional department store operators this week while the big-box discounters will report the following and beyond.The blockbuster Amazon report aside, retail results thus far have been disappointing, with growth tracking below historical periods and very few companies able to come out with positive earnings and revenue surprises. We will see if the traditional retailers can turn around this thus far weak Q2 earnings picture in the coming days, but past history is not very reassuring on that count.  The Retail ScorecardAs of Friday August 5th, we have seen Q2 results from 22 retailers in the S&P 500 index (out of the 44 total) that combined account for 58.1% of the sector’s total market cap in the index. Total earnings for these 22 retails are up +8.1% from the same period last year, on +8.7% higher revenues, with relatively low 45.5% beating EPS estimates and a very low 18.2% coming ahead of top-line expectations.The side-by-side charts below compare the growth rates and beat ratios thus far with what we have seen from the same group of 22 retailers in other recent periods.The growth comparisons (left hand chart) don’t stand out – Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates are about in-line with 4- and 12-quarter averages. But the right hand chart, which is tracking the proportion of Retail sector stocks coming out with positive EPS and revenue surprises, shows that Q2 is notably weaker relative to the recent past.The fact is that the 45.5% EPS beat % for the Retail sector is the second lowest for the entire S&P 500 index, behind only the Construction sector. The revenue beat % of 18.2% for the sector is the lowest of all 16 sectors at this stage.With respect to the growth picture, which appears to be in-line with the recent past, we have to dig a bit deeper to adjust the sector’s growth picture for Amazon’s blockbuster Q2 earnings report. This becomes clear by looking at the left hand chart above, with and without the Amazon numbers. The right-hand chart above, showing the sector’s growth comparison on an ex-Amazon basis, clearly shows that Q2 is tracking way below what we have been seeing from these same retailers in the recent past.The Q2 Earnings Scorecard (as of August 5th)We now have Q2 results from 433 S&P 500 members that combined account for 87.7% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these 433 companies are down -4.1% from the same period last year on -0.9% lower revenues, with 70.7% beating EPS estimates and 52.7% coming ahead of top-line expectations.The table below provides the current scorecardThe first column of the above table shows what percentage of each sector’s total members have reported results; the second column shows what percentage of that sector’s total market cap has reported results. As you can see, the reporting cycle has ended for five sectors already. The Retail sector is the only one that has exactly half of its results still awaited.The side-by-side charts below compare the results thus far from the 433 index members with what we have seen from the same group of index members in other recent periods. The left-hand chart compares the earnings and revenue growth rates with historical periods while the right-hand chart is doing the same comparisons for positive EPS and revenue surprises.Here are the takeaways from these comparison charts are:First, the earnings growth (green bars in the left-side chart above) remains negative, but it is an improvement over what we saw in the preceding quarter and the average growth pace for these 433 index in the preceding four quarters.Second, revenue growth (orange bars in the left-side chart) is also negative, but is tracking above what we saw from this group of 433 S&P 500 members in 2016 Q1 and the 4-quarter average.Third, positive EPS surprises (green bars in the right-side chart) for this group of companies are about in-line with historical periods, suggesting that estimates may not have been that low after all.Fourth, positive revenue surprises are about as numerous as was the case in the preceding quarter and the 4-quarter average, but remain below the 12-quarter average.Standout SectorsResults in the Technology and Medical sectors have been notably better than expected. Autos, Industrial Products, Aerospace and Finance are some of the other sectors whose results came in better than expected. Growth is notably strong in the Construction sector, but the proportion of sector companies beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking below the index’s level.For the Technology sector, we now have results from 88.1% of the sector’s total market cap in the index. Total earnings for these Tech companies are down -0.8% from the same period last year on +2.4% higher revenues, with 83% beating EPS estimates and 74.5% beating revenue expectations.The comparison charts below compare the sector’s results thus far with what these same Tech companies had reported in other recent periods.This is better growth performance than we have seen from the same group of Tech companies in the preceding quarter. With respect to positive surprises, they are tracking above historical periods for both earnings and revenue beats, as the comparison charts above show. No doubt market participants are so excited for the results from Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and even Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report).The table below shows the sector’s scorecard at the medium industry level. As you can see, all of the sector’s growth is coming from the Software/Services industry where Alphabet had +44.3% earnings growth on +22.1% higher revenues while Facebook had +158% growth in earnings on 59.2% higher revenues. The weak growth picture for the hardware industry (Computer – office Equipment) is due to Apple and IBM, with Apple’s earnings down -27% on -14.6% lower revenues.Expectations for the Quarter As a WholeLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results from 433 index members with estimates for the still-to-come 67 companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be down -3.5% on -0.4% lower revenues, with growth in negative territory for 6 of the 16 Zacks sectors. The Q2 growth pace has ‘improved’ as companies have come out with improved results, but the quarter is still on track to be in the negative for the 5th quarter in a row.As has been the pattern in other recent periods, the Energy sector remains the biggest drag on the aggregate growth picture, with total earnings for the sector expected to be down -78.9% on -26% lower revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, earnings for the rest of the index would be flat 0.0%.The table below shows the summary picture for Q2 contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding period.While Energy stands out for its very tough comparisons, there is not much positive growth coming from the other major sectors either. The Finance and Technology sectors, the two biggest earnings contributors in the S&P 500 index, are not helping the aggregate growth picture either.For the Finance sector, total Q2 earnings are expected to be down -5.3% on -0.4% lower revenues, which will follow -6.9% decline in the sector’s earnings in the preceding quarter.The Technology sector, total earnings are expected to be up +0.2% on +2.7% higher revenues, which would follow the sector’s -4.5% earnings decline on +0.4% higher revenues in Q1. The big culprit for the Tech sector’s weak showing this quarter (as well as last one) is Apple (AAPL), whose June quarter earnings were down -27% on -14.6% lower revenues from the same period last year. Excluding Apple, the Tech sector’s Q2 earnings would be up +7.0% (Apple alone brings in roughly a fifth of the Tech sector’s total earnings).On the positive side, Q2 earnings are expected be up at Autos (+16.3%), Construction (+7.3%), Conglomerates (+20.6%), and Utilities (+8.0%).Expectations Beyond Q2The chart below shows current quarterly earnings growth expectations for the index in 2016 Q2 and the following four quarters contrasted with actual declines in the preceding four quarters. As you can see, Q2 is on track to be the 5th quarter in row of earnings declines and estimates of Q3 growth starting to go deeper into negative territory as well.The only meaningful positive earnings growth this year is expected to come from the last quarter of the year, which is then expected to continue into 2017 when earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up in double-digits. We will see if those estimates will hold up as we reach the last quarter of the year. But given what we have seen over the last few quarters, the odds don’t look that favorable.Note: Sheraz Mian regularly provides earnings analysis on Zacks.com and appears frequently in the print and electronic media.

222,TPR,"Tumi Holdings Inc. (TUMI) is struggling to differentiate itself in a field crowded with luxury bags. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) recently lowered its full year guidance.
"
223,TPR,"Tumi sells travel, business and lifestyle products and accessories including brief cases, tote bags and luggage in 300 stores across the world. It also sells in department stores and specialty and travel retail stores in 75 countries.
"
224,TPR,"As of March 29, 2015, Tumi operated 155 company-owned stores.Comparable Store Sales Declined in Q1
"
225,TPR,"On May 6, Tumi announced its first quarter results and met the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents.
"
226,TPR,"Net sales rose 1.7% to $110.5 million from $108.6 million a year ago. On a constant currency, net sales jumped 4.6%.
"
227,TPR,"However, total comparable store sales for all Direct-to-Consumer channels, including the company's website, fell 4.6% compared to a year ago.
"
228,TPR,"It wasn't much better if you just single out North America. Direct-to-Consumer North America comparable store sales fell 5.3% while outlet sales were a little bit better, rising 1.1%.
"
229,TPR,"E-commerce sales, however, declined 14.1%.
"
230,TPR,"Gross margin increased 3.5% to $65.3 million from $63.1 million.Lowered Full Year Outlook
"
231,TPR,"The company continued to see a high level of third party promotions in both department stores and online in the first quarter which hurt the brand and the bottom line.
"
232,TPR,"Tumi is taking steps to lessen its involvement in these promotions which it thinks will strengthen the brand long term.
"
233,TPR,"Given the competitive retail environment and the weak dollar, it revised its guidance down for 2015. 
"
234,TPR,"It now expects earnings between $0.90 and $0.95, down from its February 2015 guidance of $0.93- $0.98. 
"
235,TPR,"Tumi also lowered its comparable store outlook to the low-to mid single digits, down from the mid-single digits it saw in February. Shares on a Roller Coaster
"
236,TPR,"Shares have been up and down all year long and are recently off the latest lows.
"
237,TPR,"But even with the sell off, shares aren't exactly cheap. Tumi still trades with a forward P/E of 23.
"
238,TPR,"Earnings are expected to grow just 8.5% this year so investors are paying a high price for single digit growth.
"
239,TPR,"If you're interested in investing in the luggage/handbag space, you may want to consider Coach (COH) instead. While it has its own problems, it has a better valuation with a forward P/E of 18. It's a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Want More of Our Best Recommendations?

"
241,TPR,"Luxury is back, baby!
"
242,TPR,"Coach, the maker of leather handbags and accessories, reported fiscal first quarter earnings on Oct 26 and did not disappoint as it easily surprised on the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents per share. 
"
243,TPR,"Earnings per share were 63 cents compared to the consensus of 55 cents. This was also much better than the 44 cents made in the year ago quarter, which is an indication of how much the luxury market is turning around.
"
244,TPR,"In the previous few quarters, international sales had been the driving force behind the company's growth. But in this quarter, even North American sales stepped it up a notch. Sales in North America rose 8.5%. In Japan they were up 3%. But most of the story is in China.Rapid Growth Continues in China
"
245,TPR,"Coach never reveals exactly how big the sales growth is in China, simply calling it ""double digit"" (does that mean 11% or 99%? We aren't supposed to know.) No analysts asked on the company's conference call either. The company uses this same language every quarter.
"
246,TPR,"A few years ago, China was a small percentage of Coach's business. But another 8 locations were opened during the first quarter bringing the total to 49. And that rapid rate of store openings is expected to continue. So why doesn't Coach just tell us exactly what sales are doing in China? All we know is, is that it's good. How ""good"" is it?
"
247,TPR,"Overall, sales rose 20% to $912 million compared with $761 million a year ago.
"
248,TPR,"Both of its divisions saw double digit sales gains. The larger direct-to-consumer, which is its own retail stores, rose 19% to $775 million. Indirect sales, which are U.S. department store sales and international wholesale, gained 27% to $136 million from $108 million last year.
"
249,TPR,"Given the level of demand for shipments to the U.S. department stores (that would be Macys and Nordstroms, both which carry the line), that bodes well for the upcoming holiday season as those stores ordered in the first quarter for the holidays.Shares Spiked On the Earnings Beat
"
250,TPR,"Investors felt it was an excellent earnings report and bid up the stock by nearly 12% on the day of the earnings to new 2-year highs.
"
251,TPR,"You can see the earnings spike in the chart below.A Little Pricey on Valuation?
"
252,TPR,"Coach is now trading at 18.6x forward estimates. That is pricier than the S&P 500 at 14.9x and its peers at 14.3. Price-to-sales are at 3.9 compared to its peers at 1.3.
"
253,TPR,"It does have an amazing 1-year return on equity (ROE) of 42.8% which blows away its peers at 17.9%.Waiting on Estimate Revisions
"
254,TPR,"Coach never gives earnings guidance so the analysts have to make due on their own.
"
255,TPR,"Given that the company just reported, we're still waiting to see the estimate revisions. So far, 2 estimates out of 17 have moved higher for fiscal 2011 in the last week, pushing the Zacks Consensus up 2 cents to $2.67 per share. That is earnings growth of 14.5%.
"
256,TPR,"You can see the nice price-to-consensus chart below.
"
257,TPR,"Coach is a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stock. It's been one of the big winners in the Growth & Income portfolio. We are up 50% on the stock since we added it just about 1 year ago, on Oct 21, 2009. Tracey Ryniec is the Value Stock Strategist for Zacks.com. She is also the Editor in charge of the market-beating Zacks Value Trader service. You can follow her at twitter.com/traceyryniec.
"
258,TPR,"The desire for handbags and other fine accessories knows no borders, as Coach, Inc. (COH) proved in its fiscal fourth quarter performance. The increased globalization of its brand is a big part of the company's plan for the future, and it appears to be rather fertile ground with economic activity slowly but surely picking up.  
"
259,TPR,"Coach reached a number of milestones in its fiscal 2010, which ended in June. There was perhaps no bigger accomplishment, though, than its ability to surpass earnings estimates in each quarter. If you average these 4 consecutive beats, the company amassed an average surprise of practically 10%.  
"
260,TPR,"Earnings estimates have been unchanged for the past 30 days, but are up since the Aug 3 quarterly announcement. As a result, Coach is retaining a very respectable Zacks #2 Rank ('buy').  
"
261,TPR,"However, on a longer-term perspective, we're sticking with a ""Neutral"" recommendation for now. While the environment is improving, the situation remains less than vibrant and still rather volatile. We are concerned about increasing competition and shaky consumer spending patterns.  
"
262,TPR,"But we shouldn't forget that Coach's long-term plan of global expansion, especially into under-penetrated markets, is a good one. Plus, the company is positioned to drive future growth with its healthy balance sheet, significant cash balance and negligible debt load.   
"
263,TPR,"Coach is a leading American marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men, including handbags, women's and men's small leathergoods, business cases, weekend and travel accessories, footwear, watches, outerwear, scarves, sunwear, jewelry, fragrance and related accessories. Earnings Estimates for Coach  
"
264,TPR,"Coach ended fiscal 2010 on a high note. The company announced earnings per share of 64 cents in its fiscal fourth quarter, which easily exceeded the year-ago result while also beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 14.3%.  
"
265,TPR,"Revenue jumped 22% year over year to $950.5 million from $778 million. (It should be noted that this quarter benefited from an extra week compared to last year, but would still have at least matched the consensus without it.)  
"
266,TPR,"For a lot more on that quarterly report, read Coach Outperforms.  
"
267,TPR,"As for the full fiscal year, EPS was up 22% to $2.33 per share while net sales advanced 12% to $3.61 billion.  
"
268,TPR,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year, ending June 2011, is $2.65 per share at the moment, marking a gain of 4.7% over the past 2 months. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for next fiscal year, ending June 2012, is $2.95, or 11.3% better that the outlook for fiscal 2011. This guidance has increased by 4.6% from 60 days ago.   
"
269,TPR,"Of course all this activity came shortly after the fiscal fourth quarter report. Since that time, the 17 estimates for this fiscal year and 14 estimates for next fiscal year have been unchanged; no revisions to the upside or to the downside in the past 30 days. China 
"
270,TPR,"Coach is looking at any country or region that will appreciate fine accessories, and its biggest opportunity is clearly China. Fiscal 2010 marked the first full year of direct operation of its stores in China. For the future, the company will continue developing its multi-channel distribution model over there, with plans to open 30 new locations this year.  
"
271,TPR,"The company got some good data out of China over the weekend when a report showed a 13.9% gain year over year in August industrial production and an 18.4% advance in retail sales. This comes after months of weakness.  
"
272,TPR,"Meanwhile, China isn't the only country that Coach has plans for. The company is also entering Europe, beginning with encouraging results in France and moving to store openings in the U.K., Portugal and Spain. Here, too, Coach has enjoyed some good data as the EU recently raised its forecast for economic growth.   
"
273,TPR,"Finally, in addition to its geographic focus, the company is also looking to expand its presence among men. According to the company, this opportunity will be a significant contributor in the year ahead, and has already shown some strong results. The company has begun opening their first standalone men's stores.
"
274,TPR,"Coach Inc. (COH) is making a big move into China as its U.S. and Japanese operations face more difficult growth trends. COH saw double digit revenue growth in its Chinese retail stores in the fiscal fourth quarter.
"
275,TPR,"Coach is a specialty retailer which used to be known for its solid leather handbags but has since expanded into other accessories, including footwear, watches, outerwear, scarves, sunwear, jewelry, and fragrances. 
"
276,TPR,"Coach operates its own retail stores as well as distributes through certain department and specialty stores as well as its own web site.Sales Jumped 22% in the Fiscal Fourth Quarter
"
277,TPR,"Coach reported its fiscal fourth quarter results on Aug 3 and beat the Zacks Consensus by 14.3%. Earnings per share were 64 cents compared to the consensus of 56 cents.
"
278,TPR,"Sales continued to be hot, jumping 22% to $951 million from $778 million a year ago. The death of the consumer has been greatly exaggerated. 
"
279,TPR,"North American same store sales climbed 6.3% and Japan rose 6%. 
"
280,TPR,"But China is where the big growth story is. China saw same store sales rise at a double digit rate (the company didn't break out exactly what that rate was). 
"
281,TPR,"The company also recently opened up its first flagship store in China in Shanghai. It has 41 locations in the country and expects to open 30 new locations this year alone.
"
282,TPR,"The company also opened its first stand-alone Men's store in Japan in the quarter and now has two locations there.Growth Expected to Continue
"
283,TPR,"Coach never gives guidance but the analysts like what they heard out of the fiscal fourth quarter.
"
284,TPR,"Estimates are up for the full year ending in July 2011 by 11 cents to $2.65 in the last month as 15 out of 17 estimates moved higher in that period.
"
285,TPR,"Analysts now expect earnings growth of 13.6%.
"
286,TPR,"Similarly, the bullish story is expected to continue into the next fiscal year, with another 11.4% earnings growth forecast.Income
"
287,TPR,"Coach pays a dividend with a current yield of 1.6%. Not many of its peers pay a dividend so it's a nice reward for shareholders.
"
288,TPR,"Coach is a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stock.Tracey Ryniec is the Value Stock Strategist for Zacks.com. She is also the Editor in charge of the market-beating Zacks Value Trader service. You can follow her at twitter.com/traceyryniec.
"
289,TPR,"With results from 380 S&P 500 companies that combined account for roughly 82% of the index’s total market capitalization already out, the Q2 earnings season is winding down for the large-cap stocks. This is the last major reporting week of this earnings season, with 65 S&P 500 members reporting results.
"
290,TPR,"But plenty of reports are still to come, particularly from small-companies. Using the S&P 600 as the proxy for the small-cap space, we have seen results from 362 of the index’s total members or 60.3% of its total membership. While only two sectors for the large-cap index have roughly half of their companies in the still-to-report category (Retail & Consumer Discretionary), we have four sectors in that category in the S&P 600 (Retail, Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Oil/Energy).  
"
291,TPR,"Any way you look at it, the 2014 Q2 earnings season has been very positive - the growth rates are better, more companies are coming ahead of estimates, and there is even some modest improvement on the guidance front.
"
292,TPR,"Guidance still remains weak, with most companies providing guidance guiding lower. But the proportion of companies guiding lower is smaller than what we have been seeing in recent quarters. And even those that don’t offer guidance have been qualitatively talking up their business outlook.  The Q2 Scorecard (as of Friday morning, August 1st)
"
293,TPR,"Total earnings for the 380 S&P 500 members that have reported already are up +9.3% from the same period last year, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 66.8% and a median surprise of +2.5%. Total revenues are up +4.8%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 56.1% and a median surprise of 0.8%.
"
294,TPR,"The table below shows the summary scorecard
"
295,TPR,"This is a better performance than what we have seen from this same group of 380 companies reported in recent quarters, as the charts below shows.The growth rate compared The beat ratios compared 
"
296,TPR,"The beat ratios, particularly on the revenue side, were tracking notably above recent historical levels earlier, though they have come down somewhat in recent days and are now more in-line with what we are used to seeing in recent quarters.
"
297,TPR,"Technology results have been the strongest that we have seen in a while, with total earnings for the sector up +14.2% on +7.3% higher revenues. The sector’s strong growth numbers notwithstanding, beat ratios remain below the aggregate for the S&P 500, implying that the growth bump was largely expected. The earnings and revenue beat ratios for Technology are tracking below the S&P 500 as well as what we had seen from the sector in other recent quarters.
"
298,TPR,"We have opposite situation in the Finance sector, where we don’t have much growth, but results still came in better than expected. With results from 87.5% of the Finance sector’s Q2 results already out, earnings are up +1.6% on +1.1% revenues. But as the charts below of ‘beat ratios’ for the sector show, results have been overwhelming surprising to the upside.What’s Happening with the Small-caps?
"
299,TPR,"Stock prices of small-cap stocks have been underwater this year, with the S&P 600 down -4.5% vs. a gain of +5.1% for the S&P 500 in the year-to-date period. This underwhelming stock price performance is getting confirmed by the group’s mixed results thus far in the Q2 reporting cycle.
"
300,TPR,"As of Friday, August 1, we have seen Q2 results from 362 S&P 600 members or 60.3% of the index’s total members. Total earnings for these 362 companies are up +16.6% from the same period last year on +9.2% higher revenues, with 51.4% beating EPS estimates and 38.1% coming ahead of top-line expectations.  
"
301,TPR,"In terms of comparison to other recent quarters, the earnings growth is better than what we have seen from the same group of 362 small-cap companies in 2014 Q1 as well as the average growth rate of the last four quarters. But the earnings beat ratio is in-line with what the same group has performed over that same period. The top-line performance presents a mixed picture, with the growth rate modestly better while the beat ratios tracking lower.
"
302,TPR,"A word about the beat ratios for the small-cap stocks may be in order. While roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500 companies beat EPS estimates on average, the ratio is a lot lower for the small-cap index, with about 50% of the S&P 600 companies beating earnings estimates.
"
303,TPR,"Here is the updated Q2 scorecard for the S&P 600 index   The Composite Picture
"
304,TPR,"The composite (or blended) growth picture for Q2, combining the actual results for the 380 S&P 500 companies that have reported with estimates for the 120 still-to-come reports, shows total earnings increasing by +7.8% on +3.7% higher revenues and modestly higher net margins. This would follow earnings growth of +1.4% in Q1 on +0.7% higher revenues. The Q2 earnings growth rate has been steadily going up, as more companies report and beat estimates.
"
305,TPR,"The table below compares what is expected for Q2 with what was actually achieved in Q1.
"
306,TPR," Record Earnings in Q2
"
307,TPR,"Total earnings in Q2 are on track to reach a new all-time quarterly record, surpassing the last record set in 2013 Q4. The chart below shows these quarterly earnings totals, with estimates for the coming quarters all in the record territory.The Sustainability Question
"
308,TPR,"As discussed in this report, the earnings results thus far represent a notable improvement over what we have become accustomed to seeing in recent quarters. But is it a one-off bounce from the low levels in Q1 or the start of something sustainable and enduring?
"
309,TPR,"The ongoing revisions trend in estimates for the current period appears to be indicating that this favorable trend can be sustained. We will see how the revisions trend unfolds through the remainder of this reporting cycle, but estimates for 2014 Q3 have held up very well thus far – better than what we have seen over comparable periods in other recent quarters.

322,TPR,"Coach Inc. (COH) was added to the Growth and Income portfolio on October 21, 2009. The stock is up almost 19% since being added to the portfolio.
"
323,TPR,"Coach's strong results are being driven by lower price points (10-15 percent lower than last year) and rapid growth in China.
"
324,TPR,"Growth and Income
"
325,TPR,"The company is expected to grow its earnings per share 9.0% in fiscal 2011, 11.4% in fiscal 2012, and 14.0% over the long term. The stock also offers investors a dividend yield of 1.6%.
"

"
330,TPR,"On August 3, Coach reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $950.5 million, an increase of 22% year-over-year. Coach earned $0.64 per share, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents, or 14.3%.
"
331,TPR,"Coach has now beaten the Zacks Consensus for three straight quarters by an average of 10.0%.
"
332,TPR,"The strength of the company's impressive business model was on display in the fourth quarter. Coach increased its gross margin 290 basis points to 73.3% from 70.4% in Q409. The company's operating margin was up 490 basis points to 31.2%, due to its gross margin gains and operating cost leverage.
"
333,TPR,"Chairman and CEO Lew Frankfort said, ""As always, we expect to continue to drive our business through a combination of productivity gains worldwide and distribution growth, primarily in new geographies. Clearly, China is our biggest opportunity, as our brand takes hold and the market continues to develop rapidly. We've started developing a multi-channel distribution model in China, including retail stores, shop-in-shops and flagships and expect to accelerate new store openings, with about 30 new locations planned this year.""
"
334,TPR,"Estimates
"
335,TPR,"It is still too early for the new analyst estimates to be included in the Zacks Consensus. However, we believe those estimates will be moving higher. The current consensus calls for 9% earnings growth in fiscal 2011, but Coach expects sales and earnings to grow at a double-digit pace. That leaves plenty of room for upside revisions.
"
336,TPR,"The Chart
"
337,TPR,"COH shares enjoyed a nice uptrend through the middle of June, climbing 50% in the previous 10 months. However, the stock suffered a sharp correction in June and July, and it even fell below its 200-day moving average. In the last few weeks, the stock appears to have bottomed around $34, bouncing almost 16% off that level. The stock has some work to do, but it has definitely taken on a more bullish tone in the last two weeks.
"
338,TPR,"Coach (COH) continues to be a must-own stock for those investors looking for exposure to the luxury goods market. The company's strong brand, earning power, and prospects for growth should enable Coach to deliver earnings growth in the mid-teens for the next several years.

355,TPR,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Tapestry is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TPR in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TPR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.15% heading into earnings season.Tapestry, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Tapestry, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Tapestry, Inc. Quote Why is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that TPR has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Tapestry, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

We've discussed the company's strong fundamentals repeatedly in the Elite Stock of the Day articles and in these commentaries since last May when we added it to the Growth & Income portfolio. Coach (COH) gained 0.73% on the session on sympathy with Tiffany (TIF  -  Free Report) which reported a strong holiday season and raised full year guidance.

"
450,TPR,"A Long Bias for KORS
"
451,TPR,"I think the KORS craze and market penetration globally is far from over. Especially when they work so hard to have so many fashion accessories at so many price points. Their ""accessible luxury"" strategy speaks to, and opens the wallets and purses of, more than the affluent. 
"
452,TPR,"I have traded KORS stock twice in the past year for my FTM portfolio, first buying last July at $63 and bagging 25%. Then we bought again in December in anticipation of a great holiday quarter. We were not disappointed as we caught the big February pop to new highs above $90 and grabbed 12% gains.
"
453,TPR,"Though I am a big fan of the Michael Kors company, its products, and its marketing strategies and global growth opportunities, I rely on the retail analysts who focus on the industry to sort out the real potential of the stock as an investment.
"
454,TPR,"What Do the Analysts See in KORS?
"
455,TPR,"What made me buy the stock again in June, besides the core growth story still being strong, is that I liked the commentary from several analysts. Here's a sampling...
"
456,TPR,"JPMorgan analysts revisited KORS in last June after British handbag retailer Mulberry reported dismal sales efforts in high-end bags. They raised estimates, even introducing their FY16 EPS number of $4.80 (we are currently in Q2 of KORS FY15 which ends next March). They also raised their PT from $100 to $104 based on 25-26X their FY15 estimate of $4.00, or 21-22X their FY16.
"
457,TPR,"Europe, Men's, and jewelry markets/categories are considered ""$1 billion opportunities"" for the company by the JPM analysts and these areas will drive growth beyond women's handbags. Though the bears here could still force a test of $86 and lower, I am confident this stock will be approaching $100 again in the next six months.
"
458,TPR,"Deutsche Bank analysts raised their price target from $105 to $110 and had this to say in response to the gross margin concerns...
"
459,TPR,"""While there are many moving parts to this increasingly complex global company, the bottom line we believe is that Kors once again delivered on both results & guidance. Though FY15 plan came in at least in-line with expectation, even so, we believe management is being conservative. Primarily, we note that plan calls for gross margin normalization, but management made it clear that hasnt happened yet (and we don't think that back-half of 1Q compares get more difficult).""
"
460,TPR,"Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy met with management recently and had many good things to say about their plans and solid execution. She reiterated her Overweight rating and $115 price target. 
"
461,TPR,"""Management was bullish not only on near-term trends but also on the multi-category opportunity for further market share gains over time. We believe Q1 comps are tracking above 20% globally. The company is investing behind e-com, product, supply chain, stores and people as sales continue to grow in the range of $1B/year. We expect operating margins in the 29% range for the next two years. Our recent European checks confirm that the brand is taking significant 'white space' that exists below high-end luxury.""
"
462,TPR,"The big take away for me was that these analysts and others are as bullish on KORS for the longer-term as I am. They see the international opportunity as still being in the early innings and they view the handbag wars (which KORS is still winning) as only one battlefield they excel on.
"
463,TPR,"The Global Opportunity
"
464,TPR,"The $75 billion accessories category of the global luxury goods markets is the fastest-growing sub-sector of apparel. And this is 85% of KORS current sales.
"
465,TPR,"Management sees the potential for 700 stores internationally, including 400 in North America (currently 288), 200 in Europe (80), and 100 in Japan (37), with potential to eventually acquire licensed Asian geographies. KORS plans to add 110 stores in F2015, including 45 in North America, 55 in Europe, and 10 in Japan.
"
466,TPR,"According to GuruFocus.com, ""KORS opened 7 stores in the Asia-Pacific region, bringing the total count to 94 stores, including a new flagship store in China. Management expects around 200 retail locations in the Asia-Pacific region. Kors also opened two stores in Brazil, expanding its presence in Latin America. The company currently has seven locations in Latin America and expects it can support 40 retail locations over the next several years.""
"
467,TPR,"To solidify their Asia strategy, the company created a new leadership position and filled it with some key talent. Stephane Lafay has been named to the newly created role of President of Asia, reporting to John D. Idol, the companys Chairman and CEO. From the company's June 30 press release...
"
468,TPR,"Mr. Lafays appointment, effective July 28th, 2014, reflects the brands powerful momentum in the region and its sustained focus on growth. ""This is a pivotal moment for the brand as we continue to invest and work to build a strategic roadmap for the Asia region,"" says Mr. Idol. ""Stephane has a long history of building luxury businesses in Asia. His skills and experience will be a tremendous asset for us going forward.""
"
469,TPR,"Mr. Lafay was most recently at Tiffany & Co., where he held the position of Senior Vice President, Asia Pacific and Japan. Lauded for his leadership and in-depth knowledge of the region, he led the brand to consistently strong results.
"
470,TPR,"""The Asian market is an important region for us to develop as we continue to grow our global luxury brand,"" says Mr. Idol. ""Were excited to take advantage of the momentum our brand has recently generated. In the past two years weve been able to double our store count to over 100 locations in the region. Stephanes experience and leadership will help enable us to capitalize on our momentum in the region.""
"
471,TPR,"""Im delighted to be joining Michael Kors at such an exciting moment in the brands development,"" says Mr. Lafay. ""Having worked in Asia for 25 years, and spent nearly two decades building brands in the region, its clear to me that there is enormous opportunity for Michael Kors there. I look forward to being part of the team that turns this potential into reality.""
"
472,TPR,"It sounds like they picked the right guy for that ""enormous opportunity.""
"
473,TPR,"Multi-Channel Excellence
"
474,TPR,"According to Baird Equity Research, ""KORS utilizes several marketing avenues to project its 'jet-set' image, including print (three 40-page catalogs per year), increasingly online/social media, fashion shows, and editorial (strong relationships with press)."" Baird analysts have a $114 price target on KORS.
"
475,TPR,"Obviously, Michael Kors the man now carries the cache of a Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report) with global fashion consumers after his celebrity run on the hit show ""Project Runway.""
"
476,TPR,"What makes KORS above-and-beyond the average retailer is their global reach and brand appeal, their diverse ""accessible luxury"" lines that attract middle class fashionistas too, and their multi-channel marketing strategies in retail and wholesale. The company strategy is not hit-or-miss like many retailers. They are going for the jugular as THE all-encompassing and innovative lifestyle brand for more than the jetset.
"
477,TPR,"And that's why it was nice to see Steve Mandel of Lone Pine Capital increasing his stake in Q2 by 25% to 11.3 million shares, probably on those dips below $90 in April. He's a conservative fundamentally-driven investor with a long-term view and he's clearly not done watching the KORS growth story take his investment higher.

481,TPR,"Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report), formerly known as Coach, Inc., is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 6. In the trailing four quarters, this house of lifestyle brands as well as designer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts, has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 6.5%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.7%.Investors are counting on another estimate beat by Tapestry in the to-be-reported quarter. Let’s delve deep and take a look at the factors that will be influencing the results.How Are Estimates Shaping Up?Post a 6.7% decline in the bottom line, Tapestry is likely to record year-over-year growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. After rising by a penny in the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings stands at 87 cents compared with 75 cents in the year-ago quarter.Analysts polled by Zacks now project revenues of $1,768 million, up from $1,322 million in the year-ago quarter. If all goes well, this will be the second straight quarter of top-line growth for the company. We note that net sales of this New York-based company jumped 24% in the first quarter. However, the same declined 1.8% and 4% in the fourth and third quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively.Factors at PlayTapestry looks way more disciplined in its approach to adapt to the changing retail landscape. The company is undergoing a brand transformation and introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets. The acquisitions of Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade are being viewed as a significant step by the company in becoming a multi-brand company. Moreover, management has undertaken transformation initiatives revolving around product, stores and marketing, which are likely to have a favorable impact on second-quarter results.Additionally, the company is aggressively expanding its e-commerce platform. Tapestry also plans to undertake strategic measures involving the upgrade of core technology platforms and enhancement of international supply chain. However, sluggish mall traffic, increased online competition and aggressive pricing strategy are affecting the industry, and Tapestry is not immune it. Moreover, any increase in selling, general and administrative expenses may hurt the bottom line, as it did in the first quarter.Tapestry, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Tapestry, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tapestry, Inc. Quote What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Tapestry is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Tapestry carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.53%.

482,TPR,"Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK  -  Free Report), the footwear and apparel retailer, is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 1. In the second quarter, the company delivered positive earnings surprise of 49.5%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Investors are keen to find out whether Deckers will be able to sustain its positive earnings surprise streak in the quarter to be reported. In the trailing four quarters, it had outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 88.3%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has decreased by a couple of cents in the last 30 days and is pegged at $3.84, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 6.6%. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $750.2 million, down more than 1% year over year.Factors at PlayDeckers is targeting profitable markets and remains focused on product innovations and store augmentation along with transitioning to a direct subsidiary model from a distributor model outside the United States. The company’s focus on expanding brand assortments, bringing more innovative line of products, targeting consumers through marketing and optimizing omni-channel distribution also bode well.In keeping with the changing trends, Deckers has made substantial investments to strengthen online presence and improve shopping experience for customers. Further, it is focused on opening smaller concept omni-channel outlets and expanding programs such as Retail Inventory Online, Infinite UGG; Buy Online, Return In Store; and Click and Collect to enhance shopping experience.Moreover, in an effort to drive long-term growth, the company has taken strategic initiatives. Its store fleet optimization plan focuses on striking the right balance between digital and physical stores.However, management had earlier informed that it expects third-quarter net sales to decline due to the timing of orders from the third quarter into the second. Net sales for the quarter under review are estimated to be in the range of $735-$745 million down from $760.3 million reported in the year-ago period. Further, the company now envisions earnings in the range of $3.65-$3.75 compared with $4.11 per share delivered in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year decline in earnings is attributable to higher operating expenses on account of performance-based compensation.Deckers Outdoor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Deckers Outdoor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Deckers Outdoor Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Deckers is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

484,TPR,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Tapestry (TPR  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3.8% over the past month. TPR hit a new 52-week high of $54.83 in the previous session. Tapestry has gained 23.5% since the start of the year compared to the 4.4% move for the Retail-Wholesale sector and the -4% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 6, 2018, Tapestry reported EPS of $1.07 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.86 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.99%.For the current fiscal year, Tapestry is expected to post earnings of $2.59 per share on $5.86 billion in revenues. This represents a 20.47% change in EPS on a 30.51% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $2.88 per share on $6.08 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 11.2% and 3.8%, respectively.Valuation MetricsTapestry may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for TPR? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Tapestry has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 21.1X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 18.7X versus its peer group's average of 8.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.87. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Tapestry, Inc. Price and Consensus Tapestry, Inc. Price and Consensus | Tapestry, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Tapestry currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Tapestry passes the test. Thus, it seems as though TPR shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.

485,TPR,"Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 1. In the trailing four quarters, this house of lifestyle brands as well as designer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 11.9%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 24.4%.Investors are counting on another estimate beat by Tapestry in the to-be-reported quarter. Let’s delve deep and take a look at the factors that will be influencing the results.Factors at PlayTapestry looks way more disciplined in its approach to adapt to the changing retail landscape. The company is undergoing a brand transformation and introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets. Its long-term growth drivers include expansion of its global distribution model and venturing into under-penetrated markets. Further, the company launched Coach Create, a platform to customize bags either online or in outlets.Management is viewing the acquisitions of Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade as a significant step toward becoming a multi-brand company. Moreover, management has undertaken transformation initiatives revolving around product, stores and marketing, which are likely to have a favorable impact on third-quarter results.Additionally, the company is aggressively expanding its e-commerce platform. Tapestry also plans to undertake strategic measures involving the upgrade of core technology platforms and enhancement of international supply chain. However, sluggish mall traffic, increased online competition and aggressive pricing strategy are affecting the industry, and Tapestry is not fully immune to it.Tapestry, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Tapestry, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tapestry, Inc. QuoteHow Are Estimates Faring?After registering a bottom-line increase of 42.7% in the second quarter, Tapestry is likely to record year-over-year growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review stands at 50 cents compared with 46 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days.Analysts polled by Zacks now project revenues of $1,302 million, up from $995 million in the year-ago quarter.

486,TPR,"After the sales uptick in March, retailers now have another reason to cheer. Consumer confidence rebounded in the month of April after a decline in the last month and the index even inched close to its 18-year high level. Courtesy of a strengthening labor market, tax reform and rising income, Americans are way more confident now, brushing aside recent hiccups like the U.S.-China face-off, apprehensions of a tighter monetary policy and rising bond yields.Per the Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index surged to 128.7 this month from March’s revised reading of 127.0. Analysts pointed that sales pickup and rising consumer confidence underscore the underlying strength in the economy. Certainly, this positive sentiment is likely to translate into higher consumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy. An uptick in this metric is welcome news for retailers.More confident consumers also bode well as the fortunes of retailers depend on their willingness to spend. Consumers nowadays have clearly taken a liking to online shopping over visiting brick-and-mortar stores. With the evolving shopping patterns, retailers are getting smarter embracing the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether in stores or online or through smartphones via apps.Given the favorable backdrop, the Retail-Wholesale sector is likely to catch investors’ attention. The sector has gained roughly 11% in the past six months, outpacing the S&P 500’s growth of 3%. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the sector is likely to witness bottom-line growth of 11.7% in the current reporting cycle, faring better than the last reported quarter’s rise of 3%. The top line is also projected to climb 7.6% compared with 9.7% increase registered in the last reported quarter.With the earnings season picking up pace, it seems prudent to snap up some retail stocks that are likely to beat estimates. These are stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Ruth's Hospitality Group, Inc.

The company’s growth drivers include expansion of global distribution model and venturing into under-penetrated markets.

488,TPR,"Despite undertaking several strategic measures to drive performance, L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report) has failed to impress investors. The stock has witnessed a sharp decline of 36.7% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s fall of 7.1%. The company’s recent performance indicates that it may take some more time to adjust to changing retail landscape.However, other stocks such as Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report), Zumiez Inc.  and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF  -  Free Report), belonging to the same industry, have witnessed a rally of 20.1%, 13.3% and 35.4% in the past three months, respectively. Today, we will focus on L Brands and try to analyze the factors that are keeping investors away from the stock.More Pain AheadIn spite of beating estimates for earnings and sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s stock was affected by dismal first-quarter and fiscal 2018 outlook. Per management, it anticipates first-quarter comps in low-single digits. Earnings per share are envisioned in the range of 15-20 cents, down from 33 cents in the year-ago quarter.For fiscal 2018, the company expects comps to increase in the 2-4%, range while sales are estimated to be 2 points higher than comps. Management projects earnings in the band of $2.95-$3.25 per share, compared with $3.20 last year.Analysts were expecting the company to be back on track after disappointing performances in the past few quarters. However, a dismal outlook forced them to slash their estimates. In the past 30 days, the company’s fiscal 2018 and 2019 earnings estimate have moved down 31 cents and 32 cents to $3.17 and $3.42, respectively. In the same time frame, first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings estimate have declined to 19 cents from 32 cents, respectively. Further, gross margin, which contracted in all of the four quarters in fiscal 2016, disappointed investors in 2017. In the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, adjusted gross margin contracted 320, 120, 190 and 100 basis points (bps) to 37.1%, 37.3%, 37.8% and 42.3%, respectively.The downside was primarily caused by buying and occupancy expenditure deleverage in the quarter. The metric was affected by fall in merchandise margin rate. Management expects first quarter fiscal 2018 gross margin rate to decline year over year, due to fall in merchandise margin rate, somewhat offset by lower buying and occupancy expenses.Performance of Victoria’s Secret has been a cause of concern for quite some time. In an effort to streamline Victoria’s Secret business, the company made some strategic changes in 2016. However, these efforts are yet to show fruitful results. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, sales at Victoria’s Secret Stores declined 1.2% to $2,038.3 million, while Victoria's Secret direct sales were up 19.9% to $630.6 million. Total Victoria’s Secret sales rose 3.1% to $2,668.9 million, while comparable sales fell 1%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here..Bottom LineUndoubtedly, the aforementioned factors are enough to unnerve investors. Nevertheless, L Brands continues to revamp business by improving store experience, localizing assortments and enhancing direct business. The company is focusing on cost containment, inventory management, merchandise and speed-to-market initiatives.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

The company also launched Coach Create, a platform to customize bags either online or in outlets.Positive Earnings Surprise StreakTapestry’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 marked the 16th straight quarter of earnings beat. The adjusted earnings of $1.07 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents, thereby resulting in a positive earnings surprise of 24.4%. The quarterly earnings improved 42.7% year over year buoyed by top-line growth.On account of revisions to the U.S. tax code as well as lower interest expense, management now envisions fiscal 2018 earnings in the band of $2.52-$2.60, reflecting an increase of approximately 17-21%, comprising mid-to-high single digit accretion from the Kate Spade buyout. The company had earlier projected earnings in the range of $2.35-$2.40 per share.Wrapping UpSales increase at Coach brand, contributions from buyouts and sturdy holiday offerings along with improved inventory mix have favorably impacted the stock’s performance. However, fashion obsolescence remains the main concern for Tapestry’s business model, which involves a sustained focus on product and design innovation. The company’s pioneering position may be compromised by delays in its product launches.

524,TPR,"Meredith Corporation (MDP  -  Free Report) is expected to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 24. In the preceding quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.5%. Moreover, it had posted an average earnings beat of 7.1% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 91 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of 30%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $416.9 million compared with $442.6 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Factors Influencing this QuarterManagement had earlier stated that Meredith’s earnings in second-quarter fiscal 2018 are likely to be in the range of 87-92 cents a share, down from $1.30 reported in the prior-year quarter. Sharp decline in earnings projections for the quarter is primarily due to benefits of 54 cents registered in the year-ago period from robust political advertising revenues.Moreover, with the advancement of technology, the print media is on a decline. Increasing online readership is compelling Meredith to put extra initiative behind its portfolio of magazines. Though the company is expanding its presence in digital presence, it will take time to complete the metamorphosis.Notably, the company’s strategic initiatives particularly in digital space, brand licensing activities, solid portfolio of television stations and robust earnings surprise history reinforce its position as one of the leading media and marketing companies. Moreover, the company remains optimistic to generate solid no-political adverting revenues in Local Media Group attributable to robust demand for automotive and professional services.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Meredith is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

"
537,TPR,"Favorable Industry Comparisons
"
538,TPR,"The company offers solid fundamentals, trading with a forward P/E of 17. Coach's return on equity (ROE) of 38% soars past the industry average of 9%. The company's net profit margin of 19% compares to an industry average of 3%. COH pays an industry-leading dividend yield of 1%.

"
541,TPR,"Our Director of Research, Sheraz Mian, will take over my duties. Over the years, I've spent a lot of time speaking with Sheraz about the markets and stocks and can assure you that you will be in good hands. Furthermore, we rely on Zacks Equity Research recommendations for selecting stocks for the Focus List. Finally, and most importantly, the committee that has helped me manage our portfolios is remaining intact. Therefore, I think you will find the transition to be smooth.
"
542,TPR,"In terms of investing philosophy, one of the things that I will take with me is a stronger appreciation of earnings estimate revisions. I paid attention to consensus estimates prior to joining Zacks, but not with the same level of awareness that I now have. The difference being the greatly increased attention I give to revisions, in particular whether profit projections are rising or falling.
"
543,TPR,"As you know, at Zacks, we heavily promote the concept of following earnings estimate revisions. The philosophy is simple, buy when estimates are rising and sell when estimates are falling.
"
544,TPR,"It may sound a good marketing scheme, but the reality is that it really does work. This is particularly the case when estimates are rising on several companies within the same industry or sector. I can personally tell you that tracking earnings estimate revisions tipped me off to big rallies in copper, fertilizer and, most recently, tech stocks. They also helped tipped me off that there were problems with American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) in February 2008 - well before the financial system fell into a crisis.
"
545,TPR,"I believe in earnings estimate revisions so much that I specifically discuss them in my forthcoming book on investing. Trust me, if you want to do a gut-check on your personal investing philosophy, write a book about it. There is nothing in my book that I don't fully believe in. (The book is tentatively scheduled to be published in the first quarter (probably March 2010) by W&A Publishing. I'd tell you the title, but the publisher and I have not finalized what it will be.)
"
546,TPR,"If the only thing you ever do with earnings estimates is to check whether they are being raised or lowered, you will be one step ahead of the game. Earnings estimates are not a substitute for conducting other analysis, such as making sure the valuation is attractive or that the business model is sound, but they are a vital tool for identifying profitable investments.

547,TPR,"I'll be at Zacks through the remainder of the week and you can email me here at crotblut@zacks.com. You can also follow me on Twitter at http://twitter.com/charlesrotblut, even if you don't have a personal twitter account.

548,TPR,"Portfolio UpdatesCoach (COH) was added to the Growth & Income portfolio. The company has successfully gone after the ""affordable luxury"" market with high quality products priced below the likes of Prada and Gucci. Furthermore, the company continues to make inroads into China. We liked the fact that COH's fiscal first-quarter profits were well above the Zacks Consensus and that overall sales are holding steady despite the still questionable economic backdrop.
"
549,TPR,"Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) was sold from the Focus List. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2010 have fallen. At the same time, the share price has lagged. Rather than risk a potential loss, we decided that the prudent was to lock in the gain.

550,TPR,"The Markets
"
551,TPR,"The major indexes have been trading a fairly tight range, despite better-than-expected earnings. Such action is not surprising given that the rally has lasted for more than 7 months. The Dow seems have found near-term resistance at 10,160.
"
552,TPR,"One of the things I will be watching this week is the advance GDP report. I think the risk for stocks is to the downside, especially if the number comes in below 3%. (Economists are projecting GDP growth of 3.1%).
"
553,TPR,"Volume continues to be light overall, suggesting an ongoing lack of conviction. With a few exceptions (e.g. Apple (AAPL)), positive earnings surprises just don't seem to be inspiring traders. This said, the bull continues to breathe.
"
