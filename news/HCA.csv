1,HCA,"Thursday was supposed to be do-or-die day for House Speaker Paul Ryan's American Health Care Act, but the bill will be on life support, at least until Friday and maybe longer. A planned Thursday night vote won't happen, and it's unclear when it will happen.Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office late Thursday released a new score of the revised GOP legislation, predicting a smaller deficit savings than the original bill.The Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite erased modest intraday gains on the stock market today. The Dow fell a fraction, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lost about 0.1%.President Trump told reporters shortly before the market close that ""we have a chance"" with the health care vote, expecting the outcome to be ""very close.""Earlier, the House Freedom Caucus of conservative lawmakers met with Trump without agreeing to support the bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare.White House spokesman Sean Spicer described the meeting as positive, with some members backing the legislation. But Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., later said this group still has ""issues"" with the bill.Ryan delayed an expected press conference for a second time Friday.The possibility of ObamaCare repeal failure has weighed on financial markets this week, with the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all suffering their steepest one-day losses since fall on Tuesday as conservatives began to close ranks against the bill.The Trump-Freedom Caucus meeting followed a late-night agreement with House conservatives to scrap ObamaCare rules requiring insurance plans to include a comprehensive list of essential benefits. While the deal moved conservatives closer to supporting the bill, some centrist lawmakers declared their opposition, including Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, who heads the Tuesday Group of moderate GOP lawmakers.If ObamaCare repeal fails, some analysts were predicting a continued rough spell for financials but a potential bounce for beaten-down hospital stocks. Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) all have sliced through their 50-day moving averages this week amid concerns that President Trump's agenda of growth-fueling tax cuts and infrastructure spending could be sidelined by a failure to repeal ObamaCare.If Ryan lacks the votes and pulls the bill, ""then we think there could be renewed pressure on financial stocks as investor confidence in Congress's ability to pass President Trump's economic agenda will be further eroded,"" wrote Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Washington analyst Brian Gardner.Meanwhile, shares of hospital operators Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA) could see a rebound. Hospital stocks have suffered in recent weeks as Ryan and Trump pushed a plan that could reduce the ranks of the insured by 24 million.IBD'S TAKE: If the GOP fails in its bid to repeal and replace ObamaCare, don't assume that it will hamper the rest of President Trump's economic agenda. Failure is likely to focus the GOP on delivering deficit-increasing tax cuts, retroactive to 2017, to avoid a shellacking in the 2018 elections. Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick expects that the GOP will somehow find a way to get the AHCA through both the House and Senate. ""If we're wrong, then on Friday we see upside to hospitals that is likely limited by overall market downside as the probability that tax reform can get done this year diminishes,"" she wrote.Actually, Tenet rose 4.1% and HCA 0.8% Thursday, in a sign investors have doubts that Ryan's bill will pass. But banks were generally higher too, though well off session highs: Bank of America rose 0.6% and Goldman Sachs 0.4%. Wells Fargo fell 0.1%.After the market close, the Congressional Budget Office released a score of the revised health care bill. The CBO still sees the legislation increasing the number of uninsured by 24 million. But it cut the bill's deficit savings by more than half to $150 billion, largely reflecting some tax and Medicaid changes.RELATED:CBO Reveals RyanCare Trick To 'Save' $600 BillionTrump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesTrumpCare Has Momentum: These Health Stocks Are ScramblingThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

2,HCA,"XA defeat for House Speaker Paul Ryan's bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare, which is scheduled for a Thursday vote, could trigger a sell-off for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and other financial markets.""The House is scheduled to vote on the Republican health care bill this week, but any delay in that process could signal to investors that tax reform is in peril,"" Brian Gardner, Washington analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote in a Tuesday note.The Nasdaq composite, which opened at an all-time high, reversed to trade down as President Trump went to Capitol Hill to press GOP lawmakers to pass Ryan's American Health Care Act.""I honestly think many of you will lose your seats in 2018 if you don't get this done,"" Trump told a private House GOP conference.On Tuesday, the Dow industrials lost 1%, the S&P 500 index 1.1% and the Nasdaq 1.5%, all their worst showing in five months. Financial stocks — which have been among the best performers since Trump's election due to hopes for tax cuts, faster growth and deregulation — were among the worst-performing groups on the stock market today. Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) slid 2.9% and Goldman Sachs (GS) 3.8%. JPMorgan broke below its 50-day line a day after Goldman Sachs closed under that key level. Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) also knifed through their 50-day lines Tuesday, sinking 5.8% and 2.6%, respectively.""If we are wrong about the health care debate and the House defeats the Republican health care bill on Thursday, then we expect the market, including financials, would sell off over concerns that Republicans will not be able to deliver on their agenda, which includes tax reform,"" Gardner wrote.Hospital stocks suffered deeper losses, with Tenet Healthcare (THC) down 6.2% and HCA Holdings (HCA) 1.55%. Medicaid-focused insurer Molina Healthcare (MOH) lost 1.2% and was testing 30-month lows.IBD'S TAKE: Up until now, financial markets have been happy with just the idea of President Trump's big tax cuts and infrastructure spending. That's because, with all that fiscal fuel in the slow lane, the Federal Reserve can take its sweet time raising interest rates.At this point, it's hard to predict the outcome of the House vote, and even if the health care bill gets through the House, the Senate looks to be a tougher hurdle. A number of conservatives have announced their opposition. Meanwhile, the Club for Growth announced it was spending $500,000 to air ads in the districts of 10 GOP lawmakers to urge them to oppose RyanCare.House leaders released an update of the bill on Monday, but the changes were unlikely to substantially reduce the 24 million rise in the ranks of the uninsured projected by the Congressional Budget Office.Moderate Republicans have criticized the Ryan bill for providing insufficient help to low-income and older adults. The tweaked version would lower the medical spending threshold, as a percentage of income, above which people could deduct health spending from taxes. That might not do much for low-income households that pay low tax rates and, in many cases, no income taxes.Trump acknowledged last week that many of his supporters wouldn't fare well under the House bill, but he said on Wednesday that the GOP has a chance ""to do something amazing."" RELATED:Trump's 3 Little Words That May Sink Ryan's ObamaCare Repeal, Tax ReformCBO Reveals RyanCare Trick To 'Save' $600 BillionTrump's Big Speech Leaves Investors With Hope, Not Much ElseThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

3,HCA,"Hospital stocks have been a sick bunch in recent years. In 2015-17, the group slipped 4%, then careened 23% lower and last year edged up 3%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 fell 1%, then rose 10% and 19% in the same periods.Yet so far this year, the hospital stock group is up 13% vs. a flat performance for the S&P 500. Going into Tuesday's session, the hospital stock group was No. 9 among 197 industry groups.Anytime a group outperforms the stock market, the group deserves some attention.According to Stock Checkup at Investors.com, Tenet Healthcare (THC) is No. 1 in the group. The company suffered earnings declines of 38% and 36% in 2016-17. The Street expects earnings to rise 80% this year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTenet is already showing signs of a turnaround. In Q4, the company earned $1.40 a share vs. 23 cents in the year-ago quarter. In Q1, Tenet chalked up a profit of 57 cents a share vs. a loss of 27 cents in the year-ago quarter.In terms of chart action, this is a better time to sell than to buy Tenet shares. The stock broke out May 1 and is in the 20%-25% profit-taking zone.No. 2 in the group is Select Medical Holdings (SEM). The stock's three-year earnings growth rate is minus 1%, but Select Medical grew earnings per share by 59% last year.Quarterly earnings jumped 39% vs. year-ago levels in Q2 2017, then 133%, 158% and most recently 38%.Select Medical's stock has been consolidating in a saucer-type base since November. The stock is 8% off its high. The potential buy point is 19.87. An aggressive entry would be 19.30.One drawback for Select Medical and Tenet is pretax margin. In 2017, pretax margin was 5% and 2.7% respectively.The No. 3 stock in the group is HCA Holdings (HCA). Pretax margin has been in the 10%-11% range for each of the past four years.HCA's three-year growth rate for earnings is 13%. Analysts expect 29% growth this year.The stock is shaping a base-on-base pattern with a double-bottom look. The potential buy point is 106.94, but an alternative entry is possible at 104.30. Volume will determine whether 104.30 is a workable entry.Universal Health Services (UHS) enjoyed annual pretax margins of 11% to 12% in the past five years.

"
5,HCA,"Hospitals and insurer stocks were hammered yet again on Tuesday, a day after the Congressional Budget Office said that the GOP ObamaCare repeal plan could cut the ranks of the insured by 24 million by 2026.Even more startling, since the biggest changes wouldn't take effect until 2020, is that the uninsured population could jump by 15 million next year alone if the individual mandate is killed, CBO said.For hospital groups like Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA) that could mean a lot more uninsured patients who can't pay their bills, even though the House bill would provide some extra funds for hospitals that treat a disproportionately high share of low-income patients. Tenet fell 3.3% and HCA 1.5% on the stock market today.Insurers also fared poorly, and this time the losses extended beyond Medicaid-focused insurers Molina Healthcare (MOH) and Centene (CNC) to big players like Anthem (ANTM) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). Molina sank 2.3%, hitting its lowest level since October 2014, while Centene lost 2.8%, Anthem 1.2% and Dow component UnitedHealth 0.7%.The overall market saw more modest losses, with the Dow Jones industrial average off 0.2%, the S&P 500 index 0.4% and the Nasdaq composite 0.4%. (UnitedHealth is a Dow component.)IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.The negative reaction of investors to the CBO report wasn't a given, because several GOP senators used the occasion to criticize the American Health Care Act put together by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Yet Ryan said he was encouraged by CBO's analysis. It's possible that the report showing more than $300 billion in budget savings will help him win over enough conservatives to pass his bill.Still, it's unclear that anything resembling RyanCare can survive the Senate, where at least five moderate Republicans and a couple of conservatives have expressed opposition. It follows that anything which can survive the Senate may not survive the House. But if the Senate can pass an ObamaCare repeal bill through budget reconciliation, which is by no means certain, there will be tremendous pressure on all concerned to get a deal done.RELATED:CBO Reveals RyanCare Trick To 'Save' $600 BillionTrump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else Hates 
"
6,HCA,"The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the House GOP plan to repeal and replace most of ObamaCare would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 24 million by 2026.Because the GOP bill would mostly retain ObamaCare coverage rules, insurance would be unaffordable for lower-income and older adults with the new, smaller tax credits on offer, so some 30 million people wouldn't claim the GOP tax credit averaging $3,000 in 2020 and rising with inflation. That would add up to more than $600 billion in unclaimed subsidies through 2026, or roughly the same $600 billion amount by which House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan cuts taxes. Those unspent subsidies go a long way to explaining why CBO found that the American Health Care Act would reduce deficits by $323 billion over a decade.Concerns about coverage losses, particularly under Medicaid, have weighed on the shares of hospital groups like Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA), and Medicaid-focused insurers like Centene (CNC) and Molina Healthcare (MOH). Other major insurers including Anthem (ANTM), one of the biggest exchange players, and UnitedHealth (UNH), have fared better amid the ObamaCare repeal debate.(Tenet Healthcare fell 3.1% on the stock market today, ahead of the CBO report released after the closing bell. HCA slid 0.9%. Centene shares rose 1.5% but Molina's sank 1%. Anthem advanced 0.5% and UnitedHealth 0.1%. Health stocks did not move much in late trading.)The increase in the ranks of the uninsured under the plan put together by House Speaker Paul Ryan would come as 14 million lose Medicaid coverage, the number of people covered by employer plans falls by 7 million and individual market coverage drops by 2 million.The budget scorekeeper's view that the American Health Care Act will substantially reduce the deficit and eventually lower average insurance premiums — by about 10%, due to rules that favor young adults, less comprehensive coverage and a reinsurance fund — may provide House GOP leaders enough encouragement to keep pushing their plan. Yet the official score of RyanCare provides reason to the think that the GOP bid to repeal ObamaCare faces high odds of failure.While the House bill easily passes the budget test, it does so by dramatically increasing the ranks of the uninsured in a way that several moderate GOP senators have criticized. That means there may not be a great deal of flexibility in improving health insurance outcomes without violating the deficit-neutral hurdle required for Senate passage via reconciliation.IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.Any bill passed via reconciliation will have to be at least deficit-neutral in the 11th year and beyond. CBO's score of the House bill in the 10th year shows a hefty $92 billion surplus. That's partly due to the inclusion of the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% tax on the cost of employer health insurance above a set threshold.The Cadillac tax has faced bipartisan opposition, which eventually led Congress to put it on ice until 2020. Including the tax may make the budget numbers add up but may risk losing support among both moderates and conservatives.The key point is that, even with the Cadillac tax, there may be less room than it appears for higher subsidies or less stringent Medicaid cuts that will still allow the budget numbers add up. With conservatives complaining about RyanCare because it does too much to preserve ObamaCare, there's also a risk that RyanCare could lose support on the right if the GOP makes significant concessions to moderates.For perspective, the additional 24 million uninsured under the GOP plan, on top of an estimated 6 million who don't claim subsidies they are eligible for under ObamaCare, would leave more than $100 billion in tax credits unclaimed in 2026 alone, an IBD analysis finds. That's more than the $92 billion in net budget savings that year. Increasing subsidies to entice or enable many more people to get coverage could wreck the plan's budget score.One last point: Republicans are talking about a multiphase process that would eventually include a relaxing of ObamaCare benefit requirements. That's to be expected, since the one thing Republicans seem to agree on about health care is that the government shouldn't tell people what kind of health insurance they have to buy.If ObamaCare's essential benefits requirements were axed, health policy experts believe that insurers would inevitably offer people coverage that costs no more than the value of their tax credit under the GOP plan. In other words, people would find a way to use their tax credits, even if they could only afford to buy the skimpiest coverage — too little in many cases to be considered insured under CBO's assessment. Still, if that's the GOP's eventual plan, it means that the CBO is underestimating the true cost of RyanCare by about $600 billion.RELATED:Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesThe Biggest Puzzle About Paul Ryan's ObamaCare RepealTrumpCare Has Momentum: These Health Stocks Are Scrambling

13,HCA,"The Republican plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare was finally unveiled late Monday, and analysts say it could lead to big drops in the number of insured.Under the proposed changes, 6 million-10 million Americans could lose coverage, according to estimates from S&P Global Ratings.Yet investors apparently saw little to fear from the House GOP plan that President Trump hailed as ""wonderful."" Among insurers with a big presence on the exchanges, Anthem (ANTM) closed 0.1% higher on the stock market today, while Centene (CNC) slipped 0.6% and Molina (MOH) fell 1.6%.The Dow Jones industrial average, Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index closed down.Anthem, Centene and Molina, along with Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH), also compete in the Medicaid managed care business and have profited from ObamaCare's expansion of the program for the poor and near-poor. UnitedHealth shares fell 0.2%.Hospital stocks did see a downdraft on Tuesday, with Tenet Healthcare (THC) tumbling 7.1%. But Universal Health Services (UHS) fell a more-modest 2.2% and HCA Holdings (HCA) shed 1.3%.Given the substantial future curtailment of government funding for health coverage built into the GOP plan, one might have expected more jarring losses. Insurers will no longer stand to benefit from ObamaCare's individual and employer mandates, which would be repealed.The House plan also would revive the so-called Cadillac tax on expensive health insurance plans in 2025, with a 40% tax on insurance the exceeds a certain cost threshold. Meanwhile, the rate of growth of Medicaid spending would be curtailed to the rate of the consumer price index for medical care, down one percentage point from a preliminary version of the House bill.So why are investors taking things more or less in stride? Here are three likely reasons:1) The chances of the bill ever becoming law appear to be fairly small. Both the relatively moderate and conservative wings of the GOP have signaled problems with the House approach. It's far from clear that the Ryan and Trump plan to thread the needle.IBD'S TAKE: The fight over ObamaCare is likely to increase doubts about President Trump's ability to enact the rest of his economic agenda including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. 2) For the insurers on the ObamaCare exchanges, the GOP changes might actually stabilize things in the near term, since the bill would lower the cost of coverage for younger adults and raise it for older adults.3) The House bill keeps the Medicaid expansion intact through 2020 and only gradually phases it out afterward. While the long run matters, investors are generally more focused on earnings within the next several years. That makes sense, given uncertainty about what Washington will do. Further, the House bill would restore government funds for hospitals that treat a disproportionate share of indigent patients.RELATED:The House GOP ObamaCare Repeal And Replace Plan: 7 Key PointsHow To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social SecuritySupernus, Valeant, Endo Stocks Lose Big After Trump Drug-Pricing TweetThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

14,HCA,"A key House committee has proposed delaying any changes in Medicaid funding until 2020 to win over moderate Republicans as the effort to repeal and replace the major parts of ObamaCare runs into trouble.Although the ability of Republicans to bridge a wide divide between moderates and conservatives still looks iffy, especially in the Senate, the signal of retreat on Medicaid cuts had the health care sector breathing a sigh of relief.While the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite were slightly negative as of early afternoon in the stock market today, health stocks were mostly higher.Among hospitals, HCA Holdings (HCA) closed up 1.4% at 88.53, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) jumped 10% to 20.99 and Universal Health Services (UHS) gained 2.2% to 125.58.Among insurers, Molina Healthcare (MOH) was unchanged at 49.99, and Aetna (AET) climbed 0.9% to 130.69, while Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) edged up 0.5% 168.20.Drugmakers, which also have benefited from President Trump backing away from earlier threats of an intervention to bring down the high cost of prescriptions, were mixed. Dow component Merck (MRK) rose 0.8%, but Pfizer (PFE), another Dow member, ended flat.IBD'S TAKE: The difficulty of Republicans in settling on a replacement for ObamaCare is threatening to sidetrack the rest of President Trump's economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending.The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which plays a key role in shaping health reform, will release a plan next week maintaining Medicaid funding levels until 2020, before cuts would take effect, the Wall Street Journal reported.The retreat by the House comes as GOP governors have been making their voices heard about preserving ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who has embraced the Medicaid expansion, met with Trump a week ago and has been among the leaders of the effort.RELATED:Biotechs Leap On Trump's Calls For Innovation, Speedy FDA ApprovalTrump's Big Speech Leaves Investors With Hope, Not Much Else

15,HCA,"Shares of hospitals and Medicaid-focused health insurers took another leg down on Friday as the divide among House Republicans over the bill to replace much of ObamaCare appeared to narrow.Among hospitals, Tenet Healthcare (THC) slid 5.3%, Universal Health Services (UHS) 1.7%, HCA Holdings (HCA) 1.3% and Lifepoint Health (LPNT) 1.8%. Medicaid-focused insurer Molina Healthcare (MOH) lost 2.5%, falling close to a 28-month low, while Centene (CNC) slipped 1.6%.Other insurers were faring better on Friday, with Anthem (ANTM) rising 0.1% and Dow industrials component UnitedHealth (UNH) 1.2%.After sinking on Tuesday after the release of the House Speaker Paul Ryan's American Health Care Act, hospital stocks had recovered the past few days. Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick noted that the apparent willingness of President Trump to back conservatives who want a faster phaseout of the Medicaid expansion might get the bill over the top in the House.The White House clarified Friday that it supports phasing out the Medicaid expansion after 2020, as the current AHCA would do. But that didn't help health stocks.Drug companies and biotechs including Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) also sold off on Tuesday as Ryan's bill was scrutinized. But that was likely due to a Tuesday morning Trump tweet: ""I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down!""On Friday, Teva shares were up 1.3% Friday on the stock market today, while Mylan edged up 0.4%.Overall, markets were holding onto modest gains after a sizzling February jobs report. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq were all up 0.2%-0.4%, although the Dow and other major indexes were on track to break a string of four straight weekly gains.In a research note, Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick said the upbeat assessment from House Majority Whip Steve Scalise offers something of a wake-up call to health care investors.""It has become clear that hospital investors were assuming that there was very little chance of a draconian repeal bill passing,"" Skolnick wrote.IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.That still leaves plenty of doubt about how anything resembling the House bill can get enough support in the Senate. Five GOP senators have expressed serious concerns about unwinding the Medicaid expansion, let alone on the expedited basis that House conservatives want to see.Skolnick notes that Trump's support will carry a lot of weight in the House, but that may not be as true for senators in states like Maine and Colorado, where Hillary Clinton beat Trump. In Ohio, GOP Sen. Rob Portman far surpassed Trump's vote tally.Yet Skolnick is sticking with her bottom line that repeal and replace gets done. ""To be clear, we don't think the GOP can go home in 2018 without passing repeal, no matter how bad, no matter whether it's full repeal or not.""And Skolnick does think that any bill that emerges will be bad for the hospitals she covers: ""We see increased adverse selection in the individual market, reduced Medicaid funding in the long term, collapse of exchanges that currently work and soaring numbers of uninsured as creating real potential for pressure on hospital cash flows that likely hit hospital valuations in the next two years.""RELATED:Three Reasons TrumpCare Isn't Killing Hospital, Insurer Stocks Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesThe Biggest Puzzle About Paul Ryan's ObamaCare Repeal

The Federal Reserve had already telegraphed a near-certain rate hike on March 15 before Friday's report confirmed the second straight month of stellar job gains. Job gains were lifted by warm weather, which fueled a 58,000 rise in construction employment. Yet enthusiasm about the Trump agenda of deregulation, tax cuts and infrastructure spending has clearly been a factor behind the spurt in job growth and economic confidence. The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, though dipping slightly to 55.3 in March, remained close to February's 12-year high.The key question is whether the optimism — and strong job growth — is sustained throughout the spring, in which case the Fed's rate-hiking timetable will accelerate.RELATED:House Republicans rolled out legislation to repeal and replace much of ObamaCare, with the legislation clearing some hurdles despite opposition from various liberals, conservatives and moderates.

23,HCA,"The two gleaming operating rooms in this Kingston, N.Y., hospital still look brand-new seven years after being built for $5 million: They've never seen a single patient, and never will.With an occupancy rate of just over 50%, the 150-bed hospital, its surgery center and an emergency department renovated in 2011 for $6 million will be closed and retrofitted into what its new owner calls a ""medical village"" of outpatient services, such as physical therapy and behavioral health services.The story of the 123-year-old facility, located in a small town about 100 miles north of New York City, is repeating itself nationwide. Hospitals have been disappearing as government pressure to drive down costs moved care to stand-alone units, doctors' offices and even patients' homes. Now, with the election of Donald Trump and his promise to repeal ObamaCare, they find themselves more vulnerable than any other health care providers to the major disruptions ahead, as they could lose government funds and face an increase of uninsured or less-profitable patients.""It's been a very tough environment for hospitals,"" said Jason McGorman, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. ""They have to get into other areas and businesses to free up cash and generate better margins than inpatient care, which has become a slow-growth business.""All kinds of services are moving outside hospitals: hip and knee replacements, heart valve repairs, even childbirth. Mt. Sinai Health System in New York City, which is closing an 856-bed hospital to reopen at the same site as a 70-bed facility, has a program that provides hospital-level care in patients' homes for conditions such as congestive heart failure and cellulitis infections.The timing of a possible undoing of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature health care law, is highly uncertain, with Republicans disagreeing on how to tackle the effort and what would replace the program. But regardless of ObamaCare's fate, the move toward cheaper outpatient services is forcing hospitals to adapt or die.The driving forces behind the change are the payers of hospital bills — insurers and the government — seeking to cut costly hospital admissions through a mix of reimbursement restrictions and incentives. The Medicare program for the older population is the biggest payer for medical services in the country, but lowering the costs of the Medicaid program for the poor, which is jointly funded by the federal government and states, is also a major focus. Some states — including New York, Texas and California — are so eager to reduce their Medicaid bills that they grant hospital systems millions of dollars to redesign care in ways that cut the need for beds.One of the beneficiaries is Westchester Medical Center Health Network, which bought the former Kingston hospital in March. The nonprofit system is eligible for more than $360 million from New York state's $8 billion program to reduce Medicaid admissions 25% over five years. About $89 million will be used to transform the Kingston facility and transfer some of its current services into another nearby affiliate.Large for-profit chains such as HCA Holdings (HCA) and Tenet Healthcare (THC) have taken measures to adapt. HCA has focused its operations in urban areas, where populations are higher and demand for high-margin services is greater, while Tenet has aggressively moved into outpatient care while expanding Conifer, its health management services unit.Still, their shares fell sharply after Trump's election as investors worried a repeal of ObamaCare — which brought coverage to 20 million people since it was passed in 2010 — without a quick replacement would hurt profits. Hospital valuations are now near five-year lows on concerns that funding for the law's public exchanges may be revoked, increasing bad debt expense and cutting earnings, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Tenet and HCA declined to comment.In the so-called medical village planned inside the former Kingston hospital, Westchester Medical has already mapped out areas for patient education and occupational and physical therapy. Behavioral and nutritional services, senior services such as respite care, perhaps even art therapy may be added in the future — anything that could help keep patients, especially with low income, from ending up in the emergency room.""We're gambling on better outcomes,"" said Marsha Casey, executive vice president of the Westchester Medical network. ""Too many people are admitted because they aren't enrolled in good primary care and prevention programs, and it will cost all of us a lot less if we start caring for them well.""Meanwhile, at MidHudson Regional Hospital, another Westchester Medical affiliate in Poughkeepsie 20 miles down the river, mental health social workers work in the emergency room along with a ""mobile crisis"" unit that counsels patients outside the hospital. MidHudson is working with Duchess County on the plan to care for patients outside the emergency room, and has received some county funding.The U.S. is the most expensive country in the world for hospital care, which accounts for about a third of the $3 trillion in annual health care spending in the country, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. With prices for an overnight stay that dwarf other nations', systems are under unprecedented pressure to cut expenses.Rural facilities, which typically have lower margins, are the most vulnerable, and their closures have a societal impact — forcing patients to travel to get emergency care. More than 600 rural hospitals are at risk of closing because of their finances and, at current closure rates, more than a quarter of them will shut down in less than 10 years, according to the National Rural Healthcare Association, which tracks the number.Related health services also suffer when a hospital shuts down, said Mark Holmes, director of the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program, a nonprofit academic research center.""The hospital is the nexus of the health system,"" he said. ""If it leaves town, the physicians who attend there are going to leave too.""In an equation that repeatedly subtracts beds, hospital leaders are struggling to understand where they fit in, said Mark Wager, president of Heritage Medical Systems, which operates physician groups in New York, Arizona and California.""If you just built a new cardio center based on previous incidence rates, well, the model just blew up,"" he said. ""If my hospital isn't one that does well, will it go away? It might need to.""RELATED:Mall Landlords Welcome Medical Clinics As Retail AilsChina's Wave Of Residential Property Investment Reaches Far CornersWhere You Can Save Money On Health Care

24,HCA,"Perhaps no group carries more weight in the health care debate than the American Medical Association, and on Wednesday the physicians group put a big hurdle in front of the Republican plan to quickly repeal ObamaCare and figure out how to replace it later.The doctor's group demanded in a letter that the GOP offer a detailed plan that can be compared to existing law before any vote to repeal large parts of the Affordable Care Act. Further, the AMA called it ""essential that gains in the number of Americans with health insurance coverage be maintained.""While it's not clear whether the Republican-led Congress and President-elect Donald Trump will slow down and detail their ObamaCare replacement plan or charge ahead with a repeal vote as soon as February, some of the stocks that have fared the worst since the election showed signs of life on Wednesday.Members of IBD's Medical-Hospitals group, which had been ranked No. 196 out of 197 based on recent stock-price performance, were big winners Wednesday. Tenet Healthcare (THC) jumped 8.8% to 16.75 on the stock market today, while HCA Holdings (HCA) climbed 3.6% to 77.13.Centene (CNC) and Molina Healthcare (MOH), two beaten-down insurers with major exposure to ObamaCare's exchange business and Medicaid expansion, also rallied. Centene rose 3.3% to 60.25, while Molina perked up 3.6% to 55.52.UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), which have already exited most of the ObamaCare exchange markets where they were doing business, saw more modest gains, rising 0.3% and 0.9%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Read why UnitedHealth is fast becoming the Amazon.com of health care and why it isn't sweating forthcoming policy changes under Donald Trump.Republicans have made clear that they plan to use a procedure known as reconciliation that requires only majority support in the Senate to quickly repeal critical parts of ObamaCare, but keep the law operating for a few years as they design, pass and implement a replacement. Vice President-elect Mike Pence promised an ""orderly transition"" from ObamaCare, with House Speaker Paul Ryan stressing that a priority will be maintaining patient care.Trump, in a Twitter post Wednesday, cautioned Republicans ""to be careful"" about repeal. While Trump has insisted he'll replace the health law with something ""terrific,"" since his election he has hinted that he might keep various provisions.In the letter to leaders of both parties in Congress, the AMA wrote, ""before any action is taken through reconciliation or other means that would potentially alter coverage, policymakers should lay out for the American people, in reasonable detail, what will replace current policies.""The doctor's group added: ""Patients and other stakeholders should be able to clearly compare current policy to new proposals so they can make informed decisions about whether it represents a step forward in the ongoing process of health reform.""The AMA came out in support of Trump's nomination of Rep. Tom Price, a physician, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Price has been a leading advocate of ObamaCare repeal and has laid out his own plan. So it comes as something of a surprise that the AMA now appears to be a significant obstacle to repeal of ObamaCare.The group's support was seen as critical before passage of the 2010 health law officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Wednesday's letter clarified its current stance: ""We continue to embrace the primary goal of that law — to make high quality, affordable health care coverage accessible to all Americans. We also recognize that the ACA is imperfect and there a number of issues that need to be addressed. As such, we welcome proposals, consistent with the policies of our House of Delegates, to make coverage more affordable, provide greater choice, and increase the number of those insured.""The AMA's directive that GOP plans don't reduce the number of insured is consistent with what Speaker Ryan and Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway have pledged. Yet, the trick will be to offer detailed policies that achieve and pay for those goals without a divisive intraparty battle.RELATED:The Only Way For TrumpCare To Be 'Terrific'Trump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?'

30,HCA,"Major health insurers and hospital groups sold off Friday after the White House confirmed that President Trump will cut off subsidies that make medical bills affordable for low-income beneficiaries.XWhile the timing of his action is uncertain, there is potential for it to unleash chaos in numerous ObamaCare exchange insurance markets and lead to a surge in the uncompensated care provided by hospitals — though there's also a chance such chaos won't materialize.Managed care stocks were broadly lower, though Centene (CNC), which has a leading share of exchange enrollment, closed down 3.2% on the stock market today. after plunging as much as 11%. Anthem and Molina Healthcare, which have both scaled back their exchange participation, lost 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively. Even insurers like UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Aetna (AET), which have fully extricated themselves from the exchange business lost ground, though the closed well off intraday lows. UnitedHealth slipped 0.2%, while Aetna gave up 0.9%.Among hospital groups, Tenet Healthcare (THC) slid 5.1%, Community Health Systems (CYH) 4%. HCA Healthcare (HCA) erased losses to close up 0.5%.While there's potential for serious fallout, it's also possible that Trump's move to stop funding ObamaCare's cost-sharing subsidies, which come on top of premium subsidies for households earning up to 250% of the poverty level, will be much ado about nothing.The 2010 Affordable Care Act health law requires that insurers provide the equivalent of platinum-level coverage to the lowest-income tier of beneficiaries paying for silver-level coverage. The government is supposed to make insurers whole for providing that extra level of coverage that can reduce out-of-pocket medical spending to a maximum of $1,000 or less vs. about $7,000 for silver plans. But even if the government doesn't come through, insurers are still on the hook for providing those extra benefits.To get around this threat, which could drive insurers to leave the exchanges, state regulators are allowing them to lump those extra costs onto silver plan premiums. Since subsidies are tied to the cost of silver plans, everyone who qualifies for subsidies would get a much bigger one under this scenario.The problem is that many states didn't take any precautions for the possibility that Trump would end the cost-sharing subsidies, despite his threat to do so. Because rates have already been set for 2018, insurers might be stuck paying for those extra costs, so some might just stop providing ObamaCare marketplace coverage.IBD'S TAKE: The insurer which has made the biggest bet on ObamaCare is ranked No. 1 in the IBD Medical-Managed Care industry group, based on earnings, sales and profit margin trends, as well as stock performance. Find the leaders in each of 197 industry groups at IBD Stock Checkup. There have been bipartisan discussions in Congress about funding the subsidies, which the Obama administration treated like an entitlement, funding them without an appropriation from Congress. A federal judge ruled last year that President Obama violated the power of the purse that the Constitution entrusts to Congress. While that ruling could be appealed, the Trump White House has no desire to and can legitimately say it's abiding by the law.Because the Congressional Budget Office baseline presumes ongoing funding of the cost-sharing subsidies, Congress could renew funding with no impact on the budget. In fact, CBO found that failure to renew funding would increase the federal deficit by $194 billion and boost the ranks of the insured by 1 million. The reason that deficits would go up is that killing the cost-sharing subsidies would lead to a spike in premiums, which would in turn lead to much higher premium subsidies.The late Thursday announcement that Trump will, at some point, end the cost-sharing subsidies came just hours after he signed an executive order that would expand options to buy low-cost, high-deductible insurance outside of the exchanges.While killing the cost-sharing subsidies might not end up hurting insurers, if Congress steps in to fund them or the move is delayed, insurers and health care investors are right to be nervous.Trump's actions send a signal that the White House is determined to undermine ObamaCare in any way possible, including gutting the individual mandate that's meant to get relatively young and healthy people to sign up for coverage.RELATED:Trump Executive Order Hits ObamaCare InsurersHouse GOP Wins ObamaCare Lawsuit: Key Subsidies Illegal McCain Pulls Plug On GOP Health Bill; Insurers, Hospitals RallyObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular TruthsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

31,HCA,"Since taking the helm of one of the fund industry's marquee portfolios on April 1, Justin White has guided $3.4 billion T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund (PRWAX) to a 10.44% return, topping 70% of his large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.In that time going into Thursday, with the broad market not favoring all of the types of stocks the fund held, the S&P 500 gained 12.35%.White is steering a fund with a proud legacy. Its 9.11% average annual return over the past 10 years ranked in the top 7% of its peer group.White is putting his mark on the fund. Since taking the helm, he has boosted the fund's weighting in financials and trimmed its weightings in health care and industrials.""Under (predecessor Daniel Martino) the fund had a tremendous track record,"" White said. ""It was higher octane than it is now."" While willing to hold individual stocks that can be volatile, White is trying to keep the overall portfolio's volatility lower. ""And I don't try to make big macro bets ... . I let stock picking carry the day. I pay more attention to (controlling) downside risk, so I have a greater allocation for example to telecoms — not the AT&Ts (T) or Verizon (VZ), but to tower businesses ... like American Tower (AMT) . . . and core holdings like Comcast (CMCSA).""In broad strategic terms, the fund aims for stocks in the fastest growing sectors. Now that means internet stocks like Amazon (AMZN), which is taking share from brick-and-mortar retailers, he says. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) are taking advertising dollars from nondigital media. ""Those are among my top holdings because their outsize growth will persist for some time,"" White said.Information technology is the fund's largest sector, with a 35% weighting as of Dec. 31.As for stocks that might benefit from Trump policies, White says he is hedging his bets. ""It's hard to make big bets on the economy reaccelerating,"" he said. He does expect financials to benefit. ""The sector has been in regulators' unrelenting crosshairs for the past 10 years,"" he said. ""And I'm pretty comfortable betting on a regulations rollback and tax reductions.""But White thinks new infrastructure spending is already largely or all priced into many materials and industrials stocks. For that reason, he has kept Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) a small holding.And White isn't wearing rose-colored glasses when he looks at internet names either. Netflix (NFLX), for instance, ""is on the right side of (technological) change and can get bigger and more profitable,"" he said. But he has trimmed his stake because ""earnings are no longer sufficiently attractive in the near term for a stock (trading) around 130.""IBD'S TAKE: Netflix is No. 3 in IBD's Leisure-Movies & Related industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its very strong 90 IBD Composite Rating and two quarters of earnings per share (EPS) acceleration — stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.Even Facebook, a favorite, has a weakness. White describes the stock in terms of the four pillars that he looks for in support of each holding. Three of Facebook's get his strong scores.HCA Holdings (HCA) is a stock that White says has a better outlook than many investors think. Most recently, he thinks the market has been overly negative in the expectation that this stock will be hurt by repeal or rollback to ObamaCare. But HCA likely gets a maximum of 5% of its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from Affordable Care Act provisions, he says. In a worst-case scenario, after stripping that income away the company would still ""be attractively valued enough to warrant owning."" White said.""It's more of a value play than the average holding in my growth portfolio,"" he said. But share price has the potential to double over the next three years, he says. ""This is still a business that can compound earnings at a double-digit pace over time. There's room for a stock like that in my portfolio.""RELATED:How A Top Mutual Fund Weathers Market VolatilityWhat To Do When Your Fund Gets A New Manager

33,HCA,"Sen. John McCain almost certainly just killed TrumpCare — and gave a boost to managed-care stocks such as UnitedHealth (UNH) and Centene (CNC). The Arizona Republican declared that he couldn't ""in good conscience"" vote for the Graham-Cassidy plan to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with block grants to states.I cannot in good conscience vote for Graham-Cassidy. A bill impacting so many lives deserves a bipartisan approach. https://t.co/2sDjhw6Era pic.twitter.com/30OWezQpLg— John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) September 22, 2017The news brought a sudden turnaround in managed-care stocks, though much of that was short-lived. Shares of Centene, whose fortunes are more tied to the ObamaCare exchanges and Medicaid than any other leading insurer, vaulted into positive territory on the stock market today. After being down more than 3%, Centene shot up to gain 3%, closing with an advance of 1.6%. Dow component UnitedHealth, which had been down more than 2%, finished off 1.1%. While UnitedHealth has bailed on the exchanges, it serves about 6 million Medicaid beneficiaries. Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) both closed 0.1% higher.Hospital operator HCA Healthcare (HCA) went from near the flatline to up 0.7% after McCain's remarks, made shortly before 2 p.m. ET.The rebound in insurers and hospitals also helped the Dow industrials pare losses and the S&P 500 index to close up 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite moved to a 0.1% gain.IBD'S TAKE: Centene isn't just widely acknowledged to be the insurer to best capitalize on the ObamaCare exchanges, it's also ranked No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group based on earnings, sales and margin trends, as well as stock performance. Check out how other insurers stack up at IBD Stock Checkup. The industry group is ranked 39 of 197 based on price performance, getting a ""neutral"" grade from IBD. Breakout stock candidates are more likely to be successful if their industry group ranks among the top 40.Before McCain spoke, the Medical-Managed Care industry group was down about 5% on the week, putting in No. 194 among 197 IBD industry groups.The last-ditch repeal bill from GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy would shift ObamaCare funding to the states via block grants — through a formula that advantages states which didn't expand Medicaid, while sticking it to states that did. Including a cap on growth of per-beneficiary Medicaid subsidies, the bill would cut federal outlays by about $200 billion from 2020-2026.Congress has until Sept. 30 to pass legislation using a filibuster-proof budget reconciliation procedure that expires at the end of the fiscal year. Extending the ObamaCare-repeal effort is unlikely because it could make tax reform more difficult.RELATED:Wall Street Is Taking The Latest ObamaCare Repeal Push SeriouslyStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksObamaCare Repeal Is Dead: Here Are The 2 Big WinnersObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths

34,HCA,"TrumpCare is back and could become the law of the land next week.While the coming vote to repeal and replace ObamaCare could go either way, Wall Street is taking this latest GOP effort seriously. Investors are bailing on health insurance stocks such as UnitedHeath Group (UNH) and Centene (CNC), while hospital stocks continued to sag.The biggest ObamaCare players were the hardest hit, with Centene sinking 5.1% and Molina Healthcare (MOH) down 5.9%. Both Centene and Molina hitched their fates to ObamaCare in a significant way, as the Medicaid managed-care companies seized the opportunity to enter the individual insurance market.Both stand to be hurt if the new GOP bill from Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy can get through Congress by Sept. 30. The clock is ticking because passage depends on using budget reconciliation to avoid a Democratic filibuster. Once the 2017 budget resolution expires on the last day of the fiscal year, the GOP would have to start from scratch.While the Congressional Budget Office hasn't yet scored the bill, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that Cassidy-Graham would cut ObamaCare funding by $239 billion from 2020 through 2026, while killing the law's subsidies and sending the money to states, which would have to figure out how best to spend it, free from much of ObamaCare's regulations.On top of that, Medicaid would impose a cap on costs per beneficiary, lowering spending by $175 billion over the same span. In 2026, the total cut in funding under Cassidy-Graham would amount to $80 billion.Even insurers that don't rank as big fans of ObamaCare saw their stocks come under pressure on Tuesday. Dow component UnitedHealth slipped 1.8%, while Humana (HUM) lost 3.4% and Aetna (AET) 3.1%. UnitedHealth, Humana and Aetna all traded at or just below their 50-day moving averages, an area of key support.IBD'S TAKE: While managed-care stocks have been solid performers lately, they aren't acting well right now. Here's a good place to start to find stocks that may be setting up for near-term advances. The group of stocks that fit IBD's investing criteria on the IBD Leaderboard have outperformed the S&P 500 by 44% this year.Among hospital stocks, HCA Healthcare (HCA) fell 1.8%, close to an eight-month low, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) dipped 0.7%, losing ground for a third straight session.One stock that stands to benefit from the legislation is Healthequity (HQY), which provides technology that lets consumers manage their health savings account, whose limits would be increased under Cassidy-Graham. Shares of Healthequity rose 3.5%.Investors seem to have been caught by surprise by the sudden revival of TrumpCare's prospects. Even President Trump tweeted the other week that it was time for the GOP to move on from repealing ObamaCare and focus on tax reform.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksObamaCare Repeal Is Dead: Here Are The 2 Big WinnersObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths 
"
35,HCA,"Senate Republicans voted on Tuesday to open 20 hours of debate on repealing and replacing ObamaCare. In reality, they're not likely to do either, but they still might manage to kill off ObamaCare's individual and employer mandates.A 50-50 vote, with two Republicans opposed and Vice President Mike Pence on hand to break a tie, provided just enough to clear the bar. Yet with divisions between conservatives and moderates over how to restructure Medicaid and subsidies for buying health insurance on the individual market, it remains unlikely that Republicans will unite over either repeal or replace.But as a last-ditch strategy, the GOP may take aim at ObamaCare's two most unpopular provisions: the requirement that employers offer coverage to workers clocking at least 30 hours a week and the choice for individuals of buying coverage or paying a fine.Still, there's no certainty that even a so-called ""skinny"" plan will pass, because some moderates may fear the damage that repeal will inflict on the individual markets. Repeal of the individual mandate would increase premiums as more young and healthy opt out. Unless other fixes are offered, such as reinsurance and a legislative commitment to cost-sharing subsidies, moderates might balk. If such changes are offered, it could lose conservatives. However, the quick debate period means that there may not be time for thorough analysis.IBD'S TAKE: Big insurers like UnitedHealth and Aetna have mostly exited the ObamaCare exchanges due to losses, but one leading ObamaCare insurer has earned the No. 1 rank in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, based on earnings, revenue, margins and stock performance. Check out the top tier at IBD Stock Checkup.Major stock indexes pushed to record highs ahead of the vote to open debate. Investors may be encouraged that the GOP determination to get something passed, even if it's really skinny, will be brought to bear for corporate tax cuts by early 2018.The news came as leading ObamaCare insurer Centene (CNC) said its exchange business is performing strongly. Shares vaulted after the open but weakened throughout the session as the GOP vote neared and continued slipping. Centene closed down 1.6%.Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the nation's largest insurer, was off 0.3%. Hospital stocks including HCA Holdings (HCA) fell, but that appeared largely a reaction to HCA's earnings, which show that more care continues to move to outpatient settings. HCA sank 4.5%.RELATED:This Is How You Fix ObamaCare: Republican Principles, Democratic ValuesSenate Delays TrumpCare Vote, Pressuring Stock MarketTrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse DealUnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term Cuts 
"
36,HCA,"XTenet Healthcare (THC) and other hospitals led a broad advance in health care stocks on Thursday as Senate Republicans unveiled their own version of TrumpCare.The short takeaway, courtesy of Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick, is that the Senate bill is ""Lots Less Worse Short-Term; Lots More Worse Long-Term,"" in comparison to the House version. In particular, Medicaid spending would suffer a smaller hit in the near term, but face even bigger long-term cuts.Among hospital groups, HCA Healthcare (HCA) rose 2.5%, Tenet Healthcare jumped 6.8% and Universal Health Services (UHS) gained 1.8%.The stock performance may have even taken management by surprise. Politico published a letter Tenet sent to employees asking them to rally opposition to TrumpCare.Investors have good reason to focus more on the intermediate term, because it's always possible that the big out-year cuts could be interrupted or delayed — if Democrats make a comeback, for example. On the other hand, the sharp eventual spending cuts relative to ObamaCare could threaten the support of moderate GOP senators. NBC News was reporting that three GOP senators planned to voice their opposition to the new legislation, enough to deny passage.Managed care companies also were solidly higher on Thursday. Centene (CNC) and Molina (MOH), both big players in the ObamaCare exchanges and its Medicaid expansion, were among the better performers. Centene climbed 3.6% and Molina 2.3%. Anthem (ANTM), the biggest ObamaCare exchange insurer, rose 0.65%. Anthem said on Wednesday that it's pulling out of the ObamaCare marketplaces in Indiana and Wisconsin.Centene is among the rare companies making a profit from the exchanges, but Medicaid is a big profit driver for the industry, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), a Dow Jones industrial average component. All insurers would stand to benefit from the GOP plan to kill a tax on health insurance plans.UnitedHealth rose 0.7% to a record high, while Aetna (AET) gained 0.55% and Humana (HUM) advanced 0.3%.Skolnick's message to investors: ""Buy UNH and HCA.""Prospects of more modest health spending cuts than feared — assuming TrumpCare even passes — also lifted shares of drugmakers and biotechs. Among Dow components, Merck (MRK) rose 0.9%, Pfizer (PFE) 0.5% and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) 0.85%, with J&J notching a record high.Johnson & Johnson would also stand to benefit from the repeal of ObamaCare's tax on medical devices. Merck, which has been rallying on good news for immuno-oncology treatment Keytruda, crossed an aggressive entry and neared a conventional buy point. 
"
37,HCA,"President-elect Donald Trump said Obamacare should be repealed and replaced ""essentially simultaneously,"" weighing in on a political debate among Republican lawmakers who are grappling with how to tackle the effort.""It'll be repeal and replace. It'll be essentially simultaneously,"" Trump said Wednesday in his first press conference since the election.Trump didn't provide details of his plans for the Affordable Care Act, but indicated that his administration will present replacement proposals after his pick for Health and Human Services secretary is confirmed, a process that could take weeks. Senators are set to vote this week on an initial step to repeal Obamacare via a budget process, with a target date later this month for more detailed repeal plans. But some Republicans have become wary of doing away with the ACA before a replacement plan is ready, and called for a delay in the process.""We're going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary's approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan,"" Trump said at Trump Tower in New York. ""We're going to do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff, and we're going to get a health bill passed.""Georgia Republican Congressman Tom Price, the president-elect's pick for HHS secretary, faces a hearing next week in front of the Senate's health committee, although the key hearing for his confirmation hasn't yet been scheduled.IBD'S TAKE: Trump sickened drug and biotech stocks after accusing drugmakers of ""getting away with murder"" and calling for better bidding on prices.Trump's remarks appear to push back the timeline for action on Obamacare from comments he made Tuesday to the New York Times. He told the newspaper that a repeal vote should be held ""probably some time next week"" and that a replacement should come ""very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.""A group of five GOP senators has been working to extend the date for an initial step in the repeal process to early March from this month, to allow more time to design a replacement plan. In the House, members of the conservative Freedom Caucus want to see details about how Obamacare would be replaced before voting to begin repeal efforts.Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican who heads the Senate's health committee, said Tuesday that Obamacare should be repealed ""only when there are concrete, practical reforms in place that give Americans access to truly affordable health care."" He's proposed plans to first shore up the Affordable Care Act's existing markets, before crafting a replacement and repealing the health law.Hospital stocks rose, with Tenet Healthcare (THC) gaining 2.8% on the stock market today while Community Health Systems (CYH) climbed 4.2%. HCA Holdings (HCA), the biggest U.S. for-profit hospital chain, gained 1.2%. Industry groups have pleaded with lawmakers to ensure there's a replacement for Obamacare to cushion them if the program is repealed.Health insurer stocks posted modest declines. The health insurance industry is seeking clarity on replacement plans, the industry's main lobby group said in a statement.""The individual market has been challenged from the beginning, and now Americans want stability,"" America's Health Insurance Plans said. ""By being clear on replacement proposals now, we can take away a lot of uncertainty.""Insurers fared better than drugmakers, which plunged as Trump said he'd force the industry to bid for government business, in an effort to save the U.S. billions of dollars. The iShares Biotech ETF (IBB) tumbled 3.1% intraday. Price, the HHS nominee, has opposed efforts in the past to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices.Trump has cautioned Republicans to let Democrats take the blame for problems with Obamacare, tweeting last week, ""It will fall of its own weight - be careful!"" He reiterated that criticism during the press event, saying ""The easiest thing would be to let it implode.""Instead, Trump said, ""We're going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better.""RELATED:Trump Vows Fighter-Jet Competition, 'Big Things' On Lockheed F-35Drug Stocks Tank As Trump Vows To Attack High Drug PricesTrump Will Let Sons Run Business, Won't Divest Ownership

38,HCA,"The Senate's TrumpCare bill would add 22 million to the ranks of the uninsured, the Congressional Budget Office said on Monday.""Despite being eligible for premium tax credits, few low-income people would purchase any plan,"" CBO said, because deductibles for the plans would amount to such a high percentage of total income.CBO said that 15 million fewer people would get Medicaid coverage, while the individual market would shrink by 7 million vs. projections under current law.The analysis by the nonpartisan agency will make it hard for moderate GOP senators to support the bill. Already, Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada became the first moderate Republican to come out against the bill on Friday. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine also has said that she won't support a bill that would cost tens of millions of people their insurance.After the CBO score, Sen. Collins tweeted that she will vote no on the Senate bill.I want to work w/ my GOP & Dem colleagues to fix the flaws in ACA. CBO analysis shows Senate bill won't do it. I will vote no on mtp. 1/3— Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) June 26, 2017Republican leaders in the Senate also have gotten plenty of pushback from conservatives as they aim for a vote before Congress goes on a weeklong July 4 recess.A quick vote now looks virtually out of the question, and prospects for ultimate passage don't look great. But the Senate has some money to work with, given that its bill was judged to save $321 billion over a decade, which is $202 billion more than what the House version saves.Senate rules require that the bill save at least as much as the House to proceed under reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority to pass.Senate Republicans released an updated version of the bill Monday: People who apply for insurance in the second half of the year after a gap in coverage wouldn't see insurance come into effect until six months after an application. There was no continuous coverage provision in last week's draft.Under ObamaCare, people who go uncovered only have to wait until the following January to get coverage.Anthem (ANTM), the biggest insurer on the ObamaCare exchanges, issued a statement that offered some modest praise of the GOP bill, touting its repeal of a health insurance tax that the industry has lobbied hard to reverse.Meanwhile, Blue Shield of California warned that ""states all across the country would not be able to make up for the dramatic cuts in federal Medicaid funding and would be forced to take people off the program or to reduce benefits.""Shares of Anthem were quiet after hours on the stock market today, as were shares of other insurers like Centene (CNC) and Aetna (AET) as well as those of hospital operators like HCA (HCA) and Tenet Healthcare (THC). But the stocks rallied last week when the bill was released.RELATED:TrumpCare Is Back On Life Support: Nevada Senator Heller Slams Bill TrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse Deal  
"
39,HCA,"Republican Senator Dean Heller of Nevada just knifed TrumpCare, and it may not recover.Heller, among the relatively moderate Republicans from a state that expanded Medicaid, announced on Friday that he can't support the bill unveiled by Republican leadership a day before.Heller said that he won't vote for a bill that ""takes insurance away from tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans.""Republicans can only afford to lose two of 52 GOP senators, so Heller's strong condemnation of the bill leaves the party perched on a precipice. Already four conservative senators have threatened to oppose the bill that is facing criticism from right-wing groups.While those conservatives might be won over, that will be now harder to do without support for the bill giving way in the center.If there's a surprise, it's that Heller, who is up for re-election in 2018, voiced his opposition even before the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis of the bill's impact early next week. Most GOP senators were keeping a low profile ahead of that report, perhaps holding out hope that the increase in the ranks of the uninsured wouldn't compare to the 23 million figure CBO attached to the TrumpCare bill that squeaked through the House.A handful of GOP moderate senators had pushed for a slower phaseout of the Medicaid expansion. Among those voicing concern have been Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rob Portman of Ohio. Their response to the coming CBO report could be influenced by Heller's strong stand, because it's hard to be the first Republican to oppose the bill as being too far to the right.On the other hand, being the deciding vote that dooms TrumpCare might be even harder. For now, while there is conservative opposition, it may be safer for moderates to oppose the bill.On Thursday, as details of the bill emerged, Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief, pushing up a broad range of health care-sector stocks, including insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH), hospital group HCA Healthcare (HCA) and drugmaker Merck (MRK). UnitedHealth and Merck are both Dow Jones industrial average components. Shares of HCA and Medicaid-focused insurer Centene (CNC) pushed higher late in Friday's session, as investors possibly began to price in lower odds of TrumpCare's passage.The apparent reason health care stocks rose on Thursday was that, as Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick put it, the Senate bill wasn't as bad as the House's in the intermediate term because of a slower phaseout of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. Some on Wall Street may have been thinking, like conservative critics of the senate TrumpCare bill, that those out-year Medicaid cuts may never happen.On Friday, markets didn't react much to news of the first moderate GOP senator coming out against the bill. Back in March, when TrumpCare appeared doomed in the House, markets stumbled, with Wall Street strategists marking down their expectations for the rest of President Trump's agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. While those expectations have come down a ways, a lot of market strategists are still factoring in a modest tax cut to 2018 earnings expectations. That means TrumpCare may take center stage in the coming week and there could be some volatility ahead.RELATED:TrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse DealUnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term CutsTrumpCare Lives: House Passes ObamaCare Repeal Bill

40,HCA,"Quest Diagnostics' (DGX) partnerships with Optum and Safeway (SWY), as well as opportunities it is pursuing with IBM (IBM) Watson and Ancestry.com, garnered the stock a price-target boost Tuesday.In the stock market today, Quest stock rose 0.6% to 92.45, after earlier rising as much as 1.6%. Shares have traded above their 50-day moving average for seven weeks. Quest stock closed 2016 up 29%.UBS analyst A.J. Rice kept his buy rating on Quest stock and upped his price target to 102 from 90.Rice expects Quest's partnership with Optum will help the firm curb its bad-debt expense and its uncompensated care. Optum agreed to manage Quest's revenue services, including billing, in a pact announced in September.IBD'S TAKE: Medtech-companies like Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Edwards Lifesciences are seeing rivalries heat up as companies lay down their cards for 2017.Quest inked major deals with HCA in Denver and with RWJ Barnabas Health in New Jersey in late 2015 and 2016, respectively. Quest has also made inroads with its partnership with grocery chain Safeway, and now aims to put more than 200 patient service centers (PSCs) in Safeway stores by the end of 2017.Beyond those specific opportunities, Quest is looking to work with IBM's Watson supercomputer unit on a project related to tumor sequencing, and with Ancestry.com to improve health care decision-making based on family medical histories, Rice wrote in a research report.Rice estimates 3% sales growth in 2017, just below the midpoint of Quest's guidance for 3%-5% growth this year. RELATED:Quest 'Turnaround' Follows Management Shake-up, Flat 2015 SalesMyriad Genetics Stock Craters As Competition Surprises Wall Street

41,HCA,"The coming presidency of Donald Trump and the near-certain prospect he will try to unravel President Obama's Affordable Care Act sent shares of hospital stocks into cardiac arrest in Wednesday trading, while major insurers were mixed and drug wholesalers enjoyed a revival.Most of the nation's biggest hospital operators plunged by double digits, led by the likes of Tenet Healthcare (THC) and troubled Community Health Systems (CYH). Tenet stock lost a quarter of its value, dropping to 15.21. Community plummeted by 21.6% to 4.66.The nation's biggest hospital company, HCA Holdings (HCA), fell nearly 11% to 72.16, while LifePoint Health (LPNT) plunged 13.5% to 52.80. Universal Health Services' (UHS) drop was paltry by comparison, 6.9%, but still that gouged nearly $9 out of its shares, bringing it to 119.26.Hospitals are expected to take the brunt of an expected drop in federal health care funding. The demise of the ACA, commonly known as ObamaCare, could leave millions of Americans uninsured and unable to pay for hospitalization, thus cutting into the profits of major health care facilities' operators.Mizuho Securities analysts Sheryl Skolnick and Ann Hynes said in a note to clients that Trump's victory, along with Republicans managing to retain control of the House and Senate, does not bode well for health care companies.""(A) GOP Triple Play, the worst possible outcome for (health care) stocks, is a reality,"" the analysts said in a note to clients. ""We see extreme risk of ACA repeal-replace, loss of the Medicaid expansion, a primary driver of results for both hospitals and health plans, and reversal of the many value-based regulations that promote home health care.""Insurers, however, were beginning to cut ties with the ambitious health-coverage plan even before Trump's surprise victory in Tuesday's election, so the effect on them was mixed. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares were down fractionally to 141.90 while Aetna (AET) jumped 4.7% to 118.02. Anthem (ANTM) was down early but swung to a gain of 1.5% to close at 128.75. Cigna (CI) shares jumped 5.5% to 135.80.Humana (HUM) surged nearly 4% to 186 as it seems the carrier's Medicare-heavy business would be largely shielded from any ObamaCare repercussions.Drug wholesalers reveled in Trump's election as it appeared they — along with pharmaceutical companies — would bask in a more pressure-free environment now that Democrat Hillary Clinton has been dispatched. Clinton had vowed to combat exorbitant drug pricing.McKesson (MCK), which fell sharply late last month on a disappointing earnings report, recovered some of that in Wednesday trading. Shares surged 8.6% to close at 141.68. The rapture extended to its main rivals, as AmerisourceBergen (ABC) also jumped more than 9.5% to 75.61 and Cardinal Health (CAH) climbed nearly 6% tp 69.25.
"
42,HCA,"Three of the nation's biggest four hospital chains took diverging paths Thursday as the fortunes of Community Health Systems (CYH) continued to diminish — its shares free falling by 50% in afternoon trades — while the stock of HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) climbed on positive earnings reports.Community Health, based in a suburb of Nashville, Tenn., projected a loss for the third quarter and said it sees revenue down for the period. The quarterly loss is expected to be $83 million, swinging from a gain of $121 million for the same quarter a year ago. Revenue is expected to hit $4.38 billion, down from the $4.85 billion from the third quarter of 2015.Community Health has been struggling since it joined the ranks of the top hospital chains in 2014 with its acquisition of Health Management Associates and its 71 hospitals. Community Health shares did climb to an intraday peak of 53.50 in June 2015 but have plummeted since, and now are down roughly 91% from that precipice.Community Health shares gapped down 50% to close at 5.05 on the stock market today, a new low. Community Health said last month it was exploring the possibility of a sale of its assets, but it's unclear whether any hospital chain will or can absorb the company and its 158 hospitals.Analysts say HCA, based in Nashville not far from Community Health, can ill afford to take on the assets of its rival, whose hospital count is close to that of HCA's 169 facilities. HCA also has 117 free-standing surgery centers.Plus, HCA seems to have few issues with profitability. The company said Thursday that adjusted net income was $618 million, or $1.59 a share, compared with $449 million, or $1.05 a share, for the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.42 a share for the period.HCA shares closed up 0.5% at 79.31.Universal Health, meanwhile, reported income of $1.60 a share, compared with $1.53 a year ago. Revenue climbed 8.2% to $2.41 billion from $2.23 billion for the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.69 a share on sales of $2.4 billion. But the company raised the lower level of its full-year earnings estimate, which it narrowed to a range of $7.16 to $7.43 a share. Shares rose 2.7% to 122.35.Finally, the other hospital in the quartet of big chains, Tenet Healthcare (THC), is due to report next week. Shares lost 4.2% in trading Thursday.

Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Martin Marietta (MLM) each swept 10% higher. Martin Marietta gapped out of a cup-shaped base with a 206.46 buy point. Vulcan gapped out of a cup-shaped base with a 127.30 buy point. Both stocks were still in buy range in early trading.Early gainers in the IBD 50 included HealthEquity (HQY) and Eagle Materials (EXP) with gains of around 9%.

Vulcan Materials (VMC) vaulted 11% and Martin Marietta (MLM) 9%. Martin Marietta topped the 206.46 buy point in a cup base. Vulcan also broke out, clearing a 206.46 buy point.In earnings news, TripAdvisor (TRIP) swooned 16% after reporting third-quarter earnings narrowly topped views, but a 1% revenue gain stopped far short of analyst expectations.Fragrance maker Coty (COTY) plunged 13% after missing analysts' fiscal first-quarter revenue and earnings targets by wide margins.GoPro (GPRO) tanked 6% as a handful of analysts downgraded the stock after news it would recall on its Karma Drone due to battery failure issues.On the IBD 50 list, Eagle Materials (EXP) popped off a near-8% gain.

45,HCA,"XThe stock market closed mixed Thursday after a late wave of selling erased much of the day's work.The Nasdaq, which had been up 0.4%, closed less than 0.1% higher. The S&P 500 wiped out a modest 0.2% gain to close a fraction lower.The Dow Jones industrial average fell less than 0.1%. Medical companies Merck (MRK), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pfizer (PFE), UnitedHealth (UNH) were four of the five best Dow components.Small caps performed better, with the Russell 2000 climbing 0.4%.The downward reversals certainly were not encouraging, but volume was lower across the board, according to preliminary data. That suggested that institutional investors did not sell in massive quantities. Also, the negative reversals were not severe in scale.Senate Republicans unveiled their own version of legislation to replace ObamaCare, and investors seemed to like what it could mean for the health care sector. Medical software, drug wholesalers, managed care and several other medical-sector industry groups were among the day's best performing, rising 0.7% to 2.2%.HealthSouth (HLS) broke out of a base-on-base pattern, closing above the 47.99 buy point. Volume was below average, which dampened an otherwise bullish move. Shares rose 3%.Hologic (HOLX) broke out of a flat base, rising past a 46.15 buy point. But it also suffered from weak volume. The relative strength line is at a new high, which backs the breakout. Two days ago, the company said it won FDA approval for its Aptima herpes treatment.Bankrate (RATE) had better volume as it broke out of a pattern with a buy point at 12.05. Volume was about 70% above average as the stock added 1.7%.On the downside, Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC) gapped down to a loss of 3%. In an SEC filing, the company said it priced an offering of 10 million shares, but did not specify the price. It also said in the filing that average sales per community for the two months ended May 31 was 2.9 homes per month vs.  2.2 in the same period in 2016, up 31.8%. Net sales orders for the same two months rose 24.3% and it expects home closings for the quarter ending June 30 to be about 1,800.RELATED:UnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term Cuts2 Key Stock Index Plays In Buy Range As Biotechs Surge Again

46,HCA,"The stock market held its gains in afternoon trading Monday, as the Nasdaq made a favorable move on its chart.The Nasdaq rose 0.6% and was inching back above its 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq 100 looked better as it jumped 0.6% and separated itself a bit above its own 50-day line. The index of the 100 largest nonfinancial Nasdaq listings never went below the 50-day average last week.Netflix (NFLX), one of the largest Nasdaq components, was up 3% in the highest volume on Stocks On The Move. The video streaming company announces results after the close today.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were also up 0.6% each, although both remained below their 50-day averages, meaning there's still reason to be suspicious about a rebound in the market.Volume was tracking lower, which was a surprise given that the prior session's trading slowed ahead of the three-day weekend. Also curious was the fact that only a few stocks were up in heavy volume.Homebuilders continued to provide some interesting charts. D.R. Horton (DHI) was trying to break out past the 34.15 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. But both the price and volume activity was insufficient to view today's move as a rush of institutional buying. The relative strength line is not near a new high, which is another damper on the potential entry.Homebuilders have shot up to the top 10 of IBD's 197 industry rankings from below 50 six weeks ago. William Lyon Homes (WLH) and CalAtlantic Group (CAA) also are forming cup-with-handle bases and could be researched further.Health care stocks were mixed as pharmaceuticals and hospitals tumbled for a variety of reasons.HCA Holdings (HCA) slid 3% in about double its usual volume, breaking below the 50-day moving average. The hospital operator gave preliminary first-quarter results today, reporting sales of $10.623 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Earnings per share rose 2% to $1.74. The numbers were below expectations.IBD's hospital industry group was the worst performing in today's market. HCA is 6% below its 52-week high, but others are more than 20% below it.Baxter International (BAX) fell 1% in active trading but remained in a price advance that has taken the stock to record highs. Reports said the U.S. Justice Department is investigating sales practices of intravenous saline, including those sold by Baxter.Abiomed (ABMD), which makes the Impella heart pump, gapped down to a loss of 3.5% in big volume. The stock, which has been forming a base, fell to its 50-day line. There was no news on the wires.Among pharmaceuticals, Eli Lilly (LLY) and Incyte (INCY) plunged below their 50-day lines in heavy volume after the FDA declined to approve their rheumatoid arthritis drug, saying more clinical trials are necessary.RELATED:Eli Lilly, Incyte Stocks Break Key Levels After FDA Drug SetbackNetflix Earnings After The Close: What To Expect

48,HCA,"U.S. stock indexes posted moderate gains Wednesday afternoon, and the Nasdaq touched a new 52-week high but backed off slightly from the peak.The Nasdaq was up 0.6%, holding near its new high. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average spurted 0.7% and 0.8% respectively. Volume was running emphatically higher on both major exchanges.The bullish action raised legitimate questions on whether or not the pressure was off the uptrend. To answer that question, wait to see how and where the Nasdaq closes.The strength of the market involved a mix of groups Wednesday afternoon. The day's leaders, and strong performers within the group, included transportation equipment (Greenbrier (GBX), up 12%), oil and gas royalty trusts (BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (BPT) up 5% and with a dividend yield of 11%), restaurants (Panera Bread (PNRA) on merger news), hospitals (HCA Holdings (HCA), up 1.5%) and construction mining equipment (Caterpillar (CAT), up 1.8%).Most of the winners had a story to tell.Railcar provider Greenbrier reported quarterly results, beating analysts' consensus views on revenue and earnings. RailwayAge magazine reported that Greenbrier won a new railcar lease agreement worth $1 billion. The company also raised its quarterly dividend from 21 cents to 22 cents a share.The oil royalty trust stocks have advanced with the recent price increase of crude oil. Light sweet crude notched a low of $47.01 a barrel March 22 and then rose about 9% to more than $51 a barrel. The oil royalty group popped almost 10% in the same period.Panera Bread is now sitting on startling gains since breaking out Feb. 8 after a stronger-than-expected earnings report. The gap-up buy point at the open that day was 220.59. With Wednesday's news that private equity firm JAB Holdings would buy the midcap restaurant chain, Panera's stock zoomed 13% higher and is now 41% above the gap-up entry.IBD'S TAKE: If the right conditions are met, the gap-up gain is one of the least risky stocks an investor can buy.HCA and the hospital stock group fell 8% and 10% respectively in the run-up to the RyanCare no vote. The bill was pulled without a vote March 24. Since then, the hospital stocks have trimmed about half the pullback. The Republicans are trying to unite the party behind a new attempt to repeal ObamaCare. The likelihood of success remains unclear.Caterpillar rolled 2% higher Tuesday and 1.8% Wednesday afternoon. The construction and mining equipment group is a laggard, but Caterpillar is only 3% off its high as it works on a shallow pattern.In economic news, the ADP employment report for March obliterated the Street's consensus number. The payroll increase reached 263,000, or 55% more than expected. The number was also about a third higher than the highest estimate in the range.On the downside, the PMI Services Index rolled in at 52.8 vs. expectations for 53.8. The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index also missed — 55.2 vs. views for 57. The Institute for Supply Management surveys 375 firms, while the PMI surveys more than 400 companies.RELATED:Think The Chips Are Done? Check Out These ChartsJobs Data Gives Boosts To Small Caps, ETFs

49,HCA,"Here's the big problem facing the new Senate TrumpCare bill: Almost everybody gets a worse deal.For all the grave faults of the bill that passed the House, it did address a couple of ObamaCare's sore spots, raising the cutoff limit for subsidies and providing more support to moderate income young adults.But if you crunch the numbers on the Senate plan, the surprising thing is how hard it is to find anyone who might pay less for a TrumpCare plan than they would for a roughly equivalent ObamaCare bronze plan.Almost everyone at least 30 years old gets a worse deal. Almost everyone earning below 225% of the poverty level — including those under 30 — gets a worse deal. And people earning more than 350% of the poverty level — the new subsidy cutoff at about $42,000 for singles — get a worse deal.This is both a political and actuarial problem. The political problem is that the Republicans have spent seven years criticizing ObamaCare for high premiums, huge deductibles and a hit to the middle class, but the GOP would make those problems worse for almost everyone. As Reason's Peter Suderman put it, ""The Senate GOP's New Health Care Bill Is Just ObamaCare, But Less Of It.""While it's impossible to overstate how determined Republicans are to repeal ObamaCare — at least its tax increases and mandates — the actuarial problem is what might prove to be the bill's undoing, sending the GOP back to the drawing board and keeping the rest of President Trump's agenda on hold.Investors' initial reaction to the Senate TrumpCare bill was more or less positive, at least for the health care sector. Shares of insurers like UnitedHealth Group (UNH), hospital operators like HCA Healthcare (HCA) and drugmakers like Merck (MRK) all rose as the bill was unveiled on Thursday. (UnitedHealth and Merck are both members of the Dow Jones industrial average.)But the last thing Wall Street wants is for TrumpCare to turn into a quagmire, exhausting the narrow legislative window available for corporate tax cuts and infrastructure spending.IBD'S TAKE: Find out why Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief when Republican Senate leaders disclosed their TrumpCare bill and why one analyst emailed out this advice to clients: ""Buy UNH and HCA.""Just how big of a rewrite challenge the GOP faces will be clear after the Congressional Budget Office releases its analysis of the Senate's officially named Better Care Reconciliation Act early next week. But there's reason to think it may be pretty severe.Consider that, all else equal except subsidies, a 30-year-old earning about 250% of the poverty level would owe about $1,700 for a bronze-type plan this year under the Senate TrumpCare bill, after subsidies — almost exactly the same as the cost under ObamaCare this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation subsidy calculator. Yet this same plan would have cost only about $300 under the House GOP's American Health Care Act (including age-rating changes), based on an IBD analysis.Here's why this is a big deal: The House plan only managed to lower average premiums by 4%, per CBO, because it dramatically shifted the landscape in favor of relatively young, moderate income adults, while slashing support for older adults. The average plan cost less because young people were priced into the market, as older people were priced out of it.Brookings Institution researchers Matthew Fielder and Loren Adler calculate that the underlying increase in the cost of insurance under the House plan was 13%, but that was obscured because of the demographic shift in the covered population, among other factors.That underlying 13% premium hike is a function of expected adverse selection, triggered by the Republicans killing off ObamaCare's individual mandate. Without a mandate, the relatively young and healthy aren't going to be willing to pay much for insurance that comes with the roughly $7,000 deductibles likely under TrumpCare. The bottom line is that the Senate bill, because it does quite a bit less to price the relatively young and healthy into the market, and less to price older and low-income households out of it, may well show a net increase in premiums.A wild card will be CBO's analysis of the Senate TrumpCare bill's impact on premiums in states that opt to waive certain ObamaCare rules. That would let states increase the allowable ratio between premiums for older and younger adults, raise out-of-pocket limits, or eliminate mandatory benefits such as maternity care and substance abuse services.If the Senate bill can't stack up to ObamaCare when it comes to premiums, that would be a killer because TrumpCare's most glaring problem is that it makes ObamaCare deductibles look minuscule. That's especially true for low-income individuals who benefit from ObamaCare's extra cost-sharing subsidies that limit out-of-pocket spending on medical bills.For a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level ($23,500), the good news is that their premiums will only cost 4% of income, about $1,000, same as ObamaCare. The bad news is that instead of facing a maximum of about $2,000 in additional bills for health spending, they'll have a combined deductible of roughly $14,000.Because the bill guts ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion, millions of people earning about the poverty level or even less will have to get coverage via the individual market. The problem isn't so much that they'll have to a pay a premium equal to about 2% of income, but they'll have $7,000 deductibles equal to more than half their income.John Graves, assistant professor of health policy at Vanderbilt School of Medicine, tweeted: ""Whereas the AHCA (House bill) would cause more uninsurance, my strong sense is the BCRA (Senate bill) will be more about underinsurance.""In other words, it's possible that CBO's analysis will predict a much smaller increase in the uninsured than the 23 million seen under the House bill.But, if a lot more people sign up for high-deductible coverage, including the influx of displaced Medicaid beneficiaries, and premiums rise due to adverse selection, that could create another problem. The Senate bill would implement automatic subsidy cuts if total individual market subsidies exceed 0.4% of GDP, a much lower cap than under ObamaCare.RELATED:UnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term CutsIBD's No. 1-Ranked Insurer Just Gave ObamaCare A Big HugTrumpCare Lives: House Passes ObamaCare Repeal BillHow To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social Security

50,HCA,"TrumpCare isn't going to pass, the U.S. economy won't get a Trump-fueled bounce and the S&P 500 index will end the year at 2400, slightly lower than current levels, Goldman Sachs analysts said on Wednesday.A day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scrapped plans for a TrumpCare vote this week amid growing opposition, Goldman political analyst Alec Phillips concluded, ""At this point, enactment of broad health legislation like the House passed or the Senate is contemplating seems unlikely.""Although financial markets slumped on Tuesday, with a late bout of selling after the TrumpCare news, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all recorded solid gains in Wednesday trading intraday, with technology stocks bouncing after bearing the brunt of the prior day's sell-off.The good news from Goldman is that, unlike in March, when markets dove as prospects for ObamaCare repeal dimmed in the House, investor confidence in the ability of the Trump administration and the GOP Congress to push through sweeping legislation has already been wounded.Bank stocks rallied for a third straight day on Wednesday amid a rise in Treasury yields and good news on their stress tests. (Investors expect positive results and shareholder returns approved in the second round of stress test results late Wednesday.)Bank of America (BAC) climbed 2.6% and Wells Fargo (WFC) 2.2%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rose 2% to 89.82, breaking out of a double-bottom base buy point of 89.23. That's a big change from how bank stocks behaved when TrumpCare suffered its first big setback in March, with Wells Fargo sliding 3% on March 21, JPMorgan Chase almost 6% and Bank of America nearly 6%.""At this stage, it seems fairly clear that intraparty disputes and a thin margin in the Senate have made sweeping reforms difficult,"" so there's unlikely to be an significant market fallout, Phillips wrote.Hospital stocks, which could suffer from the steep cuts in Medicaid and a rise in the uninsured projected under TrumpCare, were among the leaders on Wednesday. Universal Health Services (UHS) rose 2%, HCA Healthcare (HCA) 1.1% and Tenet Healthcare (THC) 3%.Insurers were broadly, though modestly, higher, with UnitedHealth Group (UNH) rising 0.6%. UnitedHealth, a Dow industrials component like JPMorgan, has mostly exited the ObamaCare exchanges. But UnitedHealth is a big player in the Medicaid managed care market, which could be stunted by TrumpCare. On the other hand, TrumpCare would kill off a health insurance tax, a priority for UnitedHealth and other insurers.IBD'S TAKE: IBD revised the market trend to ""uptrend under pressure"" on Tuesday, a status that means investors should exercise extra caution in buying stocks and consider taking profits to raise cash for when the turbulence clears. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to get the latest on the market trend and what it means for your investing.The less encouraging news from Goldman is that there's not much reason for investors to be excited about prospects for the broader market or economy over the next several years. Goldman's chief equity strategist, David Kostin, raised his year-end target for the S&P 500 to 2400 from 2300, but that's about 1% below Tuesday's close. He sees dismal returns in the next two years as ""late-cycle dynamics"" yield positive but decelerating sales and earnings growth. His year-end targets for 2018 and 2019 are 2500 and 2600, respectively.Goldman now sees GDP growth of 2.1% this year, 2.2% next and 1.7% in 2019.The possible silver lining in Kostin's outlook is that he's not assuming any reduction in the corporate tax rate, so there's room for an upside surprise. In that respect, his outlook seems more or less consistent with that of David Bianco, chief investment strategist in the Americas for Deutsche Asset Management, who wrote recently that the S&P should trade at 2450 — but only ""upon clear signs of a significant and simple corporate tax cut"" to a 25% rate.The potential problem is that the legislative lift doesn't get any lighter after health care. This week, the House set aside plans to release a fiscal 2018 budget resolution as conservatives and moderates butted heads over whether to require $200 billion in entitlement savings. Doing so, moderates warned, could make tax cuts much harder to pass.RELATED:Senate Delays TrumpCare Vote, Pressuring Stock MarketJPMorgan, Bank Of America Lead Bank Rally Amid Strong Payout HopesTrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse DealUnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term Cuts

51,HCA,"HealthEquity (HQY) is open ""every hour every day"" — a pledge with which co-founder and Vice Chairman Steve Neeleman is familiar after spending a chunk of his career running a Utah airline.The airline world generally embraces the concept of putting customers first, he says, but health care often treats them like an afterthought.""You couldn't call your health plan after 6 p.m. at night,"" Neeleman told Investor's Business Daily. ""If you called after 6 p.m., you kind of got the runaround. You could go to an (emergency room) after 6 p.m. That's what a lot of people did because they couldn't get anyone on the phone.""So Neeleman founded HealthEquity in 2002 on the concept of consumer-driven health care, which he researched in the early 2000s as a faculty member at the University of Arizona. There, he came across what were then known as medical savings accounts. This would allow patients to develop long-term savings accounts that they could take into retirement, similar to a 401(k) or an IRA, and often accompany health insurance.""It just made so much sense to me,"" he said. ""Every time I would talk to one of my doctor colleagues, I would say to them, 'Hey, what if you could have a health plan that would provide real coverage for major events, but for routine stuff you could pay for it out of your own pocket?' ""Eventually the concept also made sense to the medical arena and to the U.S. government. And in 2004, health savings accounts made their way to the market.Ultimately, HealthEquity went public in 2014. Since then, its stock has grown 260% from its initial public offering at 14. Shares now trade near the 50 mark. The stock began consolidating in January and, on June 6, broke out after hitting a 49.35 buy point. Shares have retreated slightly and were down fractionally to 49.21 in recent action.Year to date, HealthEquity stock is up 24.5%, outperforming its 28-company Commercial Services-Outsourcing industry group, which has risen just 2.7% over the same time period. Shares of its biggest rival, WageWorks (WAGE), are down 8.4% since January.Today, HealthEquity owns about 13% of the market in health savings accounts, or HSAs, says Cornelio Ash, an analyst for William O'Neil & Co., a sister company to Investor's Business Daily. The HSA market is poised to outgrow the 401(k) boom that the retirement market saw in the 1980s, he says.The 401(k) market ""went from billions after about five years and grew at a 21% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) for the first 10 years,"" he told IBD. ""It exploded. Now, it's no surprise to see over $13 trillion in 401(k)s as of 2015.""Already the HSA market is outperforming historical growth of the 401(k) market. The HSA market grew at a 36% compound annual growth rate between 2006 and 2016, and is expected to be worth $44 billion by year's end, he said. Ash expects political trends to drive HealthEquity and WageWorks.Under bills in the House and Senate, HSA contribution limits could increase to $6,550 from $3,440 for individuals and to $13,100 from $6,750 for families, Ash says. Consumers are also embracing the concept, angling to have better control over their health care destinies, he said.Another proposal in the Senate version of the American Health Care Act could expand HSA eligibility to include additional plans with large out-of-pocket expenses not currently included in deductibles. That could expand health plan coverage by 10 million, Oppenheimer analyst Mohan Naidu said in a June 9 note to clients.HealthEquity ""is well situated to take advantage of favorable regulatory changes and the current health care cost shift toward consumers,"" Naidu said. ""The one constant appears to be the push to give ownership to consumers along with the first-dollar responsibility through tax-advantaged accounts such as HSAs.""Even without Washington's help, the HSA market is still poised for 18%-20% growth through 2018, though that could be as high as 25% if contribution limits are lifted, Ash said. The biggest challenge for the market is helping consumers understand the benefits.Neeleman acknowledges the uphill education battle facing HealthEquity and its peers. Health insurance plans with copays and deductibles have been around for decades, he said. It's hard to break consumers of that mindset.HSAs are meant to work in conjunction with a health insurance plan, Neeleman said. Most consumers, though, can afford to pay for low-cost prescriptions and some checkups out of pocket, instead saving their pre-tax HSA dollars for big medical expenses. The HSA concept was — and for some remains — ""a shock.""""People were not used to it, even though that's the way the rest of our lives are,"" he said. ""If you have homeowner's insurance or renter's insurance, you're not turning in claims for a broken window. You're just paying for it even though it could cost a couple hundred dollars.""There's a wide variety of uses for an HSA, for everything from artificial limbs to bandages and a plethora of items in between. In many cases the patient needs a doctor's note, Neeleman says. But he points out that HSAs can also be used as quasi-retirement accounts. If you've not used the money by age 65, you can take it out like a 401(k).That was a hard sell when HealthEquity first got started. Even HealthEquity's employees couldn't always wrap their heads around it, Neeleman says. They included former pharmaceutical sales reps, customer service experts and even one experienced tire salesman. They all had trouble with it.""Education is so critical and it's so hard to get people to change their mindset,"" he said. ""Any time you have a brand new product in the market, it's hard to continue to galvanize your team. There were some people who said, 'Ah, this will never work out,' and left. That was a big mistake.""IBD'S TAKE: HealthEquity stock provides a strong example of why recommitting capital on a wild equity sometimes pays off. Head to Investor's Corner for a closer look at when it's safe to get back in on a stock after it dives below its buy point.Since its beginnings as an HSA provider, HealthEquity has expanded the plethora of accounts that it offers to include flexible spending accounts, health reimbursement arrangements and health incentive accounts. Recently, it began expanding into 401(k)s via its acquisition of BenefitGuard.The BenefitGuard acquisition allows HealthEquity to pair 401(k) accounts with HSAs, Oppenheimer's Naidu said in his note to clients. With retirement information on hand, the firm can crunch the numbers to offer better savings to its customers, he said.HealthEquity also partners with 20 of the top 50 largest health plans in the country and 500 employers across the nation, Neeleman said. In the recent fiscal quarter ended April 30, HealthEquity pulled in $55.4 million in sales, growing 28% vs. the prior quarter, and hitting 2.8 million HSA members.But HealthEquity is facing a tough battle — with itself. Sales growth slowed for the fourth consecutive quarter, to 26% in the first fiscal quarter ended April 30.HSA membership growth hit 2.8 million in that period, but decelerated for the fifth straight quarter, running to 27% growth.Neeleman and Ash say HealthEquity is still outgrowing the broader HSA market, which includes rivals like WageWorks, Webster Financial (WBS) and OptumHealth, a subsidiary under UnitedHealth Group (UNH). The market grew about 20% in the first quarter of the calendar year, Neeleman says.""It's getting harder (for HealthEquity) to beat,"" O'Neil's Ash said. ""But we're so, so in the early days of this. To take the baseball example, we're not even in the first or second inning. It (the HSA market) is still so small.""RELATED:This Health Savings Company Just Beat Profit ExpectationsUnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term Cuts
"
52,HCA,"Spending on health care services surged a greater-than-expected 6.9%, or $37.1 billion, from a year ago in the second quarter, according to Census Bureau data released Thursday. The acceleration in spending growth is a worrying sign after a period of moderating growth that followed an ObamaCare-fueled rise amid Medicaid and individual-market coverage expansions.The obvious concern is that the latest surge isn't tied to more people getting coverage, but to faster per-person cost growth.The Altarum Institute, which tracks health spending, had expected a 5.3% year-over-year rise in spending on health services, equal to the year-over-year growth in the first quarter and consistent with a gradually moderating trend.The surprising re-acceleration in spending, if sustained, could create more headaches for the health care sector, which has already felt rising political heat due to drug pricing and spiraling premiums for ObamaCare exchange coverage.Democrats are pushing a government insurance option competing alongside private insurers as UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have pulled back from the non-group insurance market. Higher spending growth also could step up the pace at which the ObamaCare-created Independent Payment Advisory Board will have to propose cost cuts to restrain Medicare's growth. Meanwhile, both presidential candidates have talked about letting Medicare negotiate drug prices, and Hillary Clinton has been quick to capitalize on the drug-pricing controversy, leading criticism of Mylan (MYL) for its EpiPen price hike.Political risk in a hard-to-predict election year has helped make health care the worst-performing of the eleven major S&P 500 sectors this year, with just a 1% gain, investment strategist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research noted earlier this week. ""The sector has been haunted by controversy over egregious drug pricing, insurers pulling out of ObamaCare, and some disappointing news on the new drug front,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Overall, health care has lagged other stock sectors this year, but there have been plenty of health-related winners, including Intuitive Surgical, Veeva Systems and Healthequity. IBD helps investors identify the best stocks — before they stage a breakout. IBD writes about the best investment candidates in features such as The New America  and includes them in lists such as the IBD 50 and Sector Leaders. IBD also will even help you find the best buy point and teach you rules for selling.The 6.9% in spending on health care services reported in the Census' Quarterly Service Survey easily eclipsed the year-over-year growth reported since the recession — with one exception. The first quarter of 2015 saw 7.7% growth in health services spending, but that reflected the ObamaCare enrollment gains that, partly due to the HealthCare.gov technology glitch, didn't noticeably begin to push up health expenses until the second half of 2014. The services report doesn't detail prescription drug spending or health insurance spending.Hospital revenue jumped 6.6% from a year ago to $272 billion, even as the number of inpatient days dipped 0.1%. Meanwhile, hospital expenses on labor, supplies and overhead rose a more moderate 5.4%, signaling increased profitability. In this case, though, improvement is due to the tax-exempt sector. For-profit hospitals, such as those run by Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA), actually saw expense growth (10.3%) outpace revenue growth (8.3%). Yet for-profit hospitals still have higher profit margins than the tax-exempt sector.Spending on ambulatory care services jumped 7.3% from a year ago to $244.3 billion. Within that category, outpatient care center spending rose 9.2% and home health care services 6.8%. Medical and diagnostic labs showed relatively slow 2.7% growth. Spending at nursing and residential care facilities rose 6.3%.Overall, spending on health care services accounted for about 26% of total growth in services spending. That makes six straight quarters in which health care has accounted for at least one-fourth of the total growth in year-over-year services spending — twice as big of a share of growth as that seen as recently as the second quarter of 2014.
"
53,HCA,"Shares of Community Health Systems (CYH) plummeted by nearly a third in Tuesday trading, a day after the hospital operator spooked Wall Street with a surprise fourth-quarter loss and its second straight quarterly miss.Community Health's shares gapped down 22.1% on the stock market today, hitting their lowest levels since 2008 intraday after the for-profit hospital chain posted a loss instead of an expected gain when it reported during the President's Day holiday Monday. Patient volume slumped as an abnormally mild winter led to a decrease in admissions and as well as in visits related to the flu and respiratory illness.LifePoint Hospitals (LPNT) also reported on Monday, with earnings topping views and revenue falling short. Lifepoint Hospitals stock fell 5.7% on Tuesday, sinking intraday to the lowest since May 2014. HCA (HCA) stock  closed down 0.6%, ending near session highs. HCA reported late last month.Franklin, Tenn.-based Community Health posted a fourth-quarter loss of 28 cents a share, excluding certain items. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of 95 cents a share. Operating revenue slipped 2.4% to $4.798 billion, short of analysts' forecasts for $4.986 billion.It was the second straight quarter the hospital operator missed earnings and revenue forecasts.Why the stock slump?""They missed two quarters in a row, in Q3 and again in Q4,"" Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut told IBD. ""They guided EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for all of 2016, in line with consensus. But given the two straight misses, it was hard for the Street to believe the EBITDA guidance right off the bat without any track record or proof.""Volume, he added, ""was the No. 1 culprit"" in terms of why the quarter came in lower than expected.""The results for the fourth quarter of 2015 were affected by a number of factors, including volume weakness compared with a strong fourth quarter a year ago, when we experienced higher emergency room visits and admissions attributed to respiratory illness and the flu,""  Chairman and Chief Executive Wayne Smith said in a press release.Total admissions declined 3.6% from a year earlier. Total adjusted admissions were down 1.5%. On a same-facility basis, admissions decreased 3.4%, and adjusted admissions slipped 1.2%.
"
54,HCA,"TrumpCare is officially undead.The White House is giving new life to the push to repeal and replace ObamaCare with a move to win over the conservative House holdouts who sank the American Health Care Act late last month. A new vote might come as early as this week.For investors hopeful that President Trump will provide the promised fiscal fuel that sparked the postelection rally in the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite, the U-turn back into the treacherous politics of ObamaCare repeal isn't encouraging news.The Dow was barely positive in afternoon trading, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were modestly lower. The broad market uptrend remains under pressure as bank stocks, among the big winners in the Trump rally based on prospects for tax cuts, faster growth and higher interest rates, have fallen below their 50-day moving averages. Most banks were lower on the stock market today, including Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC).Hospital stocks and Medicaid-focused insurers, which had bounced back from a TrumpCare-inspired sell-off when it looked like the legislation that would add 24 million to the ranks of the uninsured was doomed, were under pressure again on Tuesday.Hospital group Tenet Healthcare (THC) lost 2.5%, while HCA Holding (HCA) fell 1.9%. Insurer Molina Healthcare (MOH) fell 2.7% and Centene (CNC) 2.65%. Still, the stocks are well above their levels of two weeks ago, a sign that investors may think the revival of ObamaCare repeal is like a reality-show version of ""The Walking Dead.""Instead of quickly moving to tax cuts, as Trump had signaled he would do, he's diving back into what looks like a legislative morass. At best, a renewed effort to repeal ObamaCare likely just means a longer detour for Trump's fiscal plans. But there's already evidence that the ObamaCare battle is sapping consumer confidence. The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index out Tuesday fell to 51.7 in April from 55.3 in March, reversing almost all of its postelection rise. At worst, a drawn-out political battle could cut into business optimism and undercut the economy's momentum.IBD'S TAKE: When the stock market's uptrend is under pressure, as it is currently, investors should be more cautious about buying stocks and quick to cut losses. Read The Big Picture each day to see whether the uptrend remains intact and check out Leaderboard to find buying opportunities and sell signals for the market's leading stocks.Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said on Tuesday that the White House may have infrastructure legislation ready by the end of May, though infrastructure and tax reform were expected to be in the same package. For now, the Trump administration is still searching for a tax reform Plan B. Amid stiff opposition to House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to raise $1 trillion to pay for tax cuts via a 20% border-adjusted tax on imports, the White House is reportedly looking at a value-added tax or carbon tax though the administration denied they are under consideration.Getting an ObamaCare repeal bill out of the House — if it happens — would be a walk in the park compared to the challenge that awaits in the Senate, where the GOP can stand to lose just two votes, but a half-dozen lawmakers have signaled opposition to rolling back ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion.The White House has reportedly agreed to give ground on a key demand of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, granting states the opportunity to opt out of ObamaCare's community-rating regulation that requires insurers to charge the same price to the sick and the healthy. The Trump administration would grant waivers to states, if they can show that nixing the regulation would reduce premiums and result in more people being covered.The revived push to repeal ObamaCare adds to the uncertainty facing individual-market insurers who need to set premiums for 2018 ObamaCare exchange coverage within the next two months. Anthem (ANTM), which reportedly intends to exit many of its exchange markets, is the only ObamaCare insurer in 200 counties, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.Many ObamaCare exchange markets weren't thriving before Trump took office, and this year's spike in premiums may have prompted many unsubsidized customers to drop their coverage, according to one report. The extra stress from the Trump administration's efforts to undercut the law and give people a pass from complying with the individual mandate appears likely to set off a crisis this summer, as some parts of the country find themselves without any insurance options for the coming year.In other words, Trump is playing with fire in a drought zone. If a blaze breaks out, tax cuts may be starved of oxygen.RELATED:Caterpillar Lifts Dow With Goldman Push; Trump Readies Infrastructure Bill Stocks End Off Lows: ObamaCare Repeal Dead, Long Live Tax Cuts?The Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And TradeTrump Is Right: The ObamaCare Exchanges Are Racing Toward A Crisis

56,HCA,"Stocks bets against a successful Trump presidency did nicely on Monday after his first big legislative initiative ended in massive failure.After the flop of RyanCare, which died on Friday before it even came to the House floor for a vote, hospital operators HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) were the best-performing S&P 500 issues.Shares of HCA jumped 5.2% and Universal Health surged 3.35% on the stock market today, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) closed up 1.4%, amid relief that House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to slash Medicaid spending has been tabled. Centene (CNC), a Medicaid-focused insurer with a big presence on the ObamaCare exchanges, gained 2.2%, and rival Molina Healthcare (MOH) rose 2.75%, as it continued to recover from a 30-month low hit early last week.But health care stocks weren't the only group expected to suffer under Trump's policies that were shining on Monday.Gold miners also rose as the precious metal appreciated to a one-month high on Monday. Newmont Mining (NEM) gained 1.3% and Royal Gold (RGLD) 2.4%. Gold prices perked up as the dollar and 10-year Treasury yield extended their recent declines amid doubts about President Trump's ability to deliver the promised fiscal fuel of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. IBD'S TAKE: The quick and sudden flop of RyanCare proved that President Trump knows how to cut losses. Expect him to do the same with deficit-neutral tax reform and quickly shift to old-fashioned, deficit-increasing tax cuts.Meanwhile, industrial commodity stocks were among the bigger losers amid concerns that faster growth might not materialize to improve the supply-demand balance.Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) fell 4.7%, while oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) lost 3.3%. Morgan Stanley (MS) shed 2.1% as falling market interest rates weighed on the entire financial sector.Most big health insurer stocks were lower on Monday, which might seem surprising after the demise of Ryan's plan that was estimated to shrink the ranks of the insured by 24 million.Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) slipped 0.2%, while Anthem (ANTM) lost 0.3%. The investor reaction may be because health insurers would have benefited from the repeal of ObamaCare's health insurance tax and a further delay of its 40% tax on employer sponsored insurance plans that exceed a so-called ""Cadillac"" threshold. Further, health insurers pay tend to pay high tax rates and stand to benefit from a big cut in the corporate income-tax rate.RELATED:Stocks End Off Lows: ObamaCare Repeal Dead, Long Live Tax Cuts?Health Care Stocks Socked Again After CBO RyanCare ScoreFreeport-McMoRan Restarts Huge Mine; Rival Miners DiveThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

57,HCA,"After railing for years about ObamaCare's affordability problems, Republicans came up with a plan that would make them exponentially worse.""Few low-income people would purchase any plan,"" the Congressional Budget Office said of the Senate TrumpCare bill, either because premiums for comprehensive coverage are out of reach, or deductibles for lower-cost plans amount to an untenable percentage of income  — more than one-third of income for individuals in some cases and potentially much more for families.TrumpCare is so ""mean"" — President Trump's own characterization of the House-passed bill — that relatively moderate GOP governors and senators have rejected it. Yet if TrumpCare is about to be buried and it's possible to start looking for a path forward, let's not forget that there's a reason ObamaCare was unpopular and suffered from weak marketplace enrollment even before TrumpCare came around.While ObamaCare has helped the near-poor and those with chronic conditions who otherwise might be stuck without affordable coverage, it gives a bad deal to pretty much everyone else. That's why the exchanges' pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly, and premiums have soared as insurers like UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have mostly exited the markets.Unfortunately, the two most likely paths forward are forms of triage that would try to control the bleeding, rather than address ObamaCare's underlying affordability problems. One approach would focus on stabilizing insurance markets, principally by providing protection for insurers against high-claims customers — a good idea and an important step, but one that addresses the symptoms, not the underlying problem of affordability. After all, ObamaCare's unpopularity and weak enrollment preceded its premium spikes, so moderating premium increases isn't the answer.A second path, represented by the proposal from Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, wouldn't actually fix anything. It forces states to choose between ObamaCare, with all of its problems, and a less-regulated alternative built around Health Savings Accounts that's guaranteed to undermine Affordable Care Act protections for low-income households and older adults facing high medical costs.So here's a crazy idea: How about Congress actually trying to deliver something that Americans can broadly support, that works for the finances of old and young, working class and middle class, and that will lead to stable insurance markets with lower premiums?There's no good reason to aim lower, and ideology shouldn't stand in the way. In fact, the very best step for public policy, within the realm of what might be possible, would be to give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have — and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need — and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for catastrophic coverage and set aside funds to cover basic medical needs.This would involve turning ObamaCare's cost-sharing support into something more akin to working-class tax cuts and removing ObamaCare's heaviest-handed mandates, while preserving the ACA's critical protections and support.Here's ObamaCare's harsh reality that makes these changes so important — even if the law weren't under political attack and insurance markets weren't experiencing turbulence. Even among working-class households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, supposedly among ObamaCare's biggest beneficiaries, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting coverage that will protect them from financial disaster. Most of the other two-thirds are uninsured, either because they or a spouse work full time and don't qualify for exchange subsidies, or else they've spurned subsidized bronze plans that carry $6,000-$7,000 deductibles.IBD'S TAKE: Find out why hospital stocks rose and one analyst touted UnitedHealth and HCA Healthcare — even as Senate Republicans called for steep Medicaid cuts in a TrumpCare bill estimated to cut the ranks of the insured by 22 million. A central problem with ObamaCare is that the rules stacked the deck in favor of those needing comprehensive coverage, leaving far too many in the working class with three unappealing options: a silver plan that costs too much; a bronze plan that won't pay their medical bills until long after they're in financial distress; or an individual mandate penalty for opting against coverage that may be of little use.Think of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis with income of $40,000 (about 200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare offers pretty solid coverage but costs $2,430 — likely too much for a young family that's probably already struggling to save anything. The cheapest bronze plan, costing $1,068, might be doable, but the $13,300 deductible ($6,650 per person) could make a hospital stay financially devastating. (By the way, that bronze option would be far worse under the Senate TrumpCare bill, costing roughly $2,000.)The chasm between ObamaCare's silver and bronze deductibles — $700 vs. $13,300 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. ObamaCare provides extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink deductibles for modest-income households, but only if they buy silver plans. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers each month, even if the policyholder gets no medical care.Looking through the lens of these 30-year-olds in St. Louis, a bipartisan replacement, merging Republican principles and Democratic values, is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a low-deductible plan with a wide range of essential benefits.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option. A replacement for ObamaCare could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings for health expenses with two simple tweaks. Relax ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young, but only for high-deductible plans, keeping comprehensive plans affordable for older adults. (That could mean silver plans with a 3:1 age rating, bronze 4:1 and catastrophic 5:1.)Next, let people use cost-sharing subsidies to reduce premiums, if they prefer, effectively making it a tax cut. Those two steps would shrink that St. Louis couple's bronze premium to zero, and they'd have about $900 left to put in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses — not nirvana, but a dramatic improvement over what ObamaCare offers.We also should do something about the steep drop off in cost-sharing subsidies that serves as a big disincentive to earn above 200% of the poverty level. A more gradual phase-out by 300% of the poverty level would provide more constructive incentives, while delivering modest tax cuts to income-tax-paying households. Premiums could essentially be free for everyone up to 250% of the poverty level — if a catastrophic-plan option is made available.Families above 200% of the poverty level, who are more likely to remain uninsured under ObamaCare, despite the mandate penalty, should be able to opt for coverage with higher deductibles than bronze, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democrats.Freedom to choose a catastrophic plan with a 5:1 age-rating should satisfy the GOP that the reformed insurance markets will provide sufficient flexibility to meet the needs of all comers. Democrats should acknowledge that it's far better to let a young-adult member of the working class get a higher-deductible plan for free than pay a penalty for going uninsured, and the broader, healthier risk pool will serve to hold down premiums for everyone.As for the individual mandate, among the biggest issues of contention, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get high-deductible coverage essentially for free — and in most cases get extra cash on top — there should be no need to threaten them with fines.Above 250% of the poverty level, an alternative to the individual mandate is well worth considering. Among the reasons that the ObamaCare individual mandate doesn't work very well is that relatively young and healthy people who gamble on going without coverage can reasonably expect to win their bet and end up with a financial gain. ObamaCare encourages this kind of short-term calculation, since only those who get sick pay a price.A more logical approach would eliminate the incentive to go without coverage when one is young and healthy, then sign up when one's health starts deteriorating. Much like Medicare's late-enrollment penalties, the idea would be to very gradually shrink future tax subsidies based on how long people go without coverage. This should apply to both the individual market and employer market, or else people would have reason not to get coverage between jobs that offer insurance. The key for this to work in the constructive way intended is that subsidies must be sufficient to make coverage affordable, or else people would opt out for legitimate financial reasons and their future cost of coverage would gradually become even less affordable.Even without this more constructive incentive, it's important to give members of the middle class a better deal than they get now. Those who earn too much to receive ObamaCare subsidies — including young adults earning well below the official cut-off at 400% of the poverty level — should be treated more equitably relative to their peers covered through the workplace.A fiscally responsible solution would be to put a floor on tax credits for anyone buying coverage on the individual market equal to 25% of the cost of a silver plan, while limiting the income-tax benefit to 25% of the cost of employer-provided coverage and capping that benefit for high-income households. People in the 25% tax bracket (up to $91,151 for singles and $151,900 for married couples) who get coverage from an employer wouldn't be hurt by the tax change, while there would be minimal effect on those in the 28% bracket (up to $190,150 for singles and $231,450 for couples).The sad reality today is that ObamaCare throws millions of modest-wage, full-time workers under the bus. There are some 4.5 million uninsured full-time workers who — along with their spouses — don't qualify for exchange subsidies, even if bronze-level workplace coverage costs close to 10% of income, which ObamaCare deems ""affordable"" but clearly isn't. That can amount to five times what people pay on the subsidized exchanges, sometimes even more. That's why perhaps a million other modest-wage earners — solid numbers aren't available — opt for ""skinny"" coverage at work that won't pay for hospitalization or surgery but will keep them from having to pay a mandate penalty.The employer mandate is easy to dodge and ends up harming the low-wage workers it was supposed to help. Getting rid of it is a progressive thing to do — especially if it is done while fixing the individual insurance market.Finally, we should allow states that haven't expanded Medicaid to do so while limiting the expansion to 100% of the poverty level, easing the fiscal burden of the expansion on states, as suggested by Urban Institute scholars.The ideas here wouldn't deliver gold-plated insurance to most people, but they are the least we can do. All of these features would create a broad, stable risk pool, with affordable coverage options and plenty of flexibility to let people get the coverage that they believe suits them best. While they entail a fiscal cost, we can tackle that while still putting the nation on a sounder fiscal course and strengthening the social safety net.Having a robust nongroup market for insurance that serves people well should be a priority for the nation. The dynamism of our economy will be better served if entrepreneurs and idealists who are willing to step out on a limb don't have to fear that their health insurance support will come crashing down. Demographic changes make it increasingly important for people to have the flexibility to step back from full-time work to help care for an aging parent or a sick child. Amid minimum-wage pressures and health care mandates, ultra-competitive markets and the advance of technology threaten to widen the cracks in our employer-centric insurance system that millions of workers, many with modest wages, are already falling into. And don't forget that we're entering the ninth year of an economic expansion. When the next recession hits, all of these pressures will multiply and millions more people will depend on insurance outside the employer system.RELATED:Senate Delays TrumpCare Vote, Pressuring Stock MarketTrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse DealHow To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social Security
"
58,HCA,"Senate Republican leaders scrapped plans for a vote on TrumpCare this week, acknowledging that there's no quick fix for a bill that's opposed by both conservatives and moderates.The afternoon news wasn't much of a surprise after Sen. Susan Collins became the second moderate to oppose the bill following the Congressional Budget Office analysis on Monday showing that it would cut the ranks of the insured by 22 million.While it's not clear how much of Tuesday's selling was tied to TrumpCare, markets stumbled back in March when ObamaCare repeal looked to be in danger, diminishing investor confidence that President Trump can push through his fiscal agenda of tax cuts and infrastructure spending.On Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite led the way lower, falling 1.6% on the stock market today. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 0.5% and the S&P 500 index 0.8%.While expectations for corporate tax cuts have moderated since the spring, Wall Street strategists still expect a moderate tax cut to pass early in 2018, providing a boost to after-tax earnings estimates. But the longer the TrumpCare debate drags on, the narrower the window for passing tax cuts. Further, the conservative-moderate split over GOP Medicaid cuts may continue to cause problems, since the next step before cutting taxes will be to pass a 10-year budget that doesn't explode the debt.Other factors seemed to be influencing stocks as well. Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) fell 2.5% after the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion in an antitrust case. Google's parent company is trading below its 50-day moving average for the first time since mid-April.Meanwhile, bank stocks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM) were higher as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer both talked about high asset values, including equity valuations. Some on Wall Street think the Fed is quietly targeting stock prices with its plan to begin shrinking its balance sheet. Treasury yields rallied Tuesday on Yellen, Fischer and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi.Yellen said she doesn't expect another big financial crisis ""in our lifetime,"" a good sign for banks heading into Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will release the second round of stress-test results, including approval of buyback and dividend plans.JPMorgan Chase stock rose 0.9%, close to a buy point, helping limit the Dow's losses.UnitedHealth Group (UNH), another Dow component and the nation's largest insurer, dipped 0.35%. While UnitedHealth has mostly exited the ObamaCare exchanges, Medicaid managed care is an important market for the company. TrumpCare would kill off a health insurance tax, which UnitedHealth, Anthem (ANTM) and other insurers have lobbied to achieve. Anthem fell 0.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Although the Nasdaq's progress has stalled in recent weeks amid a tech downdraft, the overall market remained in a confirmed uptrend through Monday. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to get an immediate read on the latest market action and what it means for investors.While knocking 15 million people off Medicaid and sending them to the individual market to buy coverage with a tax credit, the Senate TrumpCare plan still manages to save $408 billion compared with the cost of ObamaCare tax credits for private insurance, the CBO said.That's because ""few low-income people would purchase any plan,"" the CBO said, either because premiums for comprehensive coverage are out of reach, or deductibles for lower-cost plans amount to an untenable percentage of income — more than one-third of income in some cases.The CBO found that the Senate bill would save about $200 billion more than the House bill, giving Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell some money to work with in trying to win over moderate support. Still, the coverage losses are so deep that it's hard to see how he'll suddenly come up with an answer that's eluded the GOP for more than seven years since ObamaCare first passed.RELATED:CBO Deals Blow To Senate's TrumpCare Bill; Sen.

59,HCA,"XMajor stock indexes showed modest gains in afternoon trading Thursday as Wall Street digested strong earnings from Oracle (ORCL). Health care stocks outperformed after the GOP released a new version of the ObamaCare repeal bill.In the stock market today, Oracle (ORCL) gapped up over a 47.09 flat-base entry, rising around 9%. Strong earnings were the catalyst. It's OK to buy a stock when it gaps up over a buy point, but it's important to buy as close to the open price as possible. Oracle opened at 51.61. Shares were recently trading around 50.57.The Nasdaq composite led the way, up 0.4%; the S&P 500 rallied 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average picked up 0.1%. Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 0.5%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly lower than Wednesday's levels.Health care-related industry groups outperformed while a few retail groups lagged. Outperformers in the Dow included UnitedHealth (UNH), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK).Meanwhile, China stocks were pressured after Chinese regulators asked Weibo (WB) to stop audio and video streaming services. Shares of Weibo lost 6% but were off session lows. The Chinese government has been stepping up its efforts to stop political speech on social media sites. Sina (SINA) and Alibaba (BABA) both have ownership stakes in Weibo. Shares of Sina were well off session lows but still fell 4%. Alibaba eased 0.5%.American Airlines (AAL) picked up 1%, but was well off session highs, on news Qatar Airlines is considering a 10% stake in the company. American is still in buy range from a 47.88 handle entry.Tesla (TSLA) gained 2% to an all-time high after the company reportedly reached an agreement with the city of Shanghai to explore building production facilities there.RELATED:Why Weibo, 3 IBD 50 Chinese Internet Stocks Are Selling OffUnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term CutsTesla Gets Closer To Big Manufacturing Expansion In China

"
78,HCA,"XThe House pulled a Friday vote on the ObamaCare repeal-and-replace legislation shortly before the market close. Stocks rebounded somewhat from session lows as the bill seemed doomed to defeatThe Dow Jones industrial average pared its loss to 0.3% on the stock market today. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite is up 0.2%.Fading prospects for repealing ObamaCare seemed to kneecap Thursday's rally, when the major averages all finished in the red. Two days earlier, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all suffered their steepest one-day losses since the fall, as conservatives began to close ranks against Ryan's American Health Care Act (AHCA).The Dow industrials fell 1.5% for the week, its worst loss since Trump was elected.House Speaker Paul Ryan, speaking shortly after the market close, said he and President Trump agreed to scrap the vote after they ""came up short."" Ryan signaled the ObamaCare repeal effort is over for now, with attention shifting to tax cuts. He said tax reform is ""more difficult"" now after the health care defeat, but not impossible. Trump also said that tax reform is likely next on tap.If the ObamaCare repeal effort is dead, some analysts has predicted a continued rough spell for financials but a potential bounce for beaten-down hospital stocks. Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) and many other financials have sliced through their 50-day moving averages this week amid concerns that Trump's agenda of growth-fueling tax cuts and infrastructure spending could be sidelined by a failure to repeal ObamaCare. On Friday, Wells Fargo rose 1%, while Goldman Sachs lost 1.5% and BofA was up 0.2%.Meanwhile, hospital operators Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA) rose 7.4% and 3.4% respectively, Friday, adding to Thursday's rebound.Reports coming out of the White House had suggested Trump would be just fine to see it sink. Wall Street isn't sure, but it may soon come around.While Trump's morning tweet to members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus signaled he was still trying to round up votes, he's eager to move onto the more popular parts of his agenda — tax cuts and infrastructure spending — and reportedly regrets leading off with ObamaCare repeal.IBD'S TAKE: Up until now, financial markets have been happy with just the idea of President Trump's big tax cuts and infrastructure spending. That's because, with all that fiscal fuel in the slow lane, the Federal Reserve can take its sweet time raising interest rates.Those growth-fueling parts of Trumponomics are what primarily sparked the postelection stock market rally. Yet Wall Street has been worried that failure on health care would cast doubt on the GOP's ability to deliver on the rest of its agenda.""If they fail at this then the prospects for tax reform, infrastructure and defense spending will need to be rethought,"" wrote Steven Ricchiuto, Mizuho chief U.S. economist, in a Friday note. ""Failure to pass the GOP bill sets the stage for the equity markets to retest the 2250-2300 level (on the S&P 500) and move the yield on the 10-year back toward the 2.2% level. We believe passage will result in a relief rally in stocks back to the 2400 level, and a sell-off in the 10-year note to reverts toward 2.5-2.6% again.""Meanwhile, RBC Capital Markets sees the dollar weakening further if Trump's fiscal policy takes a loss on health care.While it's possible, maybe even likely, that markets would react negatively at first, if RyanCare dies, the gloom is unlikely to last for long. The reason: It's becoming increasingly clear that ObamaCare repeal is doomed, whether it dies today or in the Senate.""Our base-case is that the AHCA passes the House, with a likely thin majority, but is ultimately voted down by the Senate and/or placed on the back burner by the Republican leadership in order to focus upon tax reform,"" Citi analysts wrote in a Thursday note.The main question, then, is whether RyanCare fails quickly, allowing for a quick shift to drawing up tax cuts, or whether it dies a slow death, which would be the most negative outcome for markets.The reason that Wall Street is divided about the impact of ObamaCare repeal failure is that tax reform looks to be just as complicated as health care reform. Yet, if RyanCare crashes and burns, there's little chance that the GOP will have the stomach to tackle tax reform centered on Ryan's controversial border-adjusted 20% tax on imports.Expect a quick shift from tax reform to tax cuts. The real impact of failure on ObamaCare repeal would be to increase the urgency of tax cuts to save the GOP from a 2018 election debacle. With their backs to the wall, there's a strong chance that Republicans would relax their sense of fiscal responsibility to deliver a big, deficit-increasing tax cut. Acting quickly could allow the GOP to make some tax cuts retroactive to 2017, meaning the payoff for voters would come before Election Day in 2018.While Senate budget reconciliation requiring just a simple majority can only be used to pass legislation that is no worse than deficit neutral beyond the 10th year, the GOP could use President George W. Bush's strategy of letting tax cuts sunset after a decade. Or the GOP could decide to blow up the Senate filibuster and enact permanent tax cuts, rolling the dice that Democrats won't control both the White House and Congress for years to come.Neither of those options is a sure thing. Some Republicans may not be willing to shed their fiscal conscience, and the political left would surely holler about disastrous implications for Social Security and Medicare. It's also unclear how the Federal Reserve and financial markets would respond to a big fiscal stimulus and higher deficits. Higher rates and uncertainty over the future of tax rates also might reduce the effectiveness of tax cuts to a significant extent.RELATED:Stocks Fall On Health Care Vote Delay; CBO Scores Revised BillThe Bull Case For Tax Cuts If ObamaCare Repeal FailsTrump's 3 Little Words That May Sink Ryan's ObamaCare Repeal, Tax ReformTrump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

84,HCA,"On Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell may announce that more than 9 million people signed up in time for Jan. 1 coverage via HealthCare.gov. The national sign-up total could exceed 12 million.
"
85,HCA,"In medical terms, the HealthCare.gov enrollment surge being celebrated by the Obama administration means that the patient didn't suffer a massive heart attack but still needs a quadruple bypass.
"
86,HCA,"The news is decent enough that sighs of relief can be expected from ObamaCare supporters, including hospital operators like HCA (HCA) and Tenet Healthcare (THC) that benefit from its generous subsidies to low-income households. Insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) that have been losing money on their ObamaCare exchange businesses may be feeling a bit more encouraged, with another full month of open enrollment still to come.
"
87,HCA,"Yet the real measure of ObamaCare is whether it makes health care broadly affordable, especially for those who lacked affordable options before its launch. On that score, ObamaCare is failing, and compelling a few million more people to sign up for coverage that may be of little use to them but won't cost any more than paying a mandate fine hardly counts as a success.
"
88,HCA,"Will ObamaCare Sign-Ups Pay?
"
89,HCA,"Current enrollment in the exchanges has dwindled to about 9 million nationally, perhaps less, down by roughly one-fourth from the 11.7 million who enrolled for 2015 coverage. So the total of 2016 sign-ups isn't much more than the number who originally signed up last year. One obvious question is how many of this year's enrollees will follow up with payments. The number touted by HHS will include a few million people who were automatically renewed, and ""new"" enrollees include people who had coverage previously but dropped it.
"
90,HCA,"There's another datapoint that may be just as important as the overall gain in enrollment: How much of the enrollment surge is really a surge of people selecting bronze plans. That's especially important when it comes to modest-income households earning up to 250% of the poverty level, since this group qualifies for extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. The catch is that those extra subsidies are only available to those who buy silver plans.
"
91,HCA,"For a 30-year-old couple in Richmond, Va., earning 200% of the poverty level ($40,000 for a family of three), buying a silver plan cuts their family deductible to $1,500, while the cheapest bronze plan comes with a $12,900 deductible. Yet, at $2,500, the silver plan may be too much of a stretch, leaving bronze the only realistic option for a family that doesn't expect massive medical bills. If a trip to the hospital could still torpedo their finances, does it really count a success if the couple pays $1,000 for a bronze plan so that they don't have to pay a combined $1,390 fine?

93,HCA,"ObamaCare Often Increases Inequality
"
94,HCA,"The reality is that the program, which was supposed to be an antidote for inequality, turns out in far too many cases to make inequality worse. Take single 27-year-olds in St. Louis earning $24,000, whose cheapest option is a $1,000 bronze plan with a $6,850 deductible. In other words, they can pay a fine equal to 3% of their income or spend 4% of income on a plan that will be of little use.
"
95,HCA,"ObamaCare has succeeded in making health care much more accessible to people whose health conditions make them desperate for comprehensive policies to limit high out-of-pocket costs and for people with income below 150% of the poverty level for whom subsidies are especially generous. But most people with income above that level aren't being served well by the exchanges.
"
96,HCA,"An Urban Institute analysis estimated that just 35% of people eligible for exchange subsidies had purchased plans. Yet the reality may be even worse for two reasons: The figure includes low-income people who settled for bronze plans and it excludes some 3 million uninsured who would be eligible for subsidies based on income but work full-time for companies that offer ""affordable"" coverage.
"
97,HCA,"Those low-wage, full-time workers get the worst deal from ObamaCare. For example, in 2015, workers earning $17,500 a year — and their spouses — were ineligible for subsidies if their employer offered them bronze-type coverage for no more than $1,670. That's 15 times the $9 per month a bronze plan would cost via the subsidized exchanges.
"
98,HCA,"When you include low-income uninsured workers with an offer of employer care, only about 1 in 4 with income from 150% to 250% of the poverty level got silver coverage in 2015 that would protect their finances if they landed in the hospital. Even if enrollment jumps in 2016, it's not clear how much the 75% with no coverage or bronze plans will decrease.

112,HCA,"ObamaCare: United Healthcare's surprise warning that it may scrap participation in federal health care exchanges is more than bad news for consumer choice. It's a broader sign of an unsustainable system.The nation's largest health insurance provider surprised the markets Thursday by saying losses from its 550,000 individual ObamaCare exchange enrollments were sharply cutting its bottom line. That's notable because ObamaCare exchange participation only forms a small slice of the $105 billion company by market capitalization.Yet it was enough to make the giant company and all the value it creates throughout its many operations suffer enough to trigger, as IBD market reporter Jed Graham wrote, ""a surge of red ink.""The company forecast $425 million less revenue in the fourth quarter and cut its full-year 2015 earnings-per-share forecast to $6 from $6.25-$6.35.Not surprisingly, its stock fell 5.6% by the close of trading Thursday, and other health care and hospital companies such as Aetna, Anthem, Tenet, Cigna, Humana and HCA took similar hits.""We see no data pointing to improvement,"" UnitedHealth Group CEO Stephen Helmsley said on a conference call. Patients, he explained, were using their plans more than the company had anticipated and, worse still, were dropping coverage when they got well.Bad as that is for company profits, it's a predictable outcome given the structure of the law and what it permits.What Helmsley described was a company caught up in the classic ""death spiral"" that IBD and reputable economists have been warning about: Insurance policy sales going in the main to the sickest patients who use the most health care services, while the high prices of the larded-up government-mandated packages continue to drive off younger, healthier consumers.In short, the ObamaCare master plan of having young and healthy consumers subsidize the oldest, sickest patients isn't working as the White House's central planners and self-proclaimed experts claimed.What's striking here is that UnitedHealth is no tiny startup ship with a narrow margin of error riding the big ObamaCare regulatory waves. It's the biggest of the big, a conglomerate that's the product of the consolidation of the industry — Anthem and Cigna, UnitedHealth and HCA, HCA and private investors — that was supposed to enable the sector to absorb the blow of higher costs of insuring more customers and still continue to do well.That's not happening.What's more, UnitedHealth was in the ObamaCare exchanges for only a year, during a window of time when the government was supposed to cushion insurers against losses in the ObamaCare transition. The cushion ends next year, leaving companies on their own.Will smaller health care companies really be able to make a profit in an atmosphere that even UnitedHealth found impossible to sustain a profit in? There's plenty of reason to wonder, as the markets did Thursday.
"
113,HCA,"Investors sent hospital stocks to the emergency room early Thursday after HCA Holdings (HCA), the largest for-profit hospital operator, reported troubling preliminary results for its third quarter late Wednesday, including a spike in uninsured admissions for the second straight quarter.HCA shares sank 5% to 72.21 on the stock market today, but that was up from an intraday low of 68.13. Other hospital operators also retreated, but pared losses as the overall market rallied. Universal Health Services (UHS) fell 0.8%. Community Health Systems (CYH) lost 2.4%, Tenet Healthcare (THC) 0.1% and LifePoint Health (LPNT) 3.8%.HCA's uninsured volume at same facilities grew to 8% of total admissions from 7.3% a year ago, continuing a trend that began in the second quarter. In Q2, uninsured admissions increased to 7.1% of the total from 6.8% in Q2 of 2014, leading analysts to opine that the benefits of ObamaCare were leveling off since enrollment in the Affordable Care Act system began in early 2014.HCA also signaled troubling signs for its bottom line. Expected Q3 earnings of $1.17 per share were below analysts' views for $1.22 per share. Operating margins were down on higher labor costs and a ""less favorable payer mix,"" the company said, noting that productivity fell, and the use of contract labor rose.The ""most concerning trend,"" said Wells Fargo analyst Gary Lieberman, ""is the continued negative mix shift in its same-facility uninsured admissions."" In a client note, he said the increase in uninsured admissions ""has been the primary focus of investor concern"" since second-quarter results were released in early August.Lieberman also chided HCA for its ""significantly higher"" labor expenses in Q3, which amounted to 46.9% of revenue vs. 45.7% in last year's same quarter.""Management should have more control over labor expense, and therefore this statistic is also concerning,"" Lieberman noted.Mizuho Securities cut HCA's price target to 86 from 103.In other preliminary results, expected Q3 revenue of $9.856 billion, up from $9.220 billion last year, was slightly above views. And overall volume increased 2.9% from a year earlier, while same-facility equivalent admissions increased 3.6% when compared to Q3 of 2014. Same-facility emergency-room visits increased 5.8%.HCA's adjusted earnings forecast for the full year was narrowed to $5.20 to $5.25 per share from $4.90 to $5.30 previously.

Also, most have climbed since their earnings press releases came out during the past couple of weeks.The medical sector, which has the largest share of the Big Cap 20, accounted for several earnings winners.Gilead Sciences (GILD) gapped up after it reported sales and profit that exceeded expectations for Q2. It also raised full-year guidance. The $3.15 a share beat analysts' consensus by 44 cents — one of the largest margins of victory in the earnings race.The stock has risen almost every day since the July 28 report and is forming the right side of a base.Better-than-expected sales and earnings also helped Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) break out of a base on July 23.Illumina (ILMN), however, was one medical leader that tumbled.The gene-sequencing company on July 21 beat earnings estimates but missed revenue expectations. Shares sold off 8% the day after its report, sinking back around a prior buy point at 213.46.

172,HCA,"Selecting stocks that have superior profit and sales growth is not the sole key to success in the market. Neither is simply buying stocks with outstanding price strength.Before you invest in a stock, make sure that it also is a favorite among the biggest investors in the market: mutual funds, investment advisors, banks and the like. This critical component is known as institutional sponsorship.Proof of heavy institutional buying is one way to confirm sponsorship, but is time-consuming to find — except at IBD.The paper's Mutual Funds and ETFs section provides instruments to help. Many of the features do double duty. They reveal top-performing funds for long-term investors and help you zero in on stocks that these strong buyers have targeted.Mutual funds are, by design, a more passive investing tool than stocks. Professional fund managers and research crews pick and time the purchases of stocks so that fund clients don't have to sweat the details.IBD narrows down the field to a list of 40 leading funds whose stock holdings carry a high average IBD Composite Rating and which have tended to outperform the S&P 500 since the index's 2009 low.The Growth Funds Leading The Market feature on the mutual funds page spotlights two of those funds each day. As is often the case in IBD, the feature makes it worth pulling out the reading glasses and diving into the fine print. The box provides a basic bio on the funds, a volatility rating and the average EPS and Relative Price Strength ratings of its stock holdings.Perhaps even more importantly, the box provides the fund's 10 largest holdings, as well as its top new buys and top sells. The daily section also provides lists of other top-performing funds, screened according to various criteria.You can delve even deeper with IBD's Mutual Fund Monthly and Quarterly Reports, usually published in the first week of each month. These features slice and dice the top-performing funds according to size, sector and type of investment. Such vital signs point to warming or cooling movement across the global economy and offer clues for whether you might want to tinker with your fund portfolio.From a stock-buying perspective, the monthly and quarterly data on stock buys and sells are pure gold mines. These data tables put a radio collar on smart money over the prior three months. Which stocks were the top funds buying, and how much?The ""Top Funds' Latest Sells"" table provides the number of funds buying vs. those selling, with a net total of sellers. If you spot one of your stocks on this list, closely monitor its chart for any key sell signals.On the buy side, some stock names will be familiar from the IBD 50, Big Cap 20 or Your Weekly Review. The table lists the industry group name and several key IBD ratings. It details how many funds are buying and the total amount invested.The IBD Mutual Fund Monthly special published on May 7 listed Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) and Zebra Techologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) as ones into which top funds poured the most dollars in the most recent three months.

266,HCA," HCA Holdings (HCA) raised its full-year guidance on solid core operations and on the upside from health care reform Wednesday. But that forecast may be too conservative, say analysts, because ObamaCare could keep strengthening earnings and revenue.

"
271,HCA,"But Wells Fargo analyst Gary Lieberman said that HCA's figures still look cautious, since most of the upside was likely the result of the Affordable Care Act and the $142 million that HCA received from the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program, benefits that are likely to continue.
"
272,HCA,"""Based on that, we think it is possible more of the beat was due to health care reform; in which case, it would appear that HCA's increase in guidance for the year is rather conservative, since that benefit will continue,"" Lieberman wrote in a research note.

"
286,HCA,"Hospital emergency rooms have their hands full providing care.And from the incessant sounds of sirens echoing through many city streets, ambulance operators seem just as busy.Outsourcing these services has become common practice. Envision Healthcare Holdings (EVHC) comes to the rescue on both fronts.The Colorado-based company is a leading player in staffing hospital emergency departments through its EmCare division and providing medical transport through American Medical Response, or AMR.Both businesses have ""brand recognition,"" said Envision Chief Executive William Sanger, who has been overseeing both as CEO since 2005.Envision went public last year, for the second time — two years after a private-equity firm had taken it private again. But the firm's roots go back much further.EmCare, the larger business of the two, was founded in 1972, two decades before AMR. At first it provided emergency-department staffing and related services to hospitals in Texas. But acquisitions broadened its reach nationwide.Now more of EmCare's growth is organic rather than acquired.Doctors On CallHospitals can buy single services or bundled packages to meet their staffing needs. EmCare can provide ER physicians, trauma surgeons, anesthesiologists, radiologists and ""hospitalists"" — doctors who give care in the hospital after an initial episode is treated.""They have really differentiated themselves with their bundled offerings. And that's led to industry leading organic growth,"" said analyst Richard Close of Avondale Partners.He says Envision's new contracts are growing 13% to 15% annually. In contrast, chief rival Team Health Holdings (TMH) is primarily growing through acquisitions, he says.On the medical transportation side, competition is fragmented. About 50% of 911 emergency requests are handled by local fire departments, the other half by private ambulance services, Sanger says.Not only is Envision's AMR the largest of its kind in the country, it has been ""benefiting from financial woes of some competitors,"" says Jason Gurda, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets.For example, one of its largest rivals, Rural/Metro, declared bankruptcy last year. More recently, a smaller rival ""went out of business overnight,"" he said.Sanger says AMR has ""several hundred 911 contracts and literally thousands of relationships with hospitals,"" the latter for transporting patients to facilities such as dialysis centers and nursing homes.""We've identified protocols to improve survival rates,"" Sanger said of its ambulance service. AMR gets high marks in cardiac survival and is looking to improve stroke survival rates.Both of Envision's core businesses are getting modest boosts from health care reform under the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.""It's translating into more patients, more revenue and more profit,"" Sanger said of expanded insurance coverage under ObamaCare.The 20% of patients who weren't able to pay for ambulance services or emergency-room visits is now closer to 18% because of ObamaCare, he says.""Generally the positive impact from the Affordable Care Act has been a shift from the uninsured into Medicaid,"" Close said.Health care reform has also put a sharper focus on integrated health care, which is a positive for Envision. Reimbursement based on outcomes or quality metrics has ""positioned Envision to be a partner to hospital systems,"" Gurda said.That's because EmCare provides a more integrated approach to health care than the fragmented care typically delivered by hospital staffs, he says.""One of the things EmCare does well is help those partners achieve quality outcomes. Part of it is being focused — making that a key operational point for employees. And it's invested quite a bit on the (information technology) side,"" Gurda said.New Hospital DealsSuch strategies have led to a growing number of contract wins with hospitals, which in turn is driving much of the company's revenue growth. Revenue year-over-year has grown in double digits for seven straight quarters.EmCare has around 750 individual contracts with hospitals or hospital systems, Sanger says. Its largest ones are with Hospital Corporation of America, or HCA Holdings (HCA), and Baylor Health Care System in Texas.EmCare generated net revenue of $690 million in the second quarter, a 21.2% gain over the prior year. AMR's revenue rose 16.7% to $385.3 million, its strongest performance in years.Total revenue in the second quarter jumped 19.6% from the earlier year to $1.08 billion. Adjusted earnings were 28 cents a share, up from the equivalent of 5 cents in the prior year.Based on improving financial results this year, Envision raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $1.15 to $1.20 from $1.10 to $1.15 previously. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year revenue to climb 17% over last year to nearly $4.4 billion and per-share earnings to rise 73% to $1.17.Aftercare OpportunityA third business, called Evolution Health, is in early development. It currently generates just a small amount of revenue, Sanger says.Evolution embraces a ""continuum of care"" model, he says, which seeks to manage patients' health care after they are discharged from a hospital.""We started an integrated-care model in the hospital so we're taking it to another level,"" Sanger said.Evolution has been lining up work with health plans to manage their most seriously ill customers and has already hired roughly 1,500 clinicians.Starting in January, Envision's Evolution will spearhead six pilot programs in conjunction with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, involving the ""sickest patients,"" Sanger says.He thinks Evolution will grow quickly over the next five to seven years.""It could be the size of our other two services,"" Sanger said.

412,HCA,"Proofpoint has been on a buying spree, making relatively small but strategic acquisitions. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based provider of security software via the cloud spent $24 million for NetCitadel and $35 million for Nexgate last year. In March, Proofpoint agreed to pay $40 million for security firm Emerging Threats.It was money well spent, CEO Gary Steele says, enhancing Proofpoint's (PFPT) capabilities in advanced threat intelligence, security for social media channels and automated security incident response. Proofpoint stock has roughly tripled in the past two years and sports a high IBD Relative Strength Rating of 94.Steele was brought in at Proofpoint's start in 2002, when the company focused almost exclusively on email security. He has overseen an evolution at Proofpoint, drawing on previous experience as CEO of applications company Portera, bought by Exigen Group in 2002, and at Sybase, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ).Now Proofpoint is pioneering next-generation, cloud-based cybersecurity that combines Big Data analytics, threat intelligence capabilities and dynamic malware analytics to block cyberattacks. In Q1, Proofpoint said that revenue for its targeted-attack protection business more than doubled from Q1 2014. Overall revenue rose 35% to $57.8 million, Proofpoint's 47th consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth.Proofpoint says that its customers include 49 of the Fortune 100 companies, including Citibank (C), HCA (HCA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).Steele said that companies are looking to avoid risks associated with malware delivered through email, among other risks. ""Because the stakes are so large and because the infrastructure available to the hacking community is so significant, these campaigns and these attacks will continue to evolve at a very, very rapid rate,"" Steele said. ""Fundamentally, the challenge for the security industry is to innovate at a faster rate than the hackers are. Some of the larger, incumbent security companies have struggled with the level of innovation that's required.""Proofpoint says that it devotes roughly 20% of revenue to R&D.Steele recently spoke with IBD about the security industry.IBD: What are your goals for Proofpoint in 2015 and 2016?Steele: When we look at the opportunity in front of us, we're very much focused on taking share from the larger incumbent vendors. As the security landscape has changed, customers are demanding additional protection, additional capability. We see today what's driving our growth is organizations searching for solutions that ensure they're well protected from this next generation of threats. We see organizations oftentimes running some legacy email security solution, plus some sort of anti-virus. Those capabilities don't protect these organizations from the targeted attacks that companies are being hit with today. We've developed a broad set of capabilities that identify and block those kinds of campaigns coming into the enterprise.Another key element of our growth is expansion, geographically. Roughly just under 20% of our business has come from international markets. We believe there is a significant opportunity of driving our solutions in international markets. We started this last year and will continue to invest because we see great opportunity outside the U.S., specifically in Europe and other international markets.IBD: How does your Nexgate Social Media Threat Center address social media threats?Steele: Our research has found that the Fortune 100 brands are experiencing at least one compromise a business day on their social media channel. As social has really grown within these organizations, so has the threat and risk associated with it. The reality today is that as large brands rely more heavily on social, they must have security because a hack or a compromise can have a significant impact on their overall brand.The opportunity for Proofpoint is to provide a level of security compliance that helps identify attacks that may come in through social. Now we're posting on people's social pages ... . We've coupled with that the integration of our back-end security capabilities, where we basically can deliver more depth and sophistication in the way which we can identify.We also see a big need for compliance. They have to make sure they comply with various regulations for their industry.IBD: Dridex, a malware that aims to steal online banking credentials when users log in to online bank accounts, is on the rise. What does that mean for the banking industry?Steele: One of the key themes we've seen in the threat landscape over the course of the last few quarters is Dridex attacks, coming through phishing, that basically have evaded the traditional anti-virus systems that people have in place. This has been a big challenge in the financial services industry, where these are pieces of malware that fundamentally go right through the legacy infrastructure. So it creates a huge amount of cleanup work on the part of the IT organizations. The only way this problem gets solved is if you're running modern architectures that block these kinds of advanced threats. This is a big theme, one of the current themes we see from hackers today. It will evolve and change, but it has been a huge headache for the financial services industry.IBD: What do folks need to know about phishing campaigns around the IRS and tax liabilities?Steele: One of the things that we have seen going into 2015 is a significant number of phishing campaigns focused around the IRS. A tax audit, a tax refund, these are very common phishing themes used by hackers to compel someone to click. They're quite effective, frankly. These broad campaigns started as we entered 2015. We saw a shift as we got to tax day on April 15 to much more about the refunds and scams around refunds. The hackers always follow the money. They're going to go where they know there's opportunity. Clearly, the IRS gets your attention.IBD: Proofpoint reported a 36% increase in subscription service in Q1, accounting for 97% of revenue. Is that where you want to be?Steele: What's really exciting is we have a fast-paced business model with a very high percent of recurring revenue. From an investor's perspective, the core benefit that we deliver, because we have such a high subscription number, is the fact that you get a very nice level of predictability. So we like that very high percentage of subscription revenue. It represents, when you look at our high renewal rate — which has consistently run over 90% with this broad, recurring base — a very powerful business model. We think that one of the most compelling aspects for investors is this high recurring revenue run rate.

425,HCA,"If you're going to own hospitals, location matters. Serving areas with a growing population can lead to heavier usage and higher profits.Take HCA Holdings (HCA), the largest operator of acute care hospitals in the U.S. It owns roughly 160 hospitals and about 115 free-standing surgical centers.""HCA has developed its markets in geographies that tend to be stronger,"" said Darren Lehrich, a managing director and analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York City. In addition to situating hospitals in regions with an increasing population, Lehrich says, HCA focuses on ""business-friendly environments where the commercially insured mix is stronger.""HCA's largest markets include Texas and Florida. Both states court businesses aggressively and do not have an individual income tax.An Ownership CultureThomas Frist Jr. and his father were part of HCA's founding team in 1968. Starting with one Nashville hospital, they built one of America's first hospital management companies. By its first initial public offering in 1969, HCA — Hospital Corporation of America — had already established or acquired 11 hospitals.""Part of the Frist genius was the Frist family really believed in creating an ownership mentality among its employees,"" Lehrich said. ""That creates great continuity and loyalty within the organization and a lot less turnover in its management ranks.""In 1987, HCA sold a chunk of its hospitals to a newly formed company operated as an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). At the time, Frist hailed the new company as ""the largest ESOP ever formed in the history of the U.S.""To reinforce the sense of ownership throughout the sprawling company, which has approximately 162,000 employees, HCA has an extensive training program to develop its regional executive team, Lehrich says. The firm often promotes from within.""When I visit HCA facilities, what strikes me the most when I meet with executives at the field level is they tend to have very long tenures at HCA,"" he said. ""That in turn tends to support strong relationships with the medical staff and allows them to react more quickly to a dynamic health care environment.""Thanks to its 46-year history, HCA has a head start on rivals that seek to scale up their health care operations. The Nashville, Tenn.- based company has established deep roots in many desirable regions.More Outpatient Services""The company has harvested and invested in these markets for decades so that they have well-developed networks of inpatient, full-service hubs and outpatient portals as well,"" Lehrich said.While traditional acute care hospitals continue to fill a need in many communities, changes in health care delivery have led to the growth of ambulatory surgery centers that provide same-day surgical care and diagnostic exams such as colonoscopies. Nearly 38% of HCA's 2013 revenues flowed from these outpatient centers.""It's part of their strategy to open more convenient locations for outpatient procedures that sometimes are not attached to hospitals,"" Lehrich said.

452,HCA,"The Oracle of Omaha recently reaffirmed his liking for the concept of great rotation — a shift to equities from bonds. Warren Buffett believes long-term investors should go for stocks over bonds as in most cases the former is likely to outperform the latter.The arguments hold good in today’s environment. Treasury yields have been on an uptrend since the start of the year, thanks to inflationary pressures and prospects of rising bond supply to fund Donald Trump’s tax overhaul plan. This has pushed the benchmark bond yields to a four-year high (read: Short These Sector ETFs on Rising Rate Concerns).Buffett Said “as an investor’s investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolio of U.S. equities becomes progressively less risky than bonds, assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensible multiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates.”Buffett believes that investing in stable companies whose products are strong sales-generating are better long-term bets than a “get-rich-quick approach.” Buffett is known to follow the Benjamin Graham school of value investing. Buffett doesn’t seek capital gains but ownership in quality companies that are able to generate earnings.This leads us to believe that choosing a value investment is a great idea over the long term. Below we highlight three value ETFs and stocks that produced at least 50% returns in the last five years (as of Feb 26, 2018).This is in stark contrast to iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT  -  Free Report) that yields around 2.61% and generated about 3% in the last five years (as of Feb 26, 2018). Total bond market iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG  -  Free Report), which yields about 2.40% annually, lost about 2.8% in the last five years (as of Feb 26, 2018).ETF PicksBelow we highlight three value ETFs that generated more than 60% returns in the last five years.Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV  -  Free Report) – Up 69.9%The fund holds about 114 stocks and charges 35 bps in fees.

455,HCA,"On Feb 19, we issued an updated research report on NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report). While the strong Spine market spells huge scope for the stock, pricing and payers pressure come as major headwinds. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Ahead of fourth-quarter 2017 earnings release (scheduled for Feb 26, 2018), we are upbeat about NuVasive’s consistent top-line gains from its international business. Last quarter, the company’s international business exceeded its expectations by recording 46% growth at CER on continued strong demand for the company’s spine technology, particularly in the key markets of Italy, Germany and Japan. Overall, the company believes that its share in the international market will rise to double-digits over the next several years. Banking on a stellar first-half 2017 performance, the company raised its international business growth guidance to more than 20% for the full year.NuVasive recently adopted a few strategies to drive its adjusted operating margin to 25% post reaching the $1-billion revenue target by the end of 2017. This includes the company’s plans to aptly align its technological expertise with marketing strategies in order to enhance product development and commercialization capability. Also, NuVasive plans to merge its U.S. Commercial and International sales functions into a global commercial organization. This apart, the company intends to alter its global operations to boost efficiencies through a combination of manufacturing, supply chain, information technology (IT), regulatory affairs and quality assurance (RA/QA).We are also encouraged by the company’s receipt of certain FDA approvals of late. In October 2017, NuVasive was granted an expanded 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its TLX interbody system. Notably, TLX has been designed for a minimally-invasive spine surgery approach. In the same month, the company announced another expanded FDA 510(k) nod for its advanced magnetic and non-invasive limb lengthening technology called PRECICE. Earlier in September, NuVasive also received an FDA approval to use the redesigned MAGEC system with its RELINE Small Stature system.On the flip side, pricing pressure continues to be a major concern for NuVasive as the company has been facing declining product prices due to intensifying competition in the spine market. Moreover, this downtrend is experienced by hospital customers from managed care organizations, insurance providers as well as other third-party payers. Further, continuous contraction in gross margin is a spoiler. This leading medical device company has underperformed the broader industry over the past six months. The stock has lost 26.8% against the broader industry’s 6.5% rise.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNuVasive carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report), Haemonetics Corporation (HAE  -  Free Report) and HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Centene has a projected long-term growth rate of 14.4%.

457,HCA,"The Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services has recently granted NuVasive, Inc.’s (NUVA  -  Free Report) SpineTRACK Registry the designation of Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR). This feat comes as a significant milestone for the company.The designation is for the 2018 Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) reporting year. With the QCDR tag, participants will now be able to use the SpineTRACK platform to earn Medicare payment incentives.It is important to note that NuVasive-sponsored SpineTRACK Registry is a prospective, multicenter, observational data collection quality improvement tool. It works as a comprehensive and collaborative data collection and quality improvement solution in the field of spine surgery. SpineTRACK uses real-time reports, which help making better treatment decisions.Within the scope of Quality Payment Program, there are two tracks and MIPS is one. Notably, the program is instrumental in shifting Medicare Part B providers to a performance-based payment system. It streamlines three historical Medicare programs namely Physician Quality Reporting System, Value-based Payment Modifier Program and the Medicare Electronic Health Record Incentive Program (Meaningful Use) into a single payment system. The above three categories further comprise four indicators such as Quality (50%), Improvement Activities (15%), Advancing Care Information (25%) and Cost (10%). Per NuVasive, each weighted category is factored into a final score that can impact Medicare payments by a plus or a minus 5% in 2020.By dint of QCDR designation, NuVasive expects the SpineTRACK Registry to successfully support the MIPS Quality reporting requirements on behalf of eligible providers. Management claims that the SpineTRACK platform is the longest-running spine outcomes database sponsored by any spine company.On a positive note, the QCDR designation is expected to help the company’s customers meet quality reporting criteria. This in turn should also aid the physicians to deliver optimal results and earn incentives to help them evolve with time and develop their practices as well. NuVasive is highly optimistic about this development and expects the same to add some effective value to align with its focus on providing systems-based spine solutions.In recent times, the spine surgery product market has witnessed growth in leaps and bounds. Per a ResearchMoz report, this market is estimated to reach a value of $16.7 billion by 2025 at a CAGR of 5.8%. Over the past six months, NuVasive has significantly underperformed the broader industry. The stock has lost 26.6% versus a 6.5% gain of the broader industry.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNuVasive carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report), Haemonetics Corporation (HAE  -  Free Report) and HCA Healthcare, Inc.

459,HCA,"Masimo Corporation (MASI  -  Free Report) recently received the CE marking of Eve, a screening application for newborns diagnosed with critical congenital heart disease (CCHD). The application will function through the flagship Rad-97 Pulse CO-Oximeter.Per management, Eve is capable of transforming the pulse oximeters into intuitive screening tools and help clinicians perform the screening of the newborns with ease.The application is yet to receive a FDA clearance, which will strengthen Masimo’s position in the MedTech space. Masimo Corporation Price and Consensus  Masimo Corporation Price and Consensus | Masimo Corporation Quote Why Eve?Eve combines the power of Masimo SET Measure-through Motion and Low Perfusion pulse oximetry with a pre-ductal to post-ductal synchronization algorithm designed to reduce calculation errors. This cost-effective application is available on the Radical-7 Pulse CO-Oximeter.The application provides visual instructions, animations, an automatic synchronization algorithm and a detailed yet convenient display of screening results. It labels results with unique patient identifiers for the mother and the newborn.Per management, studies have shown that Masimo SET pulse oximetry can help improve CCHD screening, helping to save many newborns’ lives while reducing the cost of care.Newborn Screening Market Holds PromiseAccording to Stratistics MRC, the Global Newborn Screening Market is accounted from $533.77 million in 2016 to reach $1395.65 million by 2023 at a CAGR of 12.7%.Increasing chromosomal abnormalities in infants, growing awareness in urbanized nations and rising panel of newborn infections are some of the key factors fueling the market growth.This data is indicative of the potential the critical congenital heart disease market currently holds globally. Undoubtedly, the launch of Eve post this CE mark approval should get strong customer acceptance in Europe.Price PerformanceOver the last six months, Masimo has been underperforming the broader industry. The stock has gained 1.9% compared with the industry’s rally of 12.2%.  However, the recent development is likely to boost Masimo’s shares in the quarters ahead.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMasimo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are athenahealth (ATHN  -  Free Report), HCA Healthcare (HCA  -  Free Report) and Neogen (NEOG  -  Free Report).

460,HCA,"Wall Street is bracing for higher bouts of volatility, after a rebound in U.S. stocks on Feb 6 followed the largest sell-off in more than six years. While bullish investors show a lot of optimism on corporate earnings and prospects of tax cut, those with a bearish view fear that the Fed’s embarking on a quicker route to interest rate hikes might derail the record bull run.Given such widespread concern over the future course of the equity market, investing in stocks unperturbed by market gyrations won’t be a bad proposition.Greater Uncertainty in Equity MarketThe U.S. stock market finished a wild day of trading on Feb 6 with the Dow jumping 567.02 points, or 2.3%, to 24,912.77, after losing 567 points at the open. This followed Feb 5’s brutal trading session, with the Dow nosediving around 1,600 points as investors pulled money out of stocks.The S&P 500 bounced back to close at 2,695.14, up 46.20 points, or 1.7%. But, the broader index is now down more than 5% from its all-time intra-day high of 2,872.87 on Jan 26. And it’s all because of the healthy pullback on Feb 5. Before that day, the index had enjoyed the longest stretch without a 5% pullback in 20 years.This shows that the market is unpredictable and often erratic in the short term. After all, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, at one point of time climbed as high as 49 on Feb 6, topping 40 for the first time since 2015, only to end at 31.3. Any reading above the 20 mark indicates volatility in the equity market. This is in sharp contrast to the fear gauge’s reading in 2017. Last year, VIX fell as low as 9.14.Roller-Coaster Ride for InvestorsThe wild swings over the past two days are due to the constant tussle between bulls and bears. Bullish investors argue that at the end of the day, upbeat corporate earnings and the Republican tax cut policy will support market valuations.Total Q4 earnings for the 251 S&P 500 members that have reported results so far are up 16% from the same period last year on 10.5% higher revenues, with 80.5% beating EPS estimates and 78.1% surpassing revenue estimates. Overall, Q4 earnings are expected to be up 13% from the same period last year on 7.7% higher revenues (read more: Earnings Estimates Going Higher).Corporate America has also received a massive permanent tax break, which will further boost their profit margin. The House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years. In a headline-grabbing move, the corporate tax rate was lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed until 2019 (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Bearish investors, in the meantime, believe that the market is over-stretched and its weakness has already started last week when a pickup in wage growth sparked fears of inflation and bolstered expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates than previously expected. Needless to say, the Fed’s easy monetary policy contributed significantly toward the ageing bull market, which will turn nine on Mar 9.Americans are now getting fatter paychecks, with wages growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade. Average hourly wages increased by 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Even though the Federal Reserve would like wages to grow 3% or more, the Feb 2 report was, nevertheless, a welcome sign for workers following years of stagnant pay (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).The Winning StrategyAs the broader market struggles for direction, smart investors should simply look for stocks that provide superb risk-adjusted returns. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1.But, even though low beta stocks pose less risk they provide lower returns. So, in order to boost your returns, we have further zeroed in on stocks that have seen positive earnings estimate revision, usually on a quarterly basis. Rising earnings estimates generally indicate the stock will outperform the market in the near future.

462,HCA,"The first-quarter earnings season has crossed the half way mark and has showcased strong results with earnings and revenue growth on track to reach the highest level in seven years.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 267 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 76.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 73.8% outperforming on the top line.The Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) is expected to deliver 12.9% earnings growth on 7% higher revenues in the first quarter. This is, however, shy of the projected 22.6% and 8.4% revenue and earnings growth, respectively, for the S&P 500 index.Healthcare is part of the broader medical sector, which includes diversified industries like health maintenance organizations (HMOs) popularly known as health insurers, clinical, laboratories and diagnostics research, medical equipment, hospitals & nursing homes, telehealth services and more. The sector is so diverse that a single factor influencing one industry positively can be a negative for another. For example flu, which causes an increase in medical services utilization, is an earnings driver for the hospital space, while a negative for insurers as it causes a spike in claims cost.To put it into perspective, the January-March 2018 period was an unexpectedly brutal flu season, which led to a spike in medical cost for insurers. But because of UnitedHealth’s superior medical cost management, the flu season did not have any adverse impact on the company’s results. UnitedHealth is considered a bellwether for the other companies and its results provide a broad picture of the industry that despite increased flu, the first quarter will be profitable.Health insurers are likely to have witnessed an increase in premium and enrollment from the government businesses – Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. A surge in the baby boomer population has led to higher demand for these policies. Earnings should also see an upside from ancillary and health service businesses, which health insurers have been investing in for the past many years to diversify revenue base. These businesses which focus on data management, management of clinical records, analytics, clinical care, pharmacy care and more have been a nice contributor to the group’s earnings in recent years and the trend is expected to continue.However, this severe flu season should be a shot in the arm for care providers and other companies all along the pharmaceutical supply chain, as it would lead to higher revenues from increasing hospital visits and drug sales. Companies in the hospital sector should see increased patient revenues and admissions as more patients seek medical help, which in turn should drive their top-line growth.Nevertheless, the hospital companies should continue to feel the heat, from walk-in clinics and other outpatient treatment options that have been eating into their admissions volumes for past many quarters.Let’s find out where the following healthcare stocks stand ahead of their first-quarter releases on May 1.Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report)  is expected to gain from the projected increase in net income and adjusted earnings resulting from lower taxes, strong growth in individual Medicare Advantage products and group Medicare Advantage products, as well as lesser losses from the exiting Individual Commercial products in 2018.A decline in tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and reduced losses from the individual exchange business will aid margins.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.97 for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects 10% year-over-year growth. Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. Moreover, its Earnings ESP of +0.43%, makes us confident of a positive earnings surprise. (Read more:  Will Higher Medicare Revenues Aid Aetna Q1 Earnings?)The company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 21.5%.

(HCA  -  Free Report) should see higher flu-related volumes combined with the anticipated benefits from the income tax reform and an earnings upside from favorable exchange rates.However, the company’s first-quarter results are expected to suffer from industry-wide softness in volumes. Factors like payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and the prevalence of high deductible health plans, and an increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are likely to lower volumes.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07 per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects 19% year-over-year growth. HCA Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -2.14%. Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

463,HCA,"HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 1.Higher flu-related volumes combined with the anticipated benefits from the income tax reform should support HCA Healthcare’s results. The company  should see an earnings upside from favorable exchange rates.However, the company’s first-quarter results are expected to suffer from industry-wide softness in volumes. Factors like payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and the prevalence of high deductible health plans, and an increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are likely to lower volumes.As result of the recent passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we currently estimate the company's effective tax rate in 2018 at 25%, and reduction in cash taxes in 2018 of approximately $500 million.With respect to workforce development, the company is undergoing investments of approximately $300 million in four important areas that will continue for the next few years. Though these initiatives will create better opportunities for career growth and capabilities to serve patients, these costs will weigh on the bottom line before generating profits.The company’s revenues have been rising over the past few years on the back of accretive acquisition of other hospitals and we expect the trend to continue in the first quarter. The number of hospitals in the first quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 179, up from 171 in the year-ago quarter. An increase in the number of hospitals should also drive admissions volume growth. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, total admissions should be up 3.5% year over year.The company has been deploying capital in terms of share repurchases to enhance investors’ value. Share buyback programs taken up during the first quarter are likely to favor the bottom line, limiting the share count.Earnings SurpriseThe company beat earnings estimate in one of the trailing four reported quarters and missed in two. However, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 2.23%. This is depicted in the chart below:HCA Healthcare, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HCA Healthcare, Inc.

464,HCA,"Community Health Systems, Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report)  has been losing out on investors’ confidence due to the stock’s persistently poor performance in comparison to the industry as well as its peers. The company’s lower-than-expected volumes, payer rates, increased bad debt, a weak top line combined with higher operating expenses leading to a further drag in the margin have likely caused this underperformance.In a year’s time, shares of Community Health have tanked 50.5%, underperforming the industry’s rally of 10.7%. The company’s performance pales even more when compared with other hospital stocks like HCA Holdings, Inc (HCA  -  Free Report) and Tenet Healthcare Corporation (THC  -  Free Report), which have jumped 22% and 48%, respectively, over the same time frame. What’s Causing the Underperformance?Lower Revenues: This leading operator of general acute care hospitals in communities across the country has been witnessing a downward trend in its top line since 2016 on lower admissions, stemming from decreasing number of hospitals as a result of frequent divestitures. In both 2016 and 2017, revenues declined by 5.1% and 16.7%, respectively. Rapid sale of units might have further induced reduction in the bed count and patient admissions. Besides these, the company bore the brunt of falling payer rates and increased bad debt.Higher Expenses: Community Health has been enduring continuous escalation in operating expenses for many years now. Although in 2017, operating expense declined 10%, it represents 112% of the total revenues while in 2016, the same accounted for 104% of the metric. Mounting costs combined with dull revenues  have impelled the company’s disappointing performance with a loss report in the past three consecutive quarters, adversely impacting shareholders’ expectation from the stock.Tepid 2018 Guidance: Following discouraging 2017 results, Community Health has issued guidance for 2018, comparing unfavorably with 2017. Loss from continuing operations per share is expected within $1.50-$1.10 with the mid-point wider than the adjusted loss of $1.20 incurred in 2017. The company expects net operating revenues in the range of $13.6-$13.9 billion, reflecting a 10% drop from $15.35 billion generated in 2017.Does 2018 Look Promising?Community Health is focusing on future growth and margin expansion. The company adopts strategies like service line enhancements, physician practice development, incremental outpatient access points, investments in the behavioral health and post-acute care space plus the expansion of new transfer program initiative.Although the company anticipates trimming its expenses and improving volumes through these measures, we remain on the sidelines till any progress is reflceted in its earnings.Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 was revised to a loss of $1.31 per share from a loss of 78 cents in the last 60 days. This movement reflects analysts’ pessimism on the stock, which is likely to exert a downward pressure on its share price going forward.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderCommunity Health holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A better-ranked stock from the hospital space is Universal Health Systems, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

467,HCA,"Fourth-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Jan 26, 26% S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers and 24% of them are scheduled to release this week.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 133 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating EPS estimates and 78.9% beating revenue estimates. About 65.4% of the companies have surpassed both EPS and revenue estimates.Medical Sector TrendsThe medical sector has been in the limelight ever since Donald Trump became the President. Trump’s intention to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has resulted in an uncertain future for the whole sector. As a result, the medical stocks continue to be in focus.The U.S. healthcare industry substantially benefits from the strong membership base supported by medicaid expansion under ACA. Aggressive inorganic strategies have helped the players achieve fast-paced growth. In addition, new product launches, expansion into ancillary businesses, business diversification, cost control efforts, increased operating efficiencies and a strong capital position are expected to add to the top line and bottom-line growth for most of the players.However, medical stocks face threats like the rising level of bad debt, demand for increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions. In addition, higher medical costs, public exchange woes, stiff competition, stringent regulations and compliance costs were also a drag. These are likely to put pressure on the bottom line.Stocks to CompareLet’s take a sneak peek into two Medical sector stocks — Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and HCA Healthcare, Inc (HCA  -  Free Report) — that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Jan 30, before the market opens.Aetna is an American managed health care company, engaged in selling traditional and consumer-directed health care insurance plans and related services. It is expected to be acquired by CVS Health in the second half of 2018, per a definitive merger agreement. On the other hand, HCA Healthcare, through its subsidiaries, provides health care services in the United States and England.Here are some companies from the medical sector that are likely to beat on earnings in the fourth quarter.Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.24% and a a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)The company is set to report earnings on Feb 6. You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.29% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is set to report financial results on Jan 31.Q4 Expectations From AetnaIn the quarter, we expect Aetna to witness a decline in revenues due to lower premiums in its Health Care segment, including lower membership in its ACA-compliant individual and small group products, and the temporary suspension of the health insurer fee in 2017.Revenues are also expected to remain under pressure in the fourth quarter owing to the sale of its domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence of management business lines; the previously disclosed Medicaid contract termination; exits from individual Commercial products and continued repositioning of its ACA- compliant small group Commercial products.Management has also reduced its 2017 revenue guidance to approximately $60.5 billion from $61 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Health Care segment for the fourth quarter is $14.5 billion, down 3.7% year over year.Medical benefit ratio, a metric used to measure medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, is expected to increase in the fourth quarter, due to an unfavorable performance of its Individual Commercial products.The company projects an increase in the ratio driven primarily by the suspension of the health insurer fee and experience rating pressure in the Group Commercial and Group Medicare Advantage products, partially offset by projected improvement in its Individual Commercial Insured products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 85%, up from 82% in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total medical membership, one of the key drivers of revenues, is 22.18 million, down 4% year over year. We expect medical membership to suffer from a decline in the company’s ACA-compliant individual and small group and Medicaid products. The decrease is likely to be partially offset by increase in its Commercial ASC, International Commercial Insured and Medicare Insured products.The company's focus on managing costs will keep a check on its operating expenses.Share repurchases made by the company in the fourth quarter will help boost its earnings.Aetna has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for an earnings beat. Notably, the Earnings ESP for Aetna is +0.27%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Aetna Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Aetna Inc.

QuoteQ4 Expectations From HCA HealthcareThe company’s revenues have been rising over the past few years on the back of accretive acquisition of other hospitals.  Continuing the trend, patient admissions are expected to grow further in the fourth quarter, driving the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total admissions, one of the key revenue drivers, (representing the total number of patients admitted to the company’s hospitals and is a general measure of inpatient volume) is 497,000, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for in patient revenues per admission is pegged at $13,433, up 2.5% year over year.The company has been deploying capital in terms of share repurchases to enhance investors’ value. Share buyback programs taken up during the fourth quarter are likely to favor the bottom line, limiting the share count.However, the company’s fourth-quarter results are expected to suffer from the industry-wide softness in volumes. Factors like payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, and increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are likely to lower volumes.Operating expenses per equivalent admission are also likely to increase in the fourth quarter with a rise in admissions.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that HCA Healthcare will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because, despite carrying a favorable Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of -0.20% makes the prediction inconclusive.HCA Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HCA Holdings, Inc.

468,HCA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, HCA Healthcare has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.9. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts HCA Healthcare’s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 13.2) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that HCA Healthcare has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 11.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for HCA Healthcare’s stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, HCA Healthcare has a P/S ratio of about 0.8. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, HCA Healthcare currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes HCA a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for HCA Healthcare is just 1.0, a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 1.3. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, HCA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though HCA Healthcare might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of D. This gives HCA a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen seven estimates go higher in the past sixty days, compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen twelve upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has climbed nearly 13.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased about 18.0%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:HCA Healthcare, Inc. Price and Consensus  HCA Healthcare, Inc. Price and Consensus | HCA Healthcare, Inc. QuoteThe stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance from the company in the near term. However, HCA Healthcare is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment, as indicated by the positive estimate revisions, and this works in the company’s favor.Bottom LineHCA Healthcare is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 40% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite positive estimate revision activity, investors should wait for industry trends to turn around first.  When it does, this stock could be a compelling value pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

469,HCA,"The U.S. investment market has scaled new highs on the latest Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad.In fact, the MedTech sector is looking forward to the latest decision of the Senate to postpone an industry-wide excise tax (Medical Device’ tax) by another two years. The bill will also delay the Cadillac tax (a 40% tax on employer insurance), until 2022. The Medical Device tax imposes 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, reducing the research and development (R&D) prospects.Not just abatement of the taxes, the MedTech fraternity has also been riding high on the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trends in the space. In fact various reports suggest that M&A has been the key catalyst of the U.S. healthcare space of late. Per data provided by BioSpectrum Asia, M&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion.M&A in FocusWe believe the M&A strategies will reduce pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space. Further, the companies with a strong acquisition policy will expand customer base faster, moderate leverage and enhance cash flow.Glancing through the major acquisitions of the recent past, Becton, Dickinson and Company’s acquisition of C. R. Bard, and JOHNSON & JOHNSON’s buyout of Actelion deserve a mention.Further, health insurers are trying to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain. In this regard, the latest buyout of Express Scripts by Cigna, which follows just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp announced plans to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna, is important.Combined with the postponement of the taxes and a solid M&A policy, the Medtech sector is poised to grow in the coming quarters.Our Screening ParametersIn order to save investors the time-consuming process of identifying the best performing MedTech stocks, we have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener.We have selected stocks that have a favorable Growth Style Score of A or B and carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

470,HCA,"HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) has been witnessing consistent growth in its revenue base. In the past five years, revenues have recorded a compound annual growth rate of nearly 7% on the back of organic and inorganic strategies. For 2017, it expects revenues to range within $43-$44 billion, reflecting 4% year-over-year growth.The Nashville, TN-based company has been growing through buyouts over past many years. In 2017, its two major acquisitions of Florida and Texas hospitals from Community Health Systems, Inc (CYH  -  Free Report) are worth a mention.  These deals have boosted patient volumes and expanded network across several markets. The company’s strong financial position has supported its inorganic initiatives. HCA Healthcare has witnessed impressive cash flow generation over years enabling it to deploy capital in the most effective manner. The company has been paying dividends at regular intervals. It has also been taking up share buyback programs to enhance return to investors.However, lately, the company’s commercial business has been facing challenges from declining volumes of admissions. Its international business is also under pressure due to a fall in admissions in Middle East and London. High level of bad debt is also a major headwind for the company.Further, it also suffers from the prevailing industry-wide softness in volumes. Factors such as payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, and increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are driving away volumes.The company also faces challenges due to the constant uncertainty stemming from President Trump and the Republican Congress’ efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. The recent tax bill that ends the “individual mandate” (which required most Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a fine) is also expected to result in higher uninsured rate going forward. Moreover, as continued losses from public exchanges led the health insurers to scale back their participation from exchanges, the uninsured rate continues to increase, hurting the company. Other players in the industry like Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) and Tenet Healthcare Corporation. (THC  -  Free Report) are also victims of this political uncertainty.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

471,HCA,"We expect HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) to surpass expectations in fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 30.The company surpassed estimates in one of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 0.4%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that HCA Healthcare has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: HCA Healthcare has an Earnings ESP of +0.24%.

Price and EPS Surprise HCA Healthcare, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | HCA Healthcare, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: HCA Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP as stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the Better-Than-Expected EarningsThe company’s revenues have been rising over the past few years on the back of accretive acquisition of other hospitals. Continuing the trend, patient admissions are expected to grow further in the fourth quarter, driving the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total admissions, one of the key revenue drivers, (representing the total number of patients admitted to the company’s hospitals and is a general measure of inpatient volume) is 497,000, which reflects year-over-year growth of 4.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for in patient revenue per admission is pegged at $13,433, up 2.5% year over year.The company has been deploying capital in terms of share repurchases to enhance investors’ value. Share buyback programs taken up during the fourth quarter are likely to favor the bottom line, limiting the share count.However, the company’s fourth-quarter results are expected to suffer from the industry-wide softness in volumes. Factors like payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, and increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are likely to lower volumes.Operating expenses per equivalent admission are also likely to increase in the fourth quarter driven by higher admissions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies from the health care sector that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in the fourth quarter:Centene Corp.

472,HCA,"For Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC  -  Free Report), a leading health care services company in the United States, 2017 was not a good year.  Having suffered from falling revenues, weak volumes, high bad debts and overall industry weakness, the company’s performance was weak.The stock has lost 14% in a year’s time, underperforming the industry’s decline of 0.7%.The company’s performance pales all the more compared to other hospital stocks like HCA Holdings, Inc (HCA  -  Free Report) and Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) that have gained 9.7% and 2.1%, respectively, over the same periodWhat Affected 2017?The company incurred losses in the last two quarters owing to lower revenues and higher expenses. The last quarter, however, suffered from the adverse impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Tenet Healthcare’s revenues have been continuously declining over last two quarters due to reduced admissions, inpatient and outpatient surgeries, emergency department visits and total outpatient visits. At the end of the first nine months of 2017, revenues declined nearly 4% year over year.The downtrend in revenues was due to the high deductible plans that result in more out-of-pocket expenses of the patients. Increase in uninsured rates due to the uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act also caused a reduction in volume of patients. This apart, the company also suffered from lower payer rates and increased bad debt. Lower net revenues combined with increased operating expenses adversely impacted its margin.Tenet Healthcare has been facing a continuous increase in its debt level over the past many years. The company uses a large portion of its cash flow to pay the interests on its debts, which in turn, lead to limited funds available for its operations, growth initiatives or capital expenditures. The cash flow started declining since 2016 and the company lowered its expectation for 2017. Tepid Guidance for 2017 and 2018Following disappointing results in the last two quarters, the company lowered its guidance for the second time in 2017 at the end of the third quarter.  Tenet Healthcare projects revenues in the range of $18.9 billion to $19.1 billion for 2017, down 3% from the previously guided range of $19.1 billion to $19.4 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for 2017 are projected in the range of 59 cents to 74 cents, down 26% from the earlier projection of 69-99 cents.Tenet Healthcare expects the recently enacted “Tax Cut and Jobs Act” law to affect its 2018 earnings as well. The company now anticipates adjusted diluted earnings per share to range between 58 cents and 97 cents compared with the previously guided range of $1.07-$1.36. For 2018, it expects net operating revenues to range within $17.8 billion to $18.2 billion. This also compares unfavorably with $18.9-$19.1 billion guided for 2017.Does 2018 Look Promising?Tenet Healthcare recently announced that it will be undertaking three additional initiatives as an extension to its goal to improve the overall financial performance and enhance shareholders’ value. These initiatives include strengthening of its previously announced cost reduction plan, updating the ongoing process of its board refreshment and finding a buyer for its Conifer segment.The company’s cost reduction initiatives are expected to help it lower annual operating expenses by $250 million, with annualized run-rate savings to be achieved by 2018 end.The company’s accretive acquisitions and strategic divestitures are also expected to fine tune its operations in 2018, but the immediate impact of it on earnings is hard to predict.Despite these growth initiatives undertaken by the company, its shares are likely to remain under pressure until the actual earnings number reveal some positive developments.Downward Estimate RevisionThe company has also seen downward estimate revision over the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has been revised downward by 14.3% over the same time frame, reflecting bearish analyst sentiment.Zacks Rank and A Stock to ConsiderTenet Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the medical sector is Centene Corp (CNC  -  Free Report). The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

473,HCA,"Year 2017 was a dull one for Community Health Systems, Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report), a leading operator of general acute care hospitals in communities across the country.What Were the Dampeners in 2017?The company suffered from lower-than-expected volumes, payer rates, along with increased bad debt. The lower net revenue combined with increased operating expenses negatively impacted its EBITDA and EBITDA margin.On a same-store basis, net operating revenues for the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017 decreased 0.3%. Both same-store inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions decreased 1.9% year over year for the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017.For the first nine months of 2017, Community Health’s cash flows declined nearly 24% year over year led by the timing of payments for payroll,  decline in cash received from HITECH and other decreases, including divestitures and working capital changes.In the face of continued volume challenges and high operating costs, the reduction in guidance was disappointing. For 2017, it now expects revenues between $15.8 billion and $15.9 billion (compared with $15.85 billion and $16.05 billion projected earlier), and loss per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.30 (compared with loss of 30-40 cents expected previously).These headwinds weighed on its stock, which lost 24% in 2017, underperforming the industry’s growth of 6.8%. Its performance compared unfavorably with other players in the same space like HCA Healthcare Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Services Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report), which gained 18.7% and 6.6%, respectively.Will 2018 Turn Out to be Better?Community Health undertook a 30-hospital divestiture plan with the aim of streamlining its business and using the proceeds to repay its huge debt load.The company is focusing on future growth and margin expansion. This includes strategies such as service line enhancements, physician practice development, incremental outpatient access points, investments in the behavioral health and post acute space, and the expansion of new transfer program initiative.The initiatives are aimed at reducing operating expenses and increasing patient volumes. Though Community Health expects to see some progress on this front in the fourth quarter and in 2018, we remain on the sidelines til the progress is reflected in its earnings.Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 was revised to loss of 86 cents per share from a loss of 62 cents per share in the last 60 days. This movement reflects analysts’ pessimism over the stock, which is likely to exert downward pressure on its share price going ahead.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCommunity Health carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Centene Corp.

474,HCA,"The year gone by was a dull one for Franklin, TN-based Acadia Healthcare Company Inc. (ACHC  -  Free Report) that provides behavioral health care services in the United States and the United Kingdom.What Were the Drags in 2017?This behavioral healthcare company is faced with anemic U.K. operations, which is suffering from low census and a tightening labor market for nurses and other clinical staff. These factors caused a 9.5% and 21% decline in the segment’s revenues and EBIDTA, respectively, for the first nine months of 2017.     In the face of continued volume challenges and high operating costs, the reduction in guidance was disappointing. For 2017, it now expects revenues between $2.82 billion and $2.83 billion (versus $2.85 billion and $2.87 billion), and EPS in the range of $2.23 to $2.25 (versus $2.42 to $2.47).Another concern is its high leverage. The company’s long-term debt has increased consistently for the past many years, leading to an increase in interest expense. At the end of 2016, long-term debt increased 48% year over year to $3.25 billion. Though it moderated slightly to $3.23 as of Sep 30, 2017, it remains at high levels. Its debt-to-capital ratio remains to the south of 55%. Such high debt levels may limit the company’s expansion plans and aggravate risks. Higher interest expense on debt is also expected to impact profits.These headwinds have weighed on its stock which lost 0.8% in 2017, underperforming the industry’s growth of 6.4%. Its performance pales all the more, relative to other players in the same space like HCA Healthcare Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Services Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report), which gained 18.7% and 6.6%, respectively.Will 2018 be Better?We do not expect any improvement in the company’s U.K. operations in the near term. Management anticipates pressure in the labor market to continue due to uncertainty around Brexit which is discouraging healthcare workers from coming to the country, consequently forcing the company to rely more on agency labor to fill its open positions.Also, the low admissions witnessed in the third quarter did not show up in October, making  management to expect soft volumes in the fourth quarter.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAcadia Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

475,HCA,"Stoking growth in the U.S. economy further, the February job growth data marked the best in more than one-and-a-half years.  U.S. employers added 313,000 jobs in February, after an upwardly revised 239,000 in January and surpassing market expectations of 200,000 jobs.The rate of unemployment was 4.1% — unchanged from the prior month's 17-year low and slightly above market expectations of 4%. The average workweek recovered to 34.5 hours from 34.4 hours in January.Though wage growth rose 0.1% to $26.75 in February, marking a slowdown from the 0.3% rise in January, some economists do not view this as a concern. Per Reuters, this group of economists believes that wage growth has actually been stronger than indicated by average hourly earnings, which appears more volatile on a monthly basis.Against this backdrop, it is intriguing to look at the sectors that have generated the highest number of jobs. Below we highlight those sectors and stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) from each of the sectors.Construction Per tradingeconomics, construction created 61,000 jobs.

476,HCA,"For this Global Week Ahead, let’s rank five world market themes put out by Reuters in London.To start, I thought the latest five themes showed no compelling events.In lieu of that, what is there to watch most closely?That falls to a more subtle variety of factors – a possible inflation surprise, tariff fallout, ECB talk and FX volatility.Inside the USA, there are two key matters. First, traders should watch out for any change in U.S. consumer inflation on Tuesday. This reading may cause the biggest reaction in stock markets this week. Second, traders should watch out for U.S. tariff fallout. That can also introduce downside pressures.Outside the USA, watch out for Mario Draghi speaking on monetary policy and watch two currencies — the U.K. pound and the Hong Kong dollar.Below, I list the five themes in order of importance.(1) Watch the markets when U.S. Consumer Inflation hits on TuesdayWall Street is demonstrating a heightened sensitivity to any sign of rising prices, worried it might result in more aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed. So U.S. consumer price data for February will be closely watched on Tuesday.It’s worth remembering that recent stock market tumbles kicked off when January’s jobs data stoked inflation fears by reporting the biggest wage gain in more than 8-1/2 years. February’s employment report released on Friday showed the strongest job growth in more than 1-1/2 years, but a slowdown in wage gains.U.S. CPI rose 2.1 percent year-on-year in January, and a punchy 0.5 percent month-on-month. Stock markets could again come under pressure if the February data show inflationary pressures are building, with investors moving toward pricing four Fed hikes this year rather than three.(2) Watch out for U.S. Tariff internal friction and external falloutIt’s said a war has no winners. That certainly applies to trade wars. In the United States, initiator of the latest battle, big trade and budget deficits make the dollar vulnerable, as does the fact that the Fed (unlike its European and Japanese counterparts) can cut interest rates if things get too nasty. S&P500 companies earn half their profits overseas and will likely suffer from any outbreak of trade hostilities.But others may be harder hit. Many reckon the dollar will decline less than during the 2002 steel wars — its current account gap is smaller and growth is stronger.What about others? The currencies of small, open, developed economies such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia will fall, while emerging markets will suffer if global economic and trade growth slows.Metals tariffs alone won’t much dent China, South Korea, Taiwan or India — steel exports to the United States comprise 0.2 percent of Korea’s GDP for instance. But an escalation to other sectors will hurt, first via equity outflows that then feed into currencies, especially if the dollar firms.The markets of trade-reliant countries, such as Korea and Taiwan, should be hurt more than domestic-focused ones such as India or Brazil.(3) Watch out for any cues on ECB Monetary Policy Normalization  Central banks’ journey back to something resembling policy normalization went up a gear last week when the ECB dropped its pledge to increase QE if needed.Mario Draghi soothed any market concerns in his subsequent press conference, stressing that policy will remain super-loose. This was enough to push the euro, bond yields and bond spreads back down again.But despite Draghi’s ‘softly softly’ approach, it looks like the beginning of the end of the ECB’s post-crisis measures is in sight. The question for markets now is how quickly or slowly the ECB moves.On the other hand, Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda quashed creeping speculation the BOJ could tighten policy soon, signaling his readiness to ramp up stimulus if need be.Draghi and several other ECB officials are scheduled to speak this week, so there will be further guidance on the pace of change ahead.There are no speeches from Fed officials scheduled this week, while Jerome Powell heads his first policy meeting as Fed Chair in the following week.(4) Watch the U.K. Pound: Brexit news is an underlying driverSterling started 2018 with its best monthly performance against the dollar since 2009. But renewed uncertainty about whether Britain and the European Union can agree on their future trading relationship has undermined the pound’s rally in recent weeks, despite a more hawkish central bank.Next week could prove crucial for investors unsure how to trade the pound, given the relative resilience of the UK economy and a stream of negative Brexit headlines.UK finance minister Philip Hammond gives his half-yearly update on the economy on Tuesday amid an improvement in public finances but nervousness about the outlook.Traders will also be looking closely for progress in talks with the EU to believe a Brexit transition deal — which Britain has said it will unveil in late March — will not be delayed.Edgy traders briefly pushed the pound to a three-month low versus the euro on Wednesday as the EU rejected Britain’s proposed trade deal. Against the dollar, sterling was largely unmoved by this week’s Brexit headlines and is stuck trading around $1.3860, five cents below its post-Brexit-vote peak hit in January.With the market pricing in an 80 percent probability of a Bank of England rate hike for May, the risk is that a delayed transition deal stays the BoE’s hand to tighten policy. Given Britain’s large trade deficit, its vulnerability to an extended trade war could also weigh on the pound.(5) Watch the Hong Kong Dollar: It has fallen to a 33-year lowThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate isn’t where you would normally expect to see too much movement.It’s confined to a trading band set and managed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. But this week the currency fell to a 33-year low, and markets are on high alert for HKMA intervention as it approaches the weaker end of its 7.75-7.85 trading band against the U.S. dollar.Hitting 7.85 would force the HKMA to mop up some of the excess liquidity and narrow the interest rate gap that has pushed the spread between Hong Kong and U.S. interbank rates to its widest since the 2008 financial crisis.The HKMA last intervened to defend the HK dollar’s peg in FX markets in 2015. While it sold bonds last year to mop up some cash, it has been absent this time. An attack on the trading band is unlikely to succeed however; the HKMA has some $500 billion in firepower.The question is, will the market correct itself or will the HKMA be compelled to hold regular liquidity draining operations? For investors, there is no precedent to lean on.As a gateway to Asian economies, money keeps pouring into Hong Kong and the territory is unlikely to suffer a shortage of cash any time soon even if some Chinese money moves back to the mainland.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report): This is a $45B market cap stock in the Medical Services industry, with a long-term Zacks VGM score of A.Last week, Cigna offered to buy the company.

477,HCA,"Investors generally gauge a stock’s potential return by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it’s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or the appropriate benchmark.If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 over a period of one to three months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies.

478,HCA,"With the U.S. tax reform looking more realistic, the global investing world is rejoicing the expected move. However, all is not rosy for the investing landscape. There are certain areas that maybe troubled if the tax reform is passed with the current proposals. Below we highlight those areas (read: Senate Passes Tax Bill: 5 ETFs to Buy Now).Hospital Provisions in both the House and Senate tax bills would adversely impact hospitals. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R.1) ""would eliminate hospitals' ability to access low-cost capital financing through tax-exempt private-activity bonds and advance refunding bonds"". ""In addition, the bill would impose a 20% excise tax on pay for certain nonprofit hospital employees,"" as quoted on healthleadersmedia.com.With about 80% of community hospitals not-for-profits, the pressure on the sector is now understandable. These hospitals manage billions of investments through the tax-exempt municipal bond market.Now, like most analysts and industry experts, we too believe that non-or-limited accessibility to private activity bonds or tax-exempt muni bonds may keep hospitals away from investing in newer technologies. Maybe patients will have to bear higher costs for their treatments.Hospital stock HCA Holdings Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) may bear the brunt of the likely tax reform. On the ETF front, healthcare providers fund iShares US Healthcare Providers (IHF  -  Free Report) or medical devices fund iShares US Medical Devices (IHI  -  Free Report) fall under the losers’ list.Renewable Energy Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power may have expanded rapidly in recent years on declining costs and rising importance of the usage of sustainable energy.  A still-vague provision of the tax bill — “part of a provision to limit tax deductions for certain overseas activities — threatens a financing mechanism that generated $13 billion in investment in U.S. renewable energy this year,” as per energy research firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance.This provision may put pressure on the growing prospect of the renewable energy. Solar stocks like Vivint Solar Inc. (VSLR  -  Free Report) and JinkoSolar Holding Co. Ltd. (JKS  -  Free Report) may be at knifepoint now. As a whole, funds like First Trust ISE Global Wind Energy Index Fund (FAN  -  Free Report), Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Cleantech Portfolio (PZD  -  Free Report) may be under pressure (read: Q3 Earnings Effect: 5 Hottest ETF Charts).Private Equity The tax package that passed the House is likely to eliminate the deduction on tax-exempt private activity bonds as removing the program would result in about $40 billion of savings for the government over a decade.Threat to the private equity industry is like come in another form. The tax reform, if materialized, would cut the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% and “allow companies to instantly deduct the costs of new investments in equipment for a period of five years.” So, companies will now require less private equity fund for capital spending unlike they did it before.Moreover, some private equity firms mainly use debt to finance acquisitions and some hold highly-indebted companies. Now, with a provision of “proposed cap on the tax deductibility of interest payments exceeding 30 per cent of income,” these private equity companies with heavy debt exposure will feel the pressure, as per an article on Financial Times.All these will likely make “buying and selling US companies harder” in the coming days for private equity firms. Thus, PowerShares Global Listed Private Equity ETF (PSP  -  Free Report) should be closely watched.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

480,HCA,"Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter results after market closes on Nov 6, 2017.Last quarter the company’s loss came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This underperformance primarily stemmed from a decline in California Provider Fee revenues reduced electronic health record incentives. Let us see how things are shaping for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s third-quarter earnings are likely to be affected by lower revenues and higher expenses associated with hurricanes Harvey and Irma. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover, along with other hospital companies like Universal Health Services, Inc (UHS  -  Free Report), HCA Holdings, Inc (HCA  -  Free Report) and LifePoint Health Inc (LPNT  -  Free Report) that have reported so far, Tenet Healthcare’s earnings are likely to reflect the industry-wide softness in volumes.Factors such as payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are driving away volumes and the same is likely to be seen in the quarter.  These might result in lower admissions leading to a decline in patient revenues.Admissions also must have been adversely affected by the hurricanes that tore into parts of United States. However, the company’s Ambulatory segment has been performing well over past many quarters. Tenet Healthcare expects third-quarter revenues to benefit from the segment’s performance.Tenet Healthcare’s cost management program comprised primarily of headcount reductions and the renegotiation of contracts with suppliers and vendors. Its enterprise-wide cost reduction initiatives are likely to reduce the level of expenses and favor margins.Further, shares bought back by the company in the third quarter will aid the bottom line.Tenet Healthcare Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Tenet Healthcare Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Tenet Healthcare Corporation QuotePreliminary ResultsRecently, the company announced preliminary results for the to-be-reported quarter. It expects to report revenues of approximately $4.6 billion, down 3% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be approximately $507 million, down 11% year over year. For the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA is likely to be negatively impacted by lower revenues and higher expenses associated with Harvey and Irma, lower-than-anticipated revenues from the Texas Medicaid Waiver program and the Florida Medicaid program.Tenet Healthcare expects to report an adjusted net loss of approximately $17 million, or 17 cents per diluted share. This compares unfavorably with adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share generated in the year-ago quarter.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

483,HCA,"Third-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Oct 26, 229 S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers.Per the latest Earnings Preview, third-quarter results of the 229 S&P 500 members account for 48.1% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies are up 7.7% year over year on 5% rise in revenues, with 75.5% beating earnings per share estimates and 65.1% topping revenue estimates.Healthcare Sector TrendsThe sector has been in the spotlight ever since Donald Trump became the President. Trump’s intention to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, has resulted in an uncertain future for the whole sector. As a result, the medical stocks continue to be in focus.Players in the healthcare industry have largely benefitted from a surge in membership fuelled by the Healthcare Reform. Third quarter is expected to witness an increase in enrollment across Government programs particularly Medicaid and Medicare. While Medicaid sales is driven by Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, Medicare  is in huge demand from the growing population of baby boomers.Earnings for players in the hospital industry are likely to reflect the softness in volumes persisting throughout the industry. Factors such as payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are driving away volumes and the same is likely to be seen in the quarter.Nevertheless, aggressive inorganic strategies helped the players achieve fast-paced growth. In addition, new product launches, improving service, expansion into ancillary businesses and expense management strategies are expected to add to the top line.Moreover, the companies face headwinds  like the rising level of bad debt, demand for increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions that are likely to put pressure on the bottom line.Let’s take a sneak peek into the expected performance of three medical stocks that are scheduled to report earnings on Oct 31.Aetna Inc.’s( (AET  -  Free Report) third-quarter results are expected to witness a decline in Health Care segment revenues due to lower contribution from Commercial health insurance partly offset by premium increase in Government business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $14.4 billion, down 4% year over year.Medical Benefit Ratio is expected to increase in the quarter, owing to an unfavorable performance in individual Commercial products and suspension of the health insurer fee. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 84%, up from 82% in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total medical membership, one of the key drivers of revenues is 22.14 million, down 4.2% year over year. The decline is likely to be due to lower membership in the company’s public exchange compliant Individual and Small Group products.However, the company’s continuous focus on managing costs is likely to reduce its operating expenses.Our proven model shows that Aetna has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that significantly increases the chances an earnings beat.

The same is expected to be seen in the to-be-reported quarter.The quarter is also likely to see increased interest expenses as a result of increased borrowings related to the merger and incremental term-loan borrowings to fund recent acquisitions. This, in turn, will dent its operating marginsHowever, we expect to see an increase in revenues from the company's Physician Services segment, driven by synergy from recent acquisitions and organic growth. Revenue growth is expected to come from higher patient volumes and improved pricing.Coming to our quantitative model, Envision Healthcare has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -10.98%. Hence, our proven model can not conclusively say that Envision Healthcare is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions (read more: Will High Costs Dent Envision Healthcare  Q3 Earnings?).Envision Healthcare Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Envision Healthcare Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Envision Healthcare Corporation QuoteHCA Healthcare, Inc.’s (HCA  -  Free Report) third-quarter results are expected to reflect the prevailing industry-wide softness in volumes.However, the company’s patient admissions are likely to be sustain on the back of organic and inorganic growth measures.

484,HCA,"HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, before the opening bell.The company has an impressive surprise history. It surpassed estimates in two of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.6%.Q3 ExpectationsWe expect earnings to reflect the prevailing industry-wide softness in volumes. Factors such as payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, and increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are driving away volumes. The same is likely to be seen in the quarter.Patient admissions will, however, be sustained on the back of organic and inorganic growth measures. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total admissions, one of the key revenue drivers, (represents the total number of patients admitted to the company’s hospitals and is a general measure of inpatient volume) is 483,000, which reflects year-over-year growth of 2.8%.Shares bought back by the company in the third quarter will cushion the bottom line. The company has not paid regular dividend since its IPO in 2011. It prefers share buyback over dividend payment for allocating capital and will maintain this policy.Preliminary ResultsRecently, the company announced preliminary financial and operating results for the to-be-reported quarter. It reported revenues of approximately $10.7 billion, up 4.1% year over year and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.8 billion, down 9.2% year over year. Earnings per share of $1.21 per share reflected a decline 25% year over year.  The results bore the impact of recent hurricanes, which caused loss of $140 million in some of the company’s major markets.Same facility admissions in the third quarter increased 0.6%, while same facility equivalent admissions increased 0.3% year over year. Same facility emergency room visits increased 0.3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for same facility equivalent admissions points to an increase of 0.5%.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that HCA Healthcare is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

486,HCA,"The most common strategy is to invest in risky stocks with the hope of lucrative returns. The strategy works well only when the market is bullish, but investors should prepare mentally for the opposite scenario.We have created a strategy which clearly shows that handsome returns could also be earned from stocks that are less volatile than the market. Meaning of BetaBeta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market (we are considering the S&P 500 here). That is, beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market.If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market. So, a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1.For example, if the beta is 1.8 then the stock will witness 80% more movement than the market.  Hence, we can say that if the market goes up, the stock will outperform by 80%. Conversely, if the market plunges, the stock will lose much more value than the market.Building a Low-Risk PortfolioIn order to find stocks with lower-than-market volatility, we added beta between 0 and 0.6 as our main criterion for screening. However, we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in a volatile market. Hence to reach the winning strategy, we have considered a few additional criteria.Percentage Change in Price in the last 4 Weeks: We considered those stocks that saw positive price movement over the last month.Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable.Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Here are five of the eight stocks that fit the bill:Headquartered in Denton, TX,Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. (SBH  -  Free Report) is the leading provider of professional beauty products. The company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 2.7%.

487,HCA,"With smart investment becoming the buzzword in today’s investment world, millennials are frequently inclining toward hybrid investment patterns rather than traditional pure play theories like value or growth.The logic behind this is the effectiveness of a mixed investment strategy as value or growth investing approaches come with their own share of pitfalls. A pure play value investor misses the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long-term prospects. The same way, growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks. In other words, to make a long-term investment more effective, the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined.The quest for a mixed investment strategy led to the introduction of the GARP (growth at a reasonable price) approach. What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).One of the fundamental metrics for finding GARP is the price/earnings growth ratio (PEG). Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives the idea of stocks, which are trading at a discount, PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it, helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn't consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1  or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%:Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B:Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screening:Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report): The company focuses on the development and commercialization of a wide range of products including human and animal biologic as well as small molecule medicines and vaccines, along with consumer health care products. Apart from a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of B, the company also has an impressive expected five-year growth rate of 7.7%.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report): This is a leading healthcare diagnostics company, providing comprehensive clinical laboratory services and end-to-end drug development support.

(HRC  -  Free Report): This renowned medical device company partners with health care providers by focusing on patient care solutions that improve clinical and economic outcomes in five core areas: Advancing Mobility, Wound Care and Prevention, Clinical Workflow, Surgical Safety and Efficiency and Respiratory Health.

488,HCA,"Tenet Healthcare Corporation (THC  -  Free Report) announced the sale of its MacNeal Hospital and its associated operations to Loyola Medicine, an affiliate of Trinity Health.The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2018. It marks one of the many steps taken by the company to reorganize its business, which is suffering from a decline in admissions, inpatient and outpatient surgeries, emergency department visits and total outpatient visits, and high bad debt.Last month, the company reshuffled its top brass in an effort to steer the company toward growth. The changes included the resignation of its CEO Trevor Fetter, effective Mar 15, 2018 or earlier when the company finds a suitable replacement. The company is also reviewing its board composition to sharpen management’s expertise in areas required for its long-term growth.Tenet Healthcare posted loss in the last two quarters and missed earnings estimates in three quarters in a row prior to that. The company has also reduced its earnings guidance for 2017 after lackluster performance in first-half 2017.In a year's time, the stock has lost 37.3% compared with the industry’s decline of 13.3%.The company is making continuous improvement in its business portfolio by exiting non-core and least profitable business lines. Recently, the company completed the sale of its Huston-based hospitals and related operations to HCA Healthcare Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report).The proceeds from the sale of its units are being used to repay debt to lower its interest burden and strengthen balance sheet. The funds are also being invested in growth areas, such as its Ambulatory platform in which the company is targeting $100 million to $150 million in acquisition opportunities every year.Other actions to restore profitability include expense reduction via managing pricing and cost, integrating recent acquisitions, building facilities by expanding access points for patients and investing in key service lines.Though these actions will help the company’s hospitals to expand their market share for both inpatient and outpatient services over the long term, short-term business volumes remain challenged.The hospital industry is suffering from low patient admissions as they are increasingly choosing to stay away from hospitals due to high out-of-pocket (which shift the initial costs to patients) costs. Also, a pullback of insurers from public exchanges has increased the uninsured rate, which in turn is hurting the company. Given continued uncertainty over the future of Obamacare, the present scenario is likely to continue in the quarters ahead which will drain the company’s business volumes.Some players like Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report) and United Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) are suffering from industry weakness.Universal Health missed second-quarter earnings estimates and cut its 2017 earnings guidance. Community Health on the other hand incurred loss in the second quarter and reduced its 2017 earnings guidance.Tenet Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

489,HCA,"On Feb 19, we issued an updated research report on Luminex Corp. (LMNX  -  Free Report). While balanced growth across all business segments instills confidence on the stock, reimbursement issues remain a major hurdle.In the fourth quarter, this manufacturer and marketer of biological testing technologies for life sciences and diagnostics industry recorded strong top-line performance, solid cash flow and higher revenues. The company rides high on assay revenues, which grew 13.9% year over year in the quarter. Furthermore, revenues increased almost 8.2% year over year to $78.2 million.Moreover, gross margin expanded 318 basis points (bps) to 64.4%, while operating margin improved a whopping 1118 bps to 14.4%.Of late, Luminex has been receiving a series of regulatory approvals for its flagship ARIES system. The FDA has approved the ARIES Group B Strep assay. In the recent past, the fourth and fifth FDA clearances for ARIES Bordetella and ARIES C. Difficile assays are also worth a mention. Luminex also gained CE-IVD mark for Norovirus and C. Difficile.Recently, the company witnessed significant developments in its VERIGENE platform. On the international front, Japan's Central Social Insurance Medical Council has approved the recommendation by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to provide reimbursement for two VERIGENE assays — The Gram-Positive Blood Culture (BC-GP) test and the Gram-Negative Blood Culture (BC-GN) test.In the past year, Luminex has underperformed the broader industry. The stock has returned 7.8%, compared with the industry’s rally of 23.5%.  Additionally, the company may be impacted by changes to the reimbursement landscape. It has been experiencing a drop in lab customer traffic, owing to the new molecular diagnostic code system established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This has also dented the company’s Assay revenues.Luminex operates in a market characterized by rapid and continuous technological innovation. Intense competition in the niche space adds to the woes.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLuminex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report), Haemonetics Corporation (HAE  -  Free Report) and HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report). Each of these stocks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Centene projects long-term growth rate of 14.4%. In the last six months, the stock has returned 16.3%.Haemonetics has an expected long-term growth rate of 10.8%. In the past month, the stock has returned 4.9%.HCA Healthcare has an expected long-term growth rate of 11.5%. In the past month, the stock has returned 8.7%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

490,HCA,"A surge in inflation in January possibly leading to faster-than-expected rate hikes triggered a sudden panic among investors. But is inflation actually likely to tick up? Many economists believe that the spike in inflation last month will most probably fizz out. The rise in the consumer price index (CPI), especially on a year-on-year basis, remained sluggish. Meanwhile, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has been below the central bank’s 2% target since mid-2012. HAlso, wage growth in January doesn’t hint at a surge in the cost of living. This is because the growth was primarily due to seasonal factors that are not likely to last long.At the same time, stable economic conditions and an impressive Q4 earnings performance will certainly help the broader market move north. Major markets dispelled inflation fears and closed higher for the fifth straight session on Feb. 16, with the Dow closing above the coveted 25,000 mark.Fear Grips the MarketsConcerns about rise in inflation have certainly triggered the panic. Higher inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve to hike short-term interest rates at a faster pace than expected. This, in turn, will increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which could eventually lead to a slowdown in the economy. Lest we forget, an easy monetary policy helped the equity market notch a nearly nine-year bull run. The cost of auto insurance, rent, clothes, gasoline and health care rose in January. As per the Labor Department, the CPI inched up 0.5% in January from the previous month, its biggest increase in five months. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, the so-called core gauge went up 0.3%.Meanwhile, wage growth hit the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years, according to the Labor Department. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009.Why Did the Markets Overreact?Most market pundits, however, believe that the reports by the Labor Department are not as bad as they look. To begin with, CPI inflation stayed at 2.1% in January on a year-over-year basis. Thus, it has fallen from the nearly 3% annual growth rate in the last three months.Also, the  jump in the January CPI report was led by an uptick in the cost of auto insurance. But that was mostly because of an annual price hike that usually happens in the first month of a year. Another anomaly is that a considerable rise in the cost of apparel boosted the CPI. However, such an increase usually happens in January, only to recede later in the year.If we consider the volatile energy segment, oil prices have surged by one-third since mid-2017 to $66 per barrel, but have fallen below $60 this month and are likely to decline further this year.Coming to wage growth, the annual hourly gain might be a temporary blip. After all, wages rose on colder-than-normal weather condition, which is a seasonal factor. Further, if we exclude managers and supervisors’ salaries, then hourly wages increased just 2.4%, about the same sluggish pace as in previous months. This shows that much of the increase was not evenly distributed and concentrated mostly on managers.Fundamentals Remain StrongStrong economic growth and upbeat corporate earnings should boost investors’ sentiments for now. Consumers and businesses helped the U.S. economy expand at a healthy pace in the last three quarters. Consumer outlays improved on a steady job market and healthier household finances, while the recently-passed tax overhaul policy is expected to give spending a boost this year.For the 362 S&P 500 members that have reported results, earnings are up 14.5% from the same period last year on 9% higher revenues, with 78.2% beating EPS estimates and 75.4% surpassing revenue estimates. In fact, Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 13.9% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. This will follow the 6.7% earnings growth recorded in the third quarter of 2017 on 5.9% higher revenues.Time to Buy Growth Stocks: 5 Solid PicksGiven this bullishness, investing in growth stocks seems judicious.

493,HCA,"Earnings reports for the second-quarter are pouring in. Results from 97 of the 500 S&P companies out already paint a strong earnings picture, which is likely to look rosier over the course of this reporting cycle.Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for the S&P 500 members constituting 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization — reported so far are up 8.4% year over year on a 5.1% rise in revenues.

As of Jul 19, 3.6% of the total Medical sector reported second-quarter results. The beat ratio is strong with 100% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations.The sector has been in the limelight since the change of power at the White House. President Donald Trump, who is eager to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Act more popularly known as Obamacare, has injected a fresh dose of uncertainty. The stocks continue to be in focus as the “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” scenario plays out. A lot has been happening in this part of the medical sector with efforts to “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” failing to meet with much success and basically collapsing.In the meantime, the healthcare corner continues to benefit from patients gained under Obamacare. Players in the industry are also actively engaged in mergers and acquisitions to achieve fast-paced growth. New product launch, improving service, expansion into ancillary businesses, and cost control measures will accrue to the top line.Nevertheless, high bad debt, increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions will put pressure on the bottom line.Let’s take a peek at these healthcare companies that are gearing up to report their second-quarter results on Jul 25.HCA Healthcare, Inc.

494,HCA,"Mednax, Inc. (MD  -  Free Report) is suffering from a subdued pace of birth across the country, which has slowed growth of one of its core businesses — neonatology. This has put significant stress on its revenue growth.  Moreover, a change in payor mix in its anesthesiology business has kept its commercial volumes under pressure. This segment also suffers from growth in compensation expense for nurse anesthetists.Additionally, Mednax’s results have suffered due to huge investments made in diversification. These investments might create volatility in its quarter-over-quarter performance, before reaping long-term growth.Markedly, an increase in expenses as a proportion of revenues owing to growth in compensation expense for supporting acquisition-related growth curbed margins further. Also, growth in existing units, including compensation for non-physician clinicians, increased at a faster pace than in the previous periods.The company has been witnessing a dent in its bottom line led by a spike in its interest expenses for more than three years. It is also suffering from an increase in overall expenses, which has outpaced revenue growth compared with the last many years.These factors led the company to trim its earnings guidance. Mednax expects earnings per share (EPS) for three months (ending Sep 30, 2017) in the range of 66 cents to 71 cents, down from $1.04 per share in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EPS will likely be in the range of 83 cents to 88 cents, down from $1.09 per share in third quarter of 2016.The range for its third-quarter guidance assumes anticipated same-unit revenue of negative 2% to flat year over year. For the third quarter of 2017, the company expects EBITDA to decline by 17% to 21% year over year, against growth of 7.7% in the prior-year period.Per management, the challenges in its business are expected to continue in the near term. We thus expect shares of the company to remain under pressure in the coming quarters.Other companies in the same space HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report), LifePoint Inc. (LPNT  -  Free Report) and Universal Health Services Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) are all suffering from low patient admissions. This is because patients are increasingly choosing to stay away from hospitals due to high out-of-pocket (which shift the initial costs to patients) costs.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

495,HCA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, HCA Healthcare has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.3. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts HCA Healthcare’s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 12.9) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 13.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that HCA Healthcare has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 17.3, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, HCA Healthcare has a P/S ratio of about 0.7. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, HCA Healthcare currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes HCA a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for HCA Healthcare is just 1, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.3. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, HCA Healthcare is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though HCA Healthcare might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of B. This gives HCA a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen ten downward estimates revisions in the past sixty days and none upward, while the full year estimate has seen one upward revision and eleven downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 1.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has declined 0.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:HCA Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus HCA Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus | HCA Holdings, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineHCA Healthcare is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 7% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past six months, its industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

496,HCA,"Abiomed, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report) recently announced that its flagship Impella 2.5 and Impella CP heart-pumps have received Pre-Market Approval (PMA) from the FDA for expanded use. With this, the products will now be used during elective and urgent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures.Notably, this is the second PMA in a row for the devices, which was earlier granted by the FDA to treat heart failure associated with cardiomyopathy, leading to cardiogenic shock.Such consents affirm the effectiveness of Impella in patients diagnosed with severe coronary artery diseases, complex anatomy and additional ailments.ABIOMED, Inc. Price and Consensus  ABIOMED, Inc. Price and Consensus | ABIOMED, Inc. Quote The latest PMA for Impella to treat High Risk PCI was based on two studies by the FDA; PROTECT I and PROTECT II. The studies included treatment of patients with most severe conditions in the catheterization lab, with the majority being denied open-heart surgery.The data submitted to the FDA in support of the PMA included an analysis of 229 consecutive patients with mild to moderately-reduced ejection fraction (EF), who were also denied open-heart surgery, owing to surgical risk factors.The acclaim further validates this ‘first of its kind’ indication for High Risk PCI and the benefit of percutaneous hemodynamic support in treating severely complex patients with mild, moderate and severely depressed EF. Why Impella?The Impella 2.5 and Impella CP are the only percutaneous temporary ventricular support devices that the FDA has approved as safe and effective for High Risk PCI. Per the FDA, the devices provide temporary ventricular support (less than six hours). It was further stated that the use of the Impella platform may reduce hemodynamic instability, beside reducing peri- and post-procedural adverse events.US Cardiac Disease Trends and the Cardiovascular MarketPer a research conducted by American College of Cardiology, cardiovascular diseases account for approximately 800,000 deaths in the United States. More than 90 million Americans carry a diagnosis of this disease.According to Research and Markets, the Global Cardiovascular Implants Market is poised to grow at a CAGR of around 4.5% over the next decade.Price PerformanceIn the last six months, Abiomed has outperformed the industry in terms of price.

497,HCA,"HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, before the market opens.Last quarter, this hospital company posted in-line results. It has, however, surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 6.47%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackThe company’s commercial volumes have been stressed over the past few quarters. It has taken  efforts to build out its local networks and create greater patient access both from an outpatient facilities standpoint and a digital media standpoint to address the issue. We, however, don’t expect to see any major improvement in this business in the second quarter.Last quarter, the company reported the 12th consecutive quarter of equivalent admission growth for HCA and we expect the trend to continue in the second quarter.HCA Healthcare consistently makes capital expenditure for the expansion of services and capacity in its large fast growing urban markets. In 2016, it incurred $2.76 billion in this regard and expects to invest $2.9 billion in 2017. The company has also made a number of acquisitions over the past many years to expedite growth. We believe these investments will generate top-line growth by increasing business volumes.Share bought back by the company during the to-be reported will cushion the bottom line. The company has not paid regular dividend since its IPO in 2011. It prefers share buyback over dividend payment for allocating capital and will maintain its current policy on dividend payouts.HCA Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HCA Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | HCA Holdings, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that HCA Healthcare is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: HCA Holdings has an Earnings ESP of -2.78%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.75 per share, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: HCA Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies in the healthcare sector that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Gilead Sciences, Inc.

498,HCA,"Senate Republican leaders released a revised plan for President Donald Trump's health care reform, on Jul 13. The release was based on the The Republican administration’s vow to “repeal and replace” the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.Earlier, Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders had to suffer setbacks with the healthcare bill for the replacement of Obamacare after failing to garner enough votes to pass the bill.  A key concern with the new health care act is that a large number of Americans would lose coverage.The concern was further justified by a report issued by the Congressional Budget Office. According to the report, if the new act were to go through, 14 million people would be uninsured in 2018. The number is expected to increase to 21 million in 2020 and 24 million in 2026.For Republicans it is now a race against time as the scheduled summer recess is knocking at the door. However, plans have already been chalked to delay the process and pass the bill through Senate.  The GOP’s new plan proposes major changes versus its original proposal to replace Obamacare. These changes include allowing insurers to offer cheaper services, no frills policies, taxing the wealthy and extra funding for opioid. The revision was made in an effort to garner more conservative support. However GOP’S internal misgivings about the plan alongside steep democratic opposition have put a question mark on the fate of the revised bill.Effect on Hospital StocksThe question that arises now is whether hospital stocks stand to gain or lose on Capitol Hill. The market remained jittery for a major part of the week due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of the healthcare act. Hospital stocks, which were suffering after election results were announced on Nov 8, 2016, were lukewarm over the proposed changes. These stocks benefited significantly under Obamacare, given the rise in the number of people with health insurance coverage.Supporters for the Republican alternative argue that if the proposed changes are implemented, the sector would get paid for several services that earlier were free of charge. Opponents point out that the customer base would shrink as a significant chunk of the population would lose their healthcare coverage.We believe that major hospital stocks like Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report), HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report), LifePoint Health Inc. (LPNT  -  Free Report), Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC  -  Free Report) and Community Health Systems, Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report) will suffer immensely. The stocks will be affected because the no frills insurance policy would be akin to an increase in the uninsured rate. With bare bone insurance policies, patients will have less insurance coverage and must shell out from their pockets to avail of medical services. This would lead to an increase in bad debts.Medical - Hospital Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Hospital Industry 5YR % ReturnThe market perception can be gauged from the fact that only Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc.

500,HCA,"HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report), one of the most diversified hospital companies in the United States, has achieved growth via a number of acquisitions made over the past many years.Since its IPO in March 2011 and through the second quarter of 2017, the company spent more than $4.4 billion on acquiring a number of hospitals.The company is due to acquire two hospitals from Community Health Systems.These deals have led to an increase in patient volumes and enabled network expansion across several markets. The company’s acquisitions are expected to add scale to its business, positioning it better to weather the regulatory uncertainty in the healthcare sector.These purchases are backed by HCA Healthcare’s strong balance sheet and consistent increase in cash flows for a number of years. These also provide room for shareholder-friendly capital deployment through buy backs and dividend payouts.The company’s superior performance is reflective in its share price performance which has gained 5.9% year to date compared with the industry’s growth of 4.2%.Nevertheless, the company’s commercial business has recently been facing challenges from declining volumes of admissions. Its international business is also under pressure due to decline in admissions in Middle East and London.Driven by weakness in business volumes which is expected to persist in the coming quarters, the company narrowed its earnings guidance. It expects adjusted EBITDA of $8.35 billion to $8.5 billion (versus the previous expectation of $8.4 billion to $8.7 billion) and earnings per share of $7.00 to $7.30 for 2017 (versus $7.20-$7.60 expected earlier).The hospital industry is suffering from low admissions as patients are increasingly choosing to stay away due to high out-of-pocket (which shift the initial costs to patients) costs. Also, a pullback of insurers from public exchanges has increased the uninsured rate which in turn is hurting the company.  Given the continued uncertainty about the future of Obamacare, the present scenario is likely to continue in the quarters ahead and drain business volumes.Other players in the industry like Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report) and United Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) are also victims of political uncertainty.Universal Health missed second-quarter earnings estimates and cut its 2017 earnings guidance. Community Health incurred a loss in the second quarter and reduced its 2017 earnings guidance.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderHCA Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the health care space is Medpace Holdings, Inc. (MEDP  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Medpace surpassed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 9%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

501,HCA,"The Ensign Group, Inc. (ENSG  -  Free Report) has acquired the real estate and operations of two skilled nursing facilities in Arizona.These facilities include Desert Blossom Health and Rehabilitation Center, an 88-bed skilled nursing facility located in Mesa, AZ; and Pueblo Springs Rehabilitation Center, a 115-bed skilled nursing facility located in Tucson, AZ.The acquisition was effective Sep 1, 2017.With this acquisition, The Ensign Group will expand its portfolio to 229 facilities spread across 14 states. These include 63 owned, 21 hospice agencies, 18 home health agencies and three home care businesses.The Ensign Group is quite bent on achieving growth via inorganic means. Much of the company’s historical growth can be attributed to its expertise in acquiring real estate or leasing both under-performing and well-performing post-acute care operations. Subsequently, the company applies its core operating know-how to improve upon each acquired operation, both clinically and financially.Its stock price also reflects inorganic growth efforts that have aided its top-line growth. The company’s share price has gained 1.7% in the past one year, significantly outperforming the decline of 27% suffered by the industry it belongs to.In the last few years, the company expedited its acquisition activity, having added 108 facilities between Jan 1, 2012 and Dec 31, 2016. It spent nearly $281 million on acquisitions from 2014-2016.We expect to hear more acquisitions from the company going forward. Management disclosed that it is actively seeking additional opportunities to acquire real estate or to lease both well-performing and struggling skilled nursing, assisted living and other healthcare-related businesses across the United States.The skilled nursing industry, in which the company operates, is large and highly fragmented, characterized predominantly by numerous local and regional providers. This fragmentation creates significant acquisition and consolidation opportunities.The hospital industry is witnessing consolidation due to rising expenses, declining admissions, increasing bad debts and a flurry of regulatory actions. These are compelling the players to gain in scale for survival.  Recently, another player in the same space HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) announced that it will acquire Florida  hospital from Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report) and three Houston hospitals from Tenet Healthcare Corp.

502,HCA,"The U.S hospital industry of late has been suffering from weak patient admissions, soaring costs, high bad debts, regulatory hurdles, etc.Headwinds Faced by the Industry The industry is suffering from low admissions as patients are increasingly choosing to stay away from hospitals due to high out-of-pocket (which shift the initial costs to patients) costs. Though the industry gained from a decline in uninsured rates from the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the current scenario remains gloomy.Also, a pullback of insurers from public exchanges has increased the uninsured rate which, in turn, is hurting the players. Given the continued uncertainty about the future of ACA, the present scenario is likely to continue in the quarters ahead which will drain business volumes for the players.Major companies like Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC  -  Free Report), Acadia Healthcare, Inc. (ACHC  -  Free Report), Community Health Systems, Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report) have been witnessing gradual decline in their top line in the recent quarters.Rising trend in medical costs also continues to hurt the companies. Hospitals are consolidating to reduce costs and improve negotiating power with suppliers and payers.Noise Over ACA Repeal/ReplacePresident Donald Trump intended to repeal and replace the ACA as part of regulatory reform. However, the U.S Senate has rejected the bill resulting in uncertainty regarding the future of the deal. This is expected to affect the uninsured rates and weak patient volume in the United States.Industry Rank and Price Performance The hospital industry is currently ranked #204, which represents the bottom 23% of the Zacks Industry Rank.The weakness in the industry is also evident from the year-to-date return of 5.9% compared with 10.7% gain registered by the S&P 500 market.Growth ProspectsDespite these headwinds, from an investment standpoint, the U.S. hospital industry is likely to be transformed over the coming decades after the nullification of these short-term issues. New companies have started using technologically updated methods in treating patients. The regulatory reform is likely to settle down, going forward.Moreover, as the industry moves to a payment model that incentivizes consumer value, consumer becomes a more powerful decision maker. In addition, innovative medical devices are entering the market and making surgeries and diagnostics more efficient, removing costs from the system.Stocks to Bet OnWe bring to you four hospital stocks that outperformed the industry year to date, has a solid VGM Score and a favorable Zacks Rank.VCA, Inc.  carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

503,HCA,"CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) recently announced three major programs that will allow the company to share the tax benefit earned from the implementation of the latest U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with employees. This news comes on the heels of the company’s promising fourth-quarter 2017 results. Along with the results, the company exhibited unwavering commitment toward employees’ welfare.According to management, the improvement in employee wages and benefits totaled $425 million annually. These are long-term and compensation investments, expected to create growth opportunities for the company and its employees.The programs include the following three employee-focused investments:First, CVS Health will lift the starting wage rate to $11 an hour for hourly employees, effective April 2018. With a view to grow its retail stores into a healthcare destination, the company plans to adjust pay ranges and rates for many of its retail pharmacy technicians, front store associates and other hourly retail employees later this year. CVS Health Corporation Price and Consensus  CVS Health Corporation Price and Consensus | CVS Health Corporation Quote Second, the company wishes to consistently offer affordable healthcare services to workers by not increasing employee premiums for 2018-19, despite a 5% year-over-year rise in medical and prescription costs. CVS Health will absorb the entire increase for the 100,000 employees who are part of the company-sponsored health plan.Finally, a new paid parental leave plan will be put into effect starting April 1, 2018, for full-time employees. Per management, an employee who welcomes a new child can take up to four weeks away from work at 100% of their pay, so as to ensure proper care of the newborn.Additionally, management indicated that it will put the remaining benefits earned from tax savings back into the business.

505,HCA,"Community Health Systems, Inc.’s (CYH  -  Free Report) subsidiaries have closed the sale of two Washington hospitals and their associated assets to Regional Health. These divestitures are part of the company’s plans of selling 30 hospitals and generating funds to minimize its debt level. The hospitals divested were Yakima Regional Medical & Cardiac Center in Yakima and Toppenish Community Hospital in Toppenish.  A long-term softening in admissions has hit hospital companies. Community Health Systems is burdened with high level of long-term debt. Naturally, the company is taking resort to divestures to pay off its debts and focus on a more sustainable portfolio of hospitals and networks. Community Health Systems aims to reduce its debts by 2018. As of Jul 7, 2017 the company’s long-term debts stood at $14.25 billion. In the second quarter, Community Health Systems received $1.147 billion from the sale of its 20 hospitals. The company utilized $951 million from the sale proceeds to pay off its term loans.   Earlier, Community Health Systems had shown interest in divesting 30 of its hospitals, on which it had incurred comparatively lower bad-debt expense. The divestitures are estimated to generate $1.95 billion in proceeds.  In fact, the company announced that it would expand its divestiture program. It is planning to divest hospitals that account for at least $1.5 billion of net revenues and mid-single-digit EBITDA margins. Community Health Systems wants to focus on those hospitals that may generate volume growth, higher EBITDA margin, and better cash flow. The company has been aggressively divesting its assets, in a quest to reduce its long-term debts. In July 2017, the company entered into an agreement with HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) to sell the Weatherford Regional Medical Center in Texas. We expect these divestitures to help the company lower its debt burden. Zacks Rank and Share Price Movement Currently, Community Health Systems carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Shares of Community Health have gained 36.67% year to date, outperforming the industry's  gain of 4.65%. We expect the company’s portfolio restructuring to drive the shares.   Stocks to Consider A few better-ranked stocks from the hospital industry are Edward Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) and EnteroMedics Inc. , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Edward Lifesciences Corporation provides products and technologies to treat structural heart disease and critically ill patients worldwide.

506,HCA,"Tenet Healthcare Corporation (THC  -  Free Report) has announced that its chairman and CEO Trevor Fetter will quit his position of director and chief executive officer. This will be effective Mar 15, 2018, or earlier when the company finds a suitable replacement.Though Mr. Fetter will remain in his role, he will not be regarded as the most senior official.Among other changes, the company has appointed the current independent lead director Ronald A. Rittenmeyer as the executive chairman, effective immediately. He will also be regarded as the senior most official at the company till the new CEO holds reins.The company’s board composition will also be reviewed to sharpen management’s expertise in areas required for its long-term growth.The company has also implemented shareholder rights plan to protect net operating losses which were $1.7 billion as of Dec 31, 2016. This implies that the company will be able to save $600 million in tax at a 35% tax rate.This change in Tenet Healthcare’s leadership position comes at a time when it is in rough waters. The company’s results have been suffering from a decline in admissions, inpatient and outpatient surgeries, emergency department visits and total outpatient visits.This also caused the company to post loss in last two quarters and miss earnings estimates in three quarters in a row prior to that.Tenet Healthcare has also reduced its earnings guidance for 2017 after lackluster performance in first-half 2017.The stock has given a poor performance in past one year as evident by a loss of 29.1% compared with the industry’s loss of 4.2%.We believe it will be no mean task for the new leader to restore the company’s profitability. Though on a company-specific level, assets sales by management will help it to reduce high leverage but its top line will continue to be troubled by weak volume trends expected to continue throughout the industry.The hospital industry is suffering from low patient admissions as they are increasingly choosing to stay away from hospitals due to high out-of-pocket (which shift the initial costs to patients) costs. Also, a pullback of insurers from public exchanges has increased the uninsured rate which in turn is hurting the company.  Given the continued uncertainty about the future of Obamacare, the present scenario is likely to continue in the quarters ahead which will drain the company’s business volumes.Other players in the industry like HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report), Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH  -  Free Report), United Health Services, Inc. (UHS  -  Free Report) have been suffering from the industry weakness.HCA Healthcare and Universal Health missed the second-quarter earnings estimates and cut their 2017 earnings guidance.  Community Health on the other hand posted loss in the second quarter and reduced its 2017 earnings guidance.Tenet Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

508,HCA,"The volatility in the U.S. market continues with the Dow witnessing two massive falls of 1,175 points on Monday and 1,032 points on Thursday. Although a bleeding Dow managed to recover 1.4% on Friday, the market has entered correction territory. It goes without saying that investors are still jittery with almost $2.5 trillion wiped out last week.Inflationary fears are being fueled by the specter of likely faster rate hikes this year after January jobs data showed that U.S. workers experienced their largest year-over-year wage increase since 2009. That said, this might just be a passing phase, with strong U.S. economic fundamentals and yet another robust earnings season hinting at a brighter future.While it’s too early to predict the extent of volatility over the next few days, we can say for sure that there is ample room for stocks to rebound, a reason valid enough for investors to opt for value stocks on the dip.Is the Correction Over?The Dow declined more than 1,000 points twice last week, finally slipping into correction territory. All the three key U.S. indexes registered their worst weekly decline in two years after reaching their all-time high levels on Jan 26, following an increase in inflation and higher bond yields. The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq lost 5.2%, 5.2% and 5.1%, respectively.Rising bond yields faded the appeal of stocks, especially with valuations hovering at historically high levels. A tighter labor market, strong wage growth and prospects of rise in inflation raised rate hike prospects to as early as the Fed’s upcoming March meeting, which in turn weighed on investor sentiment. A higher rate environment, optimism surrounding steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices. However, despite significant losses experienced over the week, strong fundamentals that powered the prolonged market rally remain firmly in place. The volatility is likely to exist over the next few days but analysts and market watchers believe that this downslide is much like a short pause, one which could extend the duration of an unprecedented stretch of gains.Value Still a Concern, Rally Set to ContinueIn spite of the bloodbath and correction, we haven’t yet entered a bear market. Moreover, despite the 10% fall over last week, the picture might not be actually that gloomy. If we look at the five-year share price movement of FAANG companies, last week’s 10% fall is miniscule. While the share price of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) has increased 516.96% in the last five years, that of Amazon.com AMZN.MX and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) has escalated 411.4% and 130.52%, respectively. Similarly, share price of Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) has shot up a respective 864.96% and 166.17%. This state of affairs also indicates that it is only natural for overvaluations concerns to prevail. Markets have enjoyed an extended run of gains and recent reverses in a way have erased completely the ground covered in the past. Additionally, a strong economy and bullish earnings performances indicate that this phase will be short-lived.
