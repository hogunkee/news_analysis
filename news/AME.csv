4,AME,"SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 30.SAP has an excellent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 4% in the trailing four quarters. Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to Consider SAP has established itself as a trusted partner for business enterprises who seek to transform the entire landscape of operations including applications, cloud, business networks and platforms. With business enterprises leveraging on state-of-the-art technology to outshine peers, we believe that the company’s market leading portfolio will continue to witness increased demand, consequently supplementing the company’s financials. Over the past few quarters, the company has recorded spectacular growth in S/4HANA and other Cloud initiatives, which in turn, has provided a boost to financials. During third-quarter 2017, the company gained 600 customers, of which 40% was entirely new. The company anticipates demand for S/4 HANA to surge, which will prove conducive to operating profit and bottom-line growth in the to-be reported quarter. Further, the company’s strategic actions to reinforce thriving business network are likely to prove conductive to upcoming results.Moreover, the company’s human capital management applications are gaining tremendous popularity with several international organizations. Solid adoption of the company’s human capital management applications, led by SuccessFactors Employee Central, is expected to drive the results in the upcoming quarter. Further, cloud subscriptions and support revenues are anticipated to surpass software license revenues in 2018, thereby supplementing the company’s financial performance.However, the fact remains that dull prospects of the global IT industry in recent quarters, along with flat customer spending projections are adversely affecting the company’s performances. This apart, over the past few quarters, many of the company’s emerging markets have faced fiscal imbalances and general economic slowdowns, which adversely impacted purchasing power. Also, sluggishness in China might dent the IT spending in the country, which might reflect poorly on the upcoming quarterly results.Moreover, the inherent seasonality in technology spending on part of clients exposes the company’s sales to risks of quarterly fluctuations. Also, the IT services industry is characterized by stiff competition from technology behemoths, which in turn may also dampen the upcoming financials. This apart, currency fluctuations in many of its key markets are also likely to thwart sales for the fourth-quarter results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for SAP this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.78. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.SAP SE Price and EPS Surprise SAP SE Price and EPS Surprise | SAP SE QuoteZacks Rank: SAP has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of the ESP. However, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Aspen Technology, Inc.

We expect an update on the issue on the fiscal second-quarter conference call. Reduction in engineering, selling & administrative expenses are also expected to boost the bottom line.However, the company’s Communication Systems segment might struggle in the quarter, due to reduced sales of legacy international tactical radios.Harris Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Harris Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Harris Corporation QuoteWhat Does Our Model Indicate?Our proven model too shows that Harris Corp. is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.Zacks ESP: Harris Corporation has an Earnings ESP of +0.11%.

6,AME," Infosys Limited (INFY  -  Free Report) recently announced that A.S. Watson Group (ASW), the largest international health and beauty retailer in the world, has selected Infosys to accelerate its digital transformation initiatives. The collaboration aligns with ASW’s Technology Partnership Program, which focuses on developing strategic partnerships to augment the long-term goals.A.S. Watson Group selected Infosys as an Official Technology Partner to offer technology services across Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. The collaboration supports ASW’s customer strategy, DARE — to be Different, Anywhere, build Relationships and offer unique Experiences. Infosys’ services and technologies will help ASW accelerate its next-generation digital marketing platform, optimize operational efficiencies, build robust AI and Machine Learning frameworks as well as improve scalability & reusability across business units.Our TakeInfosys has been strengthening its core competencies by pursuing strategic collaborations and acquisitions that allow it to leverage emerging technologies in a mutually beneficial and cost-competitive manner. In past few quarters, the company has entered into several strategic collaborations with other technology biggies to boost digital, cloud, legacy modernization and automation business. Further, innovative actions like ‘Zero Bench’ program devised by the company to eliminate the notion of “bench” in the IT service industry are bolstering its internal strength.Moreover, the company’s “Renew New” program, which includes restructuring of customer-centric functions, streamlining of sales function and unification of delivery systems, is proving to be highly beneficial. These initiatives are allowing the company to counter major challenges. Moreover, its services and software are proving conducive to top-line growth. Strong demand for these relatively new services is helping the company to achieve higher growth as well as margin expansion. Notably, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s stock has appreciated 27.1% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 11.2%. Despite these positives, President Trump’s anti-immigration stance and escalating costs are likely to affect performance. The company’s growth momentum may be thwarted due to unfavorable political climate in the United States. In the past few months, the company has been struggling to adapt itself to the changing political climate in the region. This is a direct threat to the company’s economical cost structure, which focuses on using its workforce on sites located abroad.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Micron Technology, Inc.

8,AME,"TE Connectivity Ltd. (TEL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on Jan 24.TE Connectivity has an excellent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 9.7% in the trailing four quarters. The company recorded its eight consecutive earnings beat in the last reported quarter, surpassing estimates by 7.8%. In the quarter to be reported, the company is expected to report strong revenues in Transportation Solutions business, which constitutes more than half of its total revenues.We expect TE Connectivity to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that TE Connectivity has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: TE Connectivity has an Earnings ESP of +0.26%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.TE Connectivity Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise TE Connectivity Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | TE Connectivity Ltd. QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected ResultsTE Connectivity is now poised to grow on the back of strong demand in end markets, along with its overarching business model and continued progress on strategic priorities. The company’s Commercial transportation business is showing remarkable signs of progress, driven by the content expansion in the heavy truck market, especially in China. Growth in electronic content and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins bode well for its transportation business. Additionally, the sensor business is anticipated to see strong design win momentum, fueled by the growth of automotive space, which is likely to prove conductive to upcoming results.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Transportation Solutions segment in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains high at $1,867 million compared with fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of $1,844 million. However, revenues from Industrial Solutions segment are anticipated to be low sequentially, with an estimate of $869 million compared with reported revenues of $954 million in the prior quarter.Moreover, being a market leader in the connectivity and sensor business, the company is armed with a comprehensive portfolio that supplements its strength. About 80% of the company’s revenues are driven by harsh environment applications. Over the past five years, its harsh business applications have experienced mid-single digit growth, driving top-line growth. Going forward, we believe that this business will provide ample opportunities of margin expansion.This apart, the company’s ardent eye for acquisitions is anticipated to be conducive to core business, going forward. The company’s buyout of MicroGroup and agreement to acquire Hirschmann Car Communication enhanced its harsh environment portfolio and are expected to drive first-quarter fiscal sales as well.However, primarily dependent on end market dynamics the company’s business is subject to cyclical risks that the end markets suffer. Though the company has witnessed some stability in direct business with OEMs, poor sales through distribution channels are taking longer-than-expected recovery time, consequently hurting segmental performance. Additionally, the company’s weakness in commercial transportation market due to weak global construction and agriculture markets, along with weakness in the North America heavy truck markets, have been adding to woesFurther, sluggishness in oil and gas markets and its derivative impact on other industrial markets will likely act as strong headwinds for the company. Also, helicopter demand has also been impacted adversely, which can prove to be a drag on the company’s aerospace business. This apart, the company believes the supply chain inefficiencies can prove to be a drag on the earnings in the quarter under review.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Analog Devices, Inc.

Overall, Waters Corp. outpaced estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWaters Corp.’s key strengths include leading positions in the pharmaceutical market, broad global customer base and an impressive lineup of products. Particularly, Global pharmaceuticals business, which is the company’s largest single market and has been a major profit churner for the Waters Division in the past few quarters. We believe stable demand from pharmaceutical business, modest recovery of industrial markets as well as growth in recurring revenues will benefit the fourth-quarter results.Moreover, the company remains bullish on its Industrial business backed by increasing regulation around food safety and quality, strict conditions for food testing, along with environmental and fine chemical applications. Additionally, an increased demand for research intensive products, especially the company’s mass spectrometry solutions, is a positive for its business and is likely to bolster the fourth-quarter sales.During the last reported quarter, the company benefited largely from both of its LC and LC/MS platforms. The company’s liquid chromatography benefited from the ACQUITY Arc System, while mass spectrometry grew impressively, driven by ACQUITY QDa and Xevo family of Tandem Quadrupole. We believe robust traction of ACQUITY and CORTECS line of products along with strength in end markets are likely to prove conductive to upcoming results.However, the fact remains that rising R&D expenses and high interest expenses remain a burden, consequently eroding profitability for the upcoming results. A significant portion of the company’s revenues is generated from non-U.S. markets. This makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. We believe currency fluctuations to put pressure on top-line growth and margins for the quarter under review.Further, the company grapples with stiff competition from several international instrument manufacturers as well as other companies in both domestic and foreign markets. The company’s key technologies like HPLC, UPLC, MS, LC-MS, thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry product lines are part of a highly competitive industry and are subject to rapid changes in technology.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Waters Corp. this time around.

12,AME,"Shares of diversified electronics manufacturer Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report) scaled a new 52-week high of $91.51 in yesterday’s trading session, before closing a tad lower at $90.81 for a healthy one-year return of 34.8%. Barring minor hiccups, the company’s share price has steadily been on an uptrend since July last year. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectations of 11.1% and looks poised to touch new highs in 2018.Growth DriversAmphenol remains encouraged by its expanding presence in the fast-growing commercial aerospace market and is well positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of electronics content in next-generation planes. These advanced electronic systems require new advanced technology interconnect solutions to enhance fuel efficiency and improve passenger experience, all of which create excellent opportunities for the company.In addition, Amphenol’s top-line growth is benefiting from improved end-market demand, new product rollouts and market share gains. Demand continues to be strong in automotive, industrial and military markets. The diversification in end markets, with consistent focus on technology innovation and customer support through all phases of the economic cycle has enabled the company to post solid results over the past few quarters. A sustained drive for geographic and market diversification has further helped Amphenol to expand its customer base and develop new applications.Moreover, Amphenol generates solid cash flow, which allows management the opportunity to invest in product innovations, acquisitions and business development. At the same time, the company has historically returned significant cash through a combination of share repurchases and dividend to reward shareholders with risk-adjusted returns. Moving forward, a balanced organic and inorganic growth model, a lean and flexible cost structure, and an agile and entrepreneurial management team augur well for long-term growth.Amphenol also has bullish revenue and earnings expectations. The ongoing revolution in electronics enables the company to capitalize on the opportunities and strengthen its position in the market. It further expects to leverage on the solid growth potential of the acquired companies to drive robust performance in the future.For 2017, Amphenol expects sales in the range of $6,828 million to $6,868 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 9%. The company estimates adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.19 to $3.21, an increase of 17-18% year over year. The projections represent a healthy improvement from the prior guidance of $6,620 million to $6,700 million in sales and adjusted earnings of $3.06 to $3.10 per share.With continued growth impetus and core focus, investors’ confidence is likely to be boosted and the share price is anticipated to hit new 52-week milestones every now and then in 2018.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering in the same space are AMETEK, Inc.

13,AME,"As a first in a planned series of offerings in the year, SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) recently announced a program, Upgrade2Success, to aid on-premise customers in transition from SAP ERP Human Capital Management (“HCM”) solutions to the cloud. The Upgrade2Success services and tools will allow customers to discover as well as attain additional business value at low risk by enabling them to move and expand their HR processes to the cloud.The program’s comprehensive set of services and tools enables smooth digital HR transition at a low risk. The transition to cloud-based SAP SuccessFactors solutions will simplify HR with standardized and streamlined business processes, and allow IT resources to focus on business-value creation as well as innovation. This will also enable the organizations to stay updated with technology innovations with updates delivered each quarter.Existing Business ScenarioSAP has been concentrating on expanding cloud business to become one of the leading players in the category. The company has a competitive edge over peers as its processes are designed to be industry-specific and can be customized to meet corresponding business requirements. The company’s human capital management applications are gaining tremendous popularity with several international organizations. Cloud subscriptions and support revenues are anticipated to surpass software license revenues in 2018, consequently supplementing the company’s financial performance. Further, the company’s new class of solutions that power the next generation of business applications — SAP HANA — has been boosting growth since introduction. Driven by solid market traction of cloud business, the company has raised mid-term outlook, signaling brighter days ahead. However, dull prospects of the global IT industry in recent quarters, along with flat customer spending projections have adversely affected performance. Also, many of the company’s emerging markets have faced fiscal imbalances and general economic slowdowns over the past few quarters, which adversely impacted purchasing power. In light of such headwinds, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks have yielded a return of 9.8% in the last six months, underperforming 18.2% growth recorded by the industry. Currency fluctuations in many of its key markets are also affecting financial performance.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Analog Devices, Inc.

14,AME,"Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) has been selected by the City of Dallas to install and host an Advanced Traffic Management System (“ATMS”) based on the company’s Connected Urban Transport solution. The solution will enable the City of Dallas and its adjoining cities to aggregate as well as analyze real-time data from traffic sensors and cameras, facilitating dynamic control of traffic lights, school flashers and message signs.The system features an ecosystem, which will allow share of data and system services with other organizations in a controlled manner. Moreover, the systems’ key performance indicators will enable monitoring as well as tracking of the city’s goals and suppliers’ performance. The solution will enable the city to control increasing traffic as well as enhance driver safety more efficiently at a cheaper cost. The implementation of the system commenced at the end of 2017 and will be fully functional by next two years.Our TakeBeing one of the premier telecom services providers, Ericsson is much in demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity. However, the company’s revenues and gross margins continue to take a grave beating from adverse industry trends. Persistent low investments in mobile broadband in certain markets and lower managed services sales have harmed the sales of Networks segment, while lower legacy product sales have hurt IT & Cloud revenues. Lower IPR licensing revenue and an unfavorable mix between coverage & capacity and services are adding to concerns.The company has been facing investment headwinds in network developments in Mediterranean, Northern Europe and Central Asia regions as well as in Latin America and the Middle East. Additionally, soft mobile broadband demand and challenging macroeconomic conditions in the emerging markets are acting as a deterrent for major investments by telecom equipment behemoths, and this significantly dented performance.Moreover, high restructuring charges are knocking on the company’s door, and we also have a subdued view of operator spending and investments in R&D. The company’s current savings plans and job reductions do not seem enough to counter macroeconomic miseries and swiftly waning product demand, further adding to woes. Notably, the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company has lost 6.7% in the past six months, against the industry’s growth of 6.2%.Further, spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the U.S. telecom industry that has a saturated wireless market. This apart, the company’s cash flow could be materially hurt by market and customer project adjustments. Though the company is working diligently to improve the situation, tangible results are yet to materialize.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report), Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET  -  Free Report) and AMTEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report).

15,AME,"Itron, Inc. (ITRI  -  Free Report) has completed the acquisition of Silver Spring Networks, Inc.  for $830 million.

Barring minor hiccups, AMETEK’s share price has steadily been on an uptrend. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectation of 11.9%.The company’s surprise history has been pretty impressive. It beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.14%.Over the last one year, the company’s shares have gained 47.2%, outperforming the industry’s 45.9% rally.Key FactorsAMETEK’s top-line growth is benefiting from improved end-market demand and market share gains. The company continues to reap benefits from the execution of its four core growth strategies of operational excellence, global market expansion, investments in product development and strategic acquisitions.Also, the diversification in end markets like aerospace, defense, medical, automation and other industrial markets, with consistent focus on technology innovation and customer support through all phases of the economic cycle, has enabled the company post solid results over the past few quarters. A sustained drive toward geographic and market diversification has further helped AMETEK expand its customer base.Despite the uncertainties prevailing in the global economy, AMETEK has bullish revenue and earnings expectations. The ongoing revolution in electronic appliances and electromechanical devices enables the company to capitalize on the opportunities and strengthen its position in the market.

17,AME,"The year 2017 has not been a smooth ride for 3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report). The leading provider of 3-D modeling, rapid prototyping and manufacturing solutions has seen its shares fall 32.1% year to date, underperforming the Computer - Mini computers industry’s growth of around 46.3%.The underperformance, in part, is due to surging costs as well as macroeconomic woes that have sparked concerns among investors. Moreover, in light of the company’s dismal third-quarter 2017 results and uncertain operating environment, management withdrew full-year 2017 guidance.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has moved south over a couple of months from 44 cents to a loss of 4 cents. This indicates extremely bearish sentiments for this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock, reflected by five downward estimate revisions versus none upward. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)What Ails the Company?Despite significant investments and implementation of organizational changes to improve execution, 3D Systems is struggling to retain its leadership position in 3D printing market. Going forward, the company’s investment in IT and go-to-market initiatives are likely to result in higher expenses, restricting near-term operating income growth. The need to continually spend heavily on research and development to keep up with the competitive marketplace is adding to margin woes on a sustained basis.Moreover, macroeconomic factors such as economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations, commodity prices and dearth of credit availability remain concerns for the company. In third-quarter 2017, revenues from 3D printing products and services were significantly undermined due to continued challenging market conditions that adversely impacted customers' capital investment cycles and reduced demand across most geographies. Further, its performance in Americas and Asia Pacific was very weak. In absence of inorganic growth in the past year, its performance has suffered to an even greater extent. If these problems persist, the company’s earnings will likely continue to be pressured, going forward.Moreover, the company had commenced significant transformational work in solving legacy issues in the third quarter, which partly led to the withdrawal of guidance for 2017. The company cited that it is unable to predict earnings and sales numbers accurately. This action has unnerved investors badly, as it indicates a highly uncertain environment.Light at the End of the Tunnel?We expect margin contraction and higher operating expenses in the upcoming quarters as the company focuses on strengthening partnerships and enhancing productivity. As a matter of fact, we believe that the company’s significant investments to counter the aforesaid challenges will take some more time to deliver credible top-line growth.The company has also undertaken a number of strategic initiatives for improvement of existing 3D printers and boosting productivity to capitalize on growth opportunity in the industry. However, all the efforts are at a nascent stage and are expected to take time to contribute to top-line growth meaningfully.Although the company’s turnaround efforts are likely to yield results in the long run, its impact on near-term results is expected to remain muted.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (ACLS  -  Free Report), AMTEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report) and Avid Technology, Inc. (AVID  -  Free Report).

21,AME,"Sales growth is an important metric for any company, as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision making. By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods, one can understand a company’s growth trend.Sales growth is essential to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business. Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and dismal financial performance. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit, but can’t register enough growth to attract new investors.Also, in a growing economy, lack of sales growth shows that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, some sustained sales growth is necessary to support the bottom line.Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. So, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable investment strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow provide the company with more flexibility in relation to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Bethesda, MD, CBRE Group, Inc.  operates as a commercial real estate services and investment company.

27,AME,"Verizon Communications Inc.’s (VZ  -  Free Report) specialized group of engineers known as MERIT —Major Emergency Response Incident Team — recently finished their annual training to ensure the protection of the company’s network assets and facilities in the event of natural disasters or hazardous materials incidents. Formed in 1992, Verizon’s MERIT team consists of more than 30 technically skilled communications employees. These members are certified and capable of entering into an area hit by hazardous materials spill and responsible for completing network repairs.In fact, the MERIT team is known to have a wide range of expertise in areas such as wireless and wireline telecommunications network equipment like fiber optic cables, routers, transmission equipment, customer premise equipment, wireless mobile assets, radio networks and critical infrastructure like Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Trained in emergency response management, this team of specialized engineers are also capable of operating at the highest operational protection level. The use of multiple tools enables them to detect over 30 chemicals, biological as well as radiological containments.Notably, the team’s training has been completed under the guidelines of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and National Fire Protection Association (“NFPA”). Verizon’s MERIT team is equipped with an onsite, climate-controlled mobile command center with a conference room, workspaces, external cameras, communications equipment, an on-board generator as well as a weather station.Our TakeVerizon expects its Wireless and Wireline businesses to perform impressively in 2018. Solid margin expansion owing to expected savings from tax reform and continued strong FiOS fiber-optic network and strategic services in the Wireline business is also anticipated in the same period. Further, the company is looking forward to capitalize on the countless innovative technology solutions being developed in the Internet of Things and telematics ecosystem across multiple industries.

The industry is likely to witness more competition in 2018, with the entry of cable MSOs (multi service operators).

30,AME,"Investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to selecting stocks. This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company’s price performance is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum. But betting on stocks depending totally on such a perception may not prove worthwhile.It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued on revenues and not earnings, as top-line growth (or decline) usually reflects a company’s future earnings performance. Notably, in contrast with price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for firms that have hit choppy waters.Also, a company can improve earnings by resorting to expense saving measures while maintaining stable revenues. However, superior profits could be achieved through continued revenue growth. Further, earnings and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. But there are limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio.A huge sales figure does not necessarily convert to profits. Hence, considering a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be more prudent. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Kalamazoo, MI, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) is a medical technology company.

This was driven by improving orders worth $1.34 billion, which grew 20% on a year-over-year basis.The company continues to reap benefits from the execution of its four core growth strategies of operational excellence, global market expansion, investments in product development and strategic acquisitions.Top Line in DetailAMETEK reports sales in two organized segments — Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) and Electromechanical Group (EMG)EIG (61.1% of total sales): The company generated $716.4 million of sales in this segment, which was down 3.4% sequentially but up 15.6% from the year-ago quarter.

The year-over-year increase was primarily by robust performance of AMETEK in both the segments, which exhibited operational efficiency in the reported quarter.EIG contributed 71% to the total operating income and improved 18.1% from the prior year quarter whereas, EMG accounted for 35.2% of the operating income and was up 16.2% year over year.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 11.7%, as percentage of sales, which contracted 40 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter and 70 bps on a sequential basis.Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents was $556.8 million, down from $646.3 million as of Dec 31, 2017.Long-term debt was $1.89 billion, which increased from $1.56 billion in the previous quarter.GuidanceFor second-quarter 2018, AMETEK expects sales to increase by 10% on a year-over-year basis.

33,AME,"Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of the presort operations of Miller’s Presort in Cleveland. The buyout will enable the company to assist high-volume mailers of the Cleveland area in reducing postage cost as well as manage compliance challenges. The overall value of the deal has been kept under wraps.Pitney Bowes Presort Services, the largest certified work-share partner of the USPS, already has a strong national network of more than 35 operating centers. The company believes this buyout, along with Presort Service’s operational expertise and state-of-the-art technology will enable it to offer excellent value and service to several successful banks and insurers, as well as healthcare companies globally.Besides expanding national network, the company is also expanding services. For instance, the company is enhancing the value of direct mail clients by optimizing their messages and offerings for digital channels. Moreover, the company is rolling out parcel mailing solutions based on its expertise in mail sortation.Despite expanding and improving business networks to drive growth, the shares of Pitney Bowes have had a disappointing run on the bourse in the last six months. Its shares have declined 32.6%, in sharp contrast to the industry’s growth of 10.1%.The fact remains that softness in the company’s North American mailing business is yet to subside fully. Lower recurring revenue streams and lower sales in the top of the line products are leading to the lackluster performance of the North American Mailing business. Additionally, decline in recurring revenues remains a concern for the International Mailing Business. Further, the company experienced few issues related with start-up system stability with its domestic shipping APIs in its in Global Ecommerce business.This apart, uncertain global economic environment is expected to impact production mail and software businesses in the near term, consequently limiting the company’s growth momentum.

39,AME,"CyberArk Software Ltd. (CYBR  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5% in the previous quarter. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe decelerating revenue growth trend makes us slightly cautious about CyberArk's third-quarter results. Notably, the company has witnessed more than 35% growth in quarterly revenues since it was enlisted in September 2014 except in the past three quarters.During fourth-quarter 2016, and the first and second quarters of 2017, year-over-year growth rates were 25%, 26% and 14%, respectively. Moreover, CyberArk’s revenue growth guidance range of 13-15% for the third quarter and 17-18% for 2017 has increased our concerns.Furthermore, flaring up operating expenses have been hurting its profitability. Escalated operating expenses are mainly stemmed by increased investment toward enhancing product offerings and expanding sales capabilities. Though these investments will have long-term benefits, we expect these will drag the company’s bottom-line in the near term.CyberArk Software Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise CyberArk Software Ltd.

40,AME,"Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 earnings results on Nov 2.In the last reported quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 800%. The company surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, generating an average beat of 339.3%.We believe that regular investments in technological upgrades (SaaS technology), along with product innovations, will continue to boost the company’s top-line. Moreover, higher adoption of Paylocity’s Affordable Care Act (ACA) dashboard application will act as a tailwind.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 11 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 57.1%.  Further, the earnings estimate has trended upward in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $81 million, up roughly 24.6% from the year-ago quarter.Aspects to Influence Q1 ResultsQ2 Earnings HighlightThe company reported stellar fourth-quarter 2017 results. Paylocity’s both the top and bottom line for the fourth quarter also increased year over year. The company also provided an encouraging guidance for the first quarter and fiscal 2018.For first-quarter fiscal 2018, Paylocity expects revenues in the range of $80.3–$81.3 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at that time was pegged at $80.3 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be in the range of 10-12 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at a loss of 2 cents.For fiscal 2018, Paylocity anticipates revenues in the range of $368-$370 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $369.5 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected within 78-80 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is peggedat 31 cents.Aided by these factors, its shares have surged 71.9% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the industry’s gain of 29.3%.SaaS HCM Solutions: Key CatalystsPaylocity offers end-to-end SaaS HCM solution that minimizes data-integrity issues across applications. In the last quarter, a significant portion of revenues was generated from clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to the company’s SaaS-based services.  We are also positive on the company’s continued investment in SaaS technology and mobile applications.  Paylocity’s SaaS-based solution reduces time, risk and headcount related to installing and maintaining applications for on-premise products. Growth of cloud computing has supported the SaaS delivery model. With its SaaS-based applications, we think that Paylocity is well positioned to lead the market. These factors are likely to positively impact the to-be-reported quarter.Paylocity also holds a dominant position in the payroll processing and human capital management market, primarily due to its robust product portfolio. The company continues to frequently upgrade existing product portfolio as well as launch new products. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act compliance which was launched in fiscal year 2016 is a positive for the business as it makes it mandatory for companies to buy additional HCM solutions. Hence, higher traction of Paylocity’s ACA dashboard application is likely to have positive impact on forthcoming results.Recurring Revenues & Client Base: Other Positive FactorsPaylocity has grown significantly over the years by providing industry-leading service and technology solutions to its clients and their employees. Revenue growth seems to be steady and is positively impacted by higher recurring revenues as well as higher traction in cloud-based offerings. In the last reported quarter, recurring revenues (96% of total revenues) increased 27% year over year. Its solid business model, diversified products and services, and strategic acquisitions have bolsteredtop-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for recurring fees is pegged at $77 million.Furthermore, Paylocity expands its client base with the help of direct sales force. The company is gaining market share over the most critical client demand area of HCM, which in turn, supports its growth. As a result, the company has a huge client base. The number of clients for fiscal 2017 increased 16% to 14,550. Notably, continued focus on client retention, on the basis of high client satisfaction, has helped the company to maintain its average annual revenue retention rate of 92% for fiscal 2017.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Paylocity is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two important ingredients.Zacks ESP: Paycom Software’s Earnings ESPis +14.71%. This is because the company’s Most Accurate estimate is 13 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 11 cents. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Paylocity currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 has a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Paylocity’s Zacks Rank #3 and +14.71% ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.53% and a Zacks Rank #1.

41,AME,"Cirrus Logic Inc. (CRUS  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2018 results on Nov 2.The company has an excellent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 21.9% in the trailing four quarters. Cirrus Logic scored its 13th consecutive earnings beat in the last reported quarter, beating estimates by 22.7%. Itstotal revenuesincreased approximately 23.6% year over year to $320.7 million and also marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $320 million.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.19 per share, which is 11.9% down from year-ago period figure. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $410 million, down roughly 4.4% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayCirrus Logic is a premier supplier of high-performance analog circuits and advanced mixed-signal chip solutions. The company has broadened product portfolio. Its chips are used in DVD players/recorders, disc drives, sound chips for computers, XBox, professional audio, mobile technologies and voice transmission.  Notably, the company is a major chipset provider to Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Samsung as it generates a significant portion of revenues from them. Consequently, we believe that new products are likely to drive sales in the forthcoming quarter.We also note that customer base has diversified in recent times. At the end of fiscal 2017, top 10 direct customers accounted for approximately 92% of its revenues as compared with 89% at the end of fiscal 2016. This bodes well for the to-be-reported quarter’s top-line.Continued investments in the audio segment have also helped the company to come up with innovative products from time to time. Portable audio product revenues (88% of the total revenues) came in at $280.7 million, up 29.9% year over year in the last reported quarter. This aids in attracting new customers and brings in additional revenues. Additionally, expansion in the LED market continues to drive growth.However, as Cirrus Logic generates a significant portion of revenues from Apple, there is always an inherent risk of losing an Apple design contract, which will significantly hurt its financials. Moreover, sluggish economic growth, as well as IT spending may affect performance, going forward.Furthermore, the company faces competition from the likes of Texas Instruments Inc. and STMicroelectronics N.V., which also remains a concern.Cirrus Logic, Inc.

42,AME,"Apple, Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2 after the market closes.Apple still depends on iPhone to drive its top line. However, a fast growing services segment is emerging as a big growth catalyst along with a resurgent iPad business (as seen in the last reported quarter).For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s earnings per share and total revenues are projected to be $1.86 and $51.171 billion representing an increase of 11.4% and 9.2% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.Fortunes Remain Tied to iPhone Revenues from iPhone segment have become the mainstay of Apple’s top line. The segment constitutes about 60% to 65% of total revenues. The about-to-be reported saw the launch of the much awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.The new models were launched on Sep 22, 2017 and as a result will include sales for the first nine days only. Per media reports, iPhone 8 sales have been marred by the lowered iPhone 7 prices as well as the excitement around the iPhone X.iPhone X and iPhone 8 carry a slight price difference. As a result, consumers are waiting for iPhone X or are more interested in iPhone 7 as it is not much different from its successor, add media reports. Also, decelerating iPhone sales are due to increased competition from cheaper handsets like Oppo and Vivo.However, many analysts observe that unit volume metric has become a little less relevant as Apple is focusing on “aggressive pricing.” Both iPhone 8 (& 8 Plus) and iPhone X cater to high-end consumers. Increased price will help to cushion the topline in the face of lower volume growth and boost gross margins as well.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total iPhone units sold is expected to be 46.423 million, up 2% from the actual figure reported in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total revenues from iPhone and related products and services are projected to be around $29.6 billion, up 5.2% from the actual figure reported in the prior-year quarter.Fast Growing Services SegmentApple’s Services segment, which includes revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, has become a fast growing segment. The company remarked that the segment is now the size of a Fortune 100 company, much earlier than the company had expected. Services segment has over 185 million subscribers.Much of the growth comes from App store and this quarter isn’t going to be any different. Given the release of iOS 11, app store revenues are expected to benefit all the more as the App store has been revamped completely. There is now a dedicated games tab in the App store.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from iTunes, Sofware and Services stands at $7.613 billion, up 20.4% from the actual figure reported in the prior-year quarter.Recovery Seen in iPad Business Coming to the iPad business, Apple saw an impressive recovery in the iPad business in the last reported quarter. The iPad business has long been in doldrums. However, increasing sales in the United States, China and Japan, has helped to reverse the drop in unit sales. Sales of iPad witnessed a 32% surge to 1 million units in the U.S education market. iPad is gaining traction among schools driven by the wide range of multimedia features of the education specific iOS applications. Going ahead, a refresh of the iPad lineup will help to sustain the momentum seen in the business.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from iPad business stands at $4.32 billion, up 1.5% from the actual figure reported in the prior-year quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total iPad units sold is expected to be $9.948 million, up 7.4% from the actual figure reported in the fourth quarter of 2016.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model conclusively shows that Apple is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

43,AME,"Motorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, after the market closes.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings (excluding 34 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.12 per share comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04. Also, the bottom line improved 8.7% from the year-ago figure owing to an increase in sales, driven by the strong performance of its land and mobile radio operations.In fact, Motorola has an impressive track record with respect to earnings per share. It has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 14.5%.However, the stock has struggled of late. This is evident from the fact that shares of the company have gained a mere 0.6% over the last three months, significantly underperforming the S&P 500’s 4.4% rally.The pessimism surrounding the stock ahead of its third-quarter earnings release is evident from a 0.7% decline in the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the last 60 days.Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on Motorola’s third-quarter results.We expect Motorola’s results to be hurt by increased costs. However, the company is looking to drive growth through acquisitions. Though positive on the strategy, we note that costs associated with the acquisitions might weigh on the bottom line.In August 2017, Motorola completed the acquisition of the privately held Kodiak Networks in a bid to broaden its software product portfolio. Costs associated with the integration process are likely to hurt the bottom line.Moreover, adverse foreign currency movements might hamper results in the quarter. The company’s high debt levels also remain a concern.On the brighter side, increased product sales are likely to boost results in the soon to-be-reported quarter. Strong performance in the Americas region is likely to lead to the improvement.  In fact, Motorola expects revenues for the third quarter of 2017 to improve in the band of 3% to 4%, on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted earnings per share are projected in the range of $1.36 to $1.41. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.40 per share.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model does not show that Motorolawill beat earnings in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks Rank: Motorola carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: Motorola has an Earnings ESP of -0.24%, which acts as a spoiler. The Zacks Rank combined with a negative Earnings ESP leaves the surprise prediction inconclusive.

44,AME,"FireEye Inc. (FEYE  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this cybersecurity company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, FireEye has delivered positive earnings surprises for 13 straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered a remarkable average positive surprise of 63.8%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of 7 cents, which is significantly narrower than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 18 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $186.2 million, almost flat with the year-ago quarter tally.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model conclusively shows that FireEye is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has higher chance of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. FireEye currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an ESP of +0.74%.FireEye, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise FireEye, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | FireEye, Inc. QuoteWhat’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?FireEye is a specialized provider of a security platform against cyber-attacks to enterprises and governments. The company’s consistent efforts toward bringing in new and advanced products have been attracting a wide range of customers. Notably, FireEye’s Essentials product, which is a lower-cost and simpler version of the FireEye Global Threat Management platform, targets smaller and mid-market companies. The company’s Cloud MVX and MVX Smart Grid offerings, a lower-cost intelligent threat detection solution, targets large enterprises and mid-market businesses. The analysts covering the stock believe that the company’s continued focus on enhancing its product capabilities will bring in new customers, in turn, further driving its top-line performance.Additionally, last year’s acquisition of iSIGHT Partners has strengthened the company’s capabilities by offering an intelligence-led security model for enterprises of any size which other security providers find difficult to match. FireEye has also taken over Invotas, a firm specializing in improving response times following a cyber-attack. Its product — Security Orchestrator — is designed to compile information from a range of security products and automate responses when an incident occurs. These acquisitions will likely be beneficial for the company’s to-be-reported quarterly results.Furthermore, the company’s move of shifting its business model to subscription-based cloud services from selling software is praiseworthy. Though shifting the business model to subscription-based services will generate lower revenues initially, but the same will be stable over the long run, as organizations usually renew subscriptions with the existing products or even with higher versions. Moreover, subscription-based services generate higher gross margins. We believe, though shift in business model may offset the benefit of higher revenues from product launches and acquisitions, it will support the company’s bottom-line results.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NVIDIA Corp.

46,AME,"Qorvo Inc (QRVO  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on Nov 1.Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.64%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.41%.For the second-quarter of fiscal 2018, Qorvo forecasts strong sequential revenue growth primarily on the strength of mobile content gains on marquee platforms, modest improvements in the Chinese market and continued strength in Infrastructure and Defense (IDP) segment.Management expects non-GAAP revenues to be approximately $800-$820 million. Earnings are anticipated between $1.36 and $1.50 per share. Qorvo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Qorvo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Qorvo, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $1.44 on revenues of $811 million.Notably, the stock has returned 39.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 38% rally of the industry.  Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Improving Demand in China to Boost Top-lineNotably, China accounts for almost 30% of Qorvo’s Mobile Product revenues. Per market research firm GFK, smartphone demand in China increased 5% in third-quarter 2017, while average selling price (ASP) jumped 15% year over year. The improving demand environment bodes well for Qorvo’s top line. However, mix will continue to be a drag as consumers are favoring lower content phones, witnessed so far in the cycle.Qorvo’s results significantly depend on performance of Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone. We believe that higher dollar content at the next-generation iPhone will drive top line. Additionally, improving market share at Samsung and Huawei is positive.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mobile Products is currently pegged at $616 million.IDP Growth to ContinueWe believe IDP is the key catalyst for Qorvo in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The company is benefiting from strong demand for its high-powered Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) for the 3.5 gigahertz band for 5G massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antennas.The defense business was strong in the last quarter as reflected in the 25% surge in GaN and BAW revenues. Multiyear defense contracts supporting programs like F-15, 16 and F-35 also aided growth.We expect the company’s top line to benefit from the launch of new products for 5G development like GaN on silicon carbide 5G front-end module for the 39 GHz frequency band (industry's first) and ultra-high performance 28 GHz solutions.During the quarter, Qorvo partnered with Veterans Trading Company (VTC), an end-to-end supply chain service provider that serves the government contract community. This will help it to fast penetrate the defense market.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IDP is currently pegged at $189 million.Unfavorable Rank, Negative ESPWe believe that Qorvo is unlikely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the second quarter due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -0.35%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderHere are some stocks you may consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.HubSpot Inc (HUBS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +26.53% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

47,AME,"CDW Corporation (CDW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Nov 1, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered in-line earnings. Notably, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.16%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.07 per share, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 10.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $4 billion indicates around 7.9% growth from the prior-year quarter.Factors to ConsiderCDW specializes in offering information technology products and services to business, government, education and healthcare customers, primarily in the United Statesand Canada. Growth in customer channels and consistent strategic achievements are a couple of positive factors that are likely to drive performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, CDW’s robust product portfolio and product refreshes are positives.The company’s approach to capture market share from existing and new customers, expand its solutions suite and enhance our services capabilities are likely to positively impact the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, the company’s investment strategies to deliver integrated solutions both in and outside of the UK, along with international sales team and its international-branded website will drive positive results.Q2 Earnings HighlightThe company reported modest second-quarter 2017 results, wherein the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the bottom line matched the same. However, both the top line and bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis. Segmental revenues from Corporate increased 9.4% year over year, whilethose of Public were up 8.2%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Corporate and Public is now pegged at $1.888 billion and $1.765 billion, respectively.Aided by these factors, its shares have surged 54.9%in the last one year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 38.8%.Challenges for the companyThe company’s carrieshigh debt, which has been increasing for the past many years. As of Jun 30, 2017, the company had total debtofapproximately $3.3 billion, 1.7% higher year over year. Such high-debt levels increase leverage risk and interest costs which may dent the company’s margins.Moreover, competition from Insight Enterprises Inc. (NSIT  -  Free Report) and PC Connection, Inc., and pricing pressure remain headwinds.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that CDW is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.

48,AME,"Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 31, before the market opens.In the last quarter, the company posted in-line earnings per share. Notably, Harris Corporation has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of approximately 3%.The scenario appears to be rosy for Harris Corporation in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as well. Its strong product portfolio is likely to boost results. In fact, the positive sentiment surrounding this Melbourne, FL- based company ahead of its earnings release can be gauged from the fact that the stock has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first-quarter earnings being revised 1.5% upward over the last 60 days.Also, the stock has moved north in the last six months outperforming the Zacks Wireless- Equipment industry in the period. Shares of Harris rallied 21.4%, as against the industry’s loss of 3%. The possibility of greater military spending by the United States, owing to tensions with North Korea has boosted the stock.Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on Harris Corporation’s fiscal first-quarter results.We expect the company’s Communication Systems unit to perform well in the to-be-reported quarter. Increased sales of legacy international tactical radios and operational efficiencies should buoy segmental results.The Electronic Systems unit is also anticipated to perform well driven by the strength in strength in electronic warfare, among others.  Of late, the company has also won multiple contracts, which is likely to boost the top line further in the quarter.Additionally, Harris Corporation announced a 8% dividend hike in the fiscal first quarter. We believe that the dividend hike not only indicates the company's commitment to create value for shareholders but also underlines its confidence regarding growth.Markedly, the company’s efforts to reduce its debt levels also raise optimism in the stock. We expect an update on the issue on the fiscal first-quarter conference call.On the flip side, the company’s Space and Intelligence Systems unit is anticipated to perform poorly in the quarter. Lower revenues from environmental and space programs might weigh on the segmental results as well.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too shows that Harris Corporation is likely to beat earnings in the soon-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.Zacks ESP: Harris Corporation has an Earnings ESP of +0.50% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a penny above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Harris Corporation carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHarris Corporation is not the only company in the broader Computer and Technology sector that islooking up this earnings season. Here are some companies from the same space, which according to our model also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:AMTEK, Inc.

49,AME,"Nokia Corporation (NOK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Oct 26, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 125%. The company’s earnings per share of €0.08 (approximately 9 cents) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4 cents. Earnings improved significantly from the year-ago figure as well. Net sales of €5.6 billion (approximately $6.18 billion) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.98 billion but fell short of the year-ago figure of approximately $6.31 billion. Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayThe disappointing performance of Nokia’s primary division, the Networks unit, is likely to hurt results in the third quarter. Similar to the previous quarter, the top line might be affected this time around too due to below-par performance of Nokia’s flagship division.Also, the top line in the third quarter might be hampered by adverse foreign currency movements since the company operates globally.Due to the above headwinds, shares of the company have declined 2.1% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s decline of 0.6% during the period.  However, Nokia’s dispute settlement with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) has been aiding the company. This holds promise for the quarter to be reported as well.In addition, Nokia’s acquisition of Comptel earlier in June is likely to drive results in the third quarter. The buyout has boosted Nokia’s software portfolio by adding capabilities that help digital service providers deliver new communications services to the market faster. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nokia is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Nokia has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 6 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Nokia has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Nokia Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Nokia Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Nokia Corporation Quote Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Computer and Technology sector may consider the following stocks that possess the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this time around:AMTEK, Inc.

50,AME,"Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after the market closes.In the second quarter of 2017, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise to the tune of 4%. It also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in terms of revenues.However, things do not look bright for the company in the quarter under review. In fact, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter, which moved down 12.6% over the last 90 days.Moreover, shares of Citrix Systems have struggled lately, underperforming the Zacks Software industry on a year-to-date basis. The stock has been down 7.3%, as against the industry’s rally of 29%.Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Citrix Systems’ third-quarter results.We expect high costs to hurt the company’s bottom line in the third quarter of 2017. With the company making significant investments to expand its product portfolio, costs are likely to shoot up. Personnel expenses are expected to be high as well, hurting the bottom line. Moreover, Citrix System’s results in the to-be-reported quarter are liable to be affected by foreign exchange movements as it continues to foray into non-U.S. markets.Markedly, the company expects net revenues in the band of $685-$695 million. Earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) are projected in the range of $1.02-$1.05. Both figures compare unfavorably to those reported a year-ago.Revenues from products and licenses are expected to be soft in the quarter under review, thus hurting the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s revenues from products and licenses is pegged at $203 million, 3.8% lower than the reported figure in the second quarter of 2017.Amid the gloomy scenario, revenues from Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) are expected to be strong in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter SaaS revenues is pegged at $43.6 million, 5.1% higher than reported figure in the second quarter.Given this backdrop, investors would keenly await Citrix Systems’ third-quarter results under its new chief executive officer (CEO) — David J. Henshall – appointed in July 2017. Notably, Henshall has succeeded Kirill Tatarinov, who had joined Citrix from Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report). The appointment of Henshall implies that Citrix has had four CEOs in less than two years. In fact, these frequent changes at its helm have contributed to the stock’s underperformance.We believe that the company’s third-quarter results would be an indicator to whether the appointment of Henshall yields the desired results as Citrix expects to increase its profitability and find favor with shareholders.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too does not show that Citrix Systems is likely to beat earnings in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the DWA Industrials Technical Leaders Index before fees and expenses.The DWA Industrials Technical Leaders Index identifies companies that are showing relative strength and are composed of at least 30 common stocks from a universe of approximately 3,000 common stocks traded on US exchanges.Cost & Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.60%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.PRN's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 0.60%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.Representing 72.10% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector; Information Technology and Materials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Jb Hunt Transport Services Inc (JBHT  -  Free Report) accounts for about 4.87% of total assets, followed by Ametek Inc (AME  -  Free Report) and Sherwin-Williams Co/the (SHW  -  Free Report).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 38.53% of PRN's total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -0.85% so far this year and is up roughly 14.48% in the last one year (as of 05/30/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $53.19 and $64.80.The ETF has a beta of 1.23 and standard deviation of 15.27% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium choice in the space. With about 42 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesPowerShares DWA Industrials Momentum Portfolio is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Industrials ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.Vanguard Industrials ETF (VIS  -  Free Report) tracks MSCI US Investable Market Industrials 25/50 Index and the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report) tracks Industrial Select Sector Index.

53,AME,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Cognex Corporation (CGNX  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in CGNX.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen six estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.40 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.15.Also, for the current quarter, Cognex has seen four downward estimate revisions versus one revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 30 cents a share from 34 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 8.1% in the past month.Cognex Corporation Price and Consensus Cognex Corporation Price and Consensus | Cognex Corporation Quote So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Electronics - Testing Equipment industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - AMETEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report). The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and may be a better selection at this time.

54,AME,"Itron, Inc. (ITRI  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share, which declined around 77% year over year. Earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The year-over-year earnings decline resulted from the elevated supply-chain transition costs, higher component and commodity prices, and product mix.Including one-time items, the company posted loss of $3.74 cents per share compared with earnings of 40 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.Total revenues increased around 27% year over year to $607 million, driven by increased sales of smart electric and gas solutions in Europe, accelerated deliveries of OpenWay Riva solutions in the Americas and stellar performance in the new Networks segment.

57,AME,"Strong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market. Companies that emphasize on sales management have a competitive advantage, as solid sales generally get converted into growth.Sales are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business. This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base.Stagnant or declining sales indicate obstacles at the company and offer limited scope for sustained growth. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without robust sales growth, the bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term. While a company can show earnings strength by lowering expenses, sustainable bottom-line improvement typically requires impressive sales growth.However, sales growth in isolation doesn’t indicate much about a company’s future prospects. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number does not necessarily translate into profits.Therefore, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

58,AME,"The Q1 earnings season has crossed the half-way mark, with results from 267 S&P 500 members having on board as of Apr 27.Per the latest Earnings Preview, approximately 76.8% of the companies delivered positive earnings surprises, while 73.8% surpassed top-line expectations. Further, 61.4% of these companies have topped the estimates on both the fronts. Earnings of these companies grew 25.1% from the year-ago quarter, while revenues were up 10%.Robust Performance From Tech StocksTechnology is one of the 13 sectors which are anticipated to report double-digit earnings growth this quarter.As of Apr 27, 64.7% S&P 500 companies belonging to the Tech sector have reported their first-quarter results, wherein earnings for these companies increased 31.3% year over year on 11.4% higher revenues.The sector’s double digit year-over-year growth so far in the quarter under review can be attributed to robust performance from tech giants like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Intel, Microsoft and Google.The tech sector experienced a tough first-quarter due to headwinds related to Trump’s trade restrictions, increasing regulatory actions in Europe, and growing concern over data privacy and security post Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica fiasco.However, strong results proved that the sector hasn’t lost its mojo. Despite significant negative press, Facebook delivered impressive results driven by higher mobile ad revenues, expanding user base and growing instagram.Amazon crushed estimates driven by expanding Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer base and Prime growth. Microsoft Azure continued its solid growth during the quarter.The increasing demand for semiconductor chips that harnesses cloud computing and emerging trends of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning drove results for Intel. Moreover, increasing demand for solutions related to self-driving vehicles and Internet of Things (IoT) boost top-line growth.Total earnings for the tech sector are now expected to increase 27.9%, while revenues are expected to grow 12.5% higher on a year-over-year basis.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

Additionally, regular investment in research and development and capital deployment in strategic acquisitions will continue to benefit the company’s product portfolio, which is likely to aid AMETEK’s performance in both segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Electronic Instruments Group’s (“EIG”) first-quarter revenues is pegged at $691 million.

60,AME,"AMETEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report) has been struggling lately, but the selling pressure may be coming to an end soon. That is because AME recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom.What is a Hammer Chart Pattern? A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting. The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day, but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price. This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer, and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock, and that better days are ahead.Other FactorsPlus, earnings estimates have been rising for this company, even despite the sluggish trading lately. In just the past 60 days alone 1 estimate has gone higher, compared to none lower, while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction.Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon.

61,AME,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of 59 cents per ADR unit which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 cent and also declined from 64 cents reported in the previous quarter. However, it surged from the year-ago bottom-line figure of 54 cents.Adjusted revenues grew 12.7% on a year-over-year basis but fell 8.2% sequentially to $8.46 billion. The figure came slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.45 billion.The year-over-year growth was driven by robust performance of the company’s technology products in the computing sector. Moreover, Taiwan Semi witnessed increased demand from cryptocurrency, automotive, HPC and IoT industry.However, the sequential decline was primarily due to weakness in the smartphone market and appreciation in New Taiwan dollar against U.S. dollar.We note that the shares of the company plunged 5.7% on Thursday after the earnings release. This is mainly due to management’s lower guidance for revenues in the second quarter.However, over a year the stock has returned 21.7%, underperforming the industry’s rally of 23.2%. Top Line in DetailNorth America accounted for 59% of the total revenues. Asia Pacific, China, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and Japan accounted for 8%, 19%, 7%, and 7% of the total revenues, respectively.By application, Communication, Industrial/Standard, Computer and Consumer accounted for 55%, 23%, 15% and 7% of the total revenues respectively.By technology, 10-nanometer (NM) and the combined 16/20 NM accounted for 19% and 22% of the total wafer revenues, respectively. The 28 NM and below advanced technologies contributed 59%.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. Quote Operating DetailsIn the first quarter, gross profit came in $4.26 billion or 50.3% of revenues, which expanded 30 basis points (bps) sequentially but contracted 160 bps year over year.The quarter-over-quarter improvement was driven by adjustments to inventory valuation and efforts toward cost efficiency. Although, unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations led to lower-capacity utilization.Operating expenses were $912 million, reflecting an increase of 8.6% year over year but a decrease of 4.7% from the previous quarter. This was due to increased research and development expenditure.Operating margin was 39%, which contracted 20 bps sequentially and 180 bps on a year-over-year basis.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of Mar 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $23.5 billion compared with $21.8 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.Also, cash flow from operating activities came in NT$ 160.72 billion against NT$ 204.13 billion in the previous quarter. Further, CapEx expenditure amounted to $2.45 billion in the first quarter.GuidanceFor the second-quarter 2018, Taiwan Semi expects revenues between $7.8 billion and $7.9 billion. Whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $8.51 billion.The management has provided weak guidance since mobile phone segment is expected to continue experience softer demand. Also, uncertainty in cryptocurrency market remains a concern.However, HPC segment is expected to strengthen in the second quarter.Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 47-49% and operating margin is anticipated between 35% and 37%. This is based on the exchange rate assumption of $1= NT$ 29.20. Unfavorable product mix is expected to prevail in the second quarter and thus the management has lowered its guidance for gross margin.Additionally, tax rate is expected to lie in the range of 18-19% in the next quarter.For 2018, the company has raised its guidance for CapEx which is now anticipated to lie between $11.5 billion and $12 billion.Our TakeWe believe Taiwan Semi’s strong focus toward innovation will continue to drive its top-line growth in the long run.Moreover, the company’s increasing investments in research and development bodewell for the idea of product innovation and expansion.The company is also using EUV layers to make its 7 NM and N7 Plus more advanced to provide better density and greater power reduction. This is expected to enrich the company’s portfolio and hence boost revenues.Further, the emerging trend of artificial intelligence and establishment of 5G networks are likely to bring in growth opportunities for the company as there will be an increase in the demand for semiconductors.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderTaiwan Semi carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report) and AMETEK (AME  -  Free Report).

63,AME,"On Apr 6, we issued an updated research report on technology firm, AMETEK Inc. (AME  -  Free Report).The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).AMETEK is a leading worldwide manufacturer of electronic appliances and electromechanical devices. The company sells its products globally through two major operating groups — the Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”) and Electromechanical Group (“EMG”). Growth DriversPrice Performance: AMETEK has outperformed its industry in the past year. Shares of the company have gained 34.9% compared with the industry’s growth of 26.2% in the same time period. AMETEK’s top-line growth is benefiting from improved end-market demand and market share gains. The company continues to reap benefits from the execution of its four core growth strategies of operational excellence, global market expansion, investments in product development and strategic acquisitions.Also, the diversification in end markets like aerospace, defense, medical, automation and other industrial markets, with consistent focus on technology innovation and customer support through all phases of the economic cycle, has enabled the company post solid results over the past few quarters. A sustained drive toward geographic and market diversification has further helped AMETEK expand its customer base.Moreover, the company’s strong business portfolio serves as another growth driver. In fact, AMETEK has been consistently introducing new and improved products that added to its vastly differentiated product pipeline. New products introduced over the last three years comprised 24% of revenues. This indicates that the company is not only good at developing products but also at marketing them.Despite the uncertainties prevailing in the global economy, AMETEK has bullish revenue and earnings expectations. The ongoing revolution in electronic appliances and electromechanical devices enables the company to capitalize on the opportunities and strengthen its position in the market. It also expects to leverage on the solid growth potential of the acquired companies to drive robust performance in the future.For the first quarter of 2018, AMETEK expects sales to be up low-double digits year over year. Earnings are expected in the range of 70-72 cents per share, up 17-20% from the prior-year quarter.For 2018, AMETEK expects sales to increase approximately 7-9%, driven by contributions from recent acquisitions and 3-5% organic sales growth. Earnings are expected to be in the range of $2.95-$3.05 per share, up 13-17% year over year.HeadwindsA major portion of AMETEK’s revenues is generated from operations outside the United States. Also, significant dollar strength and adverse foreign currency fluctuations erode the profitability of the company.Furthermore, though acquisitions are part of AMETEK’s growth strategy, unsuccessful execution and integration of new buyouts and an increase in acquisition costs due to stiff competition are likely to negatively impact its sales/margin performance.AMETEK, Inc.

Moreover, the solution will enable the company to operate its system more efficiently while reducing operating costs, as well as ensuring theft detection, outage management, high impedance detection and other safety diagnostics.OpenWay Riva a Boon for ItronNotably, Itron’s OpenWay Riva features a standards-compliant, IPv6 multi-application network, jointly developed by Itron and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report).Last month, Utilidata, Inc. a global software company and Itron joined forces to deliver a technology solution to help electric utility companies modernize the electric grid.

The deal will augment the wide smart grid solution portfolio of Itron offering utilities. It will also help to better manage the distributed energy resources (“DER”) of both firms.Notably, Itron aims to partner with several other DER vendors to optimize grid efficiency. In fact, Itron is already working with sonnen on a project in California for increased deployment of DER. Additionally, the project will help customers, utilities and other energy service companies to monitor the impact of DERs by forecasting them in advance.Itron, Inc. Price  Itron, Inc. Price | Itron, Inc. Quote Thus, Itron’s alliance with sonnen reflects its attempt to offer solutions enabling electric and gas utilities for developing smart grids to manage assets and lower operational costs. In sync with this, Itron recently teamed up with Utilidata, Inc., a global software company to help electric utility companies modernize electric grid.Of late, GTM Research, a leading market analysis and advisory firm, recognized Itron among The Networked Grid Top 10 Smart Grid Vendors in the submarket of advanced metering infrastructure (“AMI”). According to its latest report, Itron has shipped the highest automated meter reading and AMI communications modules quarter over quarter in North America.Moreover, Itron remains committed to strengthen its ability by delivering a broader set of solutions and innovation in the smart city. Hence, the company’s differentiated software and services offerings, combined with ongoing operational discipline, will drive its the top line.However, Itron stock has gained around 15%, underperforming its industry’s growth of 31% due to elevated expenses and intense competition in the AMI space.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderItron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Badger Meter, Inc.

66,AME,"Itron, Inc. (ITRI  -  Free Report) has been experiencing high demand for its OpenWay Riva solutions.  Also, focus on restructuring, acquisitions and backlog strength are other vital growth drivers for the company. However, elevated expenses and competition in the AMI space remain headwinds.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 21%.Below, we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring ItronValue Growth Momentum (VGM) ScoreItron currently has a Zacks VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. The VGM Score of A, along with some other key metrics, makes the company a solid choice for investors.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryItron has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 2.93%.Price PerformanceThe company has outperformed the industry it belongs to over the past three months. The stock has gained 7.1%, while the industry recorded growth of 6.6%.Higher Inventory Turnover RatioOver the trailing 12 months, the inventory turnover ratio for Itron has been 6.9% compared with the industry’s level of 4.9%. A higher inventory turnover than the industry average implies that inventory is sold at a faster rate, suggesting inventory management effectiveness. Growth Drivers in PlaceIn February 2018, Itron approved a new restructuring plan to optimize its global supply chain in manufacturing operations, product development, and sales and marketing organizations. This plan will result in estimated annualized savings of $45-$50 million, post completion, which is expected by the end of 2020. The restructuring plan also supports the company's goals to drive profitability beyond the near-term mid-teens EBITDA target.Further, Itron’s acquisition of Silver Spring Networks will strengthen its ability to deliver a broader set of solutions, accelerate pace of growth, and innovation in the smart city and industrial IoT markets. The integration of Silver Spring is on track and Itron has confirmed $50 million of run-rate cost synergies by the end of 2020.Again, Itron witnessed a steady backlog growth in 2017 backed by a number of new customer contracts. The company secured several notable contracts in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, Itron expanded its project with Duke Energy to install an additional 3 million smart meters. It also signed a four-year distributed energy management contract extension with Pepco Holdings to manage its demand-response program.In addition, Itron booked a five-year contract with NV Energy to implement Itron IntelliSOURCE. Itron’s contracts with Consumers Energy, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation and Questar Gas in North America, as well as new business at Sanepar in Brazil, and with SUEZ and Veolia in France will also be conducive to the company’s backlog.Notably, Itron’s total backlog has increased 13% on a compounded annual basis and 12-month backlog has risen 15% over the past five years. These growth trends reflect strong industry demand for new technologies, and an expanding group of OpenWay Riva adopters across electricity, gas and water utilities. The company has been awarded $325-million contracts which are not yet reflected in the backlog. This apart, it has $5-million OpenWay Riva endpoints committed by customers, including Avista, Vectren, National Grid, Public Service of New Mexico and others.Headwinds for ItronIn 2018, Itron anticipates to witness pre-tax restructuring charges in the $100-$110 million band for the latest restructuring plan. The company expects to record majority of this charge in first-quarter 2018. Further, Itron will incur approximately $60 million of one-time severance, professional fee and facility cost to achieve synergies from the Silver Spring acquisition. Most of these costs will be accrued in the first half of this year.Itron’s liquidity might be affected by competitive pressure, changes in estimated liabilities for product warranties and litigation, future business combinations, and capital market fluctuations. The company will be under margin pressure due to heightened competition in the AMI space, particularly in North America, which could drag down meter prices.Bottom LineInvestors might want to hold on to the stock, at present, as it has ample prospects of outperforming peers in the near future.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Teradyne, Inc. (TER  -  Free Report), AMETEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report) and Fortive Corporation (FTV  -  Free Report).

71,AME,"On Mar 7, we issued an updated research report on Itron, Inc. (ITRI  -  Free Report). The company is poised to benefit from the Silver Spring acquisition, backlog strength, expansion of the OpenWay Riva technology and focus on restructuring plan. However, elevated expenses due to restructuring are expected to affect results.Let’s illustrate these growth factors in detail.Silver Spring Acquisition to Boost ResultsItron’s acquisition of Silver Spring Networks will strengthen the former’s ability to deliver a broader set of solutions, accelerate pace of growth and innovation in the smart city and industrial IoT markets. The integration of Silver Spring is progressing well and Itron has confirmed $50 million of run-rate cost synergies by the end of 2020. It also anticipates achieving $20 million on a run-rate basis by the end of this year, which will drive approximately $10 million of realized operating expense savings in 2018. These savings will ramp up in the second half of the year.Backlog Strength a Boon for ItronItron witnessed a steady backlog growth in 2017 driven by a number of new customer contracts. The company secured several notable contracts in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, Itron expanded its project with Duke Energy to install an additional 3 million smart meters. It also signed a four-year distributed energy management contract extension with Pepco Holdings to manage its demand-response program. In addition, Itron booked a five-year contract with NV Energy to implement Itron IntelliSOURCE.Itron’s contracts with Consumers Energy, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation and Questar Gas in North America as well as new business at Sanepar in Brazil, and with SUEZ and Veolia in France will also provide support to the company’s backlog.  Thus, the rising backlog will drive its organic revenue growth.Itron to Gain From OpenWay RivaOver the past five years, Itron’s total backlog has increased 13% on a compounded annual basis and 12-month backlog has risen 15%. These growth trends reflect strong industry demand for new technologies, and an expanding group of OpenWay Riva adopters across electricity, gas and water utilities. The company has been awarded $325-million contracts which are not yet reflected in the backlog. Including the $325 million of business, it has $5-million OpenWay Riva endpoints committed by customers, including Avista, Vectren, National Grid, Public Service of New Mexico and others. Additionally, AVANGRID and Eletrobras are installing OpenWay Riva.Focus on Restructuring to Drive PerformanceThis February, Itron’s board of directors approved a new restructuring plan to optimize its global supply chain in manufacturing operations, product development, and sales and marketing organizations. This plan will result in an estimated annualized savings in the range of $45-$50 million after completion, which is expected by the end of 2020. The restructuring plan also supports the company's goals to drive profitability beyond near-term mid-teens EBITDA target.Elevated Expenses to Mar ProfitIn 2018, Itron anticipates to witness pre-tax restructuring charges in the range of $100-$110 million for the new restructuring plan, primarily for severance and other one-time termination benefits. The company expects to record majority of this charge in the first quarter. Of the total estimated charge, approximately 95% will result in cash expenditures.Further, Itron will incur approximately $60 million of one-time severance, professional fee and facility cost to achieve synergies from the Silver Spring acquisition. Most of these costs will be accrued in the first half of this year.Share Price PerformanceItron has underperformed its industry with respect to price performance in a year’s time. The stock has gained around 25%, while the industry has recorded growth of 37% during the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderItron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

73,AME,"Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) has been selected by T-Mobile to provide 5G radio access products for the latter’s deployment of a nationwide 5G network in the United States. The company’s latest products, available for 600 MHz and millimeter-wave in 28 GHz and 39 GHz, will enable T-Mobile to start deployment of 5G in its network in the current year.In collaboration with Ericsson, T-Mobile is building out 5G in New York, Las Vegas as well as Los Angeles by leveraging Ericsson's 5G New Radio (NR) radios and baseband. In fact, Ericsson's enhanced 5G Platform will aid the rollout of the network, catering to the increasing needs for customers. Based on first 3GPP 5G NR standards, Ericsson had also launched 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) commercial software in early February. The software will be available in fourth-quarter 2018, which will offer multi-band support for worldwide deployment thus enabling T-Mobile to build out 5G network in the current year.Meanwhile, Ericsson and TIM, an Italy's major ICT company, has successfully deployed first virtual Radio Access Network (vRAN) platform in a live advanced LTE network in Turin. Notably, both companies have begun to digitalize TIM's nationwide radio access network in Italy. The vRAN technology supports network transformation into a flexible cloud platform, thereby facilitating optimization of processes and reducing associated costs related to the management of innovative services and automation.Additionally, Ericsson and TIM are looking to pool their efforts to develop Self Organizing Network solutions that have increased automation with considerable improvements of customer experience. The partnership also augments TIM's transformation project, DigiTIM, which focuses on better customer experience and improved operational efficiency through automation of network systems and virtualization.Existing Business ScenarioBeing one of the premier telecom services providers, Ericsson is much in demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity. As operators continue to invest in telecom core networks for deployment of new service offerings such as Voice over LTE, the company stands to benefit significantly from the same. For instance, the company is enthusiastic about the turnaround of the Chinese market in terms of 4G deployments and believes, which is likely to be a significant growth driver going forward. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 6.8% outperforming the industry’s rally of 5.8%.Moving ahead, the company foresees mainstream 4G offerings to give way to 5G technology. Meanwhile, the impending deployment of 5G networks in 2020 is expected to boost the adoption of IoT devices with technologies like network slicing gaining more prominence. In fact, we believe 5G is likely to accelerate the digital transformation in many industries, thereby enabling new use cases in areas such as IoT, automation, transport and big data. For 2022, the Ericsson Mobility forecasts 550 million 5G subscriptions, with North America expected to lead the way. Such positive industry trends are expected to boost the company’s long-term growth.However, of late, the company seems to be grappling with negative industry trends and a declining wireless equipment market. Additionally, it expects an increasingly challenging investment environment in Europe and Latin America. Lower IPR licensing revenues and an unfavorable mix between coverage, and capacity and services are further adding to the company’s concerns.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Aspen Technology, Inc. (AZPN  -  Free Report), Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and AMTEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report).

80,AME,"A stock at a 52-week high is considered a winner. The level works as an indicator for many investors for buying or selling the stock.At the same time, a few investors regard the stock as an overpriced one at that level. While they are not completely wrong, all stocks hitting a 52-week high aren’t overpriced.In fact, in an attempt to avoid stocks that are trading near their 52-week high levels, an investor might miss out on top gainers.A stock can continue the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we will discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on the catchphrase “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting 52-week high levels are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors, who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors’ special attention (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them achieve the level. But that doesn’t always mean an impending decline. The factors — robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions — that motivated investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank <=2No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are five of the six stocks that made it through the screen:Party City Holdco Inc. (PRTY  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures and sources party goods, including paper and plastic tableware, balloons, Halloween costumes, accessories, novelties and party gifts.

84,AME,"Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report) reported decent fourth-quarter 2017 results, driven by robust sales growth, particularly in Personal Health and Diagnosis & Treatment businesses.The Dutch electronics giant posted fourth-quarter net income of €899 million ($1,058.8 million), an increase of 40.5% compared with the prior-year quarter’s figure of €640 million. The bottom line benefited from lower financial expenses, despite negligible sales growth.The company’s net income in the fourth quarter included net income related to Philips Lighting’s business, all of which is reported in discontinued operations.Inside the HeadlinesTotal revenues in the quarter came in at €5,303 million ($6,245.9 million), relatively flat (down 0.1%) from the year-ago tally. The year-over-year decline can primarily be attributed to fall in sales of Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses and HealthTech Other segment. This was partially mitigated by impressive performances from Personal Health and Diagnosis & Treatment businesses. The company, however, registered a 5% comparable year-over-year sales growth.For full-year 2017, the company recorded sales of €17,780 million ($20,941.3 million), advanced 2.1% from the year-ago tally.Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Koninklijke Philips N.V. QuotePhilips’ adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) — the company’s preferred measure of operational performance — increased 9% year over year to €884 million ($1,041.2 million) benefiting from higher volumes, procurement savings and other cost productivity.Meanwhile, net cash flow generated from operating activities came in at €1,202 million ($1,415.7 million) compared with net cash flow of €758 million in the prior-year quarter. The company’s comparable order intake rose 7% year over year, driven by strong growth in Diagnosis & Treatment businesses.Segmental RevenuesIn the fourth quarter, Personal Health sales increased 0.7% year over year to €2,181 million ($2,568.7 million). This segment reported growth of 1% in nominal sales and hike of 6% in comparable sales. The upside in comparable sales was driven by high-single digit growth in Health & Wellness as well as Sleep & Respiratory Care, while Domestic Appliances and Personal Care recorded growth in mid-single digit. On a geographic basis, double-digit growth in Asia Pacific and India, high-single digit growth in Central & Eastern Europe and China, bolstered revenues in the quarter.Diagnosis & Treatmentrevenues rose 3% in the quarter to €2,092 million ($2,463.9 million). While nominal sales reported growth of 3%, comparable sales grew 6% for the quarter. High-single digit growth in Ultrasound and mid-single digit growth in Image-Guided Therapy and Diagnostic Imaging drove this segment’s sales. On a geographic basis, double-digit growth in China, Middle East and Turkey as well as high-single digit growth in North America acted as catalysts.Connected Care & Health Informaticsrevenues were down 4.5% in the quarter to €912 million ($1,074.2 million). On a nominal basis, segmental revenues declined 5% year over year, while comparable sales grew 2% for the quarter. Comparable sales growth was primarily driven by high-single digit growth in Healthcare Informatics as well as low-single-digit growth in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions.On a geographic basis, while mid-single digit growth was posted mature geographies, mid-single-digit decline was witnessed in growth geographies. Double-digit growth in India and high-single digit growth in North America proved conducive to sales, which was somewhat offset by double-digit decline in Middle East & Turkey and Africa.Revenues in the HealthTech & Other segment continued to show weakness, shrinking 22.2% to €119 million ($140.1 million). The decline in this segment can mainly be attributed to lower royalty income during the quarter.Since the third quarter of 2017, Philips has been reporting results of Philips Lighting under discontinued operations.Liquidity & Share RepurchaseExiting the quarter on Dec 31, 2017, Philips’ cash and cash equivalents declined to €1,939 million ($2,322.7 million) from €2,334 million a year back. The company’s long-term debt rose to €4,044 million ($4,844.3 million) compared with €4,021 million a year ago.Diligent Cost-Savings ProgramsPhilips has been gaining significantly from its DfX program, along with other productivity and savings programs. These programs have been designed to maximize the value potential of the company, while accelerating growth by leveraging on innovation and operational execution.During the reported quarter, the company achieved procurement savings of €81 million, driven by the DfX program, while other productivity programs also resulted in a savings of €52 million. Overall, the company generated an impressive annual savings of €483 million, higher than the targeted savings of €400 million.Notable Developments During the QuarterDuring the reported quarter, Philips announced the acquisition of VitalHealth that would complement Philips Wellcentive’s solution including health informatics and patient engagement programs. VitalHealth is a leading supplier of cloud-based population health management solutions for the delivery of personalized care outside the hospitals.Moreover, the company obtained the 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for marketing its new eL18-4 transducer for ‘small parts’ assessment. The company is anticipated to launch the newest solution at the 16th World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology Congress in Taipei.Update on Lighting DealAt the end of fourth-quarter 2017, Philips held 29.01% of the issued share capital of Philips Lighting shares. Philips aims to sell the business completely over the next few years.GuidanceBased on the present market scenario and combining with the company’s strong order book, Philips projects full-year sales growth of 4-6%. The company also anticipates its Adjusted EBITA margin to improve around 100 basis points this year.Our TakeIn the past couple of years, Philips has successfully morphed from a lighting company into a healthcare technology provider. Further, the company's transformation from a hardware-oriented to a software-driven business, with a higher-margin and recurring-revenue model is impressive. The company also believes that increased spending on healthcare and fitness will act as a long-term growth driver, going forward.Moreover, the company remains optimistic about the prospects of its Diagnosis & Treatment vertical on account of positive industry trends as Image-Guided Therapy and Ultrasound equipment sales are acting as major profit churners. Further, the company’s ardent lookout for strategic acquisitions has enabled it to strengthen core business. This apart, the company is strongly benefiting from three of its comprehensive performance improvement and change-initiative programs — namely Accelerate, End2End productivity, and Design for Excellence — implemented earlier, consequently acting as a key driver of growth.Philips currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other Stocks to Consider Some other stocks worth considering in the same space include Aspen Technology, Inc.

Barring minor hiccups, Amphenol’s share price has steadily been on an uptrend since early July. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.2%.Growth DriversAmphenol’s top-line growth is benefiting from improved end-market demand, new product rollouts and market share gains. Demand continues to be strong in automotive, industrial and military markets. The diversification in end markets, with consistent focus on technology innovation and customer support through all phases of the economic cycle has enabled the company to post solid performance over the past few quarters. A sustained drive for geographic and market diversification has further helped Amphenol to expand its customer base and develop new applications.In addition, Amphenol remains encouraged by its expanding presence in the fast-growing commercial aerospace market and is well positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of electronics content in next-generation planes. These advanced electronic systems also require new higher technology interconnect solutions to enhance fuel efficiency and improve passenger experience, all of which create excellent opportunities for the company.Despite the uncertainties prevailing in the global economy, Amphenol has bullish revenue and earnings expectations.

Premium technologies of MKS Instruments (such as the Green Idle Mode technology) and state-of-the-art products (like the EtherCAT pressure control product line) help solve complex end-user problems, in turn, strengthening the company’s customer relationships. The company believes these positives, as well as sturdy sales generated from the life sciences, general industrial and research end markets will likely drive its top- and bottom-line performance in the quarters ahead.Moreover, MKS Instruments intends to boost its financial fundamentals through strategic inorganic moves. For instance, the Newport Corporation acquisition (completed in April 2016) is driving the company’s top and bottom lines, by reinforcing its presence in the Life Sciences, Semiconductor, Research and Industrial markets. On the back of this buyout, the company anticipates generating $40 million cost synergies by the end of 2017.In addition, on Apr 3, 2017, MKS Instruments successfully divested its Data Analytics Solutions business to Sartorius Stedim Biotech. MKS Data Analytics Solutions offers a premium solution to end users, named Umetrics Suite. The company secured after-tax gain of $72 million cash from the spin-off process and intends to fund productive capital investment programs with the proceeds.MKS Instruments has also implemented a new financial strategy aimed at reducing interest expenses and deleveraging its balance sheet over the long term. Earlier this July, the company noted that it has successfully accomplished the third repricing of secured term loan and thereby trimmed the interest expense of its term loan by 50 basis points (from LIBOR plus 2.75% to LIBOR plus 2.25%). Notably, via two consecutive prepayments, MKS Instruments reduced its principle owing amount from $780 million to $523 million.The company projects to report earnings within $1.32-$1.56 per share and revenues within $450-$490 million in third-quarter 2017.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are listed below:Applied Materials, Inc.

87,AME,"Premium global e-commerce solutions provider, Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI  -  Free Report)) has been disappointing investors of late. The company continues to grapple with rise in total costs, along with a drab revenue performance. Let us delve deeper and try to find out why it would be wise to dump the stock from your portfolio at the moment.Disappointing Fiscal Second Quarter 2017Pitney Bowes reported adjusted earnings of 33 cents per share in second-quarter fiscal 2017, down 15.4% year over year. Performance in two of the company’s three segments, namely, Small and Medium Business (“SMB”) and Enterprise Business Solutions (“EBS”), declined year over year, proving a drag on top-line performance.During second-quarter 2017, SMB Solutions revenues dipped 3% year over year to $436.4 million. The tepid performance was due to softness in the North American Mailing business (down 1%) and International Mailing Business (down 11%).This segment continues to suffer from lower recurring revenue streams and rental revenues. Additionally, a waning recurring revenues trajectory and poor equipment sales are making matters worse.EBS revenues declined 4% year over year to $204.0 million. While Presort Services (up 2%) drove top-line growth of this segment, it was more than offset by the drab performance of the production mail business (down 11%). Uncertain global economic environment is anticipated to impact production mail and software businesses in the near term, consequently limiting the company’s growth momentum.Decline in Software SalesThough the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company adopted multiple measures to broaden the base of its business and boost profits at the software segment, fluctuations in license revenues remains as a major headwind. In general, licensed software businesses are always susceptible to swings based on large transactions. Given the scale of Pitney Bowes’ business, it remains vulnerable to those swings.Over the last three months, PBI’s shares dropped 11.6%, wider than the industry’s average loss of 3.9%.Moreover, the company’s current focus to drive growth by penetrating into new areas has put the margin performance under pressure in the short run.Escalating CostsPitney Bowes has been experiencing a surge in operating expenses on account of ERP implementation in the United States and higher marketing expenses in relation to aggressive advertising as well as marketing strategies for strengthening brand value. The company expects marketing expense to be up on a year-over-year basis.In addition, it expects incremental marketing expense in the ERP program, related to digital capabilities enhancement, for entire 2017. Also, capital expenses associated with the ERP project remains a drag. Till the benefits of ERP materialize, the company is anticipated to incur higher capital expenses that might exert pressure on margins.The array of problems are limiting the company’s growth momentum, consequently putting Pitney Bowes’ investors in bumpier ride.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Apptio Inc. (APTI  -  Free Report), AMTEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report) and Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

In fact, AMETEK has been consistently introducing new and improved products that add to its vastly differentiated product pipeline. Some of the recent launches include Custom Cooling Systems, the new DC power supply and high-speed camera.The consistent product introductions help the company to create customer loyalty and facilitate market share gains, thereby boosting revenues.Also, MOCON Inc. acquisition, which was completed by the company in June this year, will complement its existing gas analysis instrumentation business. MOCON’s products will create opportunities for AMETEK to further expand into the growing food and pharmaceutical package testing market.Also, the company has gained momentum from strong fundamentals and better-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results reported on Aug 2. Since then, the stock has moved up 3.5%.AMETEK’s top line increased 8.9% from the year-ago period to $1.06 billion. Also, non-GAAP earnings of 65 cents per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Earnings are expected to be in the range of 60-62 cents per share, up 7-11% year over year. For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 62 cents.AMETEK’s strong revenue growth, solid financial conditions, increasing market share and strong long-term growth potential position it favorably.AMTEK, Inc.

89,AME,"On Sep 12, we issued an updated research report on technology firm, AMETEK Inc. (AME  -  Free Report).AMETEK is a leading worldwide manufacturer of electronic appliances and electromechanical devices. The company sells its products globally through two major operating groups, the Electronic Instruments Group (“EIG”) and the Electromechanical Group (“EMG”). Growth DriversManagement has been making strategies to improve its productivity, increase organic sales through global market expansion and new product development. This, in turn, has helped AMETEK to build an excellent backlog that has resulted in solid performance.Solid execution and global market expansion are other positives.Moreover, the company’s strong business portfolio serves as another growth driver. In fact, AMETEK has been consistently introducing new and improved products that added to its vastly differentiated product pipeline. Some of the recent launches include Custom Cooling Systems, the new DC power supply and high-speed camera.The consistent product introductions by the company generate customer loyalty and facilitate market share gains, thereby boosting revenues. Evidently, products introduced over the last three years made up 24% of revenues. This indicates that the company is not only good at developing products but also at marketing them.Also, AMETEK supplements organic growth with strategic acquisitions. For this purpose, it generally looks for niche players that complement one of its many product lines or round out its portfolio.Recently, the company completed the acquisition of instrumentation provider, MOCON, Inc. for $30 per share in cash or a total value of about $182 million. The deal will compliment its existing gas analysis instrumentation business. MOCON’s products will provide opportunities to AMETEK to further expand into the growing food and pharmaceutical package testing market.Estimate revision trends for 2017 also remain favorable with 10 estimates moving north and none moving in the opposite direction in the last 60 days. Additionally, earnings estimates climbed 1.6% to $2.52 per share over the same time frame.HeadwindsNotably, AMETEK has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. Shares of the company have gained 33.6% compared with the industry’s growth of 37.4% in the same time period.A major portion of AMETEK’s revenues is generated from operations outside the United States. Also, significant dollar strength and adverse foreign currency fluctuations erode the profitability of the company. Therefore, sales in 2016 suffered 1% from foreign currency headwinds.Furthermore, though acquisitions are a part of AMETEK’s growth strategy, unsuccessful execution and integration of new buyouts and an increase in acquisition costs due to stiff competition is likely to negatively impact its sales/margin performance. AMTEK, Inc. Price and Consensus AMTEK, Inc. Price and Consensus | AMTEK, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAMETEK currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), Stamps.com Inc. (STMP  -  Free Report) and Activision Blizzard, Inc.

90,AME,"On Aug 23, we issued an updated research report on Itron, Inc. (ITRI  -  Free Report). The company is likely to benefit from consistent focus on expanding its portfolio of outcome-based solutions. In addition, the Comverge acquisition, strong bookings, and backlog and new projects are anticipated to stoke growth.Notably, Itron closed the acquisition of Comverge in June 2017. Following the Comverge acquisition, demand response in energy management solutions fit very well within Itron. Combining these solutions under the Itron brand will simplify customer sales, service and deployment, as well as expand the portfolio of outcome-based services. Though the Comverge buyout will have not have a material effect on earnings per share in 2017, it will be fully accretive in 2018.Further, Itron continues to focus on expanding its portfolio of outcome-based solutions aimed at higher growth opportunities by utilizing the power of the OpenWay Riva platform.

Itron's organic R&D projects, partnering with third-party developers and selective M&A establish its strategy to deliver even more value to customers and increase the contribution of outcome-based services.Again, there is around $350 million worth of business awarded, which is not yet included in Itron’s backlog, reflecting ample prospects for the company. In addition, there is a solid pipeline of Itron’s Water business for the next 12 months, including large projects in the Americas, Europe and the Middle East, which are anticipated to drive top-line growth in this line.In a year’s time Itron has outperformed the industry it belongs to.

95,AME,"Motorola Solutions, Inc.(MSI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, after the market closes.In fact, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 28% in the previous quarter. It has also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters with an average beat of 16.62%.Notably, Motorola Solutions has an impressive track record with respect to earnings that is reflected in its price performance for the last one year. While the stock has surged 33.7%, its industry gained only 1% in the same period.However, our quantitative model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Motorola Solutions this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen, which is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Motorola Solutions has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 99 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Motorola Solutions has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, that alone is not sufficient to secure an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) stock going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Motorola Solutions, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Motorola Solutions, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Motorola Solutions, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely at PlayThe company’s efforts to expand its product portfolio are encouraging. In fact, its performance has been boosted by the acquisition of Airwave Solutions, which was completed last year. Moreover, the Airwave Solutions buyout is anticipated to drive second-quarter revenues. Also, the acquisitions of Spillman Technologies and Interexport are expected to augment the top line.Motorola Solutions projects revenues in the to-be-reported quarter to improve in the band of 2% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in 98 cents to $1.03 range.We are also impressed by the company’s efforts to reward investors through dividend payments and buybacks.

96,AME,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and AMETEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because AMETEK is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AME in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 63 cents per share for AME, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AME, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.61% heading into earnings season.AMTEK, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise AMTEK, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AMTEK, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that AME has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for AMETEK, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

97,AME,"Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 13.33%. The company surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 12.22%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Citrix is likely to beat estimates this quarter on the back of its perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +1.18%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged higher at 86 cents than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Citrix currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of beating earnings.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Citrix completed the spin-off and merger of its GoTo products with LogMeIn, Inc. (LOGM  -  Free Report) in Feb 2017. We expect these constant product enhancements to be value accretive for the company in the second quarter too. Besides, a centralized management of employee desktops will provide greater security, control and cost savings. This in turn might aid results in the quarter.Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenues are expected to repeat its success story by boosting the top line this quarter as well. However, adverse foreign currency movements might hamper results in the second quarter.The company expects net revenues in the band of $685--$695 million for the second quarter. Earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) for the quarter are projected in the range of 97 cents--$1.00. Citrix Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Citrix Systems, Inc.

98,AME,"Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 1, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.34%. Also, its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 3.16%.Let’s see, how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayThe fact that Harris is a highly leveraged company might hurt results in the fourth quarter. The Communication Systems segment’s disappointing performance in the previous quarter is likely to continue in the reported quarter as well.Though positive on the company’s growth on the back of acquisition strategy, we note that all buyouts have integration risks associated with them. Failure to successfully integrate the newly acquired companies into its own business model may result in trouble for Harris. This might further affect results in the quarter to be reported. Also, weakness in international markets might lead to lower-than-expected sales of tactical radio products.However, the company’s efforts to reward shareholders are encouraging. In Apr 2017, the company’s board announced a quarterly cash dividend of 53 cents per share. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Harris is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Harris has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.49 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Harris has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Harris Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Harris Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Harris Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Computer and Technology sector may consider the following stocks, which per our model, possess the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat in their respective quarters:AMTEK, Inc.

99,AME,"Nokia Corporation (NOK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Jul 27, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 25%. The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues. Earnings were flat on a year-over-year basis, while revenues declined year over year.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayThe company’s below-par performance of the primary division – Networks unit — is concerning. This struggling Nokia Networks unit may hurt results in the second quarter.Similar to the first quarter, the company’s net sales in Networks division is expected to decrease in the second quarter as well due to a weakening wireless infrastructure market, among other headwinds. The company’s global operations make its top line vulnerable to adverse foreign currency movements. This might further hurt the overall results this quarter.However, we are positive on the company’s resolution of its patent-related dispute with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) in May 2017. Following this patch up, Nokia will get an up-front payment in cash from Apple.Nokia’s growth-by-acquisition strategy is impressive too. At June-end, the company completed its acquisition of Comptel Corporation, a Finnish telecommunications software company. This buyout boosts Nokia’s software portfolio by adding capabilities that should help digital service providers deliver new communications services to the market faster. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nokia is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Nokia has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 4 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Nokia has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

However, it witnessed an average negative earnings surprise of 2.07% over the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Badger Meter, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Badger Meter, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Badger Meter, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderBadger Meter is poised to gain from consistent growth of new products in the municipal water market and acceleration in large metering projects. Robust economic growth in the company’s North American markets driven by recovery in oil prices will also drive growth. Moreover, sustained strength of its core water meter business, led by the latest products and recovery in the flow instrumentation business will support its quarterly results.However, Badger Meter’s performance will be marred by rise in raw material prices, delivery delays, short-term increases in inventory and higher quality-control costs.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Badger Meter is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Badger Meter currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.
