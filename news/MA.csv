0,MA,"Trade wars are a lose-lose proposition. Neither the U.S. economy, Europe's economy nor China's economy is likely to benefit.Yet, there's another angle to President Trump's trade war with China. Many U.S. businesses have been in a quiet trade war with China for years.Credit-card companies, such as Mastercard (MA), would love to have full access to China's gigantic consumer market. But China's foot-dragging resistance has made access difficult.In its latest 10-K report, Mastercard noted that in 2017, China's central bank issued ""more guidance and clarity in addition to the 2016 regulations on license application and operational requirements for network operators."" Piling guidance on guidance has been the stall tactic for years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe World Trade Organization ruled in July 2012 that China established a monopoly when it made Shanghai's UnionPay the country's sole domestic payment processor.In 2015, China finally agreed to heed the WTO ruling. Yet implementation has been slow.About a year ago, Reuters reported that Mastercard and other major credit cards were preparing to submit license requests to operate in China. Reuters said the regulatory hurdles in China could take two more years to clear.What does all this mean to stock market investors? So far, very little.If China eventually opens its credit-card markets in full, the opportunity would be tremendous for Mastercard (and its major rival Visa (V)).Meanwhile, investors should take the short-term view. Judge the stock on what Mastercard is earning now, not what might happen later.Last year, Mastercard grew earnings 24%, its best annual performance in six years. The Street expects earnings to leap 39%, which would be its best gain in 10 years.Mastercard's stock chart looks promising. The stock cleared a 183.83 buy point in a flat-base pattern in May. Now the stock is consolidating above its 10-week line.In the meantime, Trump has characterized the trade game with China as a sucker's game, with the U.S. being the suckers. Consider this: As the major payment processors have struggled to get full access to China's market, China's UnionPay has expanded its reach to 162 countries.Regardless of what an investor thinks of Trump, he's nailed China's stance for what it is: Free trade for me but not for thee.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:ObamaCare Just Exploded: What It MeansThe IPO Marijuana StockWhy A Failed Breakout Isn't Always A FailureIBD Stock Of The DayThe Latest Inside Investor's Corner

3,MA,"Like any other stocks, a bank stock that falls into a long decline tends to eventually rise and emerge as a new market leader. When it does, investors are looking for ways to buy into the recovery.Investor's Business Daily's discussion of CAN SLIM strategies largely involves chart patterns that range from as few as five weeks to several months. Company turnarounds and industry cycles tend to take longer than this. As a result, some base patterns can stretch into months and years.A saucer base is a chart pattern that sometimes forms in just a few months. Mastercard's (MA) action in April to September of 2016 is one good example.But this base often requires one or two years to mature. This kind of ""geological pace"" seriously tests the attention span of modern investors, many of whom seek constant motion, or otherwise move on.Saucer bases are sometimes shallow, even below the 15% level that determines a flat base. But they tend to always appear shallow. This is due to their length. A cup base that is 35% deep and eight weeks long can look quite severe.But spread that 35% correction out over a year, and it looks like a saucer, not a cup.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseJPMorgan Chase (JPM) dug a saucer base that was 29% deep between April 2015 and November 2016. Investors may alternately read the chart as a base formed between November 2015 and November 2016. Either reading is valid. And the ultimate breakout cleared both of those buy points in a single swoop.The S&P 500 notched a high in May 2015, then slipped into a long double-dip consolidation. This included the late August 2015 sell-off, begun in China, which wiped an estimated $2.1 trillion from U.S. stock markets in a six-day sell off. The index finally recovered to retake its May 2015 high in July 2016.Banks followed a slightly different timeline. JPMorgan chalked up its high in late July 2015. It quickly recovered from the late August sell-off. The bank was working its way through four quarters of earnings declines and weak revenue when it was hit again by powerful selling in January 2016. JPMorgan settled into a gradual uptrend, although bank stocks remained generally depressed ahead of what markets expected to be a Hillary Clinton presidency.That uptrend formed the right side of JPMorgan's 15-month saucer base.Because saucer bases tend to be long, there is a good deal of action that goes on within them. JP Morgan, for instance, formed a valid nine-week cup-with-handle base in June and July of 2016. It cleared the buy point of that handle on Aug. 4, 2016. Chart-wise, that may have been a valid breakout. But volume did not reach the 40%-above-average you'd like to see in a breakout. In addition, the bank had reported a gain of only 1% gain in its second quarter, even though that marked its first profit gain in five quarters.The stock barely lost ground, remaining sloggy through October, ahead of the presidential election. However, by this time, the company had reported a powerful 20% rise in Q3 earnings and a recovery to 10% revenue growth.On Nov. 9, bank stocks stepped into a leadership role as the market rallied on election results. JPMorgan broke out past potential buy points at 69.13 (1) and 70.71 (not seen on the accompanying chart). It also cleared the tops of handles that formed on the right side of the saucer. The stock was immediately extended, posting a 13% gain for the week and rallying more than 30% over the next three months.RELATED:Major Indexes Fall Broadly; These 2 Retailers Sink Especially HardThis Genetics Firm Broke Out On Improving Trends In Cancer TestingFast-Growing Tech Leader Joins IBD's Sector Leaders List No. 2 In Stock Checkup, This Stock Shows AccelerationPfizer Restructuring As It Plays Nice With Trump On Drug Price Hikes

4,MA,"Consistency has been a characteristic of the credit card stocks this year.At the start of 2018, the payment processor group was No. 34 among 197 industry groups. From there, the ranking at the start of each month has been 23 in February and then 22, 26, 45, again 45 and 39.Going into Friday's session, the credit-card group was No. 37.Two of the credit card stocks recently appeared in the Stock Spotlight screen.Mastercard (MA) is rated No. 1 in its group in Stock Checkup at Investors.com. The stock has some of the characteristics of a turnaround stock, though the negative side isn't bad enough to fit the definition.For example, annual earnings growth slowed to 11% and 7% in 2015-16. Last year, earnings growth picked up to 24%. The Street expects 38% growth this year.Pretax margin was 53.6% last year, the third highest in the past nine years. (The year 2013 was the peak at 55.1%.)The stock chart has some bullish traits. Mastercard completed a three-weeks-tight pattern June 22 and crossed above the 204.10 buy point Wednesday. The 3-weeks-tight is a secondary entry, which is ideal for adding shares to an existing position.Another plus is the relative strength line. The RS line is at a high, which is bullish. The line compares a stock's price action vs. the S&P 500. A rising line points to outperformance.USA Technologies (USAT) also is in the payment processor group. The small cap is No. 6 in its stock group. There are 30 stocks in the group, and 13 have Composite Ratings of 90 or better.The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number.USA is extended from a stage three consolidation. A stage three pattern is less likely to work than earlier breakouts.RELATED:The Secret To Investing? It's Just Hard WorkMastercard Could Benefit If Trump Wins Vs.

14,MA,"The higher swipe fees American Express (AXP) charges merchants compared to some rivals will remain intact, after the Supreme Court on Monday threw out a lawsuit alleging the credit-card company stifled competition by barring merchants from encouraging customers to use cards that carry lower merchant fees.XThe court ruled 5-4 in favor of American Express, saying that the company's so-called ""anti-steering"" provisions didn't violate U.S. antitrust law. The decision could bolster American Express' financials, as credit card issuers, payment processors, banks and tech companies race to attract wealthier customers and adapt to a more mobile, electronic payments landscape.American Express closed up 1.35% at 98.54 in the stock market today. Rivals Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) both slid, falling 3.25% and 3.2%, respectively. Both Visa and Mastercard were testing support at their 50-day lines.Discover Financial Services (DFS) fell 1.5%, touching its 200-day line.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe plaintiffs — Ohio and a handful of other states — argued that American Express' rules resulted in merchants having to pay higher swipe fees, which, in turn, were inherited by customers. AmEx said, basically, that they didn't.Here are five takeaways from the court's ruling:Businesses have to stomach swipe fees like those from AmEx when customers use credit cards to buy things. Thus, they sometimes try to discourage, or ""steer,"" customers away from using cards that carry higher merchant fees. When a shop takes American Express, they typically agree to the card issuer's antisteering provisions.AmEx has been doing stuff like this since the 1950s. But Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote for the majority, said that the plaintiffs' case failed to show AmEx's practices harmed competition.He also said their case failed to grasp the balancing act of who pays what on either side of a credit-card transaction. And he argued that when defining the credit card market, it should include both merchants and cardholders. He said the primary product of credit-card companies was transactions, rather than merchant services. Thus, ""the competitive effects of a restraint on transactions cannot be judged by looking at merchants alone.""""Evidence of a price increase on one side of a two-sided transaction platform cannot, by itself, demonstrate an anticompetitive exercise of market power,"" he wrote.Thomas said that instead, the plaintiffs needed to prove that American Express' anti-steering provisions raised the cost of credit-card transactions ""above a competitive level"" or reduced the number of credit-card transactions.Thomas also wrote that Visa and Mastercard have ""significant structural advantages"" over American Express. Thomas said that Visa and Mastercard accounted for more than 432 million cards in circulation in the U.S., while AmEx had only 53 million and that fewer locations accepted it.He also said that Visa and Mastercard get half their sales by collecting interest. American Express, conversely, gets most of its sales from merchant fees, and focuses more on rewards catered toward wealthier cardholders.""Amex's increased merchant fees reflect increases in the value of its services and the cost of its transactions, not an ability to charge above a competitive price,"" he continued.""It uses higher merchant fees to offer its cardholders a more robust rewards program, which is necessary to maintain cardholder loyalty and encourage the level of spending that makes it valuable to merchants.""Nomura analyst Bill Carcache, in a research note on Monday, said that a ruling against AmEx would be unlikely to cause significant damage to the company.He also said that AmEx's discount rates weren't much higher than other premium Visa and Mastercard cards, indicating that businesses wouldn't gain that much from discouraging customers from using their AmEx cards.""Although we never expected a negative fundamental impact on AXP's business even if the ruling went against it ... putting this issue in the rearview removes an overhang and is incrementally positive for the stock, in our view,"" he wrote.CFRA analyst Chris Kuiper appeared to agree.""We think this bolsters AXP's competitive positioning against rivals and removes a potential negative catalyst in the near term that may have been weighing on shares.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:PayPal Buddies Up To Visa, Mastercard — And New Accounts Roll InIBD Stock Of The Day: Online Payment Leader PayPal Hits Buy ZoneIBD Stock Of The Day Is One Of Several Payment Processors In Buy ZonesSquare Moves Into Buy Zone, Leading Italy-Resistant Financials

16,MA,"When a company posts high pretax margins year after year, the situation points to two realities.The first reality is that the company is doing something right. The second is that the company might be operating in a space where high profit margins are the rule, not the exception.Take a look at three stocks that have appeared recently in the Big Cap 20 with the best pretax margins.The three are Mastercard (MA), E-Trade (ETFC) and Charles Schwab (SCHW).See a trend? Yes, the money businesses are places where high margins are commonplace.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn that situation, how should an investor respond? Should the investor buy shares and then sit back and watch the stock price rise?If only it were that simple.When weighing stocks with high pretax margins, the investor should ask two questions.How do those margins look vs. companies in the same industry group? (Maybe in that context they are not so high after all.)And how do the margins compare to the company's history? (In some cases, margins may be declining.)Mastercard posted a pretax margin of 53.6% in 2017.In the eight previous years from 2009 to 2016, Mastercard's average pretax margin was 51.9%.The highest was 55.1% in 2013. The lowest was 44.1% in 2009.Within the credit payment processor group, only one stock in 2017 had a higher pretax margin than Mastercard — Visa (V), which had a 64.7% pretax margin last year.E-Trade Financial pegged a 45.9% pretax margin in 2017. In three of the previous eight years, the company lost money. The average pretax margin in the remaining five years was 25.7%.Does that sound like a problem? It isn't. Pretax margin stepped up in each of the past five years — 17.2% in 2013 and then 25.3%, 36.6%, 41.4% and 45.9%.Within the brokerage group, two stocks had a higher pretax margin than E-Trade — Interactive Brokers (IBKR) (pretax margin 54.4% in 2017) and MarketAxess (MKTX) (50.9% in 2017).Charles Schwab achieved a pretax margin of 42.4%. This represented the fifth consecutive year of increasing pretax margins.The average pretax margin over the previous eight years was 31.8%.In the brokerage group, the three aforementioned brokerages did better than Schwab on pretax margin — Interactive Brokers, MarketAxess and E-Trade.Although profit margins are important, the full range of CAN SLIM criteria should be considered before buying a stock.In some cases, a strong stock may have thin margins. Amazon.com (AMZN) had a pretax margin of 2.1% in 2017. Netflix (NFLX) delivered a pretax margin of 4.2% last year. Yet, both companies had strong revenue growth in 2017.RELATED:Oil Driller Offers High Dividend YieldP/E Ratio? Forget About ItHow To Find The Next Big Winner In Stocks

18,MA,"Square (SQ), Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), PayPal (PYPL) and Verisk Analytics (VRSK) held up nicely Tuesday even as financial stocks overall tumbled from Italy's political woes. Square, which tried to break out amid the selling Tuesday, moved back above the buy zone Wednesday, while Mastercard and Visa remain above entry points.Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) tumbled between 4% and 6% Tuesday each as investors sought safety in U.S. Treasurys, pushing the rate on the benchmark 10-year note down to 2.79%. The two-year yield skidded, but not as much, to 2.34%, squeezing the yield spread and banks' profitability on loans. (These Wall Street giants rose modestly Wednesday, with Treasury yields recouping some losses.)But financial stocks with less exposure to falling interest rates were relatively unscathed. Visa and Mastercard, for example, oversee vast payment networks but don't issue credit cards directly, unlike fellow Dow Jones components JPMorgan and American Express (AXP). That means they aren't exposed to lower rates or credit risk directly. Payments firms PayPal and Square also are largely insulated from interest rates, though Square does make some loans to small businesses. Verisk provides underwriting data analytics to the insurance industry.Here's how these five financial stocks, each of which is in a buy zone or near a buy point, are performing.

22,MA,"""Avoiding behavioral risk"" is more than a Wall Street slogan to Vladimir ""Val"" de Vassal. It is a tactic he has raised to an art form as he aims to remove subjectivity from his hunt for top-performing growth stocks for two Glenmede mutual funds of which he's lead manager. Fueled in recent quarters by leading growth stocks like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Mastercard (MA), $4 billion Large Cap Growth (GTLLX) and $2.9 billion Large Cap Core (GTLOX) both outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets racked up that four-way feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award.De Vassal and his team — including managers Paul Sullivan and Alex Attanasiu — have become adept at avoiding behavioral risk in their investment process. Instead, they focus on more than 80 objective yardsticks to measure each growth stock's worthiness. They wear blinders to block out less-meaningful information that can be distractions from data that mark growth stocks poised to advance. Emotions are a major part of behavioral risk, de Vassal says.De Vassal, age 58, talked with IBD about his strategy from his office in Philadelphia.Best Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportIBD: How do your growth-oriented mutual funds differ from rival growth funds?De Vassal: First, both funds use a similar process. The difference is the benchmark. For Core, it is the Russell 1000 Index. For Large Cap Growth, it is the Russell Growth. We control industry and sector exposures against those benchmarks.Our strategies are a blend of quantitative discipline based on underlying fundamental insights.IBD: How do you avoid letting emotions interfere with your hunt for growth stocks?De Vassal: We've built a library of factors, over 80, across the two strategies. In any sector, there are about 15 to 25 factors that we use to differentiate stocks. They're a combination of such things as valuation metrics, fundamental metrics and estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. We include some technical indicators as well.IBD: Give me examples of subjective metrics that you avoid.De Vassal: Subjective metrics that we do not use include the popularity of a company — its brand name — and nonquantifiable intangibles such as future products and profits that are not reflected in sell-side analyst earnings or revenue estimates. ... We want to remove behavioral risks that may have adverse effects on portfolio performance.IBD: Limiting downside risk plays a big role in your approach, right?De Vassal: We aim to win by avoiding negative earnings surprises and at the same time tilting more toward stocks that are more likely to have positive surprises.IBD: Basically, the difference between these two funds is that one focuses exclusively on growth stocks while Core Fund can own various types of stocks?De Vassal: In simplest terms, yes. And that means Large Cap Growth has much heavier concentration in technology stocks, for example.IBD: These funds are 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winners. What does it take to outperform so consistently?De Vassal: We have a very disciplined process. And both portfolios are well diversified. Performance isn't driven by being lucky or unlucky in one or two names. And we try to avoid losers, not just identify winners. We try to improve every year. This year we added two new stock selection factors. One is supply-chain data. The other is ESG (environomental, social and governance) momentum. We've been managing for some form of ESG strategy for over 15 years. We've found ESG momentum works better in some sectors, like consumer staples, consumer discretionary and technology, than in others.IBD: Do you see the iPhone as the key to Apple's future? Or do you see additional services like the App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, playing a bigger role?De Vassal: We look at fundamental metrics like return on invested capital. We look at valuation. We look at cash flow per employee. We look at sell-side analysts' earnings estimates, revenue estimates, cash flow estimates. We ask ourselves whether new products and services are causing analysts to increase their estimates. (A sell-side analyst works for an outside firm, not the fund.)We don't have a fundamental analyst kicking the tires on Apple. We look at what's happened in the past. Which (outside) analysts have been the most accurate, looking back nine quarters? Then we look at what they have to say.IBD: Avoiding emotion in your decisions is a key part of your search for growth stocks. What's an example of that?De Vassal: Growth Fund started its stake in Adobe Systems in October. The stock was attractively valued. Later that month they gave (positive) guidance and the stock shot up. We sold in November with a gain over 18%. When a stock moves, we're out because it's no longer attractive.IBD: Mastercard earnings per share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your view going forward?De Vassal: We bought it in June 2016. It's done well. It's a holding. We're comfortable with it. But it's not a position we would add to.IBD: You've got Visa (V) as well. Do you like it better?De Vassal: At this point, Visa looks a little more attractive. Mastercard outperformed over the past 12 months, so its valuation is up. Visa's is better. Visa is still a buy for us.IBD: IPG Photonics (IPGP) is another newcomer to Growth Fund. Do you still like it?De Vassal: We started this in August 2017. The valuation was reasonable. Cash flow yield was around 2.4%. Not that strong. But fundamentals were good. Revisions were fairly positive. Price momentum was fairly good. We think revisions are more likely to have positive surprises than negative surprises.IBD: You more than doubled your share count in TD Ameritrade (AMTD) recently. Why?De Vassal: It was September 2017 when we doubled. Its dividend yield was reasonable, and so were its profitability metrics. Analysts were raising their earnings and revenue estimates. It got good (share) price momentum. We've done well with it.IBD: Brick and mortar retailers aren't very popular these days. But you've got discounter Ross Stores (ROST). Why?De Vassal: We still consider it a buy. We've been underweight in consumer discretionary. But we're getting more neutral. Part of the reason is rebalancing the portfolio in industry groups. Looking at Ross' metrics, it's got a healthy combination of valuation, fundamentals and sell-side earnings revisions.IBD: Citrix Systems (CTXS) is in Core Fund. What's driving the speed up in its quarterly EPS growth?De Vassal: It has good profitability metrics. And we've seen more analysts covering the stock, which could lead to increased investors interest.IBD: What's driving the uptrend in CBRE Group (CBRE), which provides property management, loan servicing and origination services?De Vassal: This is one of the best ranked REITs based on our proprietary stock-ranking screens. In terms of metrics, we look at EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and we look at the consistency of its risk-adjusted growth. Analysts are raising their estimates consistently.IBD: You've trimmed your exposure to Nvidia (NVDA). Does that mean you don't like it as much anymore?De Vassal: We cap a stock's maximum weighting at 2% of Core Fund and 3% of Growth. In contrast, benchmarks are too top heavy. They have too much exposure to the top names.We initially pursued Nvidia in Core in May 2016. The stock had an attractive valuation and improving fundamentals and estimate revisions. Its share price gained a lot, and it bumped our 2% limit so we had to trim it. It has continued up. It's no longer cheap, and it's not a position we would add to.IBD: What has driven the uptrend by F5 Networks (FFIV), which makes data center computing gear?De Vassal: Its valuation isn't cheap, but it's reasonable. Its fundamentals have been strong. Its return on invested capital and cash flow per employee have been favorable vs. its peers. It's got increased coverage from sell-side analysts. So there's a stronger likelihood for positive earnings surprises than some of its peers have.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Growth Stocks In Tech And Health Care: Fund Managers Like Their OutlookSee Which Stock The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingU.S. Treasuries Led Bond Funds Higher As 10-Year Yield Tumbled To 2.8%You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeFour Ways You Can Cut Spending In Retirement — With Little Lifestyle Sacrifice

24,MA,"U.S. stock indexes sagged Monday, showing once again that the market can't find traction despite a strong earnings season. McDonald's (MCD) rose 5.75% on a strong Q1 report but the benefits didn't spread marketwide.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is set to begin a two-day meeting Tuesday.The Dow Jones industrial average reversed to a 0.6% loss, after being up almost 0.8% earlier. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fell 0.8% each, after wiping out earlier gains.Volume in the stock market today fell across the board.A step down in volume was perhaps natural, considering the Fed's meeting later this week.CME Group's FedWatch Tool puts the odds of a rate increase at about 7%. The probability of no change is pegged at almost 93%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe major indexes have been encountering resistance at their 50-day moving averages over the past six to seven sessions. If the stock market is to shake off the negative pressure, retaking the 50-day line is an important first step.Among market watchers, the recent worry is the narrowing of the spread between the 10-year yield vs. the 2-year yield. But the problem with using the yield curve for market guidance is that ""recessions typically haven't begun until 20 months after the curve inverts,"" as IBD Weekly's cover story ""The Big Squeeze"" pointed out.And not every economist agrees that yields should be the top focus right now. Johns Hopkins University economist Steve Hanke argues that the broad money supply as measured by Divisia M4 is a better guide to the economy. So far this year, Divisia M4 grew 4.8% in January, and 5% each in February and March.Hanke calls that kind of growth ""not bad"" and points to an economy where ""everything is running pretty smoothly.""Then why is the stock market struggling? It's much more useful to focus on what's happening than to search for causation. Individual investors should closely follow the charts for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.What are they showing? The choppiness that began in early February is still in place.On Monday. leaders advancing included Mastercard (MA), up 1.3%, and retailer Canada Goose (GOOS), up 1.4%.Mastercard will report Q1 results Wednesday before the market's open.Several items stand ready to break for either good or bad.First, banks are now expected to win at least a partial battle against some Dodd-Frank regulations. The Hill reported that Congress is near passage of a bipartisan package.Second, a decision on steel tariffs is near. Temporary exemptions for the European Union are about to expire. President Trump reportedly hasn't made a decision. Also, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected to leave for China soon for trade talks.Third, IBD's industry group lineup has taken definition. Going into Monday's session, only 10 sectors are outperforming the Nasdaq. New leaders could emerge from the outperforming sectors.The 10 sectors are software, up 13% year to date; consumer, up 8.2%; medical, up 6.9%; leisure, 6.3%; business services, up 6%; retail, up 5.8%; savings and loan, up 5.5%; apparel, up 4.6%; energy, 4.2%; and banks, 4%.Fourth, Trump implied that he can save the market. Speaking in Michigan recently, Trump admitted he is doing something that ""bothers the market."" He said the stock market ""would've been up 60%, but I have to do things. I can't let other countries take advantage of us, so we're doing trade deals.""The implication is that the market will recover once Trump finishes doing things that bother the market.McDonald's rose almost 6%, hoisting the stock over its 50-day and 200-day moving average lines after a strong quarterly report. Earnings increased 22% vs. the year-ago quarter.The Street expected earnings growth of 14%. Q1 revenue dropped 9%, but analysts expected a 12% decline.McDonald's is basing in a 18%-deep consolidation. The stock is 7% under a high marked in late January.The Federal Reserve's meeting Tuesday and Wednesday isn't expected to create big waves. The Street expects the Fed to stand pat on rates for now.

25,MA,"Stock futures flattened, then fell in early premarket trade Wednesday, as markets continued to seek a foothold after Monday's global sell-off.The IBD 50 list and other leading stocks continued to show resilience in premarket action. Stocks including Five Below (FIVE) and Kemet (KEM) were set to open on Wednesday either in buy range or below buy points. Sonic (SONC) and AeroVironment (AVAV) dived late Tuesday after reporting quarterly results after the close. Oil prices closed at five-week highs, and are likely to be active during Wednesday's session.Nasdaq futures slipped 0.5% ahead of Wednesday's open. Dow industrials traded 0.4% below fair value and S&P 500 futures were down 0.3%.Oil prices could factor into Wednesday's market session, after comments from the U.S. State Department, and supply disruptions in Libya and Canada sent U.S. benchmark oil up more than 3% on Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate crude traded up 0.9% early Wednesday, topping $71 per barrel, and at its highest level since May 22. Europe's Brent crude gaoined 0.7%, trading just below $77.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOilPrice.com reported that Libya's oil ports were no longer controlled by the Libyan National Army, but by the unofficial National Oil Corporation, which is affiliated with the country's eastern government based in Benghazi. In addition, a U.S. State Department official told reporters that global oil buyers must cut imports from Iran to zero by November. Buyers who fail to respect the rule will face harsh U.S. sanctions. Iran exports more than 2 billion barrels per day to countries including China, India and Turkey, according to Bloomberg.Oil also received a late boost after the American Petroleum Institute released data showing U.S. oil inventories decreased by more than 9.2 million barrels during the week ended June 22. Economists projected a 2.57 million-barrel decrease. Official weekly crude storage data are due out from the Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. ET Wednesday.Despite the choppy market, plenty of IBD 50 names ended trade on Tuesday well-positioned for acquisitive investors. Among those, kid-friendly dollar store Five Below ended Tuesday's session less than 3% below a 104.09 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.The IBD Leaderboard name scored a 22% breakaway gap on June 7, after crushing first-quarter expectations. Shares consolidated just below their June 13 high, completing a three-weeks-tight pattern on Friday. The June 7 breakout was from a third-stage base. That puts Five Below in late-stage territory, which adds some risk of failure to any further breakout attempts.While the Dow Jones industrial average has lost ground steadily since June 12, Kemet completed the right side of a base and added a handle for good measure. The handle presents a buy point at 25.79, and the stock traded less than 2% below that entry at Tuesday's close. The Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based maker of capacitors used in auto, telecom and aerospace applications has a best-possible EPS Rating of 99 from IBD. And its relative strength line is nearing new highs, a sign of strength before a breakout.Two other watchlist-worthy IBD 50 names are HealthEquity (HQY) and Mastercard (MA).  Both stocks are in industries largely unaffected by concerns over the U.S.-China trade brawl. Both remained extended after breakouts.HealthEquity was 5% above its 50-day moving average. Mastercard was 3% above its line. A touch back and rebound from that level of support would create a buying opportunity in both cases.AeroVironment ground out a 6% loss after fiscal fourth-quarter earnings declined much less than expected and a 1% revenue gain eked past the consensus target. The maker of remote-controlled drones broke out past a 61.25 cup-with-handle buy point in heavy volume during regular trade on Tuesday.Drive-in burger joint Sonic slunk 9% lower.

29,MA,"Payment stocks have been showing their worth lately, with buying opportunities in the finance sector subgroup aplenty. Your stocks to watch this week are five payment-related names that might be worth putting into your portfolio, in addition to your wallet: Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), Green Dot (GDOT), American Express (AXP) and Square (SQ).Mastercard leads payment stocks with a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, while Visa's stock earns a 97 and Green Dot has a 96. Square follows with a 91 and American Express with an 88. Top stocks typically have high Composite Ratings as they launch big runs.These five stocks are among the leaders in the broader finance sector, with the Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processors industry group ranking No. 50 out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks.Mastercard is showing strength after breaking out past a 183.83 flat-base buy point on earnings. Since chasing a stock isn't ideal, it's best to make buys when shares are no more than 5% above a buy point. Mastercard closed Friday slightly extended from a buy range that runs up to 193.02, but the stock pulled back 0.6% to 192.12 on Monday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLike Mastercard, Visa broke out of a base on its latest quarterly earnings report. The 125.54 buy point that the Dow Jones component cleared was from a base-on-base pattern. Visa dipped 0.5% to 131.21 on Monday after closing Friday at the very top of its 5% buy range.Green Dot's 15% post-earnings gain Thursday fueled shares past a 69.47 buy point from a flat base. Shares rose 1% to 72.73 on Monday, near the top of the buy range.Green Dot sells prepaid cards and debit cards. The stock has made quite a comeback in recent years, and only surpassed its all-time high, set in 2011, just a few months ago.American Express is vying for a breakout of its own, with shares coming close to a 103.06 handle entry intraday Friday. AmEx backed away from that level, closing at 101.42. Shares dipped 0.1% on Monday. But the stock has had upward momentum since a recent rebound off the 50-day line. AmEx, like Visa, is a Dow Jones component.Square, one of the big winners from 2017, fell 0.8% Monday to 54.28, still in range from a 52.60 buy point from a double-bottom base. Shares are now 7% below their all-time high of 58.46 on March 21.Meanwhile, PayPal (PYPL) is consolidating since hitting an all-time high in late January. Shares are 8% below that level after retaking the 50-day moving average Thursday.

31,MA,"PayPal (PYPL) is the IBD Stock of the Day as the online payment giant tried to muscle into the buy zone Wednesday. PayPal stock rose 1.7.% to 85.96 on the stock market today. It hit 86.97 intraday, a new all-time high and briefly topping an 86.42 buy point.PayPal's relative strength line, which compares a stock's price performance with the S&P 500, hit an all-time high. That offers bullish confirmation PayPal's breakout attempt.PayPal previously cleared a flattish double-bottom-base entry of 84.09 last month, but the move came in light volume, which is not a great sign.Wednesday's rally also appears to be on below-average trade.Analysts said Wednesday that PayPal is gaining scale against rivals such as Square (SQ) thanks to recent acquisitions. PayPal on Tuesday said it would buy Hyperwallet Systems for $400 million. In May, PayPal agreed to buy iZettle, a European mobile-payment rival to Square and others, for $2.2 billion.A key to PayPal stock's ongoing success is its stellar fundamentals.

Square stock hit a new high Monday, while PayPal, Mastercard and Visa are just below all-time peaks.FleetCor announced last week that it had inked an agreement with Casey's General Stores (CASY) to manage the convenience-store chain's fuel-card program.

33,MA,"PayPal Holdings (PYPL) is the IBD Stock of the Day. The digital payment processor has broken out, joining many of its peers, but may offer a better buying oppounity. Its relative strength line is at new highs, a bullish sign.PayPal stock cleared a double-bottom base with a 84.09 entry point on Monday. But volume was low. Investors could look for a more powerful move above the left side of its base, offering an 86.42 entry.Shares rose 0.6% to 85.05 on the stock market today. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is confirming the stock's breakout.Earnings and sales recently snapped a string of accelerating growth, but remain robust.

34,MA,"Dow Jones futures rallied Wednesday morning along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, as crude oil prices rebounded solidly a day after President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal. Meanwhile, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield moved back above 3%.Despite concerns about the stock market and geopolitical impact, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed virtually unchanged Tuesday after Trump's Iran decision. Most top stocks in buy range continued to act well, with Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) nudging higher.Crude oil prices fell, but pared losses and held near multiyear highs Tuesday.Dow Jones futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.45%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.35% higher.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseU.S. crude futures rose 2.7% to $70.95 a barrel, hitting their best levels since late 2014.The 10-year Treasury yield just topped 3%, hitting 3.006%, after peaking at 3.02% in late April. Meanwhile, the 2-year yield climbed to 2.52%, putting the spread at a still-narrow 48 basis points. That 3% yield, and the narrowing Treasury yield spread with the 2-year rate, pressured stock markets.Tuesday's stock market action held three key investing lessons. 1. Don't be swayed by outside noise and punditry; focus on the action of the major stock market averages and leading stocks. 2. The 50-day moving average looms large for the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite. 3. Pay close attention to the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. The RS line is an easy way to separate true stock market winners from laggards.Investors should stay in tune with important business, political, economic and technology news and trends. That can inform your investing decisions. But your primary focus and investing guide should be the action of the major indexes — the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average — and the action of leading stocks.President Trump's decision on the Iran nuclear deal drew a lot of attention, and deservedly so. But ultimately, the collective wisdom of investors decided for now that Trump's decision to exit that accord was not a market-moving event. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite just inched higher in stock market trading Tuesday, while the S&P 500 index edged lower.Meanwhile, most recent breakouts fared well. Tech giants Apple and Nvidia rose fractionally, outperforming the broader market. Top oil stocks like Marathon Oil (MRO) acted bullishly, paring intraday losses or even gaining despite a modest loss for crude futures.The 50-day is often a key area of support for leading stocks as well as the major indexes. But it can also act as resistance. Since late January, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have struggled to move above the 50-day line, with the few attempts short-lived. Both indexes are just below the 50-day currently, though futures Wednesday suggest they may make another run at that level.The Nasdaq composite reclaimed that level on Friday and is holding just above that line.Investors should always focus on the true stock market leaders. If you're going to take on stock-specific risk, you want to get outperformance. But in conditions like now, when the stock market uptrend is under pressure, besting the S&P 500 simply is a must.Apple, Nvidia, Mastercard and Visa all rose fractionally, moving higher but still within their 5% buy zones. While the price gains were modest, the RS lines all hit long-term or all-time highs. Marathon Oil fell intraday to 19.15 before roaring back for a 3.4% gain at 20.44, extended from an 18.76 buy point.

That outlook was up from a January forecast of $3.66-$3.76 EPS and revenue of $3.8 billion to $3.89 billion. Analysts had forecast EPS of $3.72 and revenue of $3.872 billion.Worldpay fell 3.25% to 81.74 in the stock market today, backing away from an 85.63 buy point from a flat base.

36,MA,"Amazon (AMZN) has a history of choppy profits, but late Thursday the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant delivered yet another quarter of accelerating earnings growth and revenue gains. IBD 50 stocks SVB Financial (SIVB), Twitter (TWTR), Mastercard (MA), SolarEdge Technolgies (SEDG) and Illumina (ILMN) also boast at least two quarters of faster sales and earnings growth.Amazon is not an IBD 50 stock but it already boasts a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. The Composite Rating combines several proprietary IBD ratings into a single score. All-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of their big runs. SVB Financial and SolarEdge Technologies also have 99 Composite Ratings. Twitter and Mastercard have 98 CRs while Illumina boasts a 97 CR.Accelerating earnings growth is an extremely bullish trait. Ultimately earnings drive stock gains. Faster profit gains show that a company has real momentum. The faster sales growth suggests real demand, not just cost-cutting or accounting games.Amazon reported earnings per share of $3.27, more than double analyst forecasts. Year-over-year, EPS rose 121%. That was the third straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth after 40% in Q4 2017, 0% in Q3 and -78% in Q2. Sales growth accelerated for a fifth straight quarter, sprinting 43% to $51.04 billion.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBeing able to ramp up growth rates despite massive size is especially impressive. And Amazon isn't done. Looking to Q2, analysts see a massive 485% EPS gain.Of course, Amazon could have had solid, consistent profit growth years ago, but CEO Jeff Bezos focused on efforts to boost sales and market share. That's paying off. After recently revealing that Prime memberships have topped 100 million worldwide, Amazon said Thursday that it will hike its Prime fee $119 a year.Amazon stock shot up to a record 1,638.10 Friday morning, but faded to 1,572.62. Intraday, Amazon cleared a 1,617.64 cup base buy point but closed below that level. It did settle above an alternate entry from a 1,568.62 flawed cup-with-handle pattern. But investors probably should wait for the stock to move back above Friday's high as a buying opportunity.Keep in mind that Amazon is in a very late-stage base, after several big moves in recent years. Late-stage breakouts are less likely to be big winners and more likely to fail outright.Amazon fell 0.4% to 1,566.13 on the stock market today.The social network early Wednesday reported adjusted earnings of 16 cents a share, up 129% vs. a year earlier. Twitter's earnings growth has accelerated for 5 straight quarters, from -31% to -22% to 0% to 11% to 73% to 129%.Revenue rose 21% vs. a year earlier to $655 million. It was the best sales gain in two years, and the fourth straight quarter of improving year-over-year changes.Twitter shares shot up before Wednesday's open, but the stock quickly fell sharply in the regular session after CEO Jack Dorsey warned that growth would likely slow later in the year.The stock fell 9% last week to 29, well below its 50-day line as it works on a consolidation.Twitter rose 4.5% to 30.31 on Monday on a new content and advertising deal with Walt Disney (DIS).SVB Financial, parent of Silicon Valley Bank, late Thursday reported 90% earnings growth as revenue leapt 34% to $575 million. The $3.63 EPS was 50 cents above estimates while revenue was $39 million over views.SVB Financial's earnings and revenue growth have accelerated for five straight quarters. Silicon Valley Bank's parent also raised full-year guidance, citing faster growth in loan and deposit balances and net interest income.Unlike Amazon or Twitter, SVB Financial did not pare or reverse its initial post-earnings gains. The stock shot up 19% to 305.61 on Friday, gapping beyond a seven-week cup base entry of 271.89, MarketSmith analysis shows.Because SVB Financial opened at 300, more than 5% past the standard entry, that's a breakaway gap. A breakaway gap opening price is an alternative entry point.SVB sank 2% to 299.61 Monday.The credit and debit card giant has reported two straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth and three quarters of faster sales growth, with year-over-year gains 33% and 20%, respectively.Mastercard's streak may be coming to an end. The card giant reports May 2. Analysts expect EPS to jump 25% to $1.26 on revenue up 18% to $3.25 billion, which would be strong but decelerating growth.Shares of Mastercard are trading within a flat base with a 183.83 buy point. The stock closed Friday 175.94.Mastercard rose 1.3% to 178.14, back above its 50-day line.Mastercard rival Visa (V,) also an IBD 50 stock, reported better-than-expected earnings last week, with EPS and revenue growth accelerating from the prior quarter.Visa cleared a 125.54 flat-base buy point on Thursday, closing Friday at 126.01. Visa rose 0.7% to 126.91 on Monday.For Visa and Mastercard, recent trading history suggests that pullbacks to the 50-day or 200-day lines are better entries than traditional buy points from breakouts.Illumina has enjoyed four straight quarters of improving year-over-year earnings growth, trending from -11% to a 127% gain reported last week. Revenue growth has sped up for four quarters as well, from 5% to 31%.Shares initially fell on Illumina's earnings, but rallied to close the week at 244.47, above their 50-day line.

44,MA,"Since certain sectors tend to outperform others during different stages of a business cycle, it's important to keep track of how the economy is faring.From low unemployment to higher interest rates, the U.S. economy has been displaying signs that are typical of a late-stage business cycle. Yet a few factors point to a ""slightly"" different cycle this time around, says Henry Ma, president and chief investment officer at Julex Capital Management.The Boston-based investment firm, which managed $863 million in client assets as of March 31, uses exchange traded funds to help build portfolios. Its tactical, unconstrained investment solutions aim to limit downside risk while maximizing upside potential — a strategy Julex refers to as adaptive investing.Here, in his own words, Ma explains how the current economic cycle may be different and offers three of his best ETF picks for the months ahead:Asset performance is often driven by cyclical factors tied to the state of the economy, such as corporate earnings, economic growth, interest rates and inflation. The business cycle can be an important determinant of equity market returns and the performance of sectors, styles and factors.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMost economists agree we are in the late stage of an economic expansion. The economic indicators show the typical signs of a late cycle: low employment rate, rising wages (and) higher inflation and interest rates. In the meantime, corporate earnings growth accelerates and stock market valuations become more and more expensive. Although most business cycles follow a similar pattern, this time may be ""slightly"" different.The biggest difference was the massive fiscal stimulus and other unconventional policies rolled out by the Trump administration. The largest tax cut bill since the Reagan era was introduced, and deregulation measures also lightened the burdens on businesses. Trade policies were rolled out that were intended to reduce deficits and promote domestic business. There will likely be winners and losers under such protectionism trade measures, but small/midsize business may benefit more because they are less dependent on international markets. It is possible the current economic growth can extend beyond the normal length of the expansion cycle, and in response the stock market may keep reaching new highs.Against the backdrop of positive economic momentum, corporate earnings have been strong over the past year. Among the companies in the S&P 500 index, 78% have beaten earnings estimates and 77% have beaten sales estimates in Q1. The percentage of EPS surprises marks the highest number since Q3 2008, according to FactSet. The blended earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 is 24.6%, the highest rate since Q3 2010.From a sector perspective, we want to be positioned for three general themes in the current late cycle: continued economic and earnings growth, a modest reflation trade that may arise from higher inflation and interest rates, expansionary fiscal policy, and protectionist trade policies. Specifically, we will be carefully watching three ETFs that may benefit from those general themes.IShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM): This ETF tracks the performance of large- and midcap U.S. stocks exhibiting strong six- and 12-month price appreciation and low three-year volatility. Research has shown momentum strategies outperform the markets in the long run, especially in the late cycle when market trends are well-established. We believe the current economic expansion could last longer than normal; therefore, momentum strategies should continue benefiting from strong price trends aided by solid economic growth and corporate earnings. Right now, the stocks in MTUM are mainly from the cyclical sectors like technology, financials, industrials and consumer discretionary, which normally outperform during economic expansion as investors favor growth companies.SPDR Energy Select Sector (XLE): This ETF tracks a market-cap-weighted index of large U.S. energy companies. Energy is a typical late-cycle sector play and a reflection trade. As the economy is running close to full capacity late in the cycle, demand for energy and other materials could rise and inflation pressure can mount. Oil prices have been recovering slowly in the last two years, recently reaching $70 a barrel. As a result, energy companies have had the most impressive earnings growth among all the sectors. According to FactSet, energy sector earnings grew by 96.5% in Q1 2018 compared with Q1 2017. Supportive oil prices and strong earnings are likely to help the energy sector maintain its outperformance for the rest of 2018. Furthermore, the energy sector offers a hedge against inflation, as well as potentially rising geopolitical risk, which could lead to a spike in oil prices.IShares Russell 2000 (IWM): This ETF tracks the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index. Small-cap companies are not typical late-cycle plays, but recent economic policies have made them more attractive. Lower corporate tax rates will help reduce the tax burden more for small-cap companies because it is hard for small firms to take advantage of certain tax shelters that large multinationals have enjoyed. And, with the implementation of tariffs and other protectionism trade policies, small caps, which typically only serve the domestic market, could experience increased demand for their goods and services. Additionally, current valuation of the small-cap firms on a price/book and price/sales basis are more attractive than large-cap companies.Disclaimer: These ETFs are currently owned or were recently owned by Julex Capital strategies and could be purchased at any time within their client portfolios.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:China, Solar Among Hot Stock Picks As S&P 500 Targets 3000From AI To Social Media And Beyond, This ETF Pioneer DeliversWhich Technology And Oil Stock Plays Are Performing The Best?

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe stock market came under pressure amid Trump trade war tariffs and threats over the past several weeks. President Donald Trump on Friday imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, quickly matched by Beijing. Trump also threatened tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports. But for now, Wall Street has decided the Trump trade impact has been priced into stocks.If you look at the Nasdaq composite over the last several months, the tech-heavy index looks like it broke out on June 1, rallied for a few weeks, then erased those gains before rebounding again last week from its 50-day moving average.The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have been consolidating since late January, with the S&P 500 in somewhat better shape.Stocks, even top stocks, tend to track the broader stock market.

Two more are in the top 20.Buying and holding individual software stocks has been a challenge. Salesforce, the top stock in the No. 3-ranked enterprise software group, staged a low-volume breakout in early May, then promptly undercut the buy point. It didn't trigger a 7%-8% loss that would trigger an automatic sell. By the end of May, following quarterly earnings, Salesforce stock was back in buy range and is now modestly extended.Meanwhile, some stocks did trigger the 7%-8% loss sell rule, like Workday (WDAY) and Red Hat (RHT), while others round-tripped double-digit gains, such as Qualys (QLYS).Software Stocks To Watch: Okta (OKTA), an April 2017 cybersecurity IPO, is finding support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since a late April breakout. A solid gain in heavy volume could offer a buying opportunity. Alternatively, Okta could continue to consolidate for a few weeks, forming a new base and buy point.Collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) broke out last October.

(Refiners tend to benefit from a wider ""crack spread"" between crude and gasoline prices.)EOG Resources (EOG), a recent IBD Stock of the Day, broke out in early May and ran up for a couple of weeks as crude futures rallied. But the EOG stock pulled back below the buy point and found support at the 50-day line in June as crude also backed off multiyear highs. EOG Resources, known as the ""Apple of Oil,"" is setting up in a new base with crude hitting its best levels since 2014.Marathon Oil, another IBD Stock of the Day, also broke out in early May and ran up. Marathon Oil stock also pulled back to its 50-day line, but never undercut the buy point. Shares are now in a flat base within a base-on-base formation.Biogen shot up nearly 20% to 357.48 on Friday, racing toward a 370.67 cup-base entry. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) also is closing in on a buy point. But both Biogen and Vertex Pharma have relative strength lines, while improving, that were in downtrends for several months. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 indexNotable biotech ETFs, including iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) and the triple-levered Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull (LABU) also are approaching possible buy points, but with RS lines that have made much headway over the past year.Payment stocks have been a pocket of strength.

But several Dow Jones stocks have been solid performers. Nike (NKE) has sprinted to the top of the class of 2018, with Visa (V), Microsoft (MSFT), Boeing (BA) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) also in the top five.Their performance is in stark contrast to the five biggest Dow Jones losers in 2018..The sneaker powerhouse stock has soared 27.4% since the start of the year. That includes 11 % surge in Friday's stock market trading to a record high.The sportswear behemoth vaulted over Visa to become the top-performing Dow stock after Nike released stellar earnings late Thursday.

Visa stock found support at its 50-day moving average this past week, MarketSmith analysis shows.In what could be a key development in the online shopping era, Visa could abandon its faster-online-checkout option. Instead it would adopt a single shared-payment button for online payments with Mastercard (MA).Visa also has an alliance with PayPal. Users can now even draw on their Visa to pay for something via their phone in physical retail locations. This has given PayPal (PYPL) a foothold in this space, while increasing business for the credit card company.Microsoft has been the third-best performer in the Dow Jones. Indeed its annual price increase of 15.3% for the year has easily outstripped that of its more glamorous long-term rival Apple (AAPL), up 9.4%. In its most recent quarter the Redmond giant scored a double beat, with EPS up 36% to 95 cents and sales jumping 16% to $26.8 billion.In a somewhat similar pattern to Visa, Microsoft stock hasn't rallied much since clearing a six-week flat base in May. The stock remains in buy zone from its 97.34 buy point, closing at 98.61 on Friday.The Dow Jones stock got a boost back in March when Chief Executive Satya Nadella made sweeping changes by establishing two main divisions, continuing his transformation.

The airliner would be capable of flying passengers across the Atlantic in just two hours, even faster than the legendary Concorde.Cisco Systems closes out the top five, with a year-to-date gain of 12.35%. Cisco just edged earnings estimates in its most recent quarter. EPS climbed 10% to 66 cents while revenue rose 4% to $12.5 billion.

73,MA,"Energy stocks showed a united advance Monday and a few dozen names struck 52-week highs. The move came on the back of an early jump by West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices to back above $70 a barrel. WTI reversed lower by day's end, down slightly at $69.67. The new highs list Monday also showed a solid group of highly rated companies in the software, internet, medical, retail and leisure sectors.Retail and consumer spending-type names such as Etsy (ETSY), a member of IBD Leaderboard since Feb. 28, are out of buy range. Yet more than a handful of leading companies are still not yet extended more than 5% past the proper buy point.They include Apple (AAPL), Illumina (ILMN), and Mastercard (MA). Etsy, which rallied about 3% Monday, has now gained as much as 44% since clearing an eight-week cup base with a 21.96 entry point Feb. 21.Apple is staging a sixth gain in a row as the stock added 0.7% and hit a new all-time high of 187.67. At that price, the iPhone and iPad marketer rose 4.8% past a 179.04 buy point in a seven-week double-bottom base.It's smart portfolio management to buy shares in any stock no more than 5% above the correct entry. This strategy helps prevent you from selling a stock too early as it makes a normal pullback to or just underneath the breakout price.Apple, which entered Leaderboard on Friday following its new breakout, has formed a series of bases on top of bases since May 2017.

Shares in the genetics research equipment expert hit as high as 259.27. The buy zone in Illumina goes up to 269.58, 5% above the 256.74 entry.Illumina showed a rocky reaction after issuing first-quarter results April 24. Earnings leapt 127% to $1.45 a share as revenue rose 31% to $782 million. The big EPS jump was no doubt helped by an easy comparison as earnings sank 11% in the year-ago quarter. However, the results reaffirm a bullish trend. In the first two quarters of 2017, Illumina posted two straight quarters of falling profits. But profit then rose 14% and 69% in the third and fourth quarters of the year, respectively.The average EPS increase in the past three quarters: a healthy 70%.The Street sees second-quarter earnings going up 35% to $1.11 a share.Illumina is part of the research equipment and services industry group within IBD's medical sector.

76,MA,"Look out, index huggers! The stock market is shifting in a direction that favors active managers and stock pickers, says T. Rowe Price fund manager Ann Holcomb. That should boost prospects for the stock mutual funds she helps run, whose portfolio holdings include leading stocks like Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Red Hat (RHT) and Mastercard (MA). Two of her funds have already done well in a variety of past markets, having outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets pulled off that four-for-four feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner.The market is rotating to the benefit of active managers and stock pickers because of heightened volatility, says Holcomb, one of three managers of $635 million T. Rowe Price Capital Opportunity (PRCOX) and its institutional clone, $654 million Institutional U.S. Structured Research (TRISX).Holcomb's funds bear an additional distinction. While Holcomb and her co-managers Jason Polun and Tom Watson oversee the portfolios and keep their eyes on the big picture, T. Rowe Price lets a team of some 30 analysts make buy and sell decisions for the fund. Each analyst runs his or her own sleeve, or segment, of the portfolio. It's like a professional sports team. Coaches oversee the team, but it's the players who score and play defense. Delegating that much responsibility to analysts is rare in the stock mutual fund world.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHolcomb, who is 46 years old, discussed the funds' investment approach with IBD from her office in Baltimore, Md.IBD: How does the market environment impact Capital Opportunity?Holcomb: We've had years of low volatility, high correlations (among stock performances) and compressed dispersion. That's challenging for stock pickers. There's no extra reward for good stock picking if all stocks move together.But now, volatility is increasing and correlations are going down. That should continue as interest rates rise. That helps active managers in addition to stock pickers. They're the ones who can take advantage of mispricing vs. underlying stock values that our analysts discover.IBD: Why do rising rates cause that dispersion?Holcomb: They're not necessarily the cause, but they help. Companies that have been supported by free or low-cost money now get (somewhat) taken out of the market. High quality companies take market share.IBD: Your two funds are the only T. Rowe Price portfolios that let analysts make buy-sell decisions. Why use that approach? Is it because 30 minds are better than three?Holcomb: It was the idea of our current CEO, Bill Stromberg, when he became director of research in the late 1990s. Our analysts are experts. Bill wanted to showcase their stock picking by having them manage a portfolio within a risk-controlled framework. We limit how much their industry and sector weights deviate from the S&P 500.IBD: What's left for you portfolio managers to do?Holcomb: We have what we call an oversight committee. It consists of the named PMs and portfolio specialist Jennifer Martin. We decide which analysts join the team. We also look at how much of the S&P each analyst covers.We monitor the overall profile of the portfolio daily. This comes in the form of risk monitoring, looking at components of active risk, any tilts that develop in terms of looking more growthy or valuey. We're also analyzing the analysts' performance.We're also ensuring that there is consistency between their positioning in this portfolio and what they advocate (for other funds). We engage with our large, institutional clients as well.Also, we manage a monthly rebalancing process in which any positions that are outside our risk limits are brought back in line.IBD: Intuitive Surgical has been volatile since November. But it's in a long uptrend. What's driving that?Holcomb: Its fundamentals continue to improve. Analysts have raised their estimates. When companies deliver like that, sometimes it takes time for the market to catch up.We've had a big position for some time. Our analyst Jon Wood has a very favorable view. It's a bet on computer assisted robotic surgery, a bet that it becomes more mainstream. It's been adopted in urology and gynecology. Our analyst sees it being used more in general surgery.IBD'S TAKE: Learn why Intuitive Surgical hit a record high after reporting first-quarter results.IBD: The fund has trimmed its exposure to Red Hat. Do you still like it?Holcomb: Red Hat is the prime beneficiary of the increased use of open source software, driven by cloud computing. They have leadership in Linux. So Red Hat has a strong core, which is successfully expanding into cloud software.Analysts change their positioning for many reasons.... (In trimming the position in) Red Hat, which remains overweight in the fund relative to its weight in the S&P 500, analyst Ken Allen used it as a source of funds to reduce his underweight in Oracle (ORCL) (due to) the analyst's view that its prospects are improving.IBD: You hold Mastercard as well as Visa (V). Do you like one more than the other?Holcomb: They are largely doing the same thing. Looking at Mastercard, our analyst Jon Friar sees it as a sustainable mid- to high-teens earnings per share grower. Both companies benefit from the movement of payments from cash and checks to electronic. They have high incremental margins, pricing power and strong free cash flow conversion.With regard to Mastercard, they have a willingness to invest in next generation products, such as their acquisition (last year) of (U.K.-based payments technology company) Vocalink.Mastercard has a very attractive business model, with high barriers to entry.IBD: Why has the fund trimmed its stake in PayPal (PYPL)?Holcomb: Our analysts prioritize within their own sleeves. Our PayPal thesis has been that it can materially outperform due to monetizing their Venmo asset, or using their balance sheet to buy back shares or for some accretive M&A or if they have some core business surprises.Our trim in PayPal was because its valuation was not as attractive as some other names. We used it as a source of funds for those more attractive names. But, long-term, we see some PayPal characteristics that can still be in play, so it's still in the portfolio.IBD: Earnings per share growth in SVB Financial (SIVB) has accelerated for five quarters in a row. What's your thesis for this stock?Holcomb: Generally, SVB does well heading into a Federal Reserve (money) tightening cycle like the one we're in, and the market has not fully valued its deposits strength. We're looking at the potential for it paying a dividend. Usually, paying a dividend opens your investor base. So we started a position in March.IBD: Which do you prefer with S&P Global — its index business or its ratings business?Holcomb: It does have a lot of businesses. It is a compounder. It should grow earnings per share at a double-digit pace. It should improve its margins through cost cutting and price increases.Its ratings business has a market-leading share. And it is returning capital to shareholders.Also, its tax rate fell with implementation of tax reform.After the financial crisis, regulation of its space increased, but that just made it more difficult for competitors to get into their business, deepening the moat around their business.Like PayPal, Red Hat and Mastercard, S&P Global is a leader that is pulling further ahead of rivals.They're also shifting to a recurring revenue model, which makes their financials less lumpy and can lift their valuation. About 75% of their revenue is recurring vs. less than 60% five years ago.IBD: What's your thesis for Salesforce.com (CRM)?Holcomb: It pioneered SaaS (software as a service) applications. It remains by far the biggest company in that market. It benefits from a large ecosystem of software, hardware and IT services partners to make its products more valuable and make its market position even larger. And they're another company with a recurring revenues model.IBD: How does Diamondback Energy (FANG) fit into a growth portfolio?Holcomb: Well, we're a core portfolio with exposure to all S&P 500 sectors, including energy. Diamondback is one of the leading operations in the Permian Basin, where they've got a lot of low-cost acreage and can grow production faster with better results than a lot of competitors.They have low financial leverage, and their execution over the last several quarters has been excellent.IBD: Give me an example please of a play that is not part of the S&P 500.Holcomb: Worldpay (WP) is one. They're a combination of merchant acquirer and payments processor. This was Vantiv (until its takeover of Worldpay early this year). It has the best collection of assets among public merchant acquirers, and should grow earnings per share at a mid-double-digit pace for an extended time.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE THESE:Want To Be A Millionaire?

84,MA,"When PayPal (PYPL) split from online auction site eBay (EBAY) in 2015, Wall Street wondered whether the digital-payments provider would truly find its place in the world of ushering money between people online.XCould it stand up to Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), they wondered. Would it be able to justify its existence alongside Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google? Could it compete with basically any of the large banks, who had plenty of reasons to offer payment services themselves?Rather than go to war, PayPal has reached truces, of sorts, with those and other companies since the spin-off from eBay. The strategy has sent its stock on a marathon run higher. It's also extended the company's reach online, into the muscle memory of smartphone users, and into any moment where someone might think to pay for something. It has also given PayPal a foothold in actual, physical stores, which still make up the vast majority of retail.Today, PayPal users can draw on a Mastercard or Visa card or their bank account to pay for something via their phone in such retail locations. In May, PayPal said users would be able to pay for stuff on Gmail, YouTube and other locations in the Google ecosphere. PayPal last year struck a deal with Facebook that allowed someone to send money via Facebook Messenger.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""That's really helped them become much more of a partner, obviously, than a competitor with a lot of these companies,"" Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said. ""I think that's helped ease Wall Street's concerns about whether a big tech company would just leapfrog them or make their technology obsolete.""The company also counts Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) as partners, and is trying to attract more people without bank accounts. In moves abroad, the company last year struck a deal with Chinese search giant Baidu (BIDU) to let Baidu Wallet holders buy things from PayPal merchants.In May, it announced the $2.2 billion purchase of iZettle, a Stockholm-based company sometimes called the Square (SQ) of Europe. The deal is likely to put PayPal's technology into retail outlets across that continent as well as Latin America.How sustainable these partnerships are over the long term remains an open question. Competition from Square, best known for the card readers often used by small businesses, is nothing to sneeze at. PayPal's margins have been under pressure as it chases bigger customers, Olson says. EBay's decision this year to eventually handle more payments on its own — rather than PayPal — is a big deal.But for now, analysts suggest that more freedom from eBay has allowed PayPal to come into its own. The collaboration-over-competition approach, along with the growing ease and popularity of online payments, has sent its stock up 126% since the company's 2015 spinoff. Over the past year alone, the stock is up nearly 60% and maintains an IBD Composite Rating of 96. Shares were down fractionally to 85.31 Friday.Even as competition escalates, the company in May said it was targeting around a 20% compound annual earnings per share growth rate over the next three to five years. Over that time, it also forecasts expanding adjusted operating margins and 17%-18% compound annual sales growth, when factoring foreign exchange fluctuations.In years past, the firm tried to encourage customers to link their PayPal accounts with their bank accounts. The practice helped the company avoid paying fees to the credit card networks, making those companies dyspeptic. Visa's chief executive in 2016 warned that the card network could try to compete with the payments company ""in ways that people have never seen before.""PayPal eventually backed off, agreeing later that year to partner with Visa. The agreement expanded the ""acceptance for PayPal's digital wallet to all physical retail locations where Visa contactless transactions are enabled,"" according to a statement announcing the deal.The deal also allowed customers to instantly move money from their PayPal and Venmo accounts to their bank account via a Visa debit card, that statement said. Shortly after, PayPal and Mastercard announced a similar pact that expanded an existing partnership.""It just made it a lot easier for individual consumers to sign up for PayPal,"" William Blair analyst Bob Napoli said of its increased flexibility.The company's active customer accounts grew 15% last year. In the first quarter, reported in April, it added 8.1 million active accounts, with payment transactions up 25%. The company has 218 million active users in more than 200 markets. It processes around one in every six dollars spent online, according to Edward Jones.""Embracing the traditional payment ecosystem was a positive in many investors' eyes,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said.What's more, analysts say, the company's technology is good, and it works on lots of things with which you can make payments. Its One Touch technology allows customers to buy things online without entering their password and other information. The company rolled out its own cash-back credit card last summer. The company was testing a Venmo debit card, Recode reported earlier last year.As PayPal makes it easier to pay for things, businesses have taken notice. The company has some 19 million merchant accounts, most of them small to midsize businesses.""I think, (they) have signed up, and continue to sign up, more merchants post-spinoff from eBay that maybe wouldn't have been able to sign when they were part of eBay,"" Napoli said.Still, a big chunk of PayPal's financials hinge on eBay's auction activity. EBay acquired the company in 2002 to make it easier for eBay's buyers and sellers to pay or get paid online. Last year, PayPal drew around a fifth of its revenue from customers on eBay's Marketplaces platform.But in January, the online auction platform said it would begin managing payments on its own. It said that process will be a ""—multiyear journey."" EBay also said it would use Adyen, a Netherlands-based company, as its payments processor. PayPal's stock crashed on eBay's announcement. PayPal will remain a payment option on eBay until mid-2023.The payments company seems likely to compensate by reeling in bigger retailers elsewhere. But Olson notes that its pursuit of larger customers has weighed on margins. Those companies have more bargaining power to negotiate lower fees, he says.Analysts also debate whether it has the upper hand on Square, the payments company best known for its credit-card readers used by small businesses. Square also is stepping up efforts to compete with PayPal via acquisitions.On one hand, PayPal has a massive network of millions of users. The purchase of iZettle would unite PayPal's immense digital platform with iZettle's card readers and software tools for small businesses. But small businesses comprise the turf upon which Square has built much of its reputation.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) still has Apple Pay, although PayPal last year landed a deal to allow iTunes users to buy things with PayPal. The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon (AMZN) was looking into developing something similar to a branded checking account. As long as tech and financial companies work in the payments business, friction could wear at PayPal's partnerships.""Long-term, it's harder to say,"" Sebastian said of how those partnerships will hold up. ""PayPal still has many elements of duplicating what a credit card offers.""So there's always the prospect, if PayPal were to potentially turn (to) a competitive angle vs. a partnership angle,"" he said. ""But I certainly don't foresee that in the near term or the medium term.""RELATED LINKS:Square, PayPal Lead These 5 Financial Stocks In Or Near Buy ZonesBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStock Spotlight List Adds 8 For Your Best Stocks To Buy And WatchSquare Rival Testing Buy Zone After Biggest Acquisition Since eBay Spinoff

89,MA,"The best growth stock mutual funds rewarded investors with returns between 26% and 46% in 2017, handsomely beating the S&P 500's advance of 21.83%. This strong performance partly explains why 113 funds landed an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2018 Award in the growth category vs. just nine the prior year.By comparison, no value stock funds made the winners' list this year, and the number of award-winning blend funds that have both growth and value components got cut in half to just 11.One year's outperformance is not all that's needed to win a Best Mutual Funds Award. Mutual funds need at least $100 million in assets and must beat their benchmark for the past one, three, five and 10 years ended December 2017, showing they can do well as stock market trends and conditions evolve over the long haul.So, what exactly contributed to these results and what's in store for the rest of 2018?Among the top five award winning growth funds, Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth (POAGX) tops the list with one- and 10-year average returns of 33.59% and 15.06%, respectively. The S&P 500 returned an average annual 8.5% in the past 10 years. The $11 billion fund invests in stocks across all sectors and market caps, targeting companies with prospects of rapid earnings growth that may not be reflected in their stock prices.At the end of 2017, the fund held 22% in small and micro caps — a significant overweight vs. the index's 1%. It also had major overweights in health care and technology — both sectors that were strong performers. Managers are not afraid to make strong sector or stock bets if they see solid long-term potential.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX) came in second, with returns of 31.49% for one year and an average annual 13.16% for 10 years. Midcaps and small caps comprise 69% and 25% of the $23 billion fund. Manager Henry Ellenbogen seeks out small companies that can become much larger. This usually includes disrupters and companies that promise durable growth.""Market leadership is likely to narrow as the bull market ages. As always, unforeseen risks, such as geopolitical turmoil, also pose challenges,"" Ellenbogen said in an email. ""Global macroeconomic events, including commodity price volatility, could affect performance."" He also pointed out that a regulatory attack on leading technology and internet companies is possible, which could have unintended consequences and heighten inflationary concerns.""As such, we will closely monitor global economic and political conditions and be cautious around new bouts of risk taking,"" Ellenbogen added. ""Nevertheless, we remain confident in our ability to find and hold smaller companies that can compound wealth by becoming durable and sustainable businesses, even through the downturns and valuation adjustments that are part of every market cycle.""American Century Select (TWCIX) surged 28.93% last year and an average annual 8.62% for the past 10 years. Veteran manager Keith Lee and his team run the $3 billion large-cap growth fund by selecting high-quality companies with strong growth prospects, while also limiting risk. As a result, the fund sports a turnover of just 19%.""We're looking for very long-term, durable franchises that have sustainable growth over long periods of time, and that allows us to really limit the amount of turnover we have,"" said co-portfolio manager Chris Krantz. Traits of such companies include strong management teams, strong competitive positions, good returns on capital and the ability to achieve a higher return on capital over time, he added.In addition, the fund is valuation-sensitive, so it looks to buy stocks that are reasonably priced. Top 10 holdings represent 43% of the fund and comprise leading stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Mastercard (MA), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).Last year, the fund benefited from consumer staples companies that have ""stronger-growing franchises that weren't as impacted by consumer preferences,"" said Krantz.Beauty product maker Estee Lauder (EL) was a strong contributor with a 68% jump in share price. ""They have wonderful brands, a great management team and the ability to continue to grow. A lot of consumer staples companies are struggling to sustainably grow,"" Krantz said.Costco (COST), which rose 22% in 2017, ""is another company that while there are some concerns out there about online competition to Costco, Costco is a value proposition to the consumer, because the prices they offer is a competitive advantage that we think will be enduring. They provide value to the consumer that you just can't find anywhere else,"" explained Krantz.With consumers spending more money online, global electronic payment firms such as Mastercard and PayPal (PYPL) have a ""great business model that has high margins, high returns on capital and as consumers change their shopping preferences, whether by channel or by category, they're still spending with the same means. That's a secular growth area,"" he said.Blend funds are part of the mutual fund style box and combine growth and value investing. This year's cream-of-the-crop blend funds include Carillon Scout Mid Cap I (UMBMX), sporting a one-year return of 24.02% and a 10-year average annual return of 11.13%, and Primecap Odyssey Stock (POSKX) with 25.96% and 10.3%, respectively.T. Rowe Price's Institutional U.S. Structured Research (TRISX) and Capital Opportunity (PRCOX) rose 24% last year and an average annual 9% the past 10 years.Manager Ann Holcomb says that both funds follow the exact same strategy through a team-managed style where each research analyst is responsible for making the buy and sell decision within their own area of expertise. About 30 analysts are responsible for their own slice of the portfolio, overseen by three managers who oversee the big picture and make sure the portfolio is constrained in terms of the level of active risk.Top holdings include Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Last year, about two-thirds of the fund's outperformance came from stock selection, plus one-third from being underweight energy and telecom and overweight information technology.For 2018, Holcomb has ""cautious optimism for the rest of the year. Valuations are still pretty full, but fundamental underpinnings for earnings growth are still there. We have tax reform — it hasn't really made its way into earnings yet. We should still be the beneficiaries of further regulatory relief. Rates are still low, though rising. The consumer is healthy.

96,MA,"A new threat by President Trump to apply 10% tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese imported goods put the U.S. stock market on a slicker path to a potential market correction on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average and the NYSE composite battled to stay above their key 50-day moving averages.Volume rose on both main exchanges vs. Monday, according to early data readings. That implied unusually heavy institutional selling.The Dow industrial average and the NYSE composite slid 1.1% and 0.6% in stocks today, respectively, but both rebounded off their session lows. The Dow industrial average, finishing at 24,700, is now down about 0.1% since Jan. 1.Those losses, however, were not as frightening as the sell-offs among China mainland indexes. Hong Kong's Hang Seng benchmark dropped 2.8% overnight  and cut its long-term 200-day moving average for the first time since December 2016. The Shanghai composite skidded 3.8% lower, hitting lows not seen since June 2016.Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) and other high-octane growth stocks that are leading the digital transformation of the global economy continued to flex strength.Netflix, the eighth largest company on the Nasdaq exchange by market cap, jumped 3.7% to a new high of 404.98 in brisk volume, 84% above its 50-day average. The big move helped the Nasdaq composite cut its early 1.4% drubbing to less than a 0.3% decline by day's end.Netflix joined IBD Leaderboard on Dec. 6, 2016, as the stock was forming a base next to a much larger set of bases. Then the stock broke out past a correct entry point at 129.39 in early January 2017. The stock has since advanced 208% and is currently extended from a proper buy point.At 7725, the Nasdaq holds a 12% year-to-date gain. The Nasdaq 100 also hustled off its intraday low, slipping just 0.3%. Both the Nasdaq composite and the Nasdaq 100 are trading less than 1% below their all-time highs.The S&P 500 chopped its early decline to 0.4% as strength in defensive stocks, including utilities, offset weakness in automaker, steel, construction and farming machinery, chemical and coal stocks. Biotech, movie, drug store chain and auto parts firms also rallied.The small-cap S&P 600 outperformed, losing just 0.1%. At 1044, the index is up 11.5% since Jan. 1.Also within IBD Leaderboard, at least three top-shelf retailers seem to be feeling less of an impact on the escalating tit for tat between the world's two largest economies.Discount and variety store chain Five Below (FIVE), premium yogawear retailer Lululemon (LULU) and online marketplace Etsy (ETSY) are all holding up well since their excellent breakouts in recent months.All three Leaderboard names show strong double-digit earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Etsy soared 28% last week on news that it's adding new services for sellers while also raising transaction fees.Etsy grew its top line by 19%, 21%, 24% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The Street expects Q2 revenue to jump 25% to $127.1 million and earnings to rise 150% to a nickel a share. The Brooklyn-based company has 119 million shares outstanding and a float of 116 million.The stock has rallied 103% since bolting out of an eight-week cup without handle at 21.96 on Feb. 21.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen searching for excellent stocks, be sure to check that a company meets the C in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point investing paradigm. C stands for current earnings growth of 25% or more in the latest quarter. An acceleration in the rate of year-over-year growth? Even better. Institutional investors highly prize companies that are able to post bigger profit gains vs. recent quarters.Lululemon, a member of the IBD 50, still sees the majority of its revenue coming from North America. The Vancouver-based firm has posted EPS increases of 3%, 19%, 33% and 72% in the past four quarters. In other words, it's shown growth acceleration in the bottom line for three periods in a row.The Street sees earnings rising 26% to 49 cents a share in the July-ending fiscal second quarter.Financial payment, credit history and transactions-related firms are also holding up well. TransUnion (TRU), Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) are keeping their solid long-term uptrends intact. The former, also in IBD Leaderboard, reversed from mild losses to gain 0.6%.Square (SQ), the innovator in point of sale technology and financial services for small and medium businesses, doesn't seem to be perturbed by Trump's aggressive tariff policy. The San Francisco-based company dropped 4% in the early going before shaving the loss to less than 0.4%.At 65.94, the stock is holding on to a 15% gain past a 57.29 entry in a nine-week cup with handle.That base also shows elements of a double bottom, one of the eight key chart patterns that growth investors can use to time their market buys during a confirmed uptrend in the stock market.Wall Street forecasts Square increasing its earnings by 70% to 46 cents a share in 2018, then doing it again to 78 cents in 2019.No doubt, commodities are being targeted by Chinese government officials with less than six months to go before critical midyear U.S. elections take place in November.Nucor (NUE), the largest U.S. steelmaker by market value, dropped as much as 4% and flirted with its rising 50-day moving average before rebounding some to end at 65.47.The Charlotte, N.C., firm has been locked in a trading range of 59 to 70 since January. Yet the stock is also building a new base and stands just 7% below the 70.48 peak.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings vaulting 86% to $6.67 a share this year, then easing 7% to $6.18 in 2019. Sales growth has been powerful lately, rising 14%, 30%, 22%, 21%, 29% and 16% in the past six quarters.Tesla (TSLA) led the automakers down more than 4% as a group on a price-weighted basis. Autos finished worst among all 197 industry groups tracked by IBD each day.But Tesla, the electric vehicle pioneer, actually needed to catch its breath following strong gains the past three weeks.Shares closed down nearly 5% to 352.55 in heavy turnover. Watch to see if the 350 round number level offers a floor of support. Tesla also now has a nice air cushion above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages.For now, Tesla continues to work on a huge base that stretches all the way back to September 2017. In the week ended Sept. 15 that year, the stock broke out of an 11-week cup with handle at 370.10, but reversed sharply lower the next week. The negative action triggered the golden rule of investing — keep your losses small in every investment, preferably at 8% or less.In other financial markets, crude oil rallied amid some hopes that OPEC and Russia will agree to either no change in their production quotas or raise output only by a little. Investors will be watching the results of a Friday meeting closely.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell 3 basis points to 2.89%. Yields fall when bond prices rise.

SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) reversed to a 0.7% gain after finding support near its 200-day moving average, despite weaker-than-expected housing starts and building permits in February. The ETF may be forming the bottom of a base.American Express and Walmart led the upside on the Dow with respective gains of 1.3% and 1.9%. GE, down 0.4%, was the biggest decliner.

The ETF also is forming a base with an 88.73 buy point.Keep in mind that as volatility in the broader market picked up in February, the ETF fell to its 200-day line before making its way back up to the 50-day. Such volatile periods underscore the importance of holding quality stocks with a track record of steady earnings growth.The $4.6 billion fund, which tracks the MSCI USA Sector Neutral Quality Index, provides exposure to large and midcap U.S. equities with the best profitability.

100,MA,"Several years ago China e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) set out on a path to change the face of retailing. Billions of dollars and several acquisitions later, you could say it's well on its way to accomplishing its mission.XIt started in 2014, when the Amazon (AMZN) of China paid $692 million for a stake in department store chain and mall operator Intime Retail Group, in a move to digitize brick-and-mortar department stores. A year later Alibaba paid $4.6 billion for a 20% stake in Sunning, an electronics retailer with 1,600 outlets. The company then forked over $2.9 billion for a 36% stake in Hong Kong-based Sun Art Retail. It's the largest operator of supermarkets in China, with about 446 stores in 224 cities.The company didn't stop there. Early last year it shelled out $2.6 billion to acquire the rest of Intime it didn't already own. During this same period Alibaba was building its own chain of brick-and-mortar supermarkets, called Hema. There, consumers have a variety of options on how they shop.Its ""New Retail"" strategy integrates e-commerce and conventional retailing in an effort to boost sales and convenience. Similar to Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year, Alibaba believes a foothold in traditional retail is the path to future growth.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Our New Retail initiatives are substantially growing Alibaba's total addressable market in commerce,"" said Joseph Tsai, Alibaba executive vice chairman, during the company's quarterly earnings conference call May 4. ""In retail, we are anticipating changing consumer behavior and increasing expectations of quality and convenience, whether these consumers shop online or in offline stores.""The New Retail phrase was coined by company founder Jack Ma more than two years ago.""The big prize for Alibaba in New Retail is modernizing the 'other 80%' of retail sales not yet online,"" Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler said in a recent report to clients. ""This means redefining the entire process of conventional retail workflow.""That includes new marketing methods, pricing models, inventory management, and sourcing and supply-chain management.""We think this business will ultimately be as high a margin, or better than the existing marketplace model,"" Kessler said. Kessler has raised his price target on Alibaba stock to 300 from 250. That is more than 50% from where the stock currently trades.As an example, users with a Hema supermarket app hook up to Alibaba's e-commerce platform and payment system. They then can shop for groceries online and have them delivered or pick them up.Or they can order fresh food and have it prepared by Hema chefs. And they can pay for any of it using the Alibaba online payment platform Alipay.The idea is to draw customers deeper into Alibaba's consumer-facing ecosystem. Alibaba is already the largest e-commerce services provider in China and looks to leverage that to grow its brick-and-mortar business.""With this transformation, China's $5 trillion in retail sales will be available to Alibaba as our total addressable market,"" Tsai said.There are 47 Hema stores in 13 cities across China, with 14 added in the first quarter. While that's not quite the 400-plus Whole Foods outlets that Amazon gained in one fell swoop with its $13.7 billion deal, Alibaba says its pace will accelerate.Part of the overall strategy involves attracting customers online, then directing them to physical stores and service centers. The partnerships also involve companies working together on integrating e-commerce platforms and logistics, in part to provide speedier delivery or in-store pickup. And they often include exclusive partnerships with retailers and brands.Alibaba is also developing algorithms to analyze customer data. It looks at brand affiliation, purchasing history and even tracks store visit time. The idea is to better understand shopper preferences and predict changes in habits. The results can then be used to adjust product offerings. It can also help design fresh marketing campaigns as well as build faster supply chains.The company was founded in 1999 in Hangzhou, China, but didn't gain widespread recognition in the U.S. until its blockbuster initial public offering in September 2014. It was the largest IPO ever on U.S. markets, raising $25 billion, with shares priced at 68. Alibaba stock in the past 12 months is up more than 60%. Shares jumped another 3%, surging past a buy point of 201.60, and were near 204.40 at midday Friday on the stock market today.On May 4 Alibaba reported a 76% jump in quarterly revenue from the year-ago period to $9.9 billion, up 76% from the year-ago quarter and 61% higher in local currency. That's its strongest growth in more than four years. Adjusted earnings rose 44% to 91 cents per share. Both revenue and earnings topped analyst estimates for the period ended March 31. The company expects revenue growth for fiscal year 2019 to exceed 60%, or more than 50% excluding acquired companies.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Hans Chung expects the company's new retail initiatives to be the key driver of revenue growth in fiscal 2019. Chung raised his price target on Alibaba to 235 from 219.Alibaba ended the quarter with 617 million monthly active users on mobile devices. That's up 6%, or 37 million, from the previous quarter.Needham analyst Kerry Rice attributed the better-than-expected revenue growth to Alibaba's New Retail initiative.There's another aspect to Alibaba's New Retail strategy, and that's food delivery.In April, Alibaba said it would acquire the shares that it did not already own in Ele.me, also a food-delivery company.""We believe the transaction is highly strategic to the company's new retail strategy as Ele.me's local service and food delivery network significantly strengthens Alibaba's last-mile delivery,"" wrote Rice.Alibaba and its affiliate, Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Group, invested $1.25 billion in Ele.me in 2016.It also has expanded into multiple facets of the digital economy. That includes digital entertainment and movies, financial services and cloud computing, among other businesses.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Alibaba Listing In China Would Fuel New Opportunities For InvestorsAlibaba Plans $15.2 Billion Investment In Logistics, DeliveryChina Internets Pump Billions In Online To OfflineBest Chinese Stocks To Buy And Watch

103,MA,"Is the IBD 50 trade war-resistant? Judging by the current composition of the list, one could argue, ""Yes, reasonably so.""More than a week after President Trump signed off on a 25% tariff on steel imports from most countries and a 10% hike in aluminum on March 8, the major indexes have taken it in stride. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are up since that day's close. The Nasdaq holds a nice cushion above its 50-day moving average.However, angst over the consequences of the protectionist trade strategy still hangs over the bull market. Will China and Europe retaliate? Which sectors could suffer the most if countries engage in tit-for-tat measures? Will the Scots and Brits really stop drinking Kentucky bourbon if prices skyrocket in the U.K.?No one knows. But in the IBD 50, very few of the companies making the list at the end of Thursday sell a commodity. Such physical goods appear to have a higher risk of getting punished by quotas or tariffs imposed by other countries. Warrior Met Coal (HCC) is the sole coal play in the list and sells in U.S., European, Latin American and Asian markets.In a November release on Q3 results, management expressed confidence it will remain a top exporter of high-quality metallurgical coal for the steel industry.""Strong sales volume coupled with high price realization and an exceptionally low cost structure enabled us to achieve strong free cash flow conversion,"" CEO Walt Scheller said in the release. The firm posted an average selling price of $144.06 per short ton; cash cost of sales rose $7.65, nearly 9%, vs. Q2 to $89.91.Warrior Met shares are trying to rebound off the 10-week moving average for the second time in as many months.The bulk of the IBD 50 firms are in finance, semiconductors and software. Software firms don't deliver their goods on ships or airfreight much these days. And companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) and MKS Instruments (MKSI) sell products that enjoy incredible demand.The global era of consumer spending and investment is still going strong. Mastercard (MA) and Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) are delivering steady growth. The former has posted profit growth of 29%, 15%, 24% and 33% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The latter is expected to boost its earnings 33% this year to $4.55 a share.Trump clearly cares about working class families that rely on a strong manufacturing and industrial base. That's good. But the U.S. economy is truly diversified. The savvy IBD reader recognizes that entrepreneurs deliver innovative new products and services that span a wide swath of industries.Take Casa Systems (CASA). The Andover, Mass., company is the only one in the IBD 50 hailing from the telecom infrastructure industry group. Only six companies in the 26-member group trade at least 30 a share. Its software is a big hit with cable firms expanding their broadband service. Around 40% of its sales come from outside the U.S.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Adobe Systems (ADBE) are delivering excellent products to meet the enormous demand for data security, digital marketing campaigns, video design and editing and document management.Weibo (WB) is virtually 100% unlikely to be impacted by U.S. tariffs, both present and future. The Chinese social media giant has climbed 141% from a breakout at 58.89 in May 2017, but the stock's long-term uptrend remains intact. Wall Street sees Weibo's earnings soaring 56% to $2.81 a share this year and 43% in 2019.You can trade the IBD 50 in one click with the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF, managed by Innovator Capital.

Same-store sales at company-owned domestic locations rose 3.8%, and franchise comps were up 4.2%, missing Thomson Reuters forecasts.""Our 2017 global retail sales growth and domestic comps outperformed the high-end of our stated three to five-year outlook,"" said CEO Patrick Doyle in a statement. ""This, along with tremendous net store growth and an incredibly low number of closures, helps validate that our long-term fundamental strength is well intact heading into 2018.""Meanwhile, the Brazil Journal reported on Monday that Restaurant Brands is considering a bid for Domino's, potentially adding to Brazilian investment giant 3G Capital's restaurant holdings.Stock: Shares closed up 0.3% to 221.49 on the stock market today,.

108,MA,"What accounts for USAA Aggressive Growth Fund's (USAUX) tidy gain so far this year? In terms of holdings, the credit goes to Amazon (AMZN), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline).X They're among the fund's best performing stocks this year, and have helped propel it to a 6.17% gain going into Thursday vs. 6.09% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar and 2.35% for the S&P 500.But those stocks might not have had meaningful positions in the portfolio were it not for new fund managers John Jares and Craig Behnke, who took the reins of the fund in August last year.For the board of the USAA Aggressive Growth Fund, 2016 was the straw that broke the camel's back.After years of consistently trailing its benchmark — the Russell 1000 Growth Index — in 2016 the fund posted a return of 0.72%. That year the Russell 1000 Growth rose 7.08% and the S&P 500 Index gained 11.96%. The fund's parent company knew drastic action needed to be taken. It fired the subadvisors managing the fund, Winslow Capital and Wellington Capital, and gave it to two in-house portfolio managers, John Jares and Craig Behnke, in August 2017.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersSince then, the managers have looked at each of the 125 stocks in the fund and done their own fundamental research. They've sold many stocks, narrowing the fund down to a smaller, lighter, more concentrated portfolio of 80 stocks with the goal of hitting around 70.""I don't know what was going on before, but by virtue of having two subadvisors, it was over diversified, and had little chance of outperforming,"" said Jares. ""We want to differentiate ourselves based on security selection, keep the beta in line with the benchmark, and add alpha through stock selection. We're nearly done with the process. We have 15 names to go.""The fund kept the top five holdings: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), which is the parent of Google, Visa (V) and Amazon. It also kept Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL). Among the names sold were Alibaba (BABA), Expedia (EXPE), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Amdocs (DOX), Teradyne (TER) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS).They're not just selling. They've also been adding new stocks and boosting the concentrations of the ones they like. When they took over the fund, 15 stocks made up 30% of the portfolio. Jares said by the time he's done, 15 stocks will make up about 40% of total assets.""It's a tale of two different time periods,"" said Behnke. ""From Sept. 1, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2017, when we were in the process of turning over a lot of the portfolio, our performance relative to the Russell 1000 Growth trailed by 200 basis points."" Even so, the fund ended 2017 up 30.05% vs. the Russell's 30.21% and the S&P's 21.83%.Now that the fund is closer to the managers' ideal portfolio, from Jan. 1 through March 4, it beat its benchmark by 105 basis points.Jares said the fund has performed well because of its holdings in technology and the consumer discretionary sector. Despite this, the managers have reduced the fund's technology weighting to 40% from 46%. And they increased the consumer discretionary weighting to 16.2% from 13.1%. Overall, they've broadened the fund's sector exposures by diversifying the number of sectors, while concentrating the number of stocks.Among the new stocks, they like Vulcan Materials (VMC)) so much that it became a top 10 holding. Based in Birmingham, Ala., the company supplies crushed stone, known as aggregates, along with concrete and asphalt to make roads and bridges.""Those aggregates have seen nice pricing power,"" said Jares. ""And in an improving economy where you may have infrastructure programs coming down the pike, their volume outlook is excellent.""The company has grown earnings at a 48% annual clip the past three years, but the stock is 14% off its 52-week high and trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bearish sign.Edwards Lifesciences (EW), which makes catheters to treat heart disease, has grown earnings at an annual pace of 29% in the past three years.""The original estimates of that market were $3 billion over the next three to five years,"" said Behnke. ""But with lower death rates and lower complications compared to surgery, those numbers are so strong that the total addressable market increased and the current estimate is $5 billion. Through our research and our industry contacts, over the next 12-24 months estimates for that market could push to the $6 billion-$8 billion range by 2025.""Jares also likes HP (HPQ), which he expects to become a growth company again. Best known for making computer printers, HP, Jares notes, is launching a new line of copiers. As 3-D printing kicks in, the company will become a leader again, he says. Jares says he expects HP will see growth return in the mid-single-digit range.The fund charges a below average expense ratio of 0.81%.RELATED:Look At What Hot Stocks Are Driving This Market-Beating Mutual FundDow Retakes 50-Day As Apple Pegs New Closing High; Bitcoin Dives

110,MA,"Internet: The Senate has voted to raise net neutrality from the dead, a very bad idea. Worse, the 52-47 margin of victory included three Republicans who should know better. We hope it dies in the House.""Net neutrality"" is one of those brilliant marketing gimmicks that passes as something that enhances equality and freedom, but in fact destroys it.President Obama's Federal Communications Commission in 2015 imposed net neutrality, requiring internet service providers to treat all internet traffic the same. Sure, that sounds good, even democratic, but it isn't. In fact, most economists agree, it will lead to slower times for everything, less internet innovation and, ultimately, higher prices for consumers.That's a good idea?Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThankfully, late last year, Trump's FCC under Chairman Ajit Pai let common sense prevail and overturned net neutrality. Like a zombie, it's now returned, thanks to foolish politicians who think Washington, not the marketplace, should decide how the internet is run, what prices they can charge, and what services they can provide. Heavy-handed regulation at its worst.Last week, 49 Senate Democrats and three Republicans passed what's called a ""resolution of disapproval,"" which will let Congress reimpose net neutrality, if both houses agree. It's a bad idea for a number of reasons.One, the internet's astonishing record of innovation and advancement — including making the leap from crude dial-up internet services to full-on streaming of movies, games, information, graphics and other content — took place during the non-net neutrality era. It's no accident.Yes, ISPs treat a movie you're streaming differently from a text you're downloading. But that's only common sense. To give both the exact same priority would make it nearly impossible to have, say, high quality movie streaming on Netflix or Amazon. Do you really want to give that up?Two, net neutrality rules keep internet service companies from figuring out how best to use their networks and what prices they should charge for their services. In essence, they impose price and content controls on the internet, discouraging future investment.What net neutrality does is reimpose the kinds of innovation-stifling regulations on the internet that were imposed on the Ma Bell phone network for decades. Those telephone regulations led to decades of stifled innovation, high prices and poor service, until the regulated monopoly was broken up by court order in 1982.The dead hand of government regulation will not promote competition, better services or lower prices. That only happens when market participants can respond to market demand and price their services accordingly. The House is expected to reject the bill, and we urge them to do so. If not, President Trump should veto it.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:A Tale Of Two Decisions: Trump Administration Got Antitrust Wrong, But Net Neutrality Right Net Neutrality Zealots Are Wrong — The Market Just Proved ItAjit Pai's Personal Hell, Our National Media's FailureClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

117,MA,"When Ed Sullivan introduced the 13-year-old Itzhak Perlman on his television show, he said the young violin prodigy was there ""by the grace of God."" Sullivan wasn't far off.Perlman was just four years old when he contracted polio. That was in 1949, well before the Salk vaccine. Given the state of medicine at the time, it was more likely that the Israel-born youngster would die or spend the rest of his life in an iron lung than become a world-renowned violin virtuoso.Perlman, however, doesn't see any cosmic intervention. ""It never occurred to me to consider that scenario,"" he said in an interview with IBD. ""I was just concentrating on playing the violin, liking what I was doing. I liked to play the violin — though I hated to practice.""If not otherworldly, Perlman certainly did benefit from a series of fortunate events. The first occurred when he was three years old. He heard Jascha Heifitz on the radio and immediately fell in love with the violin. Why?""Look, it's a very interesting phenomenon, what makes kids want to study the instruments they want to play. It's what speaks to you. The sound appealed to me. I wanted to do that,"" he said.Perlman was twice blessed. Not only did he find his passion very early in life, he also was good at it. He demonstrated great talent from the very beginning of his violin studies.And while he didn't fantasize that the life he now has might actually happen, he did imagine a professional career. ""Whenever one plays and has a certain amount of talent, one dreams that you can make a living at something you are passionate about, something that captures your imagination,"" he said.But as often happens in life, talent alone is not necessarily enough to assure success. Though he played exceptionally well and even had a recital at age 10, there were many who discouraged any thoughts of a professional classical music career.Some people ""were listening to the talent,"" but others couldn't see past the crutches. They ""were saying, well, he won't be able to travel, he won't be able to do this or that, but that (should have been) secondary,"" Perlman said.Extensive naysaying can prove a difficult obstacle to overcome for an adult, let alone a preteen. It would have been easy — understandable even — if young Perlman gave up. But he didn't. And that, he maintains, ""has to do with my parents. They believed in me. Whatever you hear in your house, the vibes you get from your parents, that gives you strength.""Then another stroke of luck hit. Popular TV host Ed Sullivan sent staffers to Israel in search of talent. ""They held auditions around the country, because he wanted to have Israeli acts on his show. Everybody was auditioning,"" Perlman recalled.After the number of acts was winnowed down to a manageable few, Sullivan himself came and approved Perlman. Perlman believes he wasn't selected solely on the basis of his violin skills, as great as they were. Working in his favor, he's said, was that he was a cute, chubby little kid who walked with crutches.Crutches don't make superstars though. But the way Perlman crushed Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto that Sunday evening in 1958 does. In retrospect, Perlman has said he sounded like a talented 13-year-old rather than a master musician. Still, the result, as they say, is history.At great personal sacrifice, his family moved to New York, where he attended the Juilliard School, after which a combination of his artistry and the irrepressible joy with which he makes music propelled him to the top of the classical music universe — primarily as a single star but also regularly in combination with others, including frequent trip partners Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax.Perlman's well-rounded life, though, involves more than just concertos. He loves jazz and klezmer music and has played with everyone from Billy Joel to the Sesame Street Muppets. He's even performed the national anthem before a playoff game involving his beloved New York Mets.He's also won almost every significant honor available. This impressive list includes the Medal of Liberty from President Reagan (1986), the National Medal of Arts from President Clinton (2000), the Kennedy Center Honors (2003) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama (2015).And Perlman has won four Emmy awards and 16 Grammys plus a lifetime achievement Grammy.Filmmaker Alison Chernick spent a year with the maestro for her recently released documentary, ""Itzhak."" She chose him as a subject ""not only because of his incredible musical talent, but his wonderful human soul behind his public persona.""In an interview with IBD she added, ""His humility, his honesty, his vulnerability, his kindness. I wouldn't say this surprised me, but in this time of moral corruptness, it was really nice to be around someone like that.""It is difficult to pick up a newspaper and not read a story about some celebrity gone astray. Which brings up another piece of good fortune along Perlman's path to success: He attended a prestigious music camp where he met his wife of 50-plus years, Toby, who was a violinist herself. She heard him play and immediately thereafter rushed into his bunk and proposed to the then-17-year-old prodigy. There was at least one girlfriend between then and the nuptials, she says, but eventually they became partners in life — and fiddle.""About his playing, nobody else is going to be honest,"" she told IBD. ""Everybody is going to say, 'You're so great. You're so wonderful.'""I'm going to say it too, because I think he is the greatest. But if he's (playing) sharp or I think there's a bad habit that creeps into his playing, I'm going to tell him that too.""Perlman claims people always ask him if he has any remaining goals, if there is something left he wants to accomplish. And he responds simply: I don't want to be bored. To that end, he regularly plays new pieces.He's also taken up conducting. Perlman has led some of the world's best orchestras, including symphonies in New York, London, Berlin and San Francisco. ""It's a different process,"" he said. ""But the goal is the same: to make music the way I hear it.""Perlman has also become very active as a teacher, at Juilliard and at the Perlman Music Programs, founded by wife Toby, which brings talented young string musicians 12 to 18 years old to Shelter Island in New York for a seven-week summer program and older students to a chamber music program. There are also weeklong residencies in Vermont in the fall and Sarasota in the winter.Part of the rationale for the teaching is paying it forward. When he was a struggling young student, a benefactor donated funds for sheet music and taxi fares so Perlman could make the roughly three-mile trip from his home in Manhattan to Juilliard.But, also, he feels teaching makes him a better musician. ""Teaching is really very important,"" he's said. ""I always tell my students that you should find an opportunity to teach. When you teach others, you teach yourself.""In fact, he feels, teaching, conducting and his performing career support each other. One of the most important things you can do as a musician, he says, is to listen. And the three elements of his current life allow him ""to listen with different ears.""""Life is full of challenges,"" he's said. ""I believe you're never happy unless you are consistently making challenges for yourself.""Widely considered one of the greatest violinists of his time.Overcame: Discouragement from outsiders who viewed his polio as an impediment to a classical music career.Lesson: Ignore naysayers.Quote: ""I have a very simple philosophy: One has to separate the abilities from the disabilities. The fact that I cannot walk, that I need crutches or a scooter or whatever it is, has nothing to do with my playing the violin.""

134,MA,"The poor stock market performance in March and the first quarter took its toll on many of the best mutual funds, according to IBD's latest Best Mutual Funds Performance Report. But mutual fund managers who spoke with IBD are not hitting the panic button yet. In fact, they point to a silver lining.""The pullback has taken some of the richness out of stock valuations,"" said Vladimir ""Val"" de Vassal, co-manager of $2.8 billion Glenmede Large Cap Core Fund (GTLOX), a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. Each of those top mutual funds beat its benchmark in 2017 and over the past three, five and 10 years as of Dec. 31. Only 10.4% of eligible U.S. diversified stock funds made the Best Mutual Funds Awards list. ""A drop in valuations is good,"" he added.Meanwhile, how weak was stock market performance? March's 2.54% setback marked the S&P 500's second straight monthly decline after 15 straight monthly gains. The bogey's 0.76% Q1 reversal was its first after nine straight quarterly advances. Likewise, the 0.93% March decline by the average U.S. diversified stock mutual fund was its second in a row after five monthly climbs. The group's 0.38% Q1 shrinkage was its first after seven quarterly gains in a row.Investors were jolted in part by fears of inflation, de Vassal said. That arose from January's strong payroll numbers — 200,000 jobs created instead of the 180,000 that were expected — and 2.9% rise in average hourly wages versus the prior year. Later downward revisions eased investors' concerns, but those jitters were replaced by new ones stemming from concerns about a possible trade war, sparked by U.S. tariffs on Chinese aluminum and steel, and the falloff by technology stocks.Still, many mutual fund managers look beyond the weak March and Q1 stock market performance and see encouraging signs. ""The economy looks good,"" said Chip Reed, co-manager of $11.6 billion Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund (EISMX), another 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. ""The market looks good. We have the tax stimulus package. We have global synchronized recovery in economic growth for the first time since the 1990s. It doesn't get better than this.""Despite U.S. diversified stock mutual funds' March fall, small-cap growth funds managed a 1.23% gain. That made them the best-performing subgroup. They also led Q1 overall by advancing 3.13%.And in contrast to the losses on average by U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in March and Q1, world equity funds eked out a 0.11% Q1 gain despite slipping 0.85% in March. Pacific ex Japan funds led world regions in March by posting the smallest setback, 0.35%. Latin American funds led foreign stock fund categories in Q1 with a 5.57% advance.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut the weakest market moved sharply in the opposite direction. India region funds plunged 7.51% in Q1, trimming their five-year average annual gain to 11.90%, still best among foreign stock markets.Among major sectors, real estate funds topped the pack in March with a 3.36% gain. Global science/technology funds' 5.53% advance was tops in Q1.Precious metals funds did worst among sectors in Q1, plummeting 7.21%, despite gaining 1.93% in March amid jitters about inflation and a possible trade war.On average, taxable bond funds gained in March but lost ground in Q1. Tax-exempt bond funds as a group also rose in March but sank in Q1.Despite the macro factors fueling his constructive outlook, Eaton Vance's Reed added that a trade war and high valuations could disrupt the party. ""You need to be cautious,"" he said.Matthew Moberg, lead manager of $5 billion Franklin DynaTech (FKDNX), a third 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner, says investors should expect continued volatility for the rest of this year. Otherwise, he is constructive. ""A combination of tax reform and earnings increases is good,"" he said. ""And inflation is being held in check by large internet platforms.""Further, despite the recent tech stock sell-off, Moberg's tech-focused fund remains bullish on select tech names. ""The fund invests in innovation,"" Moberg said. ""Places where we are invested still have a lot of secular growth.""In cloud computing, Moberg likes the huge lead that Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have in a growing market. In mobile advertising, he says Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) are growing and enjoying solid profitability.Three companies dominate chipmaking. He owns Intel (INTC) but not Samsung or Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). In the payments arena, he cites secular growth by Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA).In the software space, he likes ServiceNow (NOW). ""This company helps information-technology departments,"" Moberg said. ""Their software is finding new applications.""Reed looks for all-weather stocks. ""We look for holdings that can do well in any environment,"" he said. ""Our holdings tend to be companies that are somewhat immune to the economic cycle.""One is Verisk Analytics (VRSK). ""They sell data on insurance claims (mainly to property and casualty) insurance companies that they receive from other insurers,"" Reed said. ""They have a reservoir of information and tax records."" The company also has an insurance unit focused on risk assessment, rating and risk modeling for the oil and gas, petrochemicals, power-generation, and metals and mining industries.Markel (MKL) is another Reed favorite. ""They're a specialty insurance company,"" he said. ""They don't compete with big insurers. They underwrite insurance for bars, day care centers. The risks are higher, but that enables them to demand higher premiums.""Reed also holds Blackbaud (BLKB), a cloud software company focused on nonprofits. ""They design software that helps nonprofits run their business, from the accounting side to the fundraising side.""Blackbaud's programs enable nonprofits to focus on core missions rather than allocate resources to developing their own software, Reed said. ""They are dominant in that industry, and they expanding into education,"" he said.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeIn A Volatile Market: Go To Cash Or Stay The Course With Your Mutual Funds?

Many of the stocks cited in all these articles are in IBD's Relative Strength At New High Stock List.Last week the graphics-chip maker fell a fraction, erasing nearly all its losses Friday with a 6.4% jump to 231.46 after Nvidia reported blowout earnings and bullish guidance. Nvidia is about 7% off its Jan. 31 peak. Earlier in the week, Nvidia undercut its 50-day line but never closed below it.Bank of America rose 2% to 30.33, just retaking its 50-day line on Friday. Like Nvidia, BofA stock is about 7% off its high.Banks benefit from rising interest rates, so BofA shares have been less affected by stock market sell-off triggered by rising bond yields.The card giant tested its 50-day line on Tuesday and Friday, but closed comfortably above that support area on both days. Shares rose 2.85% to 165.20 on Friday. The RS line is right at record highs on a daily chart and clearly so on a weekly chart.Unlike many financials, Mastercard and larger rival Visa (V) don't get an interest rate benefit because they don't carry the credit balances on cards. Those apply to card-issuing banks such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).TD Ameritrade and other online brokerages have held up well in the stock market correction. Like many financials, they do get some benefit from higher rates.Ameritrade shares rose 0.6% to 54.69 on Friday after falling intraday below its 50-day line. The RS line is not quite at a record high on a daily chart, but is on a weekly.Fortinet is one of the better-performing cybersecurity stocks in recent months, with an RS line low at its highest level since late 2015.Fortinet reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Feb. 5, but profit guidance was a little light. Its shares, which had closed just below their 50-day line on Feb. 5, rebounded the next day, hitting a record high. Shares pulled back on Wednesday and Thursday bur popped 4.6% to 46.54, matching Tuesday's record close.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Don't Panic, It's Just A Correction: Here's What You Do NowThese 5 Defense Stocks Stand Out In Market CorrectionThe Big Picture: S&P 500 Leads Rebound; Now Watch For This SignalThese 4 Dow Stocks Reclaimed Key Support In Tough MarketThis Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On Edge

143,MA,"Imagine being told one day that your paychecks would be in Bitcoin. Pretty cool, right? Except your liquid assets could tumble in value at any moment in this cryptocurrency future. And you'd have to convert your cryptocurrency to dollars to buy groceries at Walmart (WMT), coffee at Starbucks (SBUX) or books on Amazon (AMZN).The surge in value of Bitcoin and its digital currency rivals has not been matched by their everyday utility. Payment processor Stripe cut off Bitcoin support in January, citing slow transaction times and high fees.""We've seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease,"" explained Stripe product manager Tom Karlo.Bitcoin and other digital rivals are nowhere near ready for prime time. They might never match the utility of today's financial-system incumbents, the banks and payment companies that facilitate the flow of funds over tens of millions of merchant locations.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYet much like millennials will never have a landline, a coming generation might do without bank accounts thanks to secure, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. Blockchain technology and the vast new crypto wealth have opened the door to four cryptocurrency futures that could usher in a new financial order.What are these possibilities?""Virtual currencies might just give existing currencies and monetary policy a run for their money,"" International Monetary Fund director Christine Lagarde predicted last fall. ""Citizens may one day prefer virtual currencies, since they potentially offer the same cost and convenience as cash — no settlement risks, no clearing delays, no central registration, no intermediary to check accounts and identities,"" she said.That explosive potential helps explain why so many tech entrepreneurs and investors turned cryptocurrencies into a 21st Century gold rush, even as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has trashed Bitcoin as ""a fraud.""Dimon and other titans of finance voice certainty that commercial banks will remain indispensable, cryptocurrencies will stay on the fringe, and governments will want to keep it that way.Blockchain's potential to revolutionize the financial system has some central banks studying whether to issue their own digital currency. Yale University scholars have proposed the FedCoin. In this cryptocurrency future, FedCoin could make monetary policy more flexible and forceful, even allowing for negative interest rates.If a cryptocurrency acted as a reliable, widely accepted store of value, people could cut ties to their banks. They could keep some crypto cash in digital wallets, with other liquid assets in mutual funds, stocks and government bonds.A Bank of England study concluded that a central-bank cryptocurrency could boost GDP by 3%. Gains would come, in part, from shrinking ""monetary transaction costs that are analogous to distortionary tax rates.""Yet FedCoin looks far-fetched at present because of the massive disruption it could cause. Central bank crypto dollars ""could endanger the economically and socially important financial intermediation function of commercial banks,"" JPMorgan analysts warned.The contribution of fractional reserve banking to global growth — turning each $1 of deposits into $10 in loans — could fade. ""We would expect that central banks would think twice before disturbing this source of capital to the private sector."" Dimon is surely right about one thing: The cryptocurrency future will depend heavily on government. That could mean smothering it with regulation, stealing its thunder via FedCoin or cultivating it with a light regulatory touch.Bitcoin hit its 2018 low early on Feb. 6, the morning of a key Senate cryptocurrency hearing, briefly undercutting $6,000. The chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission both urged stronger oversight. But the financial regulators stopped short of sounding an alarm. Nor did they call for any legislation to rein in cryptocurrencies. In the weeks after that hearing, Bitcoin rebounded to around $11,000 but it has retreated yet again to below $7,000.Bitcoin had doubled in the first half of December, hitting a peak above $19,000 just as Bitcoin futures began trading on Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME (CME). The anticipation of futures trading, touted as validation from U.S. regulators, stoked speculation.At the Senate hearing, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who earned his fortune as an early investor in the cell phone industry, said he sees a parallel between mobile phones then and cryptocurrencies now. ""The same kind of transformation is about to take place,"" he said.Warner criticized the CFTC for embracing Bitcoin options at this stage. He fretted that total cryptocurrency market capitalization could hit $20 trillion — vs. $300 billion now — with another 2017-like surge.""This rises potentially to the level of a systemically relevant event,"" Warner said.Yet there's reason to doubt that cryptocurrency frenzy will return. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) — Ma Bell in Warner's analogy — banned credit-card purchases of cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the SEC and foreign governments have cracked down on initial coin offerings. And lately, Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google, Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) have banned cryptocurrency ads.Even Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin warned via Twitter not long ago that cryptocurrencies ""could drop to near-zero at any time."" He added that ""traditional assets are still your safest bet.""The Bank for International Settlements, the central banker for global central banks, has warned that cryptocurrencies in the future could become a ""threat to financial stability"" if regulators aren't vigilant. U.S. regulators appear to be playing catch-up. As of Feb. 6, the cryptocurrency working group put together by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had held a single meeting.Politicians and central bankers worry that cryptocurrencies won't hold value in a panic. ""When things really go bad, where do Americans turn?"" Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker asked a fintech conference last fall. ""Well, they're going to come back to the government. That's the history of the country.""Harker did allow that other currency models might work if another ""large player"" besides the government provided trust.Who could fill that role? Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz offered some thoughts on the coffee chain's January earnings call.""I personally believe that there is going to be one or a few legitimate, trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology,"" Schultz said. He doubted that Bitcoin would be one of them.Cryptocurrencies ""will have to be legitimized by a brand in a brick-and-mortar environment, where the consumer has trust and confidence in the company that is providing the transaction.""Starbucks wants to play a role but isn't making a big investment in a cryptocurrency future right now, Schultz said.Cryptocurrency investors have speculated that Amazon might accept Bitcoin or one of its digital rivals. That specific cryptocurrency would vault past competitors as a trusted store of value and useful medium of exchange. Amazon even registered the domains AmazonEthereum.com, AmazonCryptocurrency.com and AmazonCryptocurrencies, kicking such talk into high gear.Alternatively, Amazon, Walmart — or a consortium of large companies — might issue their own cryptocurrency. Doing so could let them save on transaction costs and act as a competitive weapon.But Amazon has also been cozying up with JPMorgan. Recently, Amazon and JPMorgan have partnered in a health care venture and in creating a new type of bank account.Yet imagine if Amazon or Walmart rewarded loyal customers with tokens that could escalate in value. The tokens would jump to the head of the cryptocurrency pack with potential for broad acceptance as a currency. Customers would likely hoard the tokens, rather than spend them. The effect on sales and profits might be electric.For a digital currency to gain wide acceptance from outside businesses, the issuer would have to act like a central bank. Governing a currency requires trust, so some functions might need independence from corporate issuers.Those milestones could ease fears of a massive cryptocurrency crash. The Fed shouldn't need to rush in and save the day if AmazonCoin or WalmartCoin crashed.Currencies rely on conservative and predictable rules to assure the public that massive money printing won't destroy value. Could people trust the central bank of Amazon?Then again, will people always be able to count on the Fed?The Fed controls the creation of money, but central bankers seem to be losing their grip. Any loss of faith in the dollar and the Fed bodes well for a cryptocurrency future as dollar-skeptics look for an alternative store of wealth — besides gold.Bitcoin's peer-to-peer electronic payment system, first proposed in 2008 to verify transactions through a decentralized public blockchain, arrived on the scene as the global financial crisis triggered bailouts of one big bank after another.Bitcoin fulfilled famed economist Friedrich Hayek's idea of denationalizing money. He believed competition could help keep central banks honest and prevent runaway inflation.Doubts fueled by ""ballooning balance sheets of the major central banks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis"" motivated early cryptocurrency investors, JPMorgan analysts wrote. Yet the lack of any upsurge in inflation since ""has surely reduced concerns about fiat (legal tender issued by a central bank) money.""Yet the Fed now faces a much different challenge: a runaway federal deficit even amid a strong U.S. economy. The deficit will top $1 trillion in fiscal 2019 and $2 trillion by 2027, and there's no fix in sight. Republicans have overseen big deficit-financed tax cuts and increased government spending. Democrats want more generous Social Security benefits, Medicare for all and debt-free college.""The continued growth of public debt raises eventual sustainability questions if left unchecked,"" Goldman Sachs economists warned recently.The Fed seems on track to suffer the same fate as the Bank of Japan. The BoJ has been forced to accommodate sky-high government deficits with easy money and asset purchases. Japan, with a falling working-age population, hasn't had a whiff of inflation. But the U.S. might be a different story.Deutsche Bank global credit strategist Jim Reid put this shocking headline on a November report: ""The Start of the End of Fiat Money?"" Reid argued high debt levels will keep the Fed and other central banks too accommodative, putting fiat currencies at risk.""The fiat currency system may be seriously tested over the coming decade and ultimately we may need to find an alternative,"" Reid wrote. ""Cryptocurrencies are all the rage at the moment and are as much about blockchain as anything else, but there could be an increasing desire for alternative"" mediums of exchange in the years to come.""Keep in mind that fiat money is a relatively young innovation. It's only truly been the norm since President Nixon ended the dollar's quasi-gold standard in 1971.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisBurned By Bitcoin?

150,MA,"Dow Jones futures fell modestly Thursday morning along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures after an Apple (AAPL) rally failed to lift the major stock market averages on Wednesday. Tesla (TSLA) tumbled after reporting a $1 billion cash burn and Elon Musk took aim at ""boring"" analysts.Apple Music-rival Spotify (SPOT) and Square (SQ) sold off on weak guidance, Meanwhile, Big Data software maker Tableau (DATA) soared on strong revenue, signaling a likely breakout Thursday.The Nasdaq rose modestly for much of Wednesday's session, fueled by Apple's 4.4% gain. But the Dow Jones and S&P 500 never made much progress, even though Apple is the top weight in those indexes as well. Stocks lost ground following the Fed meeting, despite policymakers leaving Fed interest rates steady and offered few surprises. The Nasdaq fell 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and Dow each slid 0.7%.Apple failed to lift stock market indexes because the tech titan largely reflected its big shareholder returns as well as its thriving services business, while iPhone sales were a little light.

Keep in mind that stock market action overnight, from Dow Jones futures to Tesla and Square, often doesn't translate into how stocks trade in the following session.Tesla reported a smaller-than-expected loss. Model 3 production is steady, but still well below prior projections. Tesla burned through $1.05 billion in cash in the first-quarter, slightly more than expected. The electric-car maker has $2.7 billion in cash on hand.Tesla stock fell 5% before the U.S. stock market trading open.

Spotify directly listed its stock on April 3, bypassing an IPO.Square met earnings views, with revenue topping forecasts as Bitcoin transactions helped. But the $34.1 million in Bitcoin revenue came with $33.9 million in costs. The mobile payments firm gave weak earnings guidance. Square sank 6.2% early Thursday. On Wednesday, Square rose about 1% to 48.66, but hit 50-day resistance.Also inWednesday, PayPal (PYPL) sank 4.1% to 71.73, closing just below its 200-day moving average for the first time since late 2016. PayPal fell as Amazon offered discounts to retailers using its Amazon Pay option. That also follows former parent eBay (EBAY) cutting close ties with PayPal.While ""new"" payments stocks Square and PayPal ran into trouble, Mastercard (MA) jumped into a buy zone on strong earnings Wednesday. Visa (V) also is in buy range following its earnings last week.The Big Data software firm reported a 7-cent adjusted profit and $246.2 million in revenue, based on new accounting standards. By its old accounting, Tableau lost 19 cents a share on revenue of $224 million.Analysts, apparently relying on the old accounting standard, had expected a 19-cent loss on revenue of $218 million.Tableau jumped 6.5% to 90.75 in late trading.

Those firms will also need to establish a commercial presence in China, payment service facilities and disaster-recovery systems.The decision, the People's Bank of China said on Wednesday, was intended to encourage innovation and competition. But it also comes as President Trump, who has long complained that China has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade, readies a plan to hit the country with at least $30 billion in tariffs.The loosening of the payments market comes after Beijing last year eased rules for foreign banks to do business in China, potentially allowing U.S. giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) to increase their presence in retail banking and financial services.JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also among the more than 30 U.S. banks that are in a consortium for mobile payment service Zelle, which transferred $75 billion through 247 million transactions in 2017.PayPal (PYPL), which owns Venmo, already has ties in China.

163,MA,"Credit-card giant Visa (V) on Thursday reported fiscal first-quarter results after the close that beat estimates, helped by solid holiday spending and e-commerce. The company also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback, after some rivals said they would cut or suspend theirs.Earlier in the day, Mastercard (MA) also reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings as holiday shoppers spent more on their credit and debit cards.Visa earned $1.08 a share, a 26% jump, beating estimates for 90 cents. Revenue of $4.86 billion, a 9% increase, topped forecasts for $4.815 billion.Payments volume for the quarter jumped 10%, with cross-border volume up 9% and processed transactions up 12%.CEO Alfred Kelly said in a statement that in the wake of President Trump's tax bill signed into law in December, the company was ""evaulating ways"" to invest more in its business in part to digitize payments.Visa also said it expects an effective tax rate of roughly 23%, with a six percentage point reduction due to the tax cuts, and it said the legislation would would add to EPS.But it kept its revenue growth outlook for the year to the ""high single digits"" on a nominal dollar basis. And the company forecast operating expense growth to come in at the ""high end of mid-single digits"". In October, Visa said it expected operating expenses to grow in the ""mid-single digits.""Operating margin dipped 1 percentage point during the quarter, while operating expenses rose 13%.Shares were down 1.6% after hours in the stock market today.

The stock was unchanged late.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The results arrive after some department stores, like Macy's (M) and JCPenney (JCP), and other big-box retailers like Target (TGT), turned out encouraging holiday-period sales.Amazon (AMZN), meanwhile, has fattened its share of online retail sales during the holidays, according to GBH Insights figures cited by MarketWatch. Amazon reported earnings after Thursday's closing bell.But Nomura analyst Bill Carcache said the GOP's new tax legislation would create ""noise"" due to one-time impacts that the law — be it a benefit or a hit to earnings — will have on the credit-card companies' profit.Analysts generally expect the economy and finance industry to benefit from the GOP's new tax legislation once the sector digests write-downs, taxes on foreign earnings and other effects.American Express (AXP) — which issues credit cards directly, unlike card networks Visa and Mastercard — this month said it would suspend share buybacks for the first half of this year after a one-time, $2.6 billion charge related to the law chewed up a big part of its fourth-quarter profit.AmEx said it would halt repurchasing shares to gather up more capital after sustaining that charge, which stemmed largely from a repatriation tax on some foreign earnings and a lower value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Companies can accumulate deferred tax assets during losses and use them to ease their tax burden.American Express stock crept up 0.25% on Thursday. Visa and American Express are members of the Dow Jones industrial average.In December, Capital One Financial said it would cut its buyback due to similar charges.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:PayPal Shares Plunge On eBay Contract Exit; Adyen Moves In For DealAlibaba Falls Short On Earnings, Takes 33% Stake In Ant FinancialAmazon Health Care Disruption Fears Clash With This RealityToronto Dominion Bank Trying To Close In On Key Technical Measure

174,MA,"After a stunning 2017 during which the stock market pretty much went straight up, the last six weeks have been an unkind reminder that volatility is a natural part of the market, which can cause investors a lot of anxiety.If you're re-evaluating your risk tolerance and looking for investments to help you sleep better at night, you might want to look at low volatility ETFs, a group of funds that seek to offer a smoother ride during choppy waters.People buy these funds for risk mitigation when the market falls, by providing downside protection. Your losses should be much less than the broader market's during a decline. But of course, in return for less risk, you give up some profits when the market rallies.Since its May 2011 inception, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) has outperformed the S&P 500 in each of its 20 largest weekly declines — including the February correction, according to the company.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe $7.1 billion fund seeks to capture 75% of the upside and fall only 45% on the downside over market cycles. Not day-to-day, or week-to-week, but over a three- to five-year time horizon, says Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at PowerShares by Invesco.The fund does this by investing in the least risky stocks in the S&P 500. It holds the 100 stocks with the lowest volatility over the past year and rebalances every quarter. The biggest sector weights in the portfolio include 22% in utilities, 20% in financials and 17% in industrials. Among its top holdings: Coca-Cola (KO), PepsiCo (PEP) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB). Last year, SPLV returned 17.3% vs. the S&P 500's 21.8%. On a five-year annualized basis, the fund returned 11.9% vs. the S&P 500's 14.3%, according to Morningstar Inc. The ETF charges a 0.25% expense ratio.""We get the best of low volatility by examining it on the Sharpe ratio basis. What is my return, per my unit of risk that I'm taking?"" said Kalivas. ""If you're an investor who wants equity return without great volatility, that is essentially where the low volatility strategy will shine.""For people who want a little more risk and closer tracking of the S&P 500, PowerShares S&P 500 Quality Portfolio (SPHQ) seeks to capture 97% of the upside of the index and 75% of the downside. It holds what it considers the 100 highest quality stocks in the benchmark. These stocks have the strongest balance sheets, highest return on equity, and lowest leverage determined by debt to equity. The $1.4 billion fund rates them according to those traits and rebalances twice a year.""The idea is to pick stocks that can weather difficult economic times,"" said Kalivas. ""Like the low volatility fund, it will lag when the market rises a lot and outperform when it falls.""SPHQ's portfolio contains 24% in information technology, 23% in industrials, 15% in health care and 14% in consumer staples. Top holdings include Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and Boeing (BA). It earned 19.1% last year and a five-year annualized return of 14.3%. The expense ratio is 0.29%.""We like both of them in terms of reducing risk,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research. ""They go about it in different manners. SPHQ has no exposure to utilities and greater exposure to more economically sensitive sectors.""""These products haven't been tested in a severe market downturn like 2008,"" said Alex Bryan, Morningstar's director of passive strategies research, North America. ""While the downside capture has been pretty low, around 50%, I wouldn't expect that to always be the case in a more severe downturn.""Bryan says he likes iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor (QUAL) because it takes a sector-relative approach to stock selection and is cheaper at 0.15%. The $4.6 billion fund eliminates unintended sector bias or bets on certain sectors, he says, ""(and) I like it because it hasn't changed its benchmark as many times as the PowerShares ETF has changed its benchmark."" QUAL posted a 22.3% return last year and a three-year annualized return of 12.8%.For low volatility, Bryan recommends iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV). He said it uses a more complex methodology, as well as a holistic approach to construct the least volatile portfolio possible under a certain set of constraints for the sector weightings. The $14.6 billion fund's biggest sector weights include 21% in information technology, 17% in health care, and 13% in consumer staples. It returned 18.91% last year and a five-year annualized return of 13%. USMV carries a 0.15% expense ratio.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Blockchain Expands Beyond Bitcoin To Amazon, Nvidia, AlibabaIs Your Portfolio Ready To Handle Increased Market Volatility?Which Sectors Does Market Pro Expect To Outperform This Year?

176,MA,"In an industry clogged with look-alike mutual funds, an ESG focus helps Calvert Equity Fund (CSIEX) stand out. The $2.2 billion fund bases its buy decisions not only on fundamental financial analysis but also on socially responsible criteria.X ESG refers to environmental, social and corporate governance criteria. ""Investors are attracted to this approach (using ESG factors) because they want to invest in companies that are solving these pressing ESG challenges,"" said Anthony Eames, director of responsible investment strategy for Calvert Research & Management. ""Over time, companies that get ESG factors right benefit from that, and that's good for the companies and their shareholders.""The financial fundamentals that the fund's four managers screen for are designed to find ""companies with consistent growth and stability in earnings,"" said Joseph Hudepohl, one of four Atlanta Capital Management co-managers who subadvise the fund for Calvert. Both Atlanta and Calvert are units of Eaton Vance.""Companies like that can thrive in any environment,"" he added. ""They're not reliant on the capital markets for funding, so they can withstand periods like (the financial crisis of) 2008-09, and they can compound over time.""Those traits are reflected in fund performance: strong, not dazzling, with lower downside risk than many of its peers.Calvert Equity outperformed the broad market in the form of the S&P 500 for the past year going into Thursday, up 30.87% vs. 26.95%. Large-cap growth mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Direct averaged 32.56%. And the fund provided shareholders with a smoother ride than its peer group has over time periods stretching from three to 15 years. Over the past three years, for example, the fund has gone down less than 85% of the S&P 500 in downturns, while its peers have averaged declines of more than 110% vs. the big-cap bogey.Calvert analysts sift through a universe of about 2,500 stocks. They pass a pool of 100 to 150 stocks that meet its ESG standards to the fund's Atlanta Capital co-managers. ""Then, based on our financial criteria and (low) valuation, we gravitate to the 45 to 50 names that make it into our portfolio,"" Hudepohl said.""Our universe of high quality businesses overlaps a lot with Calvert's universe of businesses that meet their ESG standards,"" he added.He says companies that satisfy the criteria tend to have tail winds because of those traits. ""There are long-term benefits to focusing on clean water like Danaher (DHR), for example, and on clean air like Praxair (PX).""Danaher's products include water treatment and vapor recovery systems. Its earnings per share rose 8%, 10% and 15% the past three quarters. Shares are up 27% in the past 12 months.Praxair makes atmospheric gases, process gases and industrial gas production equipment. EPS grew 7%, 5%, 6% and 8% the past four quarters, which followed eight quarters of EPS declines. Share price rose 37% in the past 12 months. The stock yields 2%.ESG criteria do not prevent the fund from investing in stocks that are popular among investors. FANG stalwarts Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) are holdings.IBD'S TAKE: You can see how Apple's strengths — like its five quarters of earnings per share growth acceleration — stack up against its peers at the stock's easy-to-read IBD Stock Checkup page.Calvert Equity's thesis for Facebook focuses on what Facebook excels at. ""Advertising dollars go where the eyeballs are,"" Hudepohl said. ""The internet is taking (consumers) eyeball time away from other media. And Facebook is one of the top truly global platforms after Google (for attracting consumers). It benefits from worldwide growth in attracting advertising dollars.""Equity managers like the steady earnings growth prospects for both Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V). ""They're two of the better examples of high-quality growth stocks and what we're looking for from a financial perspective,"" Hudepohl said about the credit card giants.Both companies also appear to have long runways in front of them. ""Amazingly, half of all transactions in developed markets are still in cash, so there is a lot of opportunity there,"" he said. ""And within emerging markets like India, China and South America, 90% of transactions are still done in cash.""And the two companies avoid taking on consumers' credit risk. ""They don't carry loans (from consumers),"" Hudepohl said. ""They are paid on each swipe of a card because of their technology. And the number of swipes is increasing.""Also, the companies have huge free cash flow, Hudepohl says. ""So they don't depend on capital markets to grow their businesses,"" he said. That means they don't have to issue stock or pay interest on loans or bonds to pay for capital expenditures or develop new technology.Charles Schwab (SCHW) benefits from a long-term secular tail wind of online brokers gaining market share, Hudepohl says. Also, Schwab stands to gain from rising interest rates. ""(The) low interest rate environment forced Schwab along with the rest of the industry to grant fee waivers on money market funds,"" Hudepohl said. ""As rates rise, those fees are being reinstituted.""""Secondly, the low rate environment also compressed net interest margin,"" he added. ""As rates rise, the spread that Schwab earns on its assets should continue to expand. Both benefits carry very high incremental margins to Schwab.""RELATED:Here's How Wall Street Professionals Play Bitcoin — Should You?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

They're involved with blockchain in one way or another and see huge potential in the technology, not to mention cost savings, operational efficiencies and increased profits.ETF issuers have taken note of this trend. As a result, four ETFs have sprouted that represent companies involved in this up-and-coming disruptive technology.Blockchain is a chronological and public digital ledger of information, which can be applied in a nearly infinite number of ways to facilitate and expedite tasks for businesses.The four blockchain ETFs are $176 million Amplify Transformational Data Sharing (BLOK), $112 million Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy (BLCN), $21 million First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process (LEGR) and $5 million Innovation Shares NextGen Protocol (KOIN).Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!The funds have significant differences in their approach and methodology. But all four were launched in January, their fees range from 0.65% to 0.7%, and a big chunk of their holdings is in technology and finance.""I think the big argument against blockchain ETFs I've seen so far is, 'Is this just a repackaging of tech and financial names?' "" said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify ETFs. ""Usually the leaders of any emerging segment are the most well-funded companies who have the money to invest in private companies, or the money to do the research and development into that technology.""He added: ""Early on, you're owning conglomerates, or less pure-play companies. But over time, business lines develop, private companies come to market and spinoffs happen."" Magoon says that every quarter to six months, the portfolio will change in composition and become more purely focused on blockchain companies.Amplify's BLOK is the only actively managed blockchain ETF. Top 10 holdings, which represent 46% of the fund, include Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Japanese IT firm Digital Garage, Square (SQ), Nvidia, Overstock.com (OSTK) and Japanese internet and media firm GMO Internet.Being an actively managed fund is a big advantage in the fast-evolving blockchain universe, Magoon says. This flexibility allows BLOK to quickly sell names that may get involved in controversies or buy new blockchain-related stocks.Among the other three ETFs, BLCN tracks the Nasdaq Blockchain Economy index, which uses a score to rate companies' involvement with blockchain. It states on its website that ""10% of the global GDP is predicted to be stored on blockchain platforms by 2027,"" according to the World Economic Forum.""We really believe this could be one of the major innovations of the last 20 or 30 years, including the internet; it could be even possibly bigger than the internet was as far as disruption,"" said Eric Ervin, CEO of Reality Shares. ""We wanted to take it seriously, so we built out a board of advisors that are experts in the space.""""Like any new emerging technology, you really have to be able to discern which one is a fraud, and which ones are really genuinely using the technology and how they're using it,"" he said.BLCN is more diversified at the top than BLOK, with top 10 holdings representing 22% of the fund's assets. Top names include Overstock.com, Intel (INTC), International Business Machines (IBM), Japanese internet financial group SBI Holdings, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Microsoft (MSFT).The blockchain score that's used excludes companies that may be ""toying around with the technology but won't have a high economic impact,"" those with market caps less than $200 million, illiquid stocks, certain global exchanges, as well as firms in the early stages of development such as testing. Consequently, the index has omitted controversial names like Kodak (KODK), Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Xunlei (XNET).The two smaller funds are LEGR and KOIN. LEGR invests in firms that make products and services to enable the use of blockchain and those that are using the technology to be more efficient. The fund has tighter liquidity constraints and only invests in companies that have clearly demonstrated a success case.KOIN is using a unique patent-pending approach whereby artificial intelligence (AI) uses special algorithms to scan for new stories, keywords and themes, to identify stocks related to blockchain. It then compounds a sentiment score on the basis of which it will include or exclude a stock. As a result, the ETF holds a few stocks others don't, such as Sprint (S) and the world's largest shipper, Maersk.RELATED:First Trust Launches New Blockchain ETF To Meet DemandIBM Launches Blockchain Joint Venture With Maersk For Global TradingBitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet

192,MA,"American Express (AXP) on Thursday reported fourth-quarter results that topped views, but the credit-card giant said it would suspend its share buybacks for the first half of this year due to a big, one-time hit it took to profits due to the GOP's new tax legislation.The plans to halt those repurchases, which have helped boost AmEx's per-share profits, come as other big financial companies weather the short-term storm the tax bill has dumped on their profits, even though analysts and investors anticipate longer-term benefits from the law and an improving economy. Rival credit-card company Capital One Financial (COF) last month said it would chop its buyback program nearly in half due to a charge similar to the one absorbed by AmEx.""The upfront charge triggered by the Tax Act reduced our capital ratios and, as a result, while we will be continuing our quarterly dividends at the current level, we plan to suspend our share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital,"" American Express said in a statement on Thursday.AmEx said that the $2.6 billion charge was based on its ""current estimate"" of taxes on foreign earnings and the reduced value of its deferred tax assets and liabilities, whose value will get cut along with the cut in the corporate tax rate to 21%. Companies can take on those assets in the event of a loss and use them to ease their tax burden.Earlier this month, American Express said its Q4 earnings would be reduced by around $2.4 billion due to the temporary disarray caused by the tax bill.""The new law makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code and it will take time to interpret the changes,"" the company said in a regulatory filing on Jan. 3, and it forecast ""significant impacts"" to ""future periods"" beyond 2017. American Express also said its full-year EPS would come up short of its forecast for $5.80-$5.90.American Express on Thursday said it expected an effective U.S. tax rate of roughly 22% this year, before discrete items. And the company forecast earnings per share this year of $6.90-$7.30, above Zacks estimates for $6.83.For the fourth quarter, the company reported EPS of $1.58, above views for $1.54, as revenue rose 10% to $8.839 billion, topping estimates for $8.72 billion.Shares fell 2.6% to 97.40 after-hours in the stock market today after closing down 0.9%. Shares hit a record 102.38 on Tuesday. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), which both report earnings on Feb. 1, closed up 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. American Express and Visa are both Dow industrial components.As with other businesses, AmEx on Thursday said it believed the tax reform would be good for it and the U.S. economy. The company said it expected to invest as much as $200 million more this year than initially planned for ""customer-facing growth initiatives.""Nomura-Instinet analyst Bill Carcache this month wrote that AmEx's one-time charge could dent a key capital ratio for the company, temporarily threatening the share buyback program that has boosted its earnings. He wrote that a suspension of the buybacks in the first half of this year ""appears likely,"" but that it could replenish the capital within a couple of quarters if it did so.What's more, Zacks analysts say, AmEx's rewards expenses rose through much of last year, due in part to efforts to make its platinum cards more attractive and push its co-branded card with Delta Air Lines (DAL).Still, Zacks was looking for AmEx's sales to rebound from the loss in 2016 of Costco Wholesale (COST), one of its largest card customers. And the firm cites the company's attempts to cut costs and prospects abroad.The earnings from the credit-card companies will follow results from the nation's largest banks, some of which issue credit cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks. The banks' results can sometimes offer a look at what might be in store for the credit-card companies.Mizuho payments analyst Thomas McCrohan said results from JPMorgan (JPM), which showed a pickup in credit card sales volumes, had ""positive implications"" for Visa.In a separate note, he also said that Citigroup's results could be viewed as ""in line to slightly positive for Mastercard given it is Citigroup's primary card network.""He added that ""these results also have implications for Visa since Citigroup is the issuing bank for the Costco (COST) portfolio, which Visa recently won.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Goldman Sachs Weighs In On Cryptocurrencies As Trading Lags PeersInvestment Pros Like These U.S. Stocks In 2018Breakout Watch: This 2015 IPO Is Testing A New Buy Zone

196,MA,"Having a growth strategy has paid off well for American Century All Cap Growth Fund (TWGTX) since the start of the 2009 bull market. And the fund's early purchase of its largest holding Alphabet (GOOGL) in early 2009 might have something to do with it beating the S&P 500 since then.X The $1.2 billion fund is up 4.09% this year through Feb. 22, ahead of S&P 500's return of 1.41% and its large-growth Morningstar category's 4.12%. The fund also has returned a stellar 20.75% in the past year, plus average annual returns of 10.42% and 14.22% in the past three and five years, beating the S&P 500 for the one-year, but slightly lagging it for the other periods.The fund recently changed managers. Gregory Woodhams, senior vice president and co-chief investment officer of American  Century's global growth equity, and Joe Reiland, vice president and portfolio manager, took over the fund's management as of Feb. 16. Before that, Michael Orndorff and Marcus Scott comanaged the fund for the past nine and six years, respectively.American Century All Cap Growth strives to invest in companies that show continuous accelerating earnings growth and a strong price momentum. While it can invest in companies of all sizes, over 70% of its holdings fall into the large-cap category, 25% comprise midcap stocks, with the remaining allocation in small caps. It primarily invests in U.S. stocks, but had a less-than-5% allocation to foreign equities as of Dec. 31.Last year, the fund benefited from the risk-on rally that began shortly after Donald Trump won the election in November 2016. Growth stocks were lifted on expectations of President Trump's stimulus package for individuals and businesses, a solid earnings season and overall economic strength.Stock selection played a large role in the fund's performance in 2017, as much on the positive as the negative side. Its top-10 holdings represent 37% of the fund and include names such as Alphabet, IBD Leaderboard member Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Mastercard (MA) and FedEx (FDX). These stocks soared between 33% and 53% last year.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersAmong the fund's largest sectors are technology at 30% of the portfolio, consumer cyclical 17%, health care 15% and financials 12%. With technology being the top performing sector, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple's positions have each grown to represent 7%, 5% and 4.4% of the fund.LogMeIn (LOGM) is a midcap internet service company that provides a cloud-based platform for online meetings, customer support, remote access and password security. Its earnings and revenue skyrocketed between 94% and 216% the past four quarters. Earnings per share jumped 110% last year and analysts estimate a 29% increase this year. The maker of GoToMeeting, OpenVoice and join.me also recently announced it will acquire cloud-based phone system provider Jive Communications and Unified Communications. Shares of LogMeIn advanced 20% last year. The stock is 13% off its Feb. 15 all-time high, having sliced through its 50-day moving average after the company reported 94% gain in earnings that beat expectations, but was light on revenue.Within the software space, creative design program maker Adobe Systems (ADBE) and customer relationship management firm Salesforce.com (CRM) also did well, each jumping 70.2% and 49.3% last year, and 15.3% and 12% year to date. Adobe, which successfully transitioned to cloud-based recurring subscription services recently announced that its longtime CFO Mark Garrett will be retiring. The maker of Photoshop and Acrobat plans to grow its e-commerce business. It's also on IBD's Leaderboard.Among banks, which are expected to benefit from rising interest rates, the fund holds Zions Bancorp (ZION) and SVB Financial (SIVB)). The holding company for Zion Bank, which operates via 436 branches in 11 Western and Southwestern states reported double-digit earnings growth in the past six quarters. Its stock is up 8% so far in 2018 after advancing 19% last year.The holding company for Silicon Valley Bank SVB Financial reported accelerating earnings and sales growth in the last five quarters. In the most recent quarter, earnings per share rose 53% on revenue growth of 32%. The stock rose 36% in 2017 and 5% this year.Among key detractors to American Century All Cap's performance in 2017 were biotech stocks such as Shire (SHPG), where despite reporting good results, ""investor concerns over competitive threats to the company's hemophilia franchise weighed on the shares,"" notes the latest fund annual report. Shire's stock fell 6.3% last year.Natural gas producer Range Resources (RRC) also was a drag on performance due to unfavorable weather conditions and gas prices.

206,MA,"Many stock mutual fund managers are basking in the warm glow of 2017's hot performance numbers for the broad market. The S&P 500 index rose 1.11% in December, lifting the fourth quarter's gain to 6.64% and capping a 21.83% year. The Dow Jones industrials surged 28.11% for the year, on the way to topping 25,000 for the first time ever on Thursday.X The S&P 500 is already up another 2.63% so far this year. The Dow is up 2.20%.U.S. diversified stock mutual funds edged up 0.73% on average in December to extend their gains in Q4 to 5.13% and in 2017 to 18.26%, according to Lipper Inc. World equity funds, powered in part by a weaker dollar, turned in gains of 2% in December, 4.92% in Q4 and 28.52% last year.General domestic taxable bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.57% on top of a 0.39% December move. They finished the year up 4.86%.But fund managers and investment strategists have also turned their eyes to 2018, where many expect more-modest gains overall.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersTop Mutual Funds In Q4Mutual Fund Category PerformanceWhy Buffalo Discovery Fund Keeps OutperformingWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Fund managers and strategists expect to rely more on foreign stocks and on value equities for their gains. Still, fund managers certainly have not abandoned U.S. equities totally, having 2018 bets on stocks like First Solar (FSLR), part of the S&P 500; Amazon (AMZN), a key piece of the Nasdaq Composite; and Boeing (BA), the best performing Dow Jones industrial average stock in 2017.One reason fund managers and strategists expect to search further afield overall for big returns in 2018: history. Since 1963, the S&P 500 has rallied more than 15% annually in 19 years. And each time it did that, in the following year the broad market's gains averaged just 7.5%.Two more reasons for the expected rotation into more foreign stocks and value equities: Cheaper valuations for many foreign equities give them more room to run in '18, and forecasts for faster economic growth abroad.""We're in a synchronous growth pattern,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist for Nuveen Asset Management and manager or co-manager of seven of its stock mutual funds with a combined $1.7 billion in assets. ""It's rare that we have growth in the U.S. as well as in key markets abroad. In this sort of economic environment, value (stocks) overall should beat growth (stocks).""Stocks should also continue to get a tailwind from the Federal Reserve's slow tempo of interest rate hikes. ""The slow pace is reassuring to investors,"" said Allen Bond, a manager of $6.6 billion Jensen Quality Growth Fund (JENSX), which outperformed the S&P 500 in 2017 as well as the past three and 10 years, and just fell short over the past five years.One key reason why Doll expects value to outperform is that corporate earnings have been on a roll and should remain that way. That's indicative of a rising economic tide that lifts stocks of all stripes, including modestly priced value-oriented ones, Doll said. Further, as the strengthening economy lifts earnings of both types of stocks, investors are likely to flock to value stocks, which are more attractively priced than growth stocks.""Inflation and interest rates have been behaving themselves and letting earnings growth go to the bottom line,"" he added.Doll added that U.S. tax reform should boost corporate earnings. Also, both corporate CEO and consumer confidence is up. And demand is strong for many goods and services, especially in the technology, health care and certain consumer areas.IBD'S TAKE: To see how tax reform impacts individuals like you, check out this IBD report.""Much of the consumer area has been doing OK, with capital spending improving before the tax bill, (enactment of which) will accentuate capital spending,"" Doll said. ""That should be good for industrials and many tech stocks.""Within the tech space, Doll likes software companies and credit card companies, which use software to facilitate digital payments for transactions. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) were among the top four holdings of Doll's largest portfolio, $563.8 million Nuveen Large Cap Core (NLCIX), as of Nov. 30.Among health care stocks, ""I would highlight diversified biotech companies and managed care providers,"" he said. ""I'm less interested in pharmaceuticals and some equipment companies. . . . We prefer diversified biotech to pharma as they have faster growth and similar valuation characteristics.""Nuveen Large Cap Core also held cloud computing services provider Red Hat (RHT). Red Hat enables a client's noncloud enterprise software to jibe with cloud infrastructure like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was a third holding. UnitedHealth benefits from membership growth, driven by rising employment and by increased use of managed care by the U.S. government to control costs. The firm also benefits from its use of data analytics.Additional holdings included First Solar, Amazon and Boeing. Solar energy company First Solar was new to the fund in November. It posted Q3 results on Oct. 27 that crushed analysts' expectations. After four quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 0% and 64% the past two stanzas. Hot as a solar flare in 2017, the stock gained 110.41%.Trading around 125, First Solar is extended. It has a very strong IBD Composite Rating of 98. IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. Its IBD SMR Rating is A. That means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Amazon soared nearly 56% last year. The e-commerce leader slid on Dec. 29 amid reports that President Trump had called for Amazon — also a leader in cloud services — to pay the U.S. Postal Service higher fees for package deliveries. Separately, the FAANG stock says it shipped more than 5 billion items in '17 through its Prime program, for which customers pay $99 a year.Amazon is near a buy point. Shares broke out Thursday but closed just below the flat base's buy point. Now the stock is back above its proper entry of 1,213.51.And aerospace and defense titan Boeing gapped up more than 2% on Dec. 12 after saying it would raise its dividend 20%, to $1.71 a share, up from $1.42, giving shares a 2.3% dividend yield. Boeing also increased its stock buyback program.In 2018, Dow-component Boeing is up 4.19%.In the tech sector, Jensen's Bond likes stocks that benefit from the ongoing transition to cloud computing. He likes companies that help themselves by making the switch or that make money by helping others shift to the cloud.Microsoft (MSFT) is a dual beneficiary, he says. Oracle (ORCL) enables customers to use on-premises enterprise software or to shift to cloud computing. ""They are a go-to database software provider for companies with extremely sensitive information that can't have things go wrong,"" Bond said.He also likes Alphabet (GOOGL). ""GOOGL is more of a player in the cloud infrastructure space,"" he said. ""If a customer needs access to a cloud structure, they sell that. But most of their business is from their core advertising model, resulting from their ubiquitous position in online search and online ad buying.""Bond also likes specific themes in health care. One such theme is growing affluence in emerging markets. That enables patients to be able to afford better health care.""When a health care system starts to grow and develop in an emerging market, needles and syringes are some of the first things they need to make that work,"" he said. As a result, he likes Becton, Dickinson & Co. (BDX), a leading maker of needles and syringes.The company acquired CareFusion, a maker of infusion pumps (which deliver medical liquids over time), in 2015.And last month Becton Dickinson said it and C.R. Bard had agreed to divest two product lines to win regulatory approval for their merger. Bard makes catheters and biopsy devices.Bond also likes Stryker (SYK), whose orthopedic implants, surgical tools and medical devices enable it to capitalize on aging populations in the U.S., Europe and Japan.The $174 million Kinetics Internet Fund (WWWFX) was one of the top performing U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in 2017, posting a 57.43% gain, according to Morningstar Direct.The fund had 36 holdings as of Sept. 30, including a 12% stake in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC). The cryptocurrency, which is volatile, rose about 1,166% last year. ""We're not afraid to be wrong,"" said co-manager Peter Doyle. ""A lot of people won't participate in the upside of 'consensus money' and cryptocurrencies because they need outside reinforcement. We don't say cryptocurrencies can't fail. But we control our risk by controlling the size of our position.""Doyle said the fund's stake is ""much higher"" than what it has formally disclosed, due to appreciation.For investment opportunities in general, the fund is looking beyond many popular large caps that enjoyed large run-ups in 2017 and other recent years. Their high valuations leave them insufficient room to post additional gains, said co-manager James Davolos.For one thing, the fund holds stock in nine companies in which noted investor and Liberty Global (LBTYK) chairman John Malone holds large blocks of shares, including Liberty Media (LSXMK), Liberty Broadband (LBRDK) and Liberty Global. ""If you've trusted John Malone (by owning shares in his companies) over the years, almost without exception you've done well,"" Doyle said.Kinetics Internet also likes Live Nation Entertainment (LYV). The company helps popular music performers earn a living through live performances and through concession sales, corporate sponsorships and advertising, Doyle said.The fund managers also like Copart (CPRT), which conducts salvaged vehicle auctions. ""This company keeps gaining market share by providing value to both buyers and sellers of vehicles by providing price transparency and lower transaction costs,"" Davolos said.S&P 500 index funds led all U.S. diversified categories in Q4 with an average gain of 6.76% after tacking on 1.28% in December.World equity funds trailed U.S. diversified stock funds in Q4, averaging a 4.92% advance after a 2% December return. India region funds paced all foreign stock fund categories by soaring 12.64% in Q4, helped by a 4.77% December romp.Global natural resources funds beat other major sectors by posting a 6.45% Q4 gain, aided by a 4.96% December geyser. That gave them an 8.49% return for the year. But commodities base metals funds did even better with gains of 7.68% in December, 10.97% in Q4 and 28.69% for the year.Consumer services funds added 2.52% in December, which lifted its gains to 8.42% in Q4 and 18.23% in 2017.Loan participation funds were tops in Q4 among general domestic taxable bond categories, rising 1%. Their December gain was 0.35%.Among world income funds, emerging markets hard currency funds enjoyed the best Q4, gaining 0.73%, a shade better than their December return.Municipal bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.44% after returning 0.81% in December.RELATED:Stock To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top FundsHow Did Mutual Funds Perform In 2017?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

207,MA,"Fidelity Investments' plan is that shareholders of Growth Discovery Fund (FDSVX) will find their usual satisfaction in the first five or so months of the year. In that span, Asher Anolic will temporarily take the helm from marquee manager Jason Weiner, who will spend that period away from the fund on a leave of absence, traveling with his family and pursuing educational opportunities.X Anolic will be the acting manager not only of the $1.7 billion Growth Discovery but also of its advisor-sold twin, $3.1 billion Advisor Equity Growth (FAEGX).For Anolic, the challenge is weighty. Weiner, who has steered the funds since February 2007 and early November of 2006 respectively, has led them to rarefied success.The funds outperformed the broad market in the form of the S&P 500 in the latest calendar year, 2017, as well as the three and five years ended Dec. 31. If the funds keep up that pace and add outperformance over the past 10 years, they will earn inclusion as IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards winners. Only 4% of U.S. diversified stock mutual funds with at least $100 million in assets pulled off that feat by the end of 2016.Weiner — with Anolic as co-manager since July 1 — achieved that multiperiod outperformance with portfolios featuring leading stocks like Five Below (FIVE), Red Hat (RHT) and Alibaba Group (BABA), as well as household names like Facebook (FB)  and Amazon.com (AMZN), two of the FANG stocks.Shortly before 48-year-old Weiner began his sabbatical, he and 39-year-old Anolic talked with IBD from their Boston offices about their managerial juggling act and how their investment styles overlap and how they differ.IBD: Jason, has your management style changed since Asher joined you as co-manager?Weiner: Absolutely, yes. Any time you take on a partner, you talk about what you think, what your partner thinks. Ash came with experience in health care and staples, and with a much sharper quantitative investment focus. No two people have the same skill set. So one plus one equals more than two.IBD: Asher, have you changed?Anolic: With my background in staples and health care and financials, I never had a chance to encounter some of the big open-ended growth stories that Jason has done an excellent job figuring out. Those companies can have huge addressable markets, which become multiples of what people think they are today.In the past, I would have shied away from those because I was afraid of getting caught in something that I wasn't able to visualize where it could go. Jason's been great helping me out there.IBD: Since before the 2016 elections, the fund has swung toward cyclical stocks, then growth stocks, then back to cyclicals. How has that worked for the fund?Weiner: In 2016 growth didn't perform well and we didn't get paid for owning them. We got it all back in 2017 for the first three-quarters of the year. In the last quarter those leadership names took a breather. But I think it's healthy because we don't want a bubble.We stuck with growth. Now our job is to look forward into 2018 and figure out how to extend the process. No matter what the short-term gyrations are, how do we stick with names that are growing earnings and adding value?IBD: What's been the biggest change in the market during your career, Jason?Weiner: When I started at Fidelity in 1991, I was a junior analyst picking small-cap names. There was an inherent advantage because small companies were where you found little trees that grew into big trees.Today, it's completely the opposite. The only companies growing fast are the biggest companies in the world, companies with market caps of $500 billion. That's really driven by internet economics. This is very different, very unique.IBD: And you still look for the best growth opportunities, with an overlay of valuation sensitivity?Weiner: That hasn't changed. We look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with the potential for price-to-earnings (P/E) expansion, while avoiding names that have unreasonably high valuations or deteriorating business fundamentals.IBD: Asher, what changes will you make while Jason is out?Anolic: Aside from the fact that I don't love the decor (which drew laughter from both Anolic and Weiner), I expect changes in less than a quarter of the holdings. Jason has constructed the portfolio with a two-year horizon. We've tested lots of what-if scenarios. Nothing should surprise us. If something does crop up out of left field, I will adjust. But the fundamental approach will not change.IBD: Does Facebook still meet your valuation check box?Weiner: It's valuation is a lot higher than a year ago. It occurred because they grew fast. Earnings went up. They're touching 1 billion people a day with News Feed, their main product. You can sell a lot of advertising when you touch over 1 billion people a day.I still think they will improve their ad targeting. So fundamentals are intact. Can I find better value elsewhere (in another stock)? That search goes on every day. After the big move in these (internet) names in the last year, that conversation is a little more intense.IBD: With Amazon, you're comfortable that their spending will pay off within a reasonable period?Weiner: If you say retail as we knew it is dead and the retail of tomorrow is being invented as we speak, which companies are at the forefront? It is Alibaba and Amazon.We like to take a company's profit-and-loss statement and break down the business units. For Amazon, it's domestic retail and international retail and Amazon Web Services. How is each performing? What are their opportunities? With the investments they make, what will future earnings be like?IBD: Asher, what would you add?Anolic: AWS is cost intensive, more than the rest of Amazon. But it has taken a ton of market share, and has good margins and good cash flow. It's at the forefront of a major technological shift.IBD: Any more thoughts about Alibaba?Weiner: I look at Amazon and Alibaba as a pair. You want to distill the thoughts of Alibaba's Jack Ma (founder and executive chairman) and Amazon's Jeffrey Bezos (founder, chairman and CEO)? Looking at them together is helpful to understanding what those visionaries are doing. Just one part of that is inventing a new world of retail.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news and analysis of Chinese stocks, visit IBD's special section about Chinese stocks to buy and watch.IBD: Does Five Below defy the problems of many brick-and-mortar retailers by discounting and by focusing on a teen audience?Weiner: It's too small to worry about, but I will tell you this: It's like Dollar Tree (DLTR) plus a treasure-hunt thing. Mom can bring her kids, who go to the $5 basketballs while mom goes to the $5 makeup aisle. I remember the CEO saying once, ""This is the only store where you can bring your kids and not have any fears.""IBD: Red Hat is the top provider of open-source Linux software for corporate data centers. Is that like being the top buggy-whip maker?Anolic: With the move to the cloud, people are worried about Red Hat's growth prospects. If you have a Linux operating system for several servers, but then you move a lot of that data to AWS or Google Cloud or Microsoft (Azure), you don't need all of those servers or that operating system.But Red Hat's core Linux business is still fantastic. Much in the cloud runs on Linux. And Red Hat is reinventing its business. They have a new product that can write programs on top of the Red Hat system and port them to different clouds. It gives CIOs the flexibility of not getting locked in to one cloud vendor. This gives some visibility to how Red Hat looks in a cloud environment. We're going to keep monitoring it. It's a fascinating solution.IBD: What business hasn't been totally disrupted, but could be eventually?Weiner: Digital payments. Payments in general have entrenched players like Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) and card-issuing banks like Citi (C) and JPMorgan (JPM) and merchant acquirers like First Data (FDC) and Global Payments (GPN). That system has been built over decades.But PayPal has given us a taste of disruption. We've all used PayPal at checkout. Can they take that beachhead and expand into the payment space? They've already got Venmo in people-to-people payments. And they own Braintree, which (provides mobile and web payments acceptance and processing for) merchants. (The payments space) feels ripe for disruption.IBD: Why do you like Copart (CPRT)?Weiner: It's a duopoly (with KAR Auction Services (KAR)), a great business. Hurricane Irma rolls through (the Caribbean and) Florida, Harvey hits Houston, and 100,000 cars get wrecked. They get disposed of through auto auctions. Copart is family run, has super profitability and super acquisitions. When cars get totaled, sometimes the scrap value is higher than a resale value.IBD: Asher, you're continuing to run $784 million Select Pharmaceuticals (FPHAX). What's the biggest change in joining Jason at the helm of Growth Discovery?Anolic: Jason has been helpful in teaching and generous with his time. So I'm totally up to speed on what is needed. And we worked together before I was named co-manager, so I was familiar with how he runs money.The biggest change is moving from one sector to the whole market. Six months of partnering doesn't teach you everything that someone running for 20-plus years has learned. But the skill set I've built allows me to understand day-to-day market moves and how to learn as I go.IBD: Jason, was Asher's apprenticeship long enough?Weiner: Asher is an experienced investor. And the way the fund (Growth Discovery) is built, 70% of its assets are in the top 40 names, so Asher only has to learn about 40 names to understand nearly three-quarters of the portfolio. Also, Asher already knew some names from his work on other mutual funds. And we have a huge amount of research support.IBD: Jason, will you be able to hit the ground running when you return in May or so?Weiner: I think I'll be raring to go. I'll have had a nice break, but it will be nice to get back to business.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltHot Fidelity Fund Owns Stocks Like Tencent That Jumped Friday

214,MA,"A good economy had the odd effect of sinking the S&P 500 on Monday, amid concerns about higher prices and borrowing costs as central banks remove the crutches intended to support rebounds in the U.S. and abroad.X But for the individual companies in the S&P 500 index, quarterly results — that more granular measure of customer attitudes and one of the main drivers of any stock — are surpassing Wall Street forecasts at a particularly high rate, one not seen since the previous decade.The above-the-bar results have been helped, as ever, by tech, health care and financials, including Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC) UnitedHealth (UNH) and Mastercard (MA). But companies like DowDuPont (DWDP) and Eastman Chemical (EMN) have led suppliers of materials higher. Industrials — minus long-ailing General Electric (GE) — also look solid after a long drought.Among the 322 S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far this earnings season, 78% topped Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data released Thursday. Eighty percent beat estimates for revenue.That's the best rate of above-estimate earnings since the third quarter of 2009, according to Thompson Reuters. For sales, it's the best since at least 2002.S&P 500 earnings are currently on track to deliver a 14.7% gain, with revenue up a robust 8%. That assumes that the remaining S&P 500 companies due to report will meet estimates.Analysts also appear optimistic about first-quarter earnings, even as the prospect of higher wages touches off investor fears of inflation, and economic growth stirs anxieties that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in raising interest rates to keep that growth honest.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Still, the global recovery has brought new demand for technology, energy and infrastructure. And a rebound in oil prices has boosted demand for equipment of all kinds, lifting industrials and, in turn, demand for the suppliers of chemical materials.In the stock market today, the S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq composite sold off yet again as Treasury yields hit multiyear highs. Stocks rallied strongly to start 2018 in part on expectations for strong, broad earnings growth.Within Thomson Reuters' Materials sector, which includes companies like DowDuPont and Eastman, 94% of companies have beat on earnings for the most recent quarter — the highest percentage of all 11 industry sectors measured by the firm. Eighty-one percent of companies in the Materials segment have beat on revenue.Even as the troubles deepen at General Electric, which has weighed on growth in the industrial sector as it tries to focus more on aviation, power and health care — that segment overall has remained solid. Seventy-four percent have beat on earnings, 81% on revenue.GE earnings per share slid 41% in the fourth quarter. It faces an SEC investigation, and one analyst said the company could be removed from the Dow.Within the technology sector, 85% of technology companies have beaten earnings estimates, led by companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), CA (CA), Intel (INTC) and Xilinx (XLNX). Ninety percent beat on revenue, amid strong growth in semiconductors and semiconductor equipment.More tech companies are also bringing in bigger businesses as consumers.""You're seeing a transition from consumer-based to business-based, which is a big driver,"" Aurelio said. ""So you're seeing things like data-center growth.""In the Consumer-Discretionary category, where around three quarters of companies have produced above-the-bar results, Amazon (AMZN) last week turned out earnings far ahead of analyst expectations, helped by the GOP's new tax law and the broader migration to e-commerce and smart devices.""Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,"" CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement at that time. ""We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down.""Earnings from 89% of companies in Thomson Reuters' Health Care segment — which includes biotech, pharmaceuticals and health care services — came in above analyst views; 91% beat on revenue.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, was among them. But the companies that surpassed earnings estimates by the widest margin were pharma distributor Cardinal Health (CAH), ResMed (RMD) and Align Technology (ALGN), the maker of Invisalign dental braces.Those earnings follow a 2017 that BMO analyst Matt Borsch (who follows managed care companies, hospitals and other care providers) characterized as mediocre, in terms of volume — or the number of inpatient admissions, outpatient procedures, and doctor and emergency-room visits.But more of that volume, he said, has been packed into the end of the fourth quarter, as more people meet their deductible on their high-deductible plans, which have become increasingly common.""When you have the high-deductible health plans, you generally have a pretty strong dynamic of people, on average, increasing their utilization significantly after they've met the deductible, and therefore that is why you see that more late in the year,"" he said.The companies who have reported so far, largely, aren't benefiting from low expectations, either. Expectations have remained relatively similar for earnings this quarter compared with quarters past and were a tad higher for revenue, Aurelio said.As investors make their way through fourth-quarter results and the market's volatility, the outlook for the first quarter remains not so bad.""Typically as you get closer to the next earnings season, the expectations decrease,"" Aurelio said. ""So we'd see the growth rate for Q1 normally drop, and it's been going up.""At the beginning of the year, he said, expectations were for 12.2% earnings growth in the first quarter. On Thursday, growth expectations were for 17.8%. That's despite lowered guidance from Apple (AAPL) and many iPhone chip suppliers.""So that's a pretty bullish signal,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Will Stocks Repeat The 2011 Bear Sell-Off?Big Wage Gain Sinks Stocks, Bonds: 3 Reasons To Doubt The DataDid Congress, Trump Just Crush The Stock Market Rebound?Will Brokerages Receive Fresh Lift From Tax Reform, Rate Hikes?ObamaCare Exchange Enrollment Shows Surprise Gain, Despite Trump's Attacks

221,MA,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose slightly early Tuesday morning, as markets prepare for the first trading day of 2018. For the new year, here are five leading stocks that just formed flat bases at the very end of 2017: Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Mastercard (MA), Splunk (SPLK), RingCentral (RNG).X Facebook and Mastercard are members of the IBD 50 list. Facebook boasts a best-possible 99 Composite Rating while Mastercard has a 98. Splunk (96) and RingCentral (95) also have 95+ Composite Ratings. That's important, because all-time stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their runs.Amazon.com, for its part, has a 78 Composite Rating, reflecting its uneven profits.S&P 500 futures climbed 0.2% vs. fair value. Dow futures rose 0.2%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.1% above fair value. Bitcoin futures retreated.Amazon, like all the stocks on this list has a five-week consolidation, the minimum for a flat base. It's really a base-on-base formation above an October base. The e-commerce giant has a buy point of 1,213.51. Shares closed Friday at 1,169.47.Amazon appears to have been a big standout in the best holiday shopping season in years. The stock's Relative Strength line is near record highs. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. Ideally an RS line should lead or confirm a breakout by at least hitting a short-term highOn the downside, Amazon is in a late-stage base. Late-stage bases can work, but are more apt to fail than first- or second-stage bases.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon, Facebook and Splunk are all on Leaderboard, IBD's premium service offering annotated charts of a handful of stocks, usually growth names at or near buy range. Take a free Leaderboard trial today.Facebook rose 53% in 2017. But its standout performance peaked at the end of July and the RS line has trended slightly lower since Nov. 1. The stock hasn't made much headway since late July either, while the broader averages continue to add to gains.Facebook, which closed Friday at 176.46, technically is still within range of an older 175.59 buy point from an October breakout, but hasn't made much progress since then and is currently below its 50-day line.Facebook has now created a new flat base with a 184.35 entry. That may be what investors should focus on now.Facebook and Amazon are both members of the FANG group of stocks. Including AppleAAPL, the FANG+ stocks are all at key technical levels right now.Mastercard's stock gradually outperformed the S&P 500 index for most of 2017, consolidating since late November. The RS line is modestly below record highs. Payment stocks, from traditional peers like Visa (V) to PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), were big winners in 2017.Mastercard tumbled through its 50-day line in early December, but was back above that key support within a few days. Since then it's been holding just above that moving average, closing Friday at 151.36. The buy point is 154.75.The data analytics firm began forming its latest consolidation shortly after gapping higher on strong earnings released Nov. 20. The stock's RS line is near record highs.Splunk ended 2017 at 82.81. The buy point is 84.98.The cloud-based business communications software maker has found support at its 50-day moving average several times in the past few months.RingCentral has a 50.05 buy point. Shares closed Friday at 48.40, with its RS line holding near highs as well.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Seven Investing Tips For 2018 2018 Stock Market Forecast: Why You Should Expect Smaller GainsWhy This Profitable New IPO Should Be In Your InboxNew Highs: This IBD 50 Leader Broke Out Into Buy RangeArtificial Intelligence Software To Grow Nearly 30 Times By 2025

223,MA,"Square (SQ) is more likely to acquire software assets rather than be sold to credit card networks Visa (V) or Mastercard (MA), one analyst said in a note to clients Monday.X Cowen's George Mihalos initiated coverage on the payment processor with a rating of ""market perform"" due to valuation. Mihalos also gives Square a price target of 36.""We believe Square's growth prospects are reflected in the current stock price and advise investors to wait for a more attractive entry point,"" Mihalos said.""(One) view discussed in media reports is that one of the networks might acquire Square. We view this as highly unlikely,"" said Mihalos. ""The networks' main focus is converting cash to card — Visa and Mastercard win regardless of what entity issues the cards and who processes the payments.""Shares in Square rose a fraction to 38.30 on the stock market today. Square has shot up 180% in 2017, though it's retreated from an all-time high of 49 set on Nov. 24.San Francisco-based Square makes credit card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets. Square has expanded into providing financing and bank loans to small businesses.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Square itself has made several smaller acquisitions, including Caviar in 2014, Killi Technology in 2015 and Main Line Delivery in 2016.""On the software side, we believe it makes sense for Square to continue to move away from its horizontal strategy and move more toward vertical-specific software solutions (e-commerce, restaurants),"" added the Cowen analyst.Square Cash app users can now buy and sell Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency.RELATED:Apple, FANG Stocks Look Strong, But Face 2018 Risks: AnalystBitcoin Futures Soar In Debut; These Crypto Stock Plays JumpBiotech Stocks Soar On Trial Data At Hematology ConferenceChart-Reading Basics: How To Find The Correct Buy Point For Leading StocksIs The Holy Grail Of Digital Payments Just One Click Away?

The stock had been making its way through a flat base with a 97.39 buy point. Signet Jewelers (SIG), which missed revenue views earlier this month and slashed its full-year earnings guidance, slid 1.3%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Jewelry was once seen as immune to the effects of e-commerce as shoppers were viewed as needing to see the merchandise first hand before dropping hundreds or thousands of dollars on it.But that hasn't stopped Tiffany from trying new approaches as consumers' habits shift.Tiffany opened a cafe this month inside its flagship 5th Avenue store in Manhattan, and last month released an ""Everyday Objects"" line of jewelry, which include items that resemble a can, dominoes, and a ruler.And early this year, launched the Tiffany HardWear collection with pop star Lady Gaga to draw more millennials.

228,MA,"Boeing (BA) announced late Monday a $18 billion repurchase program and a 20% dividend hike to $1.71, joining other big companies like Bank of America (BAC), Home Depot (HD) and Mastercard (MA) returning more capital to shareholders.X The new buyback replaces an existing $14 billion program, under which Boeing had repurchased $9.2 billion in shares. The share repurchases are expected over the next 24-30 months. The new dividend will be payable March 2.""To support our balanced cash deployment strategy, our team remains focused on improving operating performance as we deliver on our substantial order backlog and work to capture a larger share of the growing aerospace market,"" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement.Boeing investors have already enjoyed a massive windfall this year, as the aerospace giant's stock has led all Dow Jones industrial average components with an 82% jump, far better than No. 2 performer Caterpillar (CAT) with its 55% gain.In addition to expectations that GOP tax-cut plans will boost payouts and buybacks, hopes for bigger shareholder returns had already been running high at Boeing as improving operations have grown the outlook for cash flows.In its third-quarter report in October, management boosted Boeing's overall 2017 cash flow guidance to $12.5 billion from $12.25 billion, led by improved performance.Shares rallied 1.1% late, after closing down 1% at 283.16 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.Boeing is the latest company to deliver fatter returns to investors.Last week, Bank of America announced it would be buying back an additional $5 billion worth of shares on top of its earlier plan to buy back $12 billion in shares and Mastercard said it would buy back up to up to $4 billion in class A shares.Home Depot approved its own $15 billion share buyback last week, and Honeywell (HON) set a new $8 billion repurchase program.RELATED:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

231,MA,"Bank of America (BAC) on Tuesday said it would buy back an extra $5 billion in stock, after Mastercard (MA) late Monday announced new share repurchases and raised its dividend.X Bank of America's move represents the latest good news for shareholders of big banks. Bank stocks rallied on Monday after the Senate this weekend passed its tax reform bill. That bill now needs to be meshed together with a bill that cleared the House. Final passage would clear the path for potentially greater shareholder payouts in the future.Bank of America's decision comes less than six months after announcing that it would buy back $12 billion in common shares from July 1 through June 30 of next year. The additional share repurchases have the effect of squeezing up a company's earnings per share.The move, BofA said, will offset the increase in regulatory capital that resulted from an earlier issuance of common stock that came after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) in August exercised outstanding warrants to acquire 700 million Bank of America shares. The move made Berkshire Hathaway the largest shareholder of Bank of America.The extra distribution will also offset the increase in capital resulting from BofA's sale this year of its non-U.S. consumer credit card business.Buffett, in October, said he would hold onto BofA stock for a ""long, long, long time,"" citing turnaround efforts under CEO Brian Moynihan.Moynihan, in September, said their stock was ""a good buy and we'll continue to buy it until the cows come home.""Shares fell 0.45% to 28.93 in the stock market today. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lost 1.15% to 105.72.Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase both said Tuesday said that fourth-quarter trading revenue is running about 15% below a year earlier, roughly in line with Street estimates. They are the first big Wall Street firms to give a Q4 trading update.Citigroup (C) slid 0.7% to 76.54, just above a 76.24 buy point. Goldman Sachs (GS) retreated 0.9% to 248.33, still within a 247.17 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Bank stocks have run up sharply over the past several sessions on tax-cut hopes and rising bond yields.Mastercard late Monday Monday said its board had declared a quarterly cash dividend of 25 cents per share, up 14% from the previous one, paid on Feb. 9 to shareholders of record as of Jan. 9.The credit-card giant's board will also authorized buying back up to $4 billion common shares. The repurchase program kicks in after Mastercard completes a previously announced $4 billion buyback plan. There's about $1.5 billion left under that program.Mastercard rose 1.2% on Tuesday, while rival Visa (V) gained 1.1%. Mastercard and Visa remain below their 50-day moving averages after tumbling through that key support on Monday.RELATED:Two More Banks Take A Stab At BreakoutsTrump Deutsche Bank Records Said To Be Subpoenaed by MuellerBanks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And Analysis

Volume was about average. You want to see at least 40%-50% above-normal trade when a stock breaks out. Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which tracks the stock vs. the S&P 500 index, was well below its Nov. 1 high. In fact, the RS line has not made much headway since late July.On Thursday, Facebook dipped 0.2% to 184.33, dropping just below its buy point.Obviously, Facebook could easily retake that entry area on Friday. But while its funamentals are stellar, investors do need to consider the stock's technical flaws.Adobe Systems is expected to report a 28% earnings per share gain to $1.15 for its next quarterly report.The stock hit a record 186.27 on Nov. 28, then tumbled as low as 165.68 by Dec. 5, undercutting its 50-day moving average.

234,MA,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages had their first down week of 2018, and it was their worst showing in two years. Apple (AAPL) guided lower, as many suspected. Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts. User growth cooled while users' time spent on Facebook fell, even before its latest big News Feed changes. But executives said on the conference call that ad rates are soaring, easing analysts' revenue fears. Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees. But if they are successful with their own firms, the thinking is that they would expand the services to corporate America. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers sold off. UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer and also a PBM, sank 6.7%. Drugstore-and-PBM CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET), lost 6.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume. But the real news was that eBay stunned Wall Street with the news that it will replace PayPal in 2020 and handle payments on its own site via a partnership with Adyen. The move will add a revenue stream. Shares of eBay soared nearly 14% on Thursday. PayPal lost 10.4% for the week, closing below a buy point and its 50-day line.The Chinese e-commerce giant's revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion, the best gain in at least 15 quarters and beating views. Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains.

""The strong U.S. economy was a contributing factor, but we also have to recognize that retailers who tried new strategies to engage holiday shoppers were the beneficiaries of this sales increase.""The retail sector has been showing strength recently, from long-ailing department-store titans like Macy's (M) to thriving discount chains like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Costco Wholesale (COST). As consumers continue to shop on mobile devices or online, brick-and-mortar stores continues to see closures, lower foot traffic and bankruptcies, including those of Sports Authority and Toys R Us.Shares of Amazon rose 0.7% on the stock market today, avoding their fifth straight modest loss.

245,MA,"Big-cap techs Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), PayPal (PYPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are all well-known S&P 500 index components ended last week within 2% of buy points. But that doesn't mean they're all equally enticing. Nvidia broke out on Monday to a new high, but even that chip leader has some question markets.XApple outpaced the S&P 500 from May 2016 to May 2017, but since then has been moving with the market, lagging in the past couple of weeks. Nvidia, PayPal, Adobe Systems and Salesforce.com have a more recent history of S&P 500 outperformance than Apple. Unlike Apple, they significantly outperformed the market in the last week as they built the right side of bases.Nvidia, PayPal, Adobe and Salesforce are all the No. 1 stocks in their industry groups. Then again, so is Apple.Nvidia, PayPal and Adobe are all members of the IBD 50. PayPal, Adobe and Salesforce.com are also on the IBD Big Cap 20.Apple closed Friday at 175, less than 1% from its 176.34 flat-base entry. Apple's relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been slumping for the past two months. Apple rallied 3.4% last week, but that wasn't much better than the S&P 500's 2.6% gain and even with the Nasdaq's 3.4% rise.Apple shares fell 0.4% to 174.35 on the stock market today, as the major averages rallied once again.The RS line is actually below where it was last May, when Apple was last significantly outperforming the S&P 500.Apple briefly broke out past the buy point on Dec. 18, but just barely and on volume that was only slightly above normal. The RS line wasn't close to confirming the breakout. Shares quickly fell back until finding support near their 50-day line.Apple could easily retake its buy point in the near future, and that move could work. But the odds of success are lower than with a truly leading stock.Nvidia jumped 3.1% to 222 Monday in strong volume, clearing a 218.77 cup-base entry.Nvidia's RS line is still lagging somewhat vs. its prior high. You'd like to see that RS line confirm the breakout.Keep in mind that Nvidia is a late-stage base. Late-stage bases are more likely to fail.Nvidia shot up 11.3% to 215.40 last week. It crossed its 50-day moving average in heavy trading on Wednesday, offering an entry point for aggressive investors.Chip stocks, which had struggled in late 2017, are roaring back. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index popped 5.8% last week, with several chip stocks moving back above their 50-day lines and carving the right side of bases. Chip stocks rose modestly overall Monday.Nvidia will have a presence at the CES 2018 tech show in Las Vegas this week. Nvidia on Sunday, in a pre-CES event, said it is teaming up with Uber on self-driving cars and expanded an artificial Volkswagen (VLKAY) partnership announced in mid-2017.Nvidia is already involved in several significant autonomous driving initiatives with various automakers and tech companies.IBD'S TAKE: Check out this Investor's Corner or on how the 50-day moving average or 10-week line offers buying opportunities.PayPal climbed 6.9% last week to 78.70, 1% below a 79.48 flat-base buy point. PayPal retook its 50-day line on Wednesday, but volume was only 11% above normal.PayPal rose 0.4% to 79.05.Leading stocks' performance is closely tied to their industry groups. And payment stocks are once again acting well. Square (SQ) moved back over its 50-day line Friday after a big retreat. Mastercard (MA) broke out past a buy point during the week, but on below-average volume.Adobe Systems advanced 5.8% last week to 185.34, less than 1% from a 186.37 flat-base entry. Adobe also reclaimed its 50-day line, but on below-average trade.Adobe dipped 0.2% to 185.04.Salesforce.com rose 5.7% to 108.10 last week. That's about 1% from a 109.29 entry in a flat base. Salesforce moved above its 50-day on Tuesday, but in average volume.Salesforce climbed 0.7% to 108.86, advancing to 109.14 intraday.One more observation on Nvidia, PayPal, Adobe and Salesforce. After running up so much last week, these stocks — and the overall market — are ripe for a pullback. That would not necessarily be a bad thing. Ideally, the stocks will ultimately break out in heavy volume, moving convincingly past the buy points to let their RS lines confirm the advance.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Alibaba Leads 5 Top Chinese Stocks Setting Up In BasesAdobe, PayPal Lead 5 Stocks Near Buy Points With Rising Earnings EstimatesStocks To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top Funds?The Top 16 China Stocks Surge, In A Fast-Moving Start To 2018

Last year, Ant Financial offered $18 a share in cash for Dallas-based MoneyGram, valuing the deal at $1.2 billion.""The geopolitical environment has changed considerably since we first announced the proposed transaction with Ant Financial nearly a year ago,"" MoneyGram Chief Executive Officer Alex Holmes said in the statement. ""Despite our best efforts to work cooperatively with the U.S. government, it has now become clear that CFIUS will not approve this merger.""Hangzhou, China-based Ant Financial, which is controlled by billionaire Jack Ma, has faced intense scrutiny for its proposed takeover of MoneyGram. It had resubmitted its merger deal to the panel several times, to no avail. Last spring, two U.S. House of Representatives members said the acquisition would give China access to the financial infrastructure of the U.S. The takeover would potentially allow ""malicious actors"" to obtain data on U.S. military personnel and their families who use the service, the lawmakers said.Chinese takeovers of American companies have prompted warnings from lawmakers about risks to national security. In September, President Donald Trump blocked the sale of Lattice Semiconductor Corp. to a buyer funded by a Chinese state-owned entity.Ant is a behemoth in China, providing services from wealth management and insurance to credit checks and consumer loans.Ant has disputed assertions that U.S. security would be compromised by the deal, citing its plans to keep MoneyGram's headquarters, management team and employees in Dallas.

Walt Disney (DIS) agreed to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox (FOXA) while also launching ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi."" The Federal Reserve raised rates while the FCC repealed net neutrality. Adobe Systems (ADBE) had strong earnings and guidance while Oracle (ORCL) missed on cloud revenue and cloud guidance.X The Nasdaq rose 1.4%, the Dow industrials 1.3% and the S&P 500 index 0.9%, all hitting record highs Friday as the GOP finalized its tax legislation with apparently enough support to pass. The Federal Reserve offered few surprises. Media stocks were in focus with Disney buying most of 21st Century Fox and the GOP-led FCC rolling back net neutrality.Bitcoin futures on the Cboe (CBOE) got off to a strong start, trading at their best levels on Friday amid typically volatile moves for the cryptocurrency. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said that Bitcoin played a very small role in the payments landscape, but that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" Her remarks add to the chorus of banking officials weighing in on the much-hyped cryptocurrency. They echo those of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and others who believe Bitcoin, which can gain or lose thousands of dollars in a day, can't be depended on to retain consistent value.CME Group (CME) will launch its Bitcoin futures on Dec. 18.The megadeal is a reality: Disney is buying Fox's entertainment assets for an enterprise value of $66.1 billion. It includes 20th Century Fox's movie and TV studios, National Geographic, FX, 22 Fox regional sports networks, and certain international assets. Disney CEO Bob Iger, who is extending his contract past 2019 to 2021 because of the merger, expressed enthusiasm about the deal's ability to boost the media giant's direct-to-consumer strategy and spread the ESPN brand internationally. It's not clear how regulators feel about the transaction, and Disney has promised a $2.5 billion breakup fee. Fox will keep its broadcast, news as well sports networks FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network. Disney and Fox shares soared.Separately, Disney should expect a windfall from its latest entrant to the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""The Last Jedi,"" which has already garnered largely positive reviews from critics and early viewers. Some analysts are expecting around $200 million from the film domestically. The film opened to the public on Thursday evening, with an estimated $45 million in ticket salesThe Republican-led Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal utilitylike oversight on internet service providers, delivering regulatory reversal sought by Comcast, AT&T, Verizon Communications and other ISPs. FCC chairman Ajit Pai  said the new rules will ""return regulatory parity to the internet economy."" He said some giant internet companies engage in anti-consumer behavior, while ISPs have been unfairly targeted by regulators. State regulators, Comcast and others said Congress should step in and pass internet legislation. One analyst put the chances of that at less than 30%.The Federal Reserve raised rates at its final meeting of the year, as expected. Policymakers also still expect to raise interest rates three times next year and didn't seem concerned about Trump tax cuts overheating the economy. Economic data backed a Goldilocks scenario. November retail sales were much stronger than expected, core consumer inflation cooled.Several biotechs popped on news stemming from the American Society of Hematology conference last week in Atlanta, while clinical trial data from others fell short. Bluebird Bio (BLUE) soared Monday after it reported improvement in patients using its LentiGlobin therapy to treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Fellow CAR-T player Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), though, retreated nearly 22% in two days despite strong data in patients with a form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Investors wanted more data, analysts said. On Tuesday, GlycoMimetics (GLYC) rocketed on data from its drug in acute myeloid leukemia, but Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) sank following its presentation of its sickle cell disease drug. Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) crashed on its hemophilia A drug data, suggesting a later approval than a rival treatment from Biomarin (BMRN). Cellectis (CLLS) launched Wednesday after Phase 1 trials showed promise for its experimental treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.RELATED:Biotech Stocks Soar On Trial Data At Hematology ConferenceOracle earnings rose 14% as revenue rose 6% to $9.6 billion, both beating views. Cloud revenue missed, with the 44% rise to $1.5 billion below views for $1.56 billion.

268,MA,"As carriers like United Airlines (UAL) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) engage in a price war, forecasts for unit revenue improvement in the fourth quarter now look too optimistic, according to JPMorgan analysts.XThe firm downgraded the two airlines, along with American Airlines (AAL), to neutral from over weight. JPMorgan also slashed price targets on United to 68 from 84, on American to 53 from 61, on Spirit to 37 from 45 and on Delta Air Lines (DAL) to 67 from 71.Bottom lines will take big hits too, and JPMorgan sees United earning just 64 cents a share in Q4 and Spirit earning just 34 cents a share, according to Benzinga. That compares to consensus EPS estimates of $1.34 for United and 57 cents for Spirit.Airlines have the ability to boost pricing domestically, but that isn't happening yet, JPMorgan noted, adding that higher fuel costs are also weighing on results.Shares of United closed down 2.4% at 59.80 on the stock market today. Spirit fell 3.3% to 33.69, American dipped 0.4% to 46.00, and Delta finished virtually unchanged at 48.25.Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines (LUV), which was upgraded to overweight and had its price target hiked to 66 from 60, rose 0.7% to 54.72, with JPMorgan saying the discount carrier has a better valuation and risk-reward profile than its rivals. Alaska Air (ALK) and JetBlue (JBLU) also received price target hikes.IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy to follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term.The major airlines have lowered Q3 unit revenue forecasts in recent weeks, with hurricanes Harvey and Irma adding to the downward pressure. On Tuesday, American cut its Q3 unit revenue outlook to flat to up 1%, compared to an earlier forecast of up 0.5%-2.5%.Last week, United acknowledged the impact the price war is having but vowed to continue offering low fares to compete in key markets, despite the short-term pain.""We don't like where the fare structures are right now. And we don't like the effect it has on short-term earnings,"" CFO Andrew Levy said at a conference. ""It is painful, difficult, but we're going to see it through.""United is also scaling back its ""basic economy"" fares, which were meant to compete with low-cost carriers head-on, in some markets.RELATED:United To Scale Back Basic Economy Amid Price War With Low-Cost RivalsDelta Cuts Revenue, Margin Targets As Airline Competition Heats UpAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

269,MA,"Boeing (BA) shares rose above a buy point to a record high Friday after the aerospace giant said earlier in the week that it will increase production of its 787 Dreamliner amid more upbeat long-term views of widebody jetliner demand.XAt a conference Wednesday, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said 787 output would rise to 14 a month in 2019 from the current pace of 12 per month, calling the move ""another signpost of the strength of the marketplace.""Boeing also now assumes it can spread the costs of the once-troubled 787 program over 1,400 planes, up from a prior view of 1,300.""We see a significant widebody replacement wave coming in early in the next decade as we have a number of widebodies globally that are going to hit the 25-year-point,"" Muilenburg said, according to FlightGlobal. ""Much of that demand will also be satisfied with 787s.""The remarks followed Tuesday's announcement from the prime minister of Malaysia, who said the country has a memorandum of agreement with Boeing to buy 10 787-9s.Meanwhile, the latest North Korean missile launch also may have helped various defense-minded companies.Shares of Boeing, which is the best-performing component this year on the Dow Jones industrial average, rose 1.5% to 249 on the stock market today, topping a 246.59 buy point after establishing a flat base less than two weeks ago. Boeing closed up 1.4% on Thursday.European archrival Airbus (EADSY) ascended 1.5% as it trades in its own flat base. Jet engine makers United Technologies (UTX) and General Electric (GE) fell a fraction and 1.4%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Flat bases, which require a minimum of five weeks, have been especially common in recent months with the market grinding higher. Learn more about this super growth stock pattern.The 787 program recently turned profitable, and a higher production rate would further boost cash flow at Boeing, raising prospects for bigger shareholder returns.In July, the company lifted its operating cash flow guidance for 2017 to $12.25 billion from $10.75 billion.Speeding up 787 production would also help offset the planned decline of current-generation 777 production as Boeing prepares assembly lines to start churning out the next-generation 777X.Muilenburg also signaled production of the 737 could further ramp up. The current plan calls for the pace to rise to 52 a month next year, then 57 a month in 2019. That's up from a planned pace of 47 a month this year. But the CEO said ""all of the market signals are saying we could go higher,"" according to the Seattle Times.RELATED:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsCan India Offset Slower Mideast Demand For Boeing, Airbus Widebodies?Boeing Raises Its 20-Year China Demand Outlook To $1.1 Trillion

United Airlines (UAL) also raised its unit revenue outlook and announced a $3 billion buyback.

276,MA,"Goldman Sachs (GS) unveiled a plan to boost revenue by $5 billion over the next three years, targeting growth across its operations as the trading business remains weak throughout the industry.XCOO Harvey Schwartz said at an industry conference Tuesday that trading in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) is ""still a pretty challenging environment"" and that the market so far in Q3 ""feels like the first and second quarter,"" according to the Financial Times.But he added that Goldman can lift annual FICC revenue by $1 billion, financing and lending revenue by $2 billion, investment management revenue by $1 billion, investment banking by $500 million, and equities client coverage by $500 million. The additional $5 billion at the top line should add $2.5 billion to pretax earnings.The breadth of the expected gains suggests Goldman may be looking beyond its vaunted trading desk to spark more growth, as persistent low market volatility continues to weigh on transactions.Earlier Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned that Q3 trading revenue would be down 20%.Dimon also dismissed Bitcoin as a fraud and vowed to immediately fire any trader who trades the cryptocurrency, which has soared in value in recent months.""It's worse than tulip bulbs. It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed,"" Dimon said, according to CNBC.Goldman shares closed up 2.2% on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average. JPMorgan rose 1.2%, Citigroup (C) climbed 1.6%, Morgan Stanley (MS) gained 1.31%, and Bank of America (BAC) added 2.5%, helped by another boost to bond yields.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.On Monday, Citigroup's CFO said markets revenue is on pace to come in roughly 15% lower than a year ago.JPMorgan and Citi had previously hinted at weak Q3 performance, and last month, Goldman CFO Martin Chavez said the low volatility seen in Q2 has spilled over into Q3, after reporting a 40% drop in Q2 FICC revenue.On its Q2 earnings call in July, Goldman said it ""didn't navigate the market as well as we aspire to or as well as we have in the past,"" echoing similar language on its Q1 call, when trading also suffered.The underperformance helped rival Morgan Stanley briefly surpass Goldman in market value, as its Q2 fixed-income trading revenue fell only 4%.RELATED:Bitcoin Dips Amid China's Currency Crackdown; Kin ICO ComingBig Banks Aren't Ignoring Bitcoin Anymore, Still WaryBofA, Goldman Beat But See Trading, Net Interest Income WeaknessFrustrated JPMorgan CEO Unleashes This Tirade On U.S. 'Stupidity'

277,MA,"The world's largest auto market and the second-largest economy, China, said it will eventually ban the sale of fossil-fuel cars, boosting shares of Tesla (TSLA) and those of other companies that provide key materials for electric vehicles.XStocks related to the production of lithium, which is used in batteries, are surging Monday after China's vice minister of industry and information technology said on Saturday that the government is preparing a timeline for the end of production of internal combustion engines.Chemical company Albemarle (ALB) jumped 4.7% to close at a record high of 123.85 on the stock market today, breaking out from a flat base just beyond a 123.58 buy point.The Global X Lithium & Battery Tech (LIT), a lithium-stock-related ETF, popped 4.8% to 35.96, the highest level in six years.Chemical maker Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM) surged 7% to a four-year high of 51.81.Tesla shares jumped 5.9% to 363.69, working on a cup-with-handle pattern with a 370.10 buy point. The EV maker also said it is expanding its network of Supercharger stations.Mining giant Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) produces materials like copper and cobalt that are also critical to EVs.

But they also say Tesla's Autopilot feature was a contributing factor because it allowed the driver to go for long stretches without having to take control.Meanwhile, the Frankfurt Motor Show is opening to the media this week and will feature a big EV push from top automakers.On Monday, Volkswagen (VLKAY)'s CEO said the German auto giant will spend $24 billion to bring electric versions of all of its 300 models to market by 2030.RELATED:Here Are The Hottest Cars — And Concepts — At The Frankfurt Car ShowNew Nissan Leaf Called 'A Pretty Sweet Deal' — But No Threat To TeslaAutomotive Industry News, Self-Driving Cars And Stocks To Watch

279,MA,"TCW Select Equities Fund (TCGEX) is enjoying a big rebound from 2016, thanks to a steadfast focus on leading stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN), Mastercard (MA) and Zoetis (ZTS). Not only are they poised for future growth, they have climbed 33%, 36% and 22% respectively this year.XLast year the $909.2 million fund lagged nearly its entire large-cap growth peer group tracked by Morningstar Direct. This year's rally — the fund's 26.51% year-to-date gain going into Thursday topped 89% of its direct rivals as well as the S&P 500's 13.19% advance — fits in with the fund's long-term outperformance.The challenge last year was that the market rotated toward value-oriented stocks in materials, industrials, energy and financials, and away from the more growth-oriented stocks that fund manager Craig Blum likes. ""The 2016 struggles have pretty much unwound in 2017,"" Blum said. ""We're not hoisting any trophies. We've got the rest of the year to go. But we're proud to have delivered some upside (to our shareholders) and be on our way to recovering from 2016.""Over the past 10 years, the fund is in the top 28% of its peers. In 2015, it outran 98% of its peers.Even in 2016 when the fund fell 8.07%, the fund stuck to its knitting. ""We never changed our approach,"" Blum said. ""We stayed resolute in our focus on quality stocks and growth.""And with a portfolio of 32 names as of June 30, ""focus"" is the right way to describe the portfolio. It ranges between 25 and 35 names. It aims for companies capable of long-term price appreciation through earnings growth. The quality part of the equation? ""We want companies capable of durable, sustainable earnings growth, which have a wide moat around their businesses, that are capturing market share and have balance sheet strength,"" Blum said.The technology sector is where Blum is looking for a lot of those stocks now. He had a 40% tech weighting as of Aug. 31. ""We find a lot of disruptive forces there,"" he said. ""And we want a large opportunity. Many tech companies have large total addressable markets.""Amazon is one of those tech names. The e-commerce and cloud-services giant was still a top-10 holding as of June 30 even though Blum made small trims in recent disclosures. ""We work with long-term and short-term price targets,"" he said. Amazon is at or near its short-term target, he adds, ""but we feel quite confident in our long-term thesis.""He added, ""Amazon's spending on fulfillment center expansion and aggressive investment in Amazon Web Services (AWS) are justified."" More big enterprises are shifting data center operations to services like AWS, he says. ""In the long-term this spending will be value accretive,"" he said.He says the Whole Foods acquisition is not related to his Amazon trims. ""We are constructive on the Whole Foods acquisition over the long-term for a variety of reasons,"" he said. Among them, he calls the takeover an opportunity to speed up Amazon Prime membership sign-ups. It's also a big increase in Amazon's distribution and fulfillment capabilities.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is on IBD's Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play of top stocks. One emerging Amazon strength is that it is becoming a consumer-electronics maker in its own right with the popular Echo digital assistant products.Mastercard is a relative newcomer. Blum began to buy in January. Blum calls the stock — which is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks that have strong relative price strength and fundamentals — an attractive play on growth in e-commerce and card penetration.Blum also owns Visa (V), but likes Mastercard's outlook slightly better because it has more room to grow. Mastercard is developing technologies and advertising services that, if successful, will be new sources of revenue and earnings growth.For one, it is developing technology that could enable banks to wring more information out of the stodgy Automated Clearing House (ACH) network that banks use to manage services such as processing of payroll, direct deposits, tax payments, consumer bills and money transfers from one account to another.Zoetis is another newcomer. Blum began to buy in May. ""The growthier part of the business is the companion-animals segment,"" Blum said. ""There's a secular trend of folks spending more at veterinary clinics on their pets.""The farm-animals segment is more stable, which Blum likes. It does not fluctuate much as the broader economy speeds up and contracts because the cost of vaccines and other health products is small compared to overall costs of running a farm. Also, it's crucial for a farm to maintain the health of its livestock.Also, Blum says the company is better focused than rivals that are part of large, more diverse pharmaceutical companies. ""Those rivals aren't able to integrate marketing and research-and-development the way Zoetis is,"" Blum said. ""Their focus is a competitive advantage.""That durability of revenue and earnings is something that Blum values among several of his holdings. ""It's appropriate to maintain a balanced view,"" he said. ""It's good to combine higher beta, more aggressive growth companies with more defensive names like Zoetis.""Why? Because you never know when a recession could start. ""Since 1900, the average business cycle has lasted 47 months,"" he said. ""We're now 99 months into this one. We're cyclically bullish short-term. But our eyes are wide open midterm.""RELATED:Should You Join Lawsuits Mushrooming In Equifax Hack?Are You A Newcomer To Stock Investing Who Wants A Few Pointers?

280,MA,"Ford (F) reported third-quarter results that topped consensus views and gave bullish guidance, two days after General Motors (GM) crushed quarterly estimates.XEstimates: EPS to climb 27% to 33 cents while revenue dips 1.2% to $32.92 billion, as U.S. demand cools.Results: EPS of 43 cents on revenue of $36.5 billion. Automotive revenue totaled $33.65 billion. F Series sales climbed 14% with average prices up by $2,800 to $45,400. SUV retail sales rose 4%, with the Edge up 7.8% and the Explorer up 13.6%. North America revenue fell to $20.9 billion and operating margin was 8.1%.Outlook: Full-year EPS view narrowed to $1.75-$1.85, above consensus views for $1.74. Still sees 2017 North America operating margin lower than in 2016, due to higher commodity, product and engineering expenses.Stock: Shares rallied 1.9% to 12.27  on the stock market today. Ford is forming a handle on a double-bottom base with 12.56 buy point. GM advanced 0.3%, after hitting a fresh post-bankruptcy high of 46.48 on Tuesday. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), which reported mixed results Tuesday, rose 1%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Ford, GM and the world's other auto giants are undergoing transformations as Tesla (TSLA) and Silicon Valley spur more competition in electric vehicles and autonomous driving.GM has bought up self-driving startups, announced plans to eventually go all electric, and is pulling back from less profitable markets and models.Earlier this month, Ford said it will shift toward high-margin trucks and SUVs and away from less-profitable cars, while slashing costs by $14 billion and investing more in electric vehicles. Ford also plans to add 13 EVs with a five-year investment of $4.5 billion.While markets are bullish on GM's plans, lifting its stock accordingly, the same can't be said about Ford's plans, which have been met with more skepticism.RELATED:GM's Q3 Earnings Were Great — But This Risk Hangs Over Surging StockFord's China Partner Makes Bold EV Move In World's Top Auto MarketWhy Ford Earnings Forecasts May Be Too High For The Next Few YearsFord To Focus On EVs, Trucks, SUVs; CEO Says Why Electric Push Came Late

283,MA,"Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger warned Thursday that profit will be weaker than expected this year and seemed to dash hopes that Netflix (NFLX) will retain Star Wars and Marvel content after the media conglomerate launches its own streaming service.XWhile speaking at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2017 Media, Communications & Entertainment Conference, Iger put earnings per share this year ""roughly in line"" with Disney's fiscal 2016 EPS, according to CNBC.That fiscal year, which ended in September 2016, saw EPS of $5.72, and the consensus for this year has it rising to $5.87, according to Zacks Investment Research.The weaker fiscal 2017 outlook implies Q4 EPS of $1.09, well below consensus views for $1.25. Iger blamed the expected effects of Hurricane Irma in Disney's Florida resorts, higher costs for NBA broadcast rights, the investment in BAMTech, and the lack of a major Star Wars movie release (""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" will be released at the start of fiscal 2018).Disney shares closed down 4.4% at 97.06 on the stock market today. Viacom (VIAB) lost 3.6%, 21st Century Fox (FOXA) dropped 2.4% and CBS (CBS) fell 2.1%. Netflix edged down 0.1%. NBC Universal owner Comcast (CMCSA) sank 6% after it lowered its outlook.IBD'S TAKE: Silicon Valley and Hollywood's convergence continues, amid a growing battle to own and stream television shows and movies — and get people to pay for them in the process. Here's how the big media and tech players match up. Meanwhile, Disney's upcoming streaming app will have four to five original Disney series and three to four exclusive Disney movies, Iger said, adding that Star Wars and Marvel titles will be seen exclusively on the app.Last month, Disney announced its streaming app and said it would no longer provide content to Netflix. U.S. Netflix members will have access to Disney films on the service through the end of 2019.But just days after Disney said it would pull movie content from the streaming site, Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos told Reuters that the company was ""still in active discussions"" to keep ""Star Wars"" and Marvel movies on the platform.Iger said on Disney's earnings call last month that it was ""possible"" that both Marvel and Lucasfilm theatrical titles will continue to be licensed to pay services such as Netflix. He also floated the possibility of creating stand-alone proprietary services for each studio brand.RELATED:Comcast Stock Plunges On Video Subscriber Losses, Hurricane ImpactLayoffs, Restructuring Said To Hit Disney-ABC Television SoonStreaming Content May Become King, But Who Will Wear The Crown?Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

289,MA,"United Technologies (UTX) lifted full-year forecasts Tuesday after topping Q3 estimates, led by growth at its jet engine unit, which is making progress on resolving problems in its Geared Turbofan engine.Estimates: EPS to slip 4.5% to $1.68 while revenue grows 3.7% to $14.89 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS dipped 2% to $1.73 as revenue grew 5% $15.06 billion. Organic sales rose 6%. Sales at the Otis elevator unit rose 4.6% to $3.16 billion. Climate, controls and security sales climbed 6.2% to $4.69 billion. Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales increased 10.6% to $3.87 billion. Aerospace systems sales were flat at $3.64 billion. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% at both Pratt & Whitney and aerospace systems.Orders for new equipment at Otis were down 4% on a constant-currency basis, while climate, controls and security saw a 2% increase in organic orders.Outlook: United Tech raised its full-year earnings estimate to $6.58-$6.63 from $6.45-$6.60. It sees sales of $59 billion-$59.5 billion, up from $58.5 billion-$59.5 billion. The Dow industrials component still sees 3%-4% organic growth.Stock: Shares fell 0.9% to 119.76 on the stock market today, falling back below a 120.05 buy point on a cup-with-handle base after hitting 123.28 intraday. Fellow Dow component General Electric (GE), which slashed its guidance last week, slipped 1.9% after diving 6% on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.United Tech has been grappling with problems in its new Geared Turbofan engines, which have delayed Airbus (EADSY) A320neo deliveries.In July, Airbus said Pratt & Whitney has to ""work harder"" to fix delays and reliability problems. United Tech said Tuesday that it has shipped 245 Geared Turbofan engines so far this year and backed its target of 350-400 deliveries for 2017.Management also said the company is speeding up production for the engines used in the A320neo and Bombardier's C Series aircraft.Meanwhile, United Tech reached a deal last month to buy aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins (COL) for $30 billion, including debt.The combination of United Tech, whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes jet engines, and Rockwell, which makes cockpit and communications systems, is seen as one of the biggest aerospace deals ever, and may draw a challenge from Boeing (BA), which is looking to keep it market share in the lucrative maintenance and repair business.The United Tech-Rockwell deal comes as Boeing ramps up its parts sales and services business, which provides maintenance and technical support and was launched on July 1.""We believe this deal is partly in response to the increased pricing pressure from the leading aerospace OEMs (Airbus and Boeing) and the increased push by the leading OEMs, notably Boeing, into the commercial aftermarket, traditionally the source of most industry profits and cash flow,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said in a note last month.But as United Tech gets bigger, other industrial heavyweights like GE and Siemens (SIEGY) are getting smaller. General Electric said last week it will streamline its business by $20 billion, with thousands of layoffs expected. Siemens may cut thousands of workers at its power-and-gas and process industries, Bloomberg reported last week.United Tech needs to break up some of its assets to ""unlock the conglomerate discount and bring this deal to its ultimate logic,"" according to Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague.In a Setember note, Sprague wrote that a spin-off of United Tech's buildings units, which includes Carrier air conditioning and Otis elevators, ""could unlock upwards of $20/share in value"" and would be ""the logical conclusion"" to the Rockwell transaction.RELATED:GE Under Pressure To Cut Dividend After Slashing Cash Flow OutlookBoeing May Challenge United Tech's Buyout Of Rockwell CollinsHoneywell's Expected Spinoffs Fall Short Of Investor's PlanHoneywell To Spin Off 2 Units; Pfizer Mulls Consumer Sale; P&G-Peltz Proxy Fight Today

293,MA,"Halliburton (HAL) topped third-quarter estimates Monday as strong pricing trends in the U.S. oil patch helped power through a recent slowdown in drilling activity.The oilfield service provider's earnings per share from continuing operations shot up to 42 cents from 3 cents a year ago, topping forecasts for 38 cents. Revenue jumped 42% to $5.44 billion, above analysts' estimates for $5.32 billion. North American revenue, which by far makes up the bulk of the top line, soared 91% to $3.16 billion.""Our North American business is hitting on all cylinders and our international business proved resilient in a challenging environment,"" said CEO Jeff Miller in a statement.Completion and production revenue jumped 62.5% to $3.54 billion, while drilling and evaluation revenue rose 15% to $1.91 billion.Shares fell 2.5% to 42.24 on the stock market today. Rival Schlumberger (SLB), which matched forecasts on Friday, slid 2% on Monday.

296,MA,"Best known for processing credit card payments for small businesses like food trucks and farm-stand vendors, Square (SQ) has expanded into a host of financial services as it aims to become a more critical support partner for its customers.XAmong its latest ventures, Square recently revealed that it plans to create a banking arm to offer business loans, take deposits and provide other services. It already offers small loans through its Square Capital unit.""The premise is small businesses don't have access to capital to start, run and grow their business,"" Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said. ""Our typical loan type is about $6,000. This is not a playground that the banks typically can serve in any sort of profitable way. So we felt there was a market need.""It's all part of Square's master plan to continue serving the often neglected small business market, as well as to move upmarket to larger businesses.""Today where we're being most successful is that move upmarket,"" Friar said. Square is more than a payments company, she adds. Speaking at a recent technology conference, she said Square provides the financial hardware and software to get small businesses up and running and to grow.""That's really what Square revolutionized,"" Friar said. ""We bring to a seller a cohesive commerce ecosystem.""San Francisco-based Square broke into the financial technology scene in 2009 with its tiny credit-card swipe dongles — hardware attachments that plug into computers, smartphones and tablets. Since then it has grown in scope, scale and ambition.In addition to processing payments, Square provides software for point-of-sale and back offices in order to manage inventory and other tasks. It also offers customer relationship management software so businesses can do targeted marketing to their clients.Square's software and services have proved to be incredibly sticky, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Josh Beck said in an Oct. 2 report.Square's rivals, mostly traditional payments firms, have tried undercutting it on price, but customers appear to be sticking with Square, according to a recent survey by KeyBanc.Among the larger businesses that Square serves — those doing more than $200,000 in annual sales — 60% have received lower-price offers from Square's competitors, Beck said. But 80% say that they plan to stay with Square for more than a year.Square has created a stickier business by offering payroll and lending services to the small businesses that already rely on it to process payments.The survey results suggest that ""the value and breadth of services (from Square) exceeds the potential expense savings"" of lower fees for processing payments through rivals, Beck said.Square has created a business platform that is differentiated by ease of use, transparency, system integration and innovation, he said.""The survey data indicates to us that Square is rapidly innovating new features to accommodate a variety of needs, forming a platform that generates a substantial moat,"" Beck said.He reiterated his overweight rating on Square stock and raised his price target to 32 from 29.Square went public in November 2015 at $9 a share and reached an all-time high of 30.90 before ending trades Thursday at 30.76. Shares were unchanged Friday.Square is one of 28 companies in IBD's Finance-Credit Card and Payment Processing industry group, which currently ranks No. 51 out of 197 groups. The biggest companies in the group by market cap are Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), American Express (AXP) and PayPal (PYPL).The company is scheduled to announce third-quarter results on Nov. 8 after the market close. Square has guided to adjusted earnings per share of 5 cents on sales of $565 million. In the third quarter last year, Square earned a penny a share on sales of $439 million.In the second quarter, Square earned an adjusted 7 cents a share, up from 5 cents in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 26% year over year to $552 million, ahead of the $536 million consensus view.IBD'S TAKE: With an IBD Composite Rating of 96, Square ranks third among companies in its industry group. For analysis of Square stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.In the first six months of 2017, Square got 87.4% of its revenue from handling transactions, 10.7% from subscriptions and 1.9% from hardware.Square has several drivers that could sustain revenue growth and margin expansion, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane said in a Sept. 14 report. They include continued penetration of its core small business market, its move upmarket, and expansion into e-commerce and international markets.""The power of Square's platform continues to be undervalued by investors,"" Keane said. He rates the stock as buy.Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider sees Square continuing to grow its user base and to sell them more services. He rates Square as buy.""We expect the company to achieve significant growth driven by further growth in payment processing, and bolstered by cross-selling subscription and service-based products to its base of nearly 3 million merchants,"" Schneider said in a Sept. 11 report. ""We believe Square can continue to drive margins higher as it builds scale outside payments.""Square's other offerings include Square Cash, a way for businesses and people to send and receive money, and Caviar, a food ordering service for popular restaurants.On Sept. 28, Square announced a deal to process payments for ticketing service Eventbrite as part of its push into online commerce, an area dominated by larger players like PayPal. Square will handle Eventbrite's online, mobile and in-person payments.Square also invested $25 million in Eventbrite, which lets event organizers sell tickets and promote and manage live events.RELATED:PayPal A Buyer, Not Seller, And May Seek A Big Target: AnalystSquare Goes Retail To Offer Hands-On Support For Merchants

297,MA,"The number of oil rigs in operation in the U.S. was unchanged at 759 this week, after falling five times in the prior nine weeks, as Hurricane Harvey appears to have had a muted initial effect on drilling in south Texas.X But Baker Hughes a GE Co. (BHGE), which was formed when Baker Hughes merged with General Electric's (GE) oil and gas business, said it couldn't verify data in dozens of counties due to the storm.Rigs in the Permian Basin rose by three to 380, slipped by one to 65 in the Eagle Ford formation in south Texas, and dropped by four to 65 in the Cana Woodford formation in Oklahoma.The downward trend in rigs has come as crude prices remain below $50 a barrel, and Hurricane Harvey has pushed them lower while sending gasoline prices soaring.U.S. crude futures were down 0.5% at $46.98 a barrel, and Brent crude dipped 0.7% to $52.51 a barrel.IBD'S TAKE: Lower oil prices are weighing on producers, but companies that use petroleum products in manufacturing, like Platform Specialty Products, are outperforming.The storm has forced Gulf Coast refineries to shut down, but most crude production takes place inland, and persistently low oil prices have quieted higher-cost offshore production.On Wednesday, the Energy Department said U.S. crude production last week was essentially unchanged at 9.53 million barrels a day, still near the record high of 9.61 million reached in June 2015. But that masked a drop in output in the lower 48 states, offset by an increase in Alaska.RELATED:Gasoline Futures Soar On Harvey While Crude Supplies DropEnergy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

301,MA,"Regulations: When FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced plans to repeal the Obama administration's heavy-handed ""net neutrality"" regulations, critics acted as if the world were coming to an end. Actual consumers, however, aren't likely to notice any difference, because the ""problem"" those rules were supposed to solve has always been wildly exaggerated.X Net neutrality sounds at first blush like a noble goal. Internet service providers shouldn't, the argument goes, be allowed to favor some traffic over others, either by throttling speeds, charging more or taking any other action that discriminates against bits of data crossing their network.But to enforce the rules, the Obama administration had to treat ISPs as if they were monopoly phone providers, which let the government not only impose net neutrality requirements, but gave it sweeping authority to regulate everything the ISPs did.Never mind that, unlike Ma Bell of the 1930s, the internet is highly competitive, with cable, fiber, fixed wireless, satellite and mobile carriers all offering broadband services. Or that the decade before the Obama rules went into effect provided no justification for the rules.Between 2005 and 2015, average broadband speeds increased by more than 1,150%, FCC data show. Over those same years, average broadband prices remained flat, after adjusting for inflation.Meanwhile, household broadband penetration went from 30% to almost 80%, according to the Pew Research Center. And this figure doesn't include households that rely on mobile for their high-speed internet access, a share that has also exploded in recent years.Where is the consumer harm in any of this?Yet multiple headlines warned that going back to the world before 2015 would amount to ""destroying the internet as we know it."" CNET, for example, warned ominously that ""net neutrality repeal means your internet may never be the same.""But the warnings always are about what ISPs ""might do,"" not what they've actually done, or would have any business justification for doing. In other cases the consumer harm is debatable.One fear cited, for example, is that ISPs would start charging tiered prices for different services, rather than a flat rate for all of them. Even if they did, so what?For years, these same consumer advocates were blasting cable companies for not offering a-la-cart cable programming, forcing consumers to buy access to channels they didn't want.What's more, big content providers pushing to keep net neutrality rules use tiered pricing. Netflix, for example, charges almost twice as much for a plan that includes Ultra HD videos as it does for its basic non-HD service.And tiered pricing is arguably more fair to consumers than bulk pricing. Why should someone who doesn't use the internet to stream videos have to pay the same price as someone who streams ultra-HD programming 24/7?While net neutrality advocates can't provide specifics on how consumers benefit from the rules, we know for certain what the net neutrality regime would produce if left in place — stifling government regulations.The first big regulation to come out of the FCC had nothing to do with net neutrality, but was a costly privacy rule imposed on cable companies. And the first ""blatant"" net neutrality violation cited by advocates was against T-Mobile (TMUS) for offering … wait for it … unlimited streaming video.Why? Because T-Mobile offered a cheaper rate to customers willing to watch videos on their phones in 480p, instead of higher quality HD that hogs far more bandwidth.The horror!The net neut crowd also claims that the regulations haven't impinged on the industry's investment in their networks. There's disagreement about this. One side suggests that investment dropped 5% after the rules went into effect, the other says it's had no impact.This debate is  pointless at the moment, since the rules haven't been in effect long enough. But even advocates admit that the rules could be a problem.TechCrunch, a snarky tech trends website, tried to debunk all the ""myths"" about net neutrality regulations. But the author says it ""is certainly possible"" that the regulatory costs pose a burden for small ISPs. And all he could muster was to say he was ""skeptical"" about industry complaints that no-blocking and no-throttling rules would prevent useful services from being rolled out.Given the FCC's history, the only thing to be skeptical about is reassurances that its rules and mandates wouldn't ultimately hamper innovation and hurt consumers. As we have pointed out in detail in this space, that has been the main outcome of the FCC's 80 years of regulating the telecommunication industry. It stalled the growth of TV, tied the cable industry in regulatory knots for years, blocked phone companies from providing video services, and delayed the introduction of cellphones by at least a decade.The idea that letting the FCC put its regulatory boot on ISPs would somehow spur growth and innovation is pure fantasy.FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai said it best when he called net neutrality ""a solution that won't work to a problem that doesn't exist.""Consumers should be glad that someone with that much common sense is calling the shots there.RELATED:A Tale Of Two Decisions: Trump Administration Got Antitrust Wrong, But Net Neutrality Right After Choking Telecom Innovation For 80 Years, FCC Plans To Take On The Internet Net Neutrality's Days Are Numbered, And That's A Good Thing Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

304,MA,"PayPal Holdings (PYPL) made friends out of Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) last year, but now PayPal's stock is trading at a higher multiple than the credit card networks.That has some analysts questioning PayPal's valuation, amid a stock run-up of 78% in 2017. PayPal rose 5.5% to close at 70.97 on the stock market today after reporting September-quarter profit and revenue that topped views and forecasting current quarter sales above estimates.The e-commerce payment processor in 2016 signed partnerships with Visa and Mastercard. PayPal let its users choose the credit cards at its online checkout service. PayPal had used an automated clearing house system set up by bank partners, bypassing the credit card companies.It was a big strategic move by PayPal, whose forward price-to-earnings ratio has expanded from 25 times to 36 times since the beginning of the year, noted a Jefferies analyst in a report.""We think (PayPal's) multiple expansion is due to some combination of admirable execution along with the stock gaining the focus of financial investors that seem to compare to card networks Visa/Mastercard, which can trade 28 times to 30 times price/earnings,"" Michael Graham, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said in a note to clients. ""We are impressed with the company's performance but we wonder if the multiple expansion can continue.""Scott Devitt, an analyst at Stifel, said in his note: ""With shares already trading at a healthy premium to the card networks, we believe the current valuation reflects the outsized growth opportunity. As such, we remain on the sidelines.""Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette remains a bull, raising his price target to 77 from 76.""What makes us most bullish is PYPL is able to deliver this consistent performance without upside from its myriad initiatives, including the partnerships following its Visa/Mastercard agreements last year, Pay With Venmo, and a transition to asset-light credit,"" Faucette said in a note.IBD'S TAKE: IBD has a wide range of free lessons on trading stocks. Get started on our How To Invest page.PayPal said adjusted fiscal third-quarter earnings were 46 cents a share, up 31% from a year ago, with revenue rising 21% to $3.24 billion, both topping consensus estimates. Analysts expected PayPal to report earnings of 43 cents on sales of $3.18 billion for the period ended Sept. 30.In the current quarter, PayPal forecast revenue growth of 21% at its midpoint of guidance to $3.60 billion and non-GAAP profit of 51 cents vs. consensus estimates of $3.56 billion and 51 cents.RELATED:PayPal Climbs On Upgrade, 'Never Going To Look Cheap Again'PayPal A Buyer, Not Seller, And May Seek A Big Target: AnalystIs The Holy Grail Of Digital Payments Just One Click Away?Could You Have Spotted The 1987 Stock Market Top?

310,MA,"Gasoline futures soared Wednesday to their highest level in more than two years as more refineries shut down due to Harvey, while domestic crude output was flat but still near a record high.XThe Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.4 million barrels, gasoline supplies were flat, and distillates rose by 700,000 barrels.Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts see a decline of 1.5 million barrels in today's report, along with a drop of 1.9 million barrels for gasoline and 600,000 barrels for distillates. Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said crude inventories shrank by 5.8 million barrels last week, while gasoline increased by 476,000 barrels.But those numbers are for last week, before the catastrophic storm slammed into the south Texas and the Gulf Coast.U.S. crude futures fell 1% to 45.96 a barrel, off earlier lows, and Brent crude retreated 2.2% to $50.86 a barrel. With many Gulf Coast refineries still shut down, unprocessed crude oil has been piling up and weighing on prices.But gasoline futures skyrocketed 5.7% to $1.885 a gallong, hitting a 25-month high intraday, as traders realize that refineries will be shut for some time. Motiva began fully shutting down the nation's largest refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, after it had run at 40% capacity on Tuesday. But the October gasoline contract was at $1.638 a gallon.Meanwhile, EIA said U.S. crude production was essentially unchanged at 9.53 million barrels a day, still near the record high of 9.61 million reached in June 2015. But that masked a drop in output in the lower 48 states, offset by an increase in Alaska.Shares of oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 0.5% on the stock market today, Chevron (CVX) retreated 0.1%, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) dipped 0.5% and BP (BP) was flat.IBD'S TAKE: Lower oil prices are weighting on producers but companies that use petroleum products in manufacturing, like Platform Specialty Products, are outperforming.Meanwhile, offshore drilling in the Gulf has fallen off since the shale boom took off more than 10 years ago, shifting more production inland to less hurricane-prone areas like the Permian Basin.Still, operations in the Eagle Ford shale formation in south Texas may take a hit and could show up in EIA's data next week, when inventories should also see big swings.On Tuesday, S&P Global Platts said roughly 2.33 million barrels per day of Texas refining capacity remained down, or 12.6% of U.S. capacity. In addition, refineries that are still online are also slowing run rates. If plants operate at 50% capacity, that would put the total loss at 3.36 million barrels per day, or 18% of total capacity, S&P Global Platts estimated.RELATED:This Chart Shows How Close U.S. Oil Production Is To A New Record High

322,MA,"The Pentagon has picked Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) to advance to the next stage of a competition for new nuclear-armed cruise missiles that could be launched from bombers like Northrop Grumman's (NOC) forthcoming B-21.XThe Long Range Standoff (LRSO) weapon will replace aging AGM-86B Air Launched Cruise Missiles made by Boeing (BA). Those missiles were initially fielded in the early 1980s.The LRSO is meant to hit targets from long ranges without putting bombers at risk of getting shot down. But critics have charged that the Pentagon doesn't need the LRSO as the B-21 is supposed to be stealthy enough to elude enemy air defenses.Lockheed and Raytheon each received $900 million contracts to develop the technologies for the LRSO and demonstrate the new weapon's reliability, the Air Force announced late Monday. The service will then pick one company to manufacture the LRSO, whose cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion.The Air Force plans to start fielding the next-generation nuclear cruise missile in the late 2020s. Meanwhile, the B-21 is expected to enter service in 2025.""This weapon will modernize the air-based leg of the nuclear triad,"" said Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson in a statement about the LRSO. ""Deterrence works if our adversaries know that we can hold at risk things they value. This weapon will enhance our ability to do so, and we must modernize it cost-effectively.""Shares of Lockheed were flat on the stock market today, but still above buy range.

Leaderboard is having its best month of the year and the YTD distance is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500.Earlier this week, the Pentagon awarded Boeing and Northrop with similar early-stage development contract for new nuclear ballistic missiles to replace Boeing-made Minuteman IIIs.The Pentagon will then award a single, final contract for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent in late fiscal 2020, with deployment seen in the late 2020s. That contract will be worth up to $85 billion, according to the Pentagon's Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. However, the Air Force has put the number around $62 billion.Those contracts will build on earlier deals to upgrade strategic bombers and submarines.In 2015, Northrop was awarded a contract to build the B-21 bomber that replaces the Cold War-era Boeing B-52s. Development and procurement costs are expected run as much as $80 billion.The Navy has a program underway to replace its Ohio-class nuclear missile submarines.

Full-year operating margin to widen 80-100 basis points, down from an earlier view for 120 points of improvement.Lowe's will increase store hours for customers to capitalize on strong traffic and the supportive macroeconomic environment, though that will put pressure on operating margins, Chairman and CEO Robert Niblock said in a statementStock: Shares were down 5% at 72.02 in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Home Depot fell 0.9% to 148.59.Last week, rival Home Depot delivered strong results and guidance, but shares gapped down amid concerns about slowing growth.Morningstar analysts noted that Home Depot's more bullish full-year same-store sales view implies growth will slow over the remainder of 2017 to a mid-single-digit pace.But the analysts added that such growth is still impressive given the ""lengthy housing cycle upswing and the maturity of this particular business model.""Home Depot and Lowe's sank on July 20, after Sears (SHLD) announced that it would sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon (AMZN), a move that some investors saw as a threat to the home improvement retailers, which sell appliances themselves.Adding to the pressure on Lowe's and Home Depot shares was weak data on sales of new homes last month.

334,MA,"Talk about hot! Brian Demain is lead manager of $14.2 billion Janus Henderson Enterprise (JANEX), which is an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. So is the fund's twin, $1 billion Aspen Enterprise (JAAGX), of which he also is skipper.XThe portfolios won Best Funds honors by outperforming the S&P 500 in four time periods ended Dec. 31 — the trailing one, three, five and 10 years.And they did so in not just one category but in three — diversified equity mutual funds, growth mutual funds and midcap mutual funds.That put them into a small group of gems. A mere 44 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, out of 1,104 with assets of at least $100 million, prevailed as winners across those four time spans.Demain and Cody Wheaton run the funds with little turnover, just 20% now, according to Morningstar Inc. Among both portfolios' holdings are Crown Castle (CCI), Microchip Technology (MCHP), Global Payments (GPN), Sensata Technologies (ST) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD). All are either forming basing patterns or in buy ranges.Enterprise is open to investors who already own shares. It's also open to old or new shareholders in 401(k) plans that already offer the fund, as well as to old or new investor clients of a wirehouse brokerage that offers the identical strategy through a separately managed account. Twin sister Aspen Enterprise can be bought by old or new investors through some insurance companies.A midcap fund at Janus Henderson that is still open to new investors is $4 billion Mid Cap Value (JMIVX).Demain, who is 40 years old, talked about his investment approach and several key stock holdings in a recent interview with IBD:IBD: Brian, summarize your investment approach.Demain: First, we look for what we call sustainable growth. We want companies that are growth companies today and will be three, five, seven years from now. They may not be the fastest growers, but they can grow for the long term.Second, we're looking for companies with sustainably high returns on invested capital. It's great if a company can grow. But if it's not earning high returns on invested capital, it's not increasing shareholder value. So we try to understand a company's competitive advantage, because that's what will drive its long-term return on invested capital.Third, we care about the quality of a company's management team. We like management teams that focus on the right areas, and that are good leaders.If we find companies that meet those three criteria and we can buy them at attractive valuations and hold them for the long term, we can outperform our peers.IBD: The fund's performance is consistent, as shown by its being an IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards winner. Is the key its outperformance during up markets or during down markets?Demain: We've generally been able to keep up in up markets and outperform in down markets. We try to have a predicted beta (a measurement of volatility relative to the market or benchmark) against our Russell MidCap Growth Index benchmark of between 0.85 and 1, so we have less absolute risk than the benchmark. But it's higher than 0.85, because we don't want to only outperform in a down market. That's where we want to shine, but we do OK in up markets as well.IBD: Why do you like midcaps?Demain: They're not as mature as large caps, so they have real growth opportunities ahead of them. But their business models are more established than small caps'.Many have withstood competitive challenges, which small caps may not have. But they tend to be less volatile than small caps.IBD: You've got about 70% of your assets in the technology, industrials and health care sectors. Why do you expect to find so many opportunities in those spaces?Demain: With tech and health care, it is the power of innovation. In tech, we've been overweight in hardware and semiconductors. The mobile internet is driving semiconductor growth. And we're seeing a lot of innovation in software pushing itself into our lives.In health, we own biotechs, pharmaceuticals, life-science tools and diagnostic companies. Aging baby boomers and an emerging middle class globally are driving innovations in drug development and diagnostics.IBD: You've noted that corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation may not occur as fast as many investors have hoped. How have you hedged your bets on those areas?Demain: Take tax cuts. Sensata is a Netherlands domiciled company (which makes sensors for aircraft, cars and other products) but it does business in the U.S. It pays a low tax rate because of where it is domiciled, so it will not benefit from lower U.S. rates.We also own TD Ameritrade (which is a brokerage). It pays a full tax rate, so if there's reform it will benefit. But policy changes can cut both ways. Ameritrade also benefits from rising interest rates. It sweeps clients' cash balances into TD Bank and earns more money on that spread as rates rise. And we own Crown Castle (a REIT that owns wireless cell towers). It has high levels of borrowing, so it will be hurt by high interest rates.IBD: Lam Research (LRCX) must be one of your semiconductor plays. Describe it, please.Demain: They are a semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer. In the last few years, we've gone from everything being etched on one plane of each microchip to effectively stacked layers on chips. So a lot of growth has gone to etching deposition players like Lam.In addition, demand in the memory market is robust. That's driven by uptake in solid-state drives. We're going from the old disk drives to solid-state flash-driven drives. That demands lots of chips, which is good for Lam.And we like their valuation. The stock trades at 13.5 times forward earnings. If you back out their cash, it is close to 12 times. The market's multiple is north of 18 times. And several high quality semiconductor companies are trading at 20 times.IBD: Celgene (CELG) is best known for Revlimid, its blood-cancer treatment. Do you like its other products?Demain: You're right, Revlimid is its workhorse and continues to grow due to longer treatment duration and finding new patients. But what do they do after Revlimid goes off-patent in 2026?The outlook for three other Celgene products — Pomalyst, Otezla and Abraxane — is constructive. And we're excited about its pipeline of new (treatments). Also, they've done business development deals with cash from Revlimid to build emerging franchises in gastroenterology and immunology, and inflammation and immunology. Those things should make the 2026 patent cliff for Revlimid a manageable event.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, which is ranked a very strong No. 4 among 197 groups. Celgene earns its top-dog status thanks to such traits as a best-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD and an annual pretax margin of 50.4, which is the highest it's been in at least nine years. Compare its other technical and fundamental strengths to its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.IBD: Microchip Technology's earnings per share growth has accelerated for six quarters in a row. Does your thesis revolve around the fact that their chips are used in a variety of products?Demain: The majority of their revenue is from microcontrollers, which are very simple computers that can go into all sorts of devices from airplanes to microwave ovens to kids' toys. That has great growth dynamics, which is a function of the growth of the Internet of Things. That's the company's sustainable growth.That business has a very fragmented customer base. You're not just selling a ton of chips to one customer like Apple (AAPL). You're selling to thousands of end markets. That's their competitive advantage.As for a good management team, the company is led by Steve Sanghi. We have high regard for his value creation. The company recently acquired Atmel, which was a large microcontroller competitor. It had good assets, but was poorly managed. Sanghi has improved operating margins and driven strong earnings growth. And valuation is not that demanding at about 15 times forward earnings.IBD: How does SS&C Technologies (SSNC) illustrate your investment approach?Demain: This is another example of sustainable growth plus competitive advantage plus strong management. SS&C provides back-office services for financial companies. As asset management matures, more companies want to focus on their core competencies. Rather than run back offices in-house, they look to outsource. And once they are embedded with a customer, other departments at the customer may outsource to them as well.SS&C is run by Bill Stone, who has a proven record of value creation. And their valuation is reasonable.IBD: Global Payments' earnings per share growth has sped up. Why?Demain: Think of Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) as electronic payment highways. Global Payments is the on- and offramp. They have relationships with merchants who accept credit card terminals. If you run a restaurant, for example, Global gives you software that not only accepts credit cards but also helps you run your restaurant. And Global has benefited from consolidation.IBD: What makes Heico (HEIA), which designs and repairs parts for aircraft and engines, attractive to you?Demain: Only certain approved suppliers can sell parts to airlines. Planes are in service for 25, 30 years, and need servicing. But only a relatively small number of companies have parts-manufacturing approval (PMA) from the Federal Aviation Administration and the European (regulatory) body. The FAA has (limited resources) and can only approve so many parts per year. Heico has the best position in the PMA market. They earn healthy margins.Also, the Mendelson family owns a large percentage of the company. It's most of their liquid net worth, so they care a lot about creating shareholder value, so we like to partner with them.IBD: What's driven the share-price uptrend by contact-lens developer Cooper (COO)?Demain: We like their sustainable growth. Contact lens are a growing category as contacts get more comfortable. They also benefit from international growth.There are only four players: Bausch & Lomb, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Alcon and Cooper. Once a consumer picks one, they usually stick with it and won't change because of a small price difference.IBD: Why is index operator MSCI attractive?Demain: The way to think about them is that they benefit from the growth of ETFs. An active manager like Janus Henderson pays a fixed fee for access to a benchmark operator. For MSCI, when a fee dollar moves from an active to a passive fund, that dollar becomes more profitable.And once you are a standard index, it is hard (for users) to change.IBD: By the way, any plans to reopen Enterprise Fund to all investors?Demain: No, we are managing $18 billion (including money in Aspen Enterprise and in separately managed accounts using Enterprise's strategy). It makes us one of the larger midcap strategies. Our first priority is working on behalf of existing clients. They think being closed is in their best interests and that's why we've done this.RELATED:Winning Mutual Fund Focuses On Leading Stocks Like Autohome, MarketAxess7 Steps For Millennials Who Want To Become Rich Retirees

Here are six big-cap stocks that are within 1% of buy points: Amgen (AMGN), General Motors (GM), Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), ASML (ASML) and PNC Financial Services (PNC).XGeneral Motors has a $54 billion market cap, and that's the smallest of the six, with Visa No. 1 at $200 billion. Amgen, GM, Mastercard and ASML all edged past entry points intraday, but closed beneath them.The market uptrend is under pressure, with earnings season kicking into high gear. So investors should be especially cautious about taking on new positions now.Amgen rose 1% to 175.04 in Thursday stock market trading. The biotech's stock rose as high as 176.20, briefly passing a 175.55 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, but couldn't hold that level. Volume was below normal, though the highest in three weeks.Amgen hasn't been a market leader lately. Its relative strength line is well off recent highs, as Amgen lags the S&P 500 index. And several other biotechs, including Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN), have already broken out.General Motors rose as high as 36.12 Thursday afternoon, briefly passing a 36.10 cup-with-handle entry. GM settled with a 1% gain at 35.86 in slightly above-average volume. Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) cleared buy points Thursday, following a move by Ferrari (RACE) on Wednesday.General Motors' RS line has been lagging. Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales have peaked, though a shift to SUV and truck purchases is supporting profits.Visa climbed to 96.65 intraday, a new all-time high, but not quite triggering the 96.70 buy point from a flat base. Visa reversed to closed down 0.25% at 95.94.Mastercard edged up 19 cents to 125.47, rising intraday to 126.40, briefly topping the 126.29 flat-base entry.Volume was below average for both Visa and Mastercard, but their RS lines are near highs, reflecting their strong performance and short consolidations.However, several other payment stocks have broken out this week, including PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ).Visa has earnings next week, along with a few other card firms such as American Express (AXP), which is still in range from a June breakout.Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial could provide insight into credit card trends Friday with their second-quarter earnings reports and conference calls.The chip-equipment giant fell 0.1% to 136.85. But for the second straight day ASML inched past a 137.37 buy point in a flat base going back nearly two months. ASML's RS line is near highs, a good sign.ASML will report quarterly earnings next week.PNC Financial is a superregional bank. It may be overshadowed by the money center banks JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, but PNC is expected to deliver a 10% EPS gain, while its larger rivals deliver essentially flat profit. PNC rose 0.1% to 127.38, as it builds toward a 128.35 entry in a shallow cup-with-handle base.JPMorgan is still in range from a double-bottom base, while Citigroup is extended.

The stock retook its 50-day line on Friday after testing support at the key measure a few days earlier.Mastercard was also nearing breakout territory in a flat base with a 126.29 buy point. Shares rose 0.85% to 125.28.Visa reports earnings on July 20, with Mastercard on tap July 27.PayPal rose 3.3% to 56.55 Wednesday , breaking out of a flat base with a 55.24 buy point after Apple (AAPL) enabled users in some countries to buy things on iTunes, the App Store, Apple Music and elsewhere using their PayPal accounts. It's unclear how large the Apple deal is. But it's the latest example of a payments rival agreeing to work with PayPal. PayPal also has alliances with Visa and Mastercard.Payments technology company Square rose 3% to 26.21, at the edge of the 5% buy zone. Shares broke out on Tuesday, surging 6.3% and clearing a 25.07 flat-base buy point as an analyst speculated that PayPal should buy Square.A sturdy economy and increased travel since the election have lifted the airline industry this year, even if airline stocks have waxed and waned over that time as Wall Street parses carriers' expansion plans and trends in demand growth.But in recent weeks, Delta suggested second-quarter unit revenue — the industry measure of an airline's operating efficiency that tends to move stocks — was on track to come in at the high end of its forecast range. Last week, the carrier confirmed those expectations, saying Q2 unit revenue had increased around 2.5%, in the upper range of an earlier forecast for a 1%-3% bump.Wall Street expects Delta to report second-quarter earnings per share of $1.65, up 12%, with revenue up 4% to $10.82 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.The unit revenue increase, Delta said, marked the first year-over-year quarterly unit revenue gain since the fourth quarter of 2014. In the roughly two years that followed, cheaper fuel cleared more room for profits. That tempted the airlines to add flights and reduce fares in a grab for airspace, hurting unit revenue before an oil-price rebound prompted more restraint.Delta last week also said that ""commercial initiatives and an improving revenue environment"" helped to make up for a barrage of thunderstorms in the Atlanta area that caused scores of flight cancellations.Delta shares rose 2.2% to 55.48 on Wednesday, buoyed by strong traffic and guidance from United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL). The stock is extended from a 50.28 buy point in a flat base.RELATED:Second Payment Stock Breaks Out, This Time On Apple DealThis Is Why Airline Stocks Have A Tailwind TodayApple iPhone 8 Expectations Too High, No 'Supercycle' Ahead: Analyst

338,MA,"The Nasdaq composite is in a rough patch, but hit a record high just a month ago. The S&P 500 index is about 1% from a record high. So finding leading stocks in proper bases is hard. But a quartet of highly rated payment stocks: Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ) have just formed short flat bases and are within 5% of potential buy points. PayPal was flirting with a buy point Monday morning.XSeveral, notably Visa, Mastercard and PayPal, are part-time partners, part-time rivals. And Apple (AAPL) remains a looming threat for payments generally, but PayPal's Venmo in particular.PayPal has formed a flat base with a 55.24 buy point. On a daily chart, PayPal has only been consolidating since June 9, just four weeks ago. But it's five weeks on a weekly chart, so it meets the minimum requirement for a flat base.PayPal didn't come near its 50-day line in recent weeks, and its relative strength line is near record highs, signaling its outperformance vs. the S&P 500. PayPal closed Friday at 53.97.PayPal rose 1.8% to 54.96 on the stock market today amid positive comments from analysts. PayPal hit 55.42 intraday, briefly topping that entry.The mobile payments specialist reached deals with Visa and Mastercard last year, giving consumers more choice and giving investors another reason to buy. PayPal also runs Venmo, a peer-to-peer mobile payments and transfer service. Venmo transactions more than doubled in Q1 vs. a year earlier to $6.8 billion.Apple (AAPL) introduced its own peer-to-peer service, while Visa, Mastercard have teamed up with many banks on another such service, Zelle. Apple's peer-to-peer offering in particular has been called a potential ""Venmo killer,"" but PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said last month that Apple won't have ""end-to-end"" services.RELATED:PayPal Worries Over Apple Overblown, New Deals Help: AnalystVisa, a Dow Jones industrial average component, has been consolidating for about five weeks (definitely five weeks on a weekly chart), with a potential buy point of 96.70. Visa dipped below its 50-day moving average last week, but rose back above that line on Friday, closing at 93.92. Visa rose 1.25% to 95.09 Monday.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal is rated No. 1 in IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processor group. To find the other leaders in the group and how they all measure up vs. objective criteria, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Visa and Mastercard don't hold credit balances, so don't benefit from rising interest rates like American Express (AXP) and other card firms. They make money on processing fees on merchants and card-issuing banks.Visa's takeover of Visa Europe last year has boosted growth, while Visa also recently announced a stake in big Swedish fintech startup Klarna.RELATED:Visa Invests In Hot Tech Unicorn With This Unique Twist On PaymentsMastercard, like archrival Visa, also has been consolidating since June 5. Unlike its archrival, Mastercard tested but did not undercut its 50-day line last week, rising 1.4% on Friday to 122.20. Mastercard has a buy point of 126.29. Shares climbed 0.5% to 122.76 on Monday.Square makes credit-card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets. It mostly serves smaller businesses, but has been getting larger customers. It's also been expanding into providing credit to small firms.Square has a short flat base with a 25.07 buy point, never really approaching its 50-day line. Square climbed 1.4% to 23.93 Monday.American Express, at 84.35, is still in buy range from an 82.10 entry. American Express is a Dow component.Alliance Data Systems (ADS), which handles credit card businesses for many retailers, has a cup-with-handle pattern with a 265.54 buy point. Alliance Data Systems closed Monday at 256.19.Vantiv (VNTV), which last week bested JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in pursuit of U.K. payments firm WorldPay with a $10 billion deal, retook its 200-day moving average on Friday. It rose 1.55% to 62.07 on Monday, nearing its 50-day line. Vantiv is in a flat base going back to Feb. 27, with a potential buy point of 66.34.Global Payments (GPN) has a short flat base with a potential buy point of 93.62. Global Payments fell 0.4% to 88.63 on Monday, just below its 50-day.

339,MA,"U.S. stock indexes kept small gains near midday Monday, as miners, steel and chips joined the upside and retail owned the downside.XThe Nasdaq crept 0.3% higher, just above its 50-day moving average, while the S&P 500 added 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.1%. Small caps lagged with the Russell 2000 sagging 0.4%. Volume in the stock market today was running lower on the NYSE and Nasdaq, compared to Friday's pace.Gold miner Royal Gold (RGLD) popped 1.5% in quiet turnover. It's working on a cup-with-handle pattern of 49 weeks. The stock's relative strength is hurt by the nearly yearlong pattern, but earnings growth is in the top quartile.Fort Wayne, Ind.-based Steel Dynamics (STLD) tacked on about 2% in volume about 15% above average. The stock has been consolidating since December.Chip designer Cavium (CAVM) gapped up 2% in volume about 50% above average. The stock is trying to regain its 200-day line and is 16% off its high amid waning group strength. Going into Monday's session, the group was No. 45 among 197 industry groups. But in early June, the chip designers were No. 22.Meanwhile, retailers were mostly down. The highly rated Retail-Home Furnishings group slouched 3%, but some of the action within the group was constructive. La-Z-Boy (LZB) trimmed about 1.5%, but the stock is working on a cup-with-handle pattern with a 32.91 entry. La-Z-Boy is 4% off its high. Earnings jumped 27% in fiscal Q4 ended in April. The 27% gain was the best in five quarters.Blue chips leaned south with losers leading winners by a 5-to-4 ratio in the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow's biggest gainer was Visa (V). The payment processor rose 1% in volume about 40% above average. Visa has grown earnings 25% to 26% in the past three quarters. Revenue jumped 25% and 23% in the past two quarters.Visa's chief rival Mastercard (MA) advanced 0.5% in average volume. Both stocks are working on flat patterns.RELATED:Two IBD 50 Chip Stocks Get Price-Target HikesFour Dow Stocks Near Buy Points

340,MA,"""Buy now"" with one click.Online shoppers know the payment tool well. It's a good example of how innovating in digital payments can take a company and its stock a long way. XJust ask founder Jeff Bezos at Amazon.com (AMZN), whose shares have approached the 1,100 mark.Other digital-payment players — think PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Square (SQ), and hot startup Stripe — also make it easier for merchants to nail down purchases, whether shoppers are on a PC, using a smartphone or in a store. PayPal and Square have shined in 2017, with their stocks climbing 50% and 92%, respectively, for the year vs. a gain of 10% for the S&P 500.Innovation in digital payments is making cash and checks go away and someday may even eliminate plastic credit cards. As technology evolves, a battle is raging to draw in merchants to payment ecosystems, along with billions of dollars in transaction fees.Payment processors are wooing merchants with new software-based sales tools and website services and, in some cases, cash loans to grow their businesses.""Anything a merchant can do to reduce the amount of friction in the transaction has an immediate effect on the top line, in terms of incremental sales, and the bottom line, in terms of lower transaction costs,"" said Thad Peterson, analyst at Aite Group.IBD'S TAKE: Keep an eye on credit card and payment-processing stocks, which have risen in weeks to rank 31st in price performance among 197 industry groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily. A leader in the group, PayPal's stock climbed to a record high after earnings. Use the IBD Stock Checkup to see how PayPal and other stocks stack up on crucial fundamental and technical measures.But competition is fierce in the crowded digital-payment industry, with well-funded startups challenging corporate giants from the credit card, e-commerce and consumer electronic fields. It's a tight-margin business, but huge.Online payment processors generally garner around 2.9% of a transaction value plus a 30-cent fee from merchants. They may pay partners, such as banks, to use their systems. ""It has to be a scale (volume) business to make it work,"" said Peterson.The good news is that e-commerce is booming. Global e-commerce sales will jump to $4 trillion by 2020, up from $2.35 trillion in 2017, accounting for nearly 15% of all retail spending worldwide, says research firm eMarketer.Competition is about to get even rougher.Amazon's U.S. patent for 1-Click technology, which stores payment and shipping information, expires in mid-September. When that happens, analysts say Visa (V), Mastercard (MA) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are expected to jump in with their own versions of the technology, intensifying the battle for merchants. While the credit card networks offer their own speedy online payment systems, such as Visa Checkout, they still require a user name and password to complete a transaction, while 1-Click does not.Amazon grew into an e-commerce giant by leveraging its 1-Click technology, rolled out in 1997. Apple (AAPL) licensed 1-Click for its app store, paying Amazon for the friction-free payment option.Keep Up With Stocks Near A Buy Zone At IBDMore recently, Amazon has been using 1-Click to attract merchants to its payments platform. If online shoppers log in to their Amazon accounts at third-party websites, 1-Click speeds up the checkout process. Partners include luxury retailer Moda Operandi, Nine West and L'Occitane.Amazon in February announced that 33 million consumers are using its payments service at both its site and third-party sites, up from 23 million a year earlier. That still trails PayPal's 210 million active customer accounts worldwide. Amazon reported earnings late Thursday and fell far short on earnings views due to high expenses.As digital-payment rivals target merchants, they're tapping a new tool — loans. Banks have stepped back from lending to small businesses since the 2008 recession. But Amazon, Square and PayPal have expanded their lending. Shopify (SHOP), a provider of e-commerce platforms that uses Stripe technology, has jumped into the lending game, too.Amazon in early June said its lending to small businesses has topped $3 billion, including $1 billion in loans over the last 12 months. Some 20,000 small businesses have received loans ranging from $1,000 to $750,000. Amazon uses internal data to identify creditworthy clients.PayPal in May announced that it has issued more than $3 billion in loans to 115,000 businesses globally since 2013. Square's lending has topped $1.5 billion over three years.One weapon that Square has been able to wield is making credit-card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets, such as Apple's iPad. That enables Square to drill down deeply into the small-business realm by targeting ""micro-merchants"" — very small entities that may not have accepted credit cards previously. A handyman, lunch-truck operator or masseuse might be among them.Square in March unveiled a new platform enabling its retail customers to process payments on custom websites, getting into competition with Stripe and PayPal. Jordan McKee, analyst at 451 Research, says payment processors aim to add higher-margin products.""Everyone wants to be a solutions provider,"" said McKee. ""The payments space is difficult. Margins are very slim. It's a game of scale. These companies are using payment processing as a linchpin to offer software-based services with higher margins that are sticky.""""Payments is a hard business to make money in. But if you can offer software with monthly fees and get recurring revenue then you build a bigger business,"" he added.What companies will find long-term success? It's hard to say, but here's a snapshot of new developments involving three big digital-payment players that illustrate the industry stakes, strategies and ambitions.The iPhone maker says Apple Pay, the mobile payments service rolled out in 2014, is on track to be accepted at 50% of U.S. retailers by year-end. ""It's a commendable milestone but pales in comparison to the ubiquity of Visa and MasterCard in physical stores and PayPal (online) acceptance,"" said Josh Beck, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst in a report. Loup Ventures says only 13% of Apple's 680 million iPhone users have activated Apple Pay.Apple launched its first large-scale marketing campaign targeting mainland China in late July, notes research firm Analysys Mason. Apple has lagged in gaining traction vs. local mobile payment incumbents, Alipay and WeChat.Looking to gain traction with millennials, Apple in June introduced a rival to PayPal's Venmo and Square Cash, both person-to-person payment systems. Consumers link a bank account to a smartphone app and send money to friends or family using an email address.While the money-transfer services are mostly free for consumers, PayPal and Apple see the apps as acquisition and engagement tools. PayPal also aims to get fees from merchants that accept the money transfers as payment.The San Francisco-based startup maintains it has no plans to go public, despite speculation that it could pull the trigger next year. Stripe's latest funding round in December gave it a whopping $9.2 billion valuation. In all, Stripe has raised $440 million.Investors include American Express (AXP) as well as Visa, which has placed multiple online- and mobile-shopping bets, also investing in Sweden's Klarna and Square.Stripe's software enables companies to accept and track online payments made via credit or debit cards as well as smartphone apps and cyber-currencies such as Bitcoin. Stripe's customers build its tools into their own apps and websites. The tools help businesses bypass complex relationships with banks and older payment providers.Stripe's technology lets companies focus on their products rather than back-end payment processing. Customers include Salesforce.com (CRM), Uber-rival Lyft and Target (TGT). Stripe's closest rivals are PayPal's Braintree unit and Dutch startup Adyen.""Braintree and Stripe are similar animals,"" said Aite's Peterson. ""They take the payment processing load off of a merchant along with the risk. Both of them need to find ways to add value, to broaden their platform.""Stripe on July 10 unveiled a partnership with Alipay, part of Alibaba Group (BABA), and WeChat, part of Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), two of China's biggest digital-payment services. The deal gives Stripe access to hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers.Amid worries over competition from Apple, Amazon, and Stripe, PayPal has nonetheless raised 2017 revenue guidance and its three-year revenue outlook. Since spun off from eBay in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments service provider, while expanding from online checkout to mobile payments.PayPal in February said one-third of all its transactions are now mobile while three-fourths of the top 100 online retailers accept PayPal. PayPal has forged new alliances with Visa, Mastercard, Google and Facebook (FB).Apple has also warmed up to PayPal. PayPal announced in early July that consumers in North America, Australia, Israel and seven European nations will be able to use their PayPal accounts for purchases across Apple platforms, including the App Store, Apple Music and iTunes.A deal with Amazon remains elusive.""Convincing Amazon to accept PayPal seems unlikely given it already has its own payments-tender type, its own private-label card, and it recently added a staged-wallet feature for Prime members, which we see as a direct threat to PayPal,"" said Thomas McCrohan, a Mizuho Securities analyst in a June 27 report. Pacific Crest Securities says PayPal could be a takeover target of several companies, though nothing seems imminent.More In-Depth AnalysisSmart Ideas In Artificial Intelligence And Early Investing Hot SpotsHere's One More Thing Amazon Is KillingFast Food Makes Its Biggest Change Since The Drive-Thru

Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD) and Raytheon (RTN) also raised their full-year earnings outlooks after reporting Q2 earnings results above estimates. Northrop said its aerospace-system sales climbed on higher manned-aircraft demand, including work on its E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft. Raytheon saw higher air-defense missile and smart bomb sales and General Dynamics' revenue got support from strong Gulfstream and defense-product demand.Boeing shares soared 14% for the week.

Philip Morris International (PM), which sells Marlboro cigarettes overseas, initially tumbled but closed up 0.3%.RELATED:FDA Acts Vs. Cigarettes, But One Tobacco Giant Is Holding UpThe Federal Reserve kept to Wall Street's preferred script on Wednesday, leaving its key interest rate unchanged and putting off an announcement that it will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The Fed's patience comes as the economy is performing pretty well, with real GDP growing at a 2.6% pace in the second quarter, but inflation and wage gains have been more muted than expected. The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December. The real uncertainty, hinging on the inflation outlook, is what Fed policy will look like in 2018.A flurry of chip-industry players posted beat-and-raise June-quarter results including chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN), as well as chip-gear suppliers Lam Research (LRCX) and Teradyne (TER).AMD earned an adjusted 2 cents a share on sales of $1.22 billion in Q2, when analysts expected it to break even on sales $1.16 billion.

Nigeria said it'll eventually join the rest of OPEC in curbing production. Saudi Arabia agreed to cut oil exports. U.S. crude inventories tumbled by 7.2 million barrels and domestic production dipped. Some energy companies trimmed capital-spending plans after months of sub-$50 oil.

Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) earnings missed.General Motors (GM) reported that adjusted profits grew 1.6% to $1.89, beating views for $1.72, while revenue dropped 12.7% to $37 billion, below views for $40.2 billion. GM reaffirmed full-year EPS guidance but will cut second-half production amid swelling inventories and falling U.S. industry sales. Ford Motor (F) topped views and raised guidance, but largely on lower tax rates. GM fell further below a buy point while Ford fell back toward multiyear lows. But Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held above a buy point after adjusted EPS swelled 49% though sales fell short.

The U.K. drugmaker also announced a deal with Merck (MRK) to gain access to the latter's I-O blockbuster Keytruda. Merck rose 3% on Thursday. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which has had several setbacks for its I-O drug Opdivo, slid 3% on concerns that the Mystic failure bodes ill for a similar Opdivo-combo study.Wall Street soured on casino players like MGM Resorts International (MGM), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) as the sector overall put up mixed results and guidance. Concerns about mass-market gaming in Macau weighed on Wynn, whose Q2 results nonetheless beat estimates. MGM offered a weak revenue-per-available-room outlook. It also cited ""higher-than-anticipated disruption"" at the Monte Carlo, which is being revamped into Park MGM, and a ""challenging comparison"" on the Las Vegas Strip in Q3. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped; results from Melco and U.S.-focused Boyd Gaming (BYD) and Penn National Gaming (PENN) were mixed.Shares in AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) soared after the telecoms reported better-than-expected wireless results amid stiff competition. AT&T narrowed its losses of high-spending postpaid phone subscribers while Verizon added more than forecast. AT&T says its strategy of packaging video and wireless services is jelling. Verizon says consumers are willing to pay a premium for its unlimited data services because of its high-performing network.Comcast (CMCSA) reported second-quarter profit and revenue that topped estimates, as NBCUniversal's filmed-entertainment business delivered strong box office results, but video subscriber losses were higher than expected. Citigroup speculated that Comcast could acquire Verizon. Charter Communications (CHTR) missed on earnings and sales, but shares soared amid speculation that it could be acquired as well.McDonald's (MCD) Q2 earnings and same-store sales topped estimates, helped by cheap drink offerings and ""premium"" menu items.

Domino's Pizza (DPZ) crashed in part on disappointing Q2 international comps, lower margins, an EPS helped by the tax rate and an already-high stock valuation. Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled after fiscal-Q3 same-store sales and revenue missed; EPS matched views. The coffee chain said it would close all 379 Teavana retail stores.Several industrial Dow giants rolled past Q2 estimates Tuesday thanks in part to improved global growth.

United Technologies (UTX) saw earnings climb 1.6% to $1.85 per share on a 2.7% revenue rise to $15.28 billion. Shares tumbled to their lowest level since May despite raised full-year EPS and revenue guidance. DuPont (DD) also beat on the top and bottom lines. Their Dow peer 3M (MMM) was an outlier with an overall miss, and shares tanked.Proofpoint (PFPT) reported Q2 profit and revenue that topped expectations and forecast current quarter sales and earnings just above consensus estimates. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection for corporate networks and cloud-computing infrastructure. Proofpoint rose modestly Friday morning. Fortinet (FTNT) posted mixed Q2 results that beat on EPS and revenue, but billings growth disappointed. The outlook for providers of computer-security software has yet to improve despite recent  ransomware attacks. Fortinet shares tumbled.TAL Education (TAL) topped earnings and sales estimates, as per-share profit of 43 cents and revenue of $321.9 million came out ahead of forecasts for 28 cents and $307.8 million.

Meanwhile, peer New Oriental Education (EDU) also pulled ahead of forecasts with 41 cents EPS and $486.4 million, in addition to a 36.9% bump in total student enrollments; the midpoint of Q1 revenue guidance pulled just ahead of current views. TAL and New Oriental shares rose 4.8% and 0.9%, respectively,  but the latter's breakout failed Thursday.Mastercard (MA) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue. Shares reversed modestly lower from a record high but remained in buy range.Baidu (BIDU) earnings rose 143%, well over views, while revenue climbed 14% to an in-line $3.08 billion.

352,MA,"A successful test flight for SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket could set up its first commercial launch just three to six months later, said SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk Monday.X So far, conditions look good for the rocket, the most powerful since the Apollo program's Saturn V, to have its first test flight on Tuesday, he told reporters on a conference call. The launch window opens at 1:30 p.m. ET.""Amazingly it's looking like we're going to launch tomorrow,"" said Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and will launch his Tesla Roadster on the rocket. ""We will have a good time no matter what happens.""If the Falcon Heavy's flight Tuesday goes well, SpaceX has said it plans to use the rocket to launch an Arabsat satellite built by Lockheed Martin (LMT) sometime early this year. The Falcon Heavy also will be used in the U.S. Air Force's Space Test Program-2 mission, which is comprised of military and scientific research satellites, as early as April.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Meanwhile, SpaceX's plans to use the Falcon Heavy to take tourists on a trip around the moon have changed.Last year, the company found that development of another deep-space rocket dubbed the ""BFR"" was moving along faster than anticipated, Musk said.That means it may not be necessary for SpaceX to qualify both the Falcon Heavy and BFR for crewed flights and instead just qualify the BFR, he added.But if the BFR winds up taking longer to develop, then SpaceX would revisit using the Falcon Heavy, which Musk said has the capability to go farther than the Apollo missions did.It's the part of the spacecraft where the crew would ride that is proving to be most difficult, and that's where development efforts are focused, he said.As a vessel envisioned for human exploration of other planets, Musk noted it must be designed for different re-entry speeds and different atmospheres on various planets, as well as takeoffs and landings on unimproved terrain.""The ship is by far the hardest part,"" he said, though he hopes to have it conducting short flights next year.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Space Industry News And Top Aerospace StocksSpaceX, Boeing To Take This Giant Leap For Space Industry In 2018

He went on to say: ""Our key ideas are Vantive, Total System Services, and PayPal, where improving fundamentals, debate narratives, and (merger) synergies could drive outperformance.""KeyBanc raised PayPal's price target to 64 from 60, Square's target to 28 from 22, and Vantive's to 73 from 70. Beck hiked Visa's price target to 105 from 100, Total System Services' target to 68 from 64, Mastercard's to 135 from 130, and First Data's to 20 from 18.PayPal has shifted its strategy to give consumers more payment options at checkout, such as using credit cards. PayPal in 2016 announced online check-out deals with credit card firms Visa and Mastercard.

360,MA,"What's the case in favor of actively managed stock mutual funds? Funds like $41 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX) are Exhibit A. Run by Larry Puglia since its inception in mid-1993, the fund's 24.13% gain this year going into Thursday topped 94% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.XThat blistering pace was achieved with a portfolio that, as of June 30, included Electronic Arts (EA), Netflix (NFLX), Celgene (CELG) and Mastercard (MA).Except for an occasional lag like last year when the fund trailed its peers 0.98% to 3.23% while the S&P 500 rallied 11.96%, outperforming is the norm for Puglia. His fund outlegged 97% of its peers over the past five years. And it has averaged a 10.7% yearly return in the nearly quarter century Puglia has been at the helm, outpacing 90% of its peers, all of which averaged 8.07%.Blue Chip Growth wins over the long term with a strategy that fund literature distills to a few key points: ""The fund primarily invests in the common stocks of large and medium-sized blue chip companies that have the potential for above-average earnings growth and are well established in their respective industries.""The ""blue chip"" part of its name does not mean it focuses on stodgy stocks, if you judge by the results. Instead, Puglia looks for companies that have carved out leading market positions, that are led by seasoned management teams, that stand on solid financial foundations and that have above-average earnings growth and profitability.Since growth stocks historically have been more volatile than cyclical companies and slower-growth companies, Puglia aims for sector diversification to dampen those ups and downs.Technology was his largest sector, with 39% of his shareholders' money allocated there as of July 31. Among his tech stocks, Electronic Arts is up 50% so far this year. Trading around 118, shares are within buy range of their 116.14 entry in a flat base.The online and software game producer is at the forefront of the gaming industry. The stock is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals. Its earnings per share rose 40%, 70% and 343% the past three quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Electronic Arts is the No. 1-ranked stock in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group thanks to traits like a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD and four quarters in a row of EPS acceleration.

The consensus of analysts is that EPS will tack on 23% EPS growth this quarter, after growing 36%, 27% and 26% the prior three stanzas.Financials are the fund's third-biggest weighting, at a little above 9%. Mastercard is up 29% this year. Trading around 133, shares are just beyond their 5% buy zone after clearing a 126.29 buy point.The company expects growth in transactions despite the mixed economy. The stock is yet another member of the IBD 50.Analysts expect the credit card network's EPS to rise 20% this year, on a 14% gain in revenue. That would mark the company's best performance on both lines since 2011.To improve its fraud detection technology, Mastercard recently agreed to acquire artificial intelligence software developer Brighterion.

PayPal users will be able to buy apps, music, movies, TV shows, and books, as well as Apple Music subscriptions and iCloud storage. A Loop Capital analyst, meanwhile, said in a report that PayPal should acquire Square (SQ), sending that stock in to a buy zone.

The Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories fell by 7.6 million barrels but domestic production rose to 9.397 million barrels per day up from 9.338 million barrels in the prior week. The EIA also cut its 2018 U.S. crude output forecast by 1% to 9.9 million bpd. OPEC expects demand for its oil next year to fall by 60,000 bpd to 32.2 million bpd as non-OPEC supply is seen climbing by 1.14 million bpd to 58.96 million bpd. OPEC compliance to its production cut deal fell to 78%, the lowest rate this year, according to an International Energy Agency report. But an earlier IEA report warned that shale drilling won't be enough to offset the drop in conventional drilling investment, which just hit its lowest mark in 70 years. IEA said a supply squeeze could be on the horizon.Shares in optical component makers rallied after Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) preannounced June-quarter profit and revenue above its earlier guidance and consensus estimates. Applied Optoelectronics shot up 25% for the week. Lumentum Holdings (LITE), Finisar (FNSR), and Oclaro (OCLR) all rallied Thursday. Applied Optoelectronics customers include Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB), which are upgrading data centers to superfast communications for cloud-based services. China remains a wild card for the telecom-fiber optics group. China's market was a bright spot last year as telecoms upgraded optical technologies for both 4G wireless networks and landline broadband services but demand has weakened.

Higher costs hurt the carrier's estimate-missing Q2 results and were seen by some analysts as holding back margin growth in Q3. Delta indicated that the worst of its unit-cost troubles are behind it. Delta also touted its efforts to divide up the flight cabin into different fare classes with different amenities, saying that could drive profits. Management added that the addition of larger jets would allow them to offer more premium services. Delta shares fell 1.8% on Thursday but was down just 0.6%.

High-end cosmetics maker Estee Lauder (EL) dipped but recovered by week's end. Meanwhile, fashion house Michael Kors (KORS) dropped 5.6% on a sell rating from MKM Partners and 26 price target.RELATED:Macy's Hits 7-Year Low, Ulta Slices 200-Day As Beauty Gets OldThe Air Force said that the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 is the most cost-effective way to modernize its aging fighter platforms, a day after Congress was warned of the program's rising costs in a Selected Acquisition Report submitted Monday.

383,MA,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with top executives from Apple (AAPL), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Amazon (AMZN) and others in the tech, banking and consumer industries  on Sunday, ahead of his meeting with President Trump on Monday.Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan attended a round table Sunday, along with Mondelez (MDLZ) CEO Irene Rosenfeld, Mastercard (MA) CEO Ajay Bhanga, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon,  David Rubenstein from the Carlyle Group and David Yergin from IHS Markit.The executives reportedly told Modi that India's tough business climate and bureaucracy make it hard to operate there, but Cook and Dimon said afterwards the meeting was  positive and productive.Wal-Mart (WMT) CEO Doug McMilon asked for a private meeting with Modi after the group meeting as the company looks to expand operations in India, according to a CNBC report,The big-box retailer has had trouble navigating India's regulatory system and in 2013 dissolved its joint venture, Bharti Wal-Mart, over corruption charges and other issues.Apple shares were up 0.1% at 146.39 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.

The deal would still need approval from Congress.Last week, Lockheed Martin (LMT) agreed to send its Texas-based F-16 production to India, if it secures a major fighter deal from New Delhi.Other possible defense deals between the U.S. and India could include Lockheed's C-130J and Boeing's (BA) P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft.Another topic on the table is the H-1B visa program, which Trump has put under review as part of his ""hire American buy American"" initiative. Without the visa, Indian IT workers would be shut out from working in Silicon Valley.Modi reportedly will highlight the jobs created by Indian-Americans and could use Infosys (INFY), an Indian IT company that pledged to hire 10,000 Americans, as an example a two-way street of investment in hiring between the U.S. and India.RELATED: Amazon's Reentry Into Smartphones Signals Battle For India E-Commerce

385,MA,"After a long absence, Apple (AAPL) made IBD's latest monthly list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, as it gets ready to unveil its latest iPhone, with one analyst saying the launch may be delayed due to production issues.X The tech giant was joined by a slew of medical sector stocks, including managed care providers UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), as well as leading biotech companies Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN).Defense contractors Boeing (BA), Raytheon (RTN) and Heico (HEI) also made the list, as tensions with North Korea and anticipated defense spending increases are expected to drive demand.Over the last three months, top fund managers invested over $1 billion each in four stocks on the list: UnitedHealth (99 funds, $1.39 billion invested), Apple (85, $1.36 billion), Electronic Arts (EA) (76, $1.25 billion) and Celgene (96, $1.07 billion).The heavy institutional buying has helped push Apple, Electronic Arts and Celgene into new buy zones, and has already lifted UnitedHealth beyond buy range.Seeing that stocks on your watch list are being bought by mutual fund managers with a proven track record of success is a positive sign, since it means they've done their due diligence and like what they see.But it doesn't mean the stocks are necessarily in or near a proper buy zone right now. More time may be needed for them to set up a proper buying opportunity.In addition to Apple and Celgene, stocks on this month's list that are forming a base or within buy ranges also include Boeing, medical software firm Cerner (CERN), and casino operator MGM Resorts (MGM).Apple has the distinction of making the new buys screen and also topping the list of new sells this month. The net number of funds selling Apple (151 selling minus 85 buying) was 66.Mastercard (MA) had the second-most net sellers (48), followed by NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) (45) and biotech giant Amgen (AMGN) (30).Despite the number of sellers, each of those stocks continues to show strength, and Amgen is testing a new potential buy zone. On Monday, Amgen jumped past a 182.70 entry in heavy volume. The buy range extends to 191.84.RELATED: Why Mutual Fund Managers Are Betting On Tech, 'Quality' StocksFind And Track The Best Mutual Funds

"
387,MA,"Sure, Amazon made a splashy invasion of the retail grocery space when it bought Whole Foods Markets a few months ago, but the e-commerce giant's Chinese counterpart, Alibaba (BABA), has been in that realm for quite some time now.XIt was two years ago that Alibaba decided it could make further inroads into the consumer psyche when it decided to start its own supermarket chain called Hema. Now there are 18 Hemas — not quite the 400-plus Whole Foods outlets that Amazon (AMZN) gained in one fell swoop with its $13.7 billion deal. Still, Alibaba has known for some time there was a reason to break into that sector, analysts say.For one, users with a Hema supermarket app hook up to Alibaba's e-commerce platform and payment system. They can then shop for groceries online and have them delivered or pick them up. Or they can order fresh food and have it prepared by Hema chefs. And they can pay for any of it using the Alibaba online payment platform Alipay. The idea is to draw customers deeper into Alibaba's consumer-facing ecosystem.""Historically, supermarket food delivery has been a difficult, low-profit category from an e-commerce perspective,"" Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told Investor's Business Daily. ""It doesn't make a ton of profit but the rationale is that it gets people to keep coming back to their online ecosystem, moving Alibaba from a customer acquisition phase to a customer engagement phase.""It's one reason why Alibaba stays vibrant and keeps growing even with revenue topping $23 billion a year and a market cap at more than $430 billion. The grocery business historically operates on the slimmest of margins, but Alibaba aims to make groceries just one part of its many businesses, interconnected via the digital economy, helping to ensure customer loyalty.Along with groceries, Alibaba has expanded into multiple facets of a digital economy, engaged in digital entertainment and movies, financial services and cloud computing, among other businesses.Alibaba also sees itself as a data company, having captured a significant amount of user data with more than half a billion people shopping on its platform that buy something at least once a month. That data has been used for, among other things, targeted advertising and product promotions. It also sells that data to help the sellers of products on Alibaba's e-commerce platforms better target buyers.As if all that wasn't enough, Alibaba also reportedly is working on its first brick-and-mortar mall, a five-story facility near company headquarters, scheduled to open in April, according to a report from China financial media outlet Caixin. The mall will exhibit a number of brands that are on Alibaba's e-commerce platform Taobao, as well as many conventional retail brands. It will also have a Hema grocery store.""We remain intrigued by Alibaba's 'new retail' platform and believe this offers the company another avenue of long-term growth,"" said Hottovy.If you don't know the story already, Alibaba was founded in 1999 in Hangzhou, China, but didn't gain widespread recognition until its blockbuster initial public offering in September 2014. It was the largest IPO ever on U.S. markets, raising $25 billion, with shares priced at 68. Alibaba stock this year is up about 93%. Shares ticked down slightly Friday to 170.25 in midday action.At the end of June, Alibaba said it had 466 million annual active customers and 529 million people visiting Alibaba sites via mobile devices.The company was launched by current Chairman Jack Ma and others, starting with an e-commerce platform for businesses. It then added another website for consumers and then several more. Alibaba emerged as the largest online shopping platform in China and accounts for about 75% of online transactions processed in that country, analysts estimate.""Over the past few quarters, we have constantly delivered superb results, and the market is gradually recognizing the significant value created by the Alibaba economy,"" Alibaba Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said during a conference call after the company reported earnings Aug. 17. ""We are committed more than ever to build a data-driven infrastructure for commerce in the area of the digital economy.""Alibaba's two core e-commerce platforms, which account for a majority of revenue, are Tmall and Taobao. Tmall is China's largest business-to-consumer platform, which retailers worldwide use to establish online stores. Taobao is China's largest consumer-to-consumer shopping site, similar to eBay (EBAY). Alibaba also operates on online wholesale marketplace, called 1688.com, among others.It also operates Cainiao Network, an affiliate that provides a logistics platform that links a network of delivery partners, warehouses and merchants to make package deliveries. Another growth area is its cloud-computing business, which has been growing revenue at a triple-digit rate.IBD'S TAKE: U.S.-listed China-based firms, particularly those catering to China's booming internet population, aren't suffering from lack of growth. Far from it, as names like Alibaba, JD.com, Baidu, Sina, Weibo and others continue to produce blockbuster earnings and sales. Alibaba is an IBD Leaderboard stock with a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99.Strength in e-commerce and contributions from its other business lines helped Alibaba beat the consensus estimate when it reported earnings in August. Revenue rose 56% from the year-ago quarter to $7.4 billion while adjusted earnings rose 60%.Revenue from Alibaba's nascent cloud computing business nearly doubled to $359 million, as paying cloud customers surged 75% to 1.01 million. Its e-commerce operation accounted for 86% of revenue. Digital media and entertainment accounted for 8%, while cloud computing added 5%.China lags behind the U.S. in cloud computing development by a wide margin but has plenty of opportunity to grow that business.""We see huge potential for China's public cloud market to catch up with the U.S., as the growing awareness of public clouds' benefits is driving a growing number of enterprises to adopt this service,"" said a report from DBS Group in July, when it initiated coverage on Alibaba with a buy rating and price target of 170.Several analysts raised their price target on Alibaba following the company's August earnings report, including Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. He raised his price target to 190 from 170.""Alibaba's scale, consumer data, and technological sophistication provides significant competitive advantages that will become even more pronounced going forward,"" Sebastian said in a note to clients.Alibaba's main competitor in the e-commerce field is China-based JD.com (JD), which has partnerships with Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY). Tencent is China's leader in mobile messaging and gaming, along with China search engine leader Baidu (BIDU).But Alibaba is different from Amazon or JD.com in that it does not warehouse the inventory. Alibaba serves as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. Alibaba gets a cut from the sale of goods on its platforms, known as its monetization rate, which is about 2.5% of gross merchandise sold.""Alibaba is more like a marketplace and JD more like a retailer,"" said Morningstar's Hottovy. ""JD is doing some interesting things but at the end of the day, Alibaba is the most preferred market for online consumers.""Still, Alibaba wants to make further inroads. Currently, e-commerce accounts for about 15% of total retail sales in China. Alibaba sees its new strategy as a way to capture more of the other 85% of retail sales that occur offline and at stores.Earlier this year, Alibaba completed the acquisition of Intime Retail Group for $2.6 billion. Intime operates roughly 49 department stores and shopping malls in China""Our goal is not to simply ride a wave of converting purchases from offline to online,"" said Joe Tsai, Alibaba executive vice chairman, on the company's August earnings call. ""Our new retail strategy is an invention that anticipates and catalyzes changes in consumer behavior where time, place and method of purchase and consumption will be different from what we were used to before.""RELATED:Alibaba Price-Target Increase Comes As China Stocks Stay StrongChina Stocks Battered As Profit-Taking Kicks In After Long Run-UpWhat Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailChinese Internet Giant Tencent Earnings Top, Revenue Soars 59%Is Amazon Closer To Fulfilling Dream Of Fast Grocery Delivery?

391,MA,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) fell Tuesday as markets weighed conflicting reports on how a laptop ban may be widened on U.S. flights.X Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that laptops may be banned from the main cabins on all flights into and out of the U.S., despite a lobbying effort from the airline industry, which sent executives from the top U.S. carriers to meet with him earlier this month.On Tuesday afternoon, Politico reported the U.S. won't ban the devices on flights to the U.S. from Europe, following a call between Kelly, European Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, and EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc.A few hours later, a Homeland Security Department spokesman reportedly said that Kelly told his European counterparts that the ban is is ""still on the table.""The U.S. has already banned electronic devices larger than smartphones from inbound flights on several Middle East-based airlines originating from several Middle Eastern and African airports.That restriction has hurt carriers like Emirates, which competes against Delta, United and American for lucrative trans-Atlantic traffic. Earlier this month, Emirates said it will reduce flights to several U.S. destinations, citing the device ban as well as tougher policies on security vetting and visas.Shares of Delta sold off 3% early, then halved their losses before closing down 3.4% at 49.06 on the stock market today. Other airlines followed similar patterns. United finished 2.5% lower, re-entering buy range after surging 4.2% last week on oil's latest sell-off. American fell 1.6%, still in buying territory. Southwest (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU), which have been adding flights to Latin America, both fell 2% but also are still in buy ranges. More domestic-focused carrier Alaska Air Group (ALK) lost 0.9%, and Hawaiian Holdings (HA) dipped 0.4%.Another factor potentially weighing on airline stocks is news that European budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) is looking to accelerate its global fleet growth with more narrow-body Boeing (BA) planes.The proliferation of low-cost carriers and the expansion of existing ones has turned the trans-Atlantic market into a cutthroat competitive environment and eroded the market share that Delta, United and American once commanded.U.S.-listed shares of Ryanair rose 1.45% to 107.76 and are well into profit-taking sell territory after breaking out last month.RELATED:If Airplane Device Ban Expands, It Could Cost You This Much Virgin's Branson Was Asked About Starting A New Airline; He Said ThisThese Airline Stocks Close In On Buy Points As Buffett Boosts Stakes

393,MA,"Stocks inched higher at Thursday's open, as unemployment and second-quarter productivity data were mixed, and as investors grappled with a heavy slate of early news.XThe Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all notched opening gains of less than 0.1%.Concerns over North Korea continued to hang over markets early Thursday, but stocks gained some early lift from news that the Trump administration had straight-armed Republicans in Congress. Trump instead brokered a deal with Democrats that would defer the potential for a government shutdown only to December and immediately free up $7.85 billion in relief funds for those affected by Hurricane Harvey in Houston and the Gulf Coast region. Republicans had sought for a longer-term extension on the debt ceiling, and to separate the question of Hurricane Harvey from the debt ceiling question.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.European markets ran higher following the U.S. budget news, and after the European Central Bank announced it would hold its monetary policy steady for now.  The bank is expected to begin tapering its $2.38 trillion quantitative easing program sometime before the end of the year. A news conference with ECB President Mario Draghi was scheduled following the policy announcement.With Houston and the rest of the Gulf only beginning to recover after Hurricane Harvey, the Caribbean's Leeward Islands are reporting heavy impact from Hurricane Irma. Barbuda reported 95% of structures on the island damaged and 60% of its 1,400 residents homeless. Eight people were reported dead on St. Martin and almost 1 million residents of Puerto Rico are estimated to be without electricity. Haiti and the Dominican Republic are next in line. The National Hurricane Center projects the storm will ease from a Category 5 to Category 4 before its potential landfall in Florida, estimated for late Saturday.Among Dow stocks, Visa (V) and Home Depot (HD) shared an early lead, each up 1.5%. The gain put Home Depot less than 2% below a 160.96 buy point in a flat base.Visa rose on sympathy strength from Mastercard (MA), which surged 3% at the open after the company raised its full-year revenue growth guidance to ""the high end of low double digits."" The gain bumped shares to a new high above a flat base buy point of 125.40.RH (RH), formerly Restoration Hardware, blasted 46% higher at the open. The high-end home furnishings retailer reported an across-the-board, second-quarter beat and stronger-than-expected guidance late Wednesday, adding a second quarter to its recovery. The gain hoisted shares straight up the right side of a month-long consolidation, to within 11% of the stock's July 20 high.China's New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) bolted 4% higher to lead the IBD 50 list in opening trade. Trade was heavy as the stock struggled to break recent resistance and move to new highs.IBD 50 peer Kemet (KEM) dropped 4% at the open, after announcing late Wednesday an 8.4 million share secondary offering. Kemet shares are extended and well above 10-week support following a strong breakout in May.Productivity surged 1.5% in the second quarter, according to the Labor Department, above the 1.3% jump expected by economists, vs. a 0.9% gain in the first quarter. Unit labor costs, meanwhile, rose a modest 0.2%, down sharply from the first quarter's 0.6% advance and below views for a 0.3% gain.First time unemployment claims jumped to 298,000 in the week ended Sept. 2, up from 236,00 in the prior week, with the impact of Hurricane Harvey along the Gulf Coast lifting results far above forecasts for a slight increase to 241,000. The four-week moving average angled up to 250,250, a broad step up from 236,750 a week earlier.RELATED:5 Stocks Near Buy Points As Market Rebounds: Investing Action Plan  These Four Top Tech Stocks Are A Warning Sign As Nasdaq Struggles With 50-Day LineIBD Investor Research Tools Getting Started With IBD

394,MA,"PayPal Holdings' (PYPL) relationship with former parent eBay (EBAY) bears watching, says Morgan Stanley, which upped its price target on the e-commerce stock but maintained an equal-weight rating.Analyst James Faucette on Tuesday bumped his price target on PayPal to 62 from 49. PayPal climbed 1.1% to close at 59.69 on the stock market today. Shares in PayPal are up 50% in 2017.Since it was spun off from eBay in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments service provider, while expanding from online checkout to mobile payments.EBay's online marketplace still uses PayPal for processing payments. According to Faucette, eBay represented 22% of PayPal's 2016 revenue and ""likely a higher percentage of profit.""""PayPal's preferential relationship with eBay is scheduled to end in 2020, with eBay able to experiment with new payment structure from 2018. We think it is probably safe to assume that there will be some (earnings) drag as the end of that agreement approaches,"" Faucette said in a note to clients. ""However, for now, our assumption is that any changes would serve to slow pricing and margin expansion rather than causing measurable negative impact. However, a worse case than we currently build in is certainly a possibility and a key source of investor concern.""IBD'S TAKE: PayPal shares have remained well above their 50-day moving average since breaking out in April. The stock holds a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD and continues to surge. It's now the No. 1-ranked stock in its group.PayPal has shifted its strategy to give consumers more payment options at checkout, such as using credit cards. PayPal in 2016 announced online checkout deals with credit card firms Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA).  PayPal announced in June that consumers will be able to use their PayPal account for purchases across Apple (AAPL) platforms.""With nearly 100% revenue exposure to e-commerce, a big online acceptance lead and good exposure to cross-border consumer spending, (PayPal) has significant industry tailwinds,"" added Faucette.RELATED:BitAuto Earnings Cruise Past Estimates, Guidance StrongHow Google And Others Could Be Profit Machines For AppleComcast Could Partner With Altice To Acquire Charter, Says Citigroup

395,MA,"Elon Musk has the kind of problem his fellow executives in Silicon Valley and Detroit would love to have: Demand for Tesla's (TSLA) electric cars is booming in China and its California factory is ""bursting at the seams.""XNow he may have the kind of solution that stokes their envy, too. Tesla is close to an agreement with the city of Shanghai to make vehicles in China for the first time, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal would further open the world's largest car market just as the government pushes to put more new-energy vehicles on the roads.The agreement allowing Tesla to build facilities in the city's Lingang development zone could come as soon as this week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are private.Details are being finalized, and the timing of the announcement could change. Tesla would need to set up a joint venture with at least one local partner under existing rules, and it isn't immediately clear who that would be.""Tesla sees an opportunity to create and lead a premium electric segment in China,"" Michael Dunne, president of consulting firm Dunne Automotive in Hong Kong, said in an email. ""Affluent and brand-driven Shanghai as a production base makes sense.""Tesla officials didn't respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Lingang didn't answer calls to his mobile phone.Reaching a deal to produce cars in China would help Tesla better compete with local rivals because it would eliminate a 25% import tariff that makes Tesla's Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles more costly than in U.S. showrooms.China has identified new-energy vehicles as a strategic emerging industry and aims to boost annual sales of plug-in hybrids and fully electric cars 10-fold in the next decade. A total of 283,000 EVs were sold there last year, making up 41% of global sales, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.About 15% of Tesla's $7 billion in revenue last year was generated in China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.""The EV industry in China is studying Tesla and taking inspiration from it,"" said Fu Yuwu, president of the government-backed Society of Automotive Engineers of China. ""It inspired a batch of Chinese startups who studied Tesla before they started their own business.""About 200 companies have announced plans to make new-energy vehicles in China, with billionaire backers such as Alibaba (BABA) chief Jack Ma, Tencent (TCEHY) founder Pony Ma, Foxconn head Terry Gou and business magnate Li Ka-shing. Domestic brands such as BAIC Motor Corp. and Warren Buffett-backed BYD (BYDDF) dominate the electric vehicle market with a combined 89% of sales, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Musk has been putting the pieces in place to compete. In March, he landed Tencent, China's second-most valuable internet company, as an investor with the owner of China's ubiquitous messaging app WeChat agreeing to spend $1.8 billion for 5% of Tesla.""An automobile is becoming a smart device,"" Tencent President Martin Lau said during a May 17 earnings call. ""We want to partner with the leading company in such fields.""Shenzhen-based Tencent didn't respond to a request for comment Tuesday. The company's Hong Kong-traded shares hit a record high, boosting its gains to 48% this year.A month after sealing the Tencent deal, Musk went to Beijing to meet with Vice Premier Wang Yang, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency.New models also will help Tesla compete in China, where unit sales of SUVs last year accounted for 37% of the passenger-vehicle market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Tesla plans to introduce the Model Y, a compact SUV, in 2019 at the earliest.Tesla made about 80,000 cars last year and aims to boost that to 500,000 annually by next year.""By localizing production in China, it will set a benchmark for Chinese automakers and motivate them to make bigger technological innovation,"" said Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association.A lot will depend on the manufacturing partner Tesla chooses. China requires overseas car makers such as General Motors (GM), Toyota Motor (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) to form joint ventures with locals in order to sell their brands there.The rule enacted two decades ago capped foreign investment at 50%, helping local brands develop manufacturing expertise while still profiting from sales of foreign marques. GM's Cadillac opened a $1.2 billion plant in Shanghai last year.""Tesla has Elon Musk, who is the Steve Jobs of EVs,"" said Wang Yunshi, director of the China Center for Energy and Transportation at the University of California, Davis. ""Chinese officials get inspired by Musk. He's a software guy who can come up with such capable cars, while so many engineers from our carmakers still cannot make something that decent.""

But just two analysts provided estimates to Thomson Reuters, representing a very thin ""consensus.""Results: Adjusted per-share loss of 0.24 yuan (about 3 cents) on revenue of 332.7 million yuan (about $48.3 million). Total student enrollment grew 20.6% to 27,785, and total seat capacity in learning centers expanded by 20% to 52,822.

""Our costs associated with the new centers and new courses were incurred ahead of the enrollment and revenue ramp, which contributed to the net loss of RMB24.6 million in the first quarter 2017, compared with a net loss of RMB 24.5 million in the same period last year. However, given the strong enrollment result in the first quarter and the healthy business fundamentals, we are confident in our overall revenue growth outlook for the full year of 2017.""Stock: Tarena dropped 2% late. Shares closed up 0.5% to 18.59 on the stock market today. Tarena broke out in early March and climbed above the zone a few weeks later.

Shares hit a record high but then reversed to close flat. New Oriental is now in profit-taking zone but has seen more choppiness in recent weeks.Days later, Tal Education (TAL), a provider of K-12 after-school tutoring, also beat earnings and sales views but gave weak guidance. Shares jumped early, then pared gains sharply on the results and have seen other intraday swings as well as big moves between trading days too.Shares of New Oriental closed up 2.4% Monday at 73.41, and Tal Education added 2% to 126.23.

Volume in the stock market today rose on both major exchanges.The Federal Reserve began its two-day meeting, but expectations were muted. The Street expects the Fed to stand pat on interest rates. CME Group's FedWatch Tool sees a less than 5% chance of a rate hike when the Fed wraps up its meeting Wednesday. However, the gauge sees about a 70% chance of a rate hike in June, including 3% who expect a half point increase rather than the usual quarter point.Blue chip stocks were mostly up early Tuesday.

407,MA,"The stock market's ascent has slowed since June. But Wells Fargo Growth Fund's Tom Ognar sees a buying opportunity for the kinds of growth stocks his fund holds, which include PayPal (PYPL), Alibaba (BABA), Nvidia (NVDA) and Netflix (NFLX).X""The market has been a little more defensive, and it seems some higher multiple stocks have corrected a little — but nothing too discouraging,"" said Ognar, who is lead manager of $4.4 billion Growth Fund (SGRAX). ""To us, it opens opportunities. It has made many secular growth stocks more attractively valued.""Those are the kinds of stocks that Ognar and co-managers Bruce Olson and Joseph Eberhardy aim for and that have fueled the fund's long-term outperformance. ""The Growth Fund has always had a bias (in favor of) investing in longer-term secular growth companies that exhibit robust and sustainable growth,"" Ognar said. Many are built for vigorous growth in a variety of economic conditions.That focus has driven the fund in the long term. Ognar has been a manager of this portfolio since May 2002. Going into Thursday, over the past 15 years the fund's 11.53% average annual gain outpaced 93% of its peer group tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the big-cap bogey's 9.01% average yearly gain.This year the fund has tacked on an additional 22.16%, topping 80% of its direct rivals, despite a rocky past three months during which the fund beat only 43% of its peers.Olson has been a co-manager since the start of 2005. Eberhardy has been a manager since late April 2008.The recent downturn is certainly not the only time that the managers have added to names they like. They added to positions in recent quarters in several favorites, including PayPal, Alibaba, Nvidia and Netflix.PayPal benefits from the shift to electronic payments for transactions. That trend is driven by the need to make electronic payments for online transactions. It's also driven by global governments' desire to track transactions so they can assess taxes. The stock is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks that have strong relative price strength and fundamentals.PayPal isn't the only holding that benefits from that trend. ""Square (SQ), Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), Global Payments (GPN) all benefit from the transition away from cash,"" Ognar said. ""The other big push for that (group) is the movement from offline, brick-and-mortar retailers to online retailers.""In addition, a change in PayPal's business strategy has cut a source of risk. ""PayPal has evolved its business model,"" Ognar said. ""It no longer fights with peers. It has made them more partners. It has signed partnerships with Visa and Mastercard, where it no longer creates barriers (for consumers) using Visa and Mastercard. Now it makes it easier for consumers to make payments through Visa and Mastercard using the PayPal platform.""Alibaba, China's leading online retail marketplace, benefits from the growth of online retail, the same trend that helps Amazon, Ognar notes, and it is diversifying geographically. ""We've felt there was an opportunity there since the (Alibaba) IPO,"" Ognar said.Both stocks are on Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play of top stocks.A third trend that the fund plays is ""the digitization of the economy and consumer,"" Ognar said. He added, ""It's a compelling growth opportunity for semiconductor firms,"" Ognar said. Chipmaker Nvidia, which is another member of the IBD 50, benefits from the shift toward more use of graphics processing units, away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as gaming, driverless and driver-assisted cars, and cryptocurrencies, as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence.EPS grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It earned that spot in part by posting a 56% jump in sales last quarter and a 27.6% annual pretax margin. You can compare its other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Portfolio newcomer Netflix is too small of a holding to be the poster child for any broad investment theme for the fund, Ognar says. Still, the stock popped 3.5% on Wednesday. IBD readers saw that the video-streaming service bounced off its 50-day moving average, rising toward a buy point.Among other holdings, Microchip Technology (MCHP) is another chipmaker that benefits from digitization of the economy and consumer. ""Electronics and digitization are influencing more of what we do and the products we use to do those things,"" Ognar said.Microchip Tech's products include signal microcontrollers. ""They're like little full-blown computers within thermostats in your home, the entertainment system of your car, or camera, or brake system of your car,"" he said.While the fund has trimmed its Microchip stake, the stock is still the fund's largest chipmaker. Shares are up 34% so far this year.The fund has trimmed stocks that have been big share-price gainers this year, including software titan Microsoft (MSFT) and video game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI), to reduce their weightings. ""It's more of a risk-management move as they've grown in position size, not because of a degradation in growth opportunities,"" Ognar said. RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?Are You A Newcomer To Stock Investing Who Wants A Few Pointers?

409,MA,"Even honest poker players yearn to know what cards other players are holding. Investors can gain a bit of the same insight into the stock market today by knowing what Fidelity Investments — whose army of stock mutual funds includes many that are actively looking for winning equities, not just passively tracking this or that index — is up to with its buys and sells.XIn the second quarter, among Fidelity's 100 top holdings, the biggest net buys by the Boston-based fund complex's stock mutual funds as a group were in Aetna (AET), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Oracle (ORCL), Marriott International (MAR) and British American Tobacco (BTI).Fidelity funds boosted their cumulative net share count in health insurer Aetna by nearly 36%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research for CFRA, working from the Capital IQ database and Fidelity's June 30 13-F filing with the SEC. IBD recently reported that Aetna is talking with Apple (AAPL) about offering free or discounted Apple Watches to Aetna customers.Fidelity managers increased their collective stake in online payment processor PayPal by 34%, in database and e-commerce software leader Oracle by nearly 34%, in hotel giant Marriott by just under 30% and in cigarette maker British American Tobacco by almost 21%.PayPal is the No. 1-ranked stock in IBD's Finance-Creditcard/Payment Processor industry group. It sports a best-possible Composite Rating of 99 from IBD. Consensus among analysts is that earnings per share will rise 22% this year.IBD'S TAKE: You can compare PayPal's other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Oracle's EPS grew 8% and 10% the past two quarters after sliding 3% in the prior stanza. The stock has an excellent A SMR Rating from IBD. That means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Marriott and Alibaba (BABA) have agreed to a joint venture that will let Alibaba users use the e-commerce giant's travel service platform, Fliggy, to book Marriott rooms, as IBD recently reported. Earlier this months Marriott reported better-than-expected earnings for the June quarter but gave weak guidance.Marriott International's (MARS) shares are forming a flat base, while Alibaba's are extended from an optimal buy point.British American Tobacco is 16% off its June 6 high and has a weak 31 Composite Rating.Individual Fidelity funds and managers can deviate from the overall net patterns.The technology sector remained Fidelity's largest cumulative sector, with a 27% weighting, Rosenbluth reported this week. The complex's six top individual stock holdings by combined market value in Fidelity portfolios were in fact tech stocks.Consumer electronics colossus Apple led the way with a $20.3 billion portfolio value, accounting for a 2.94% weighting. Social media mammoth Facebook (FB) was next, with an $18.1 billion portfolio value, with a 2.63% weighting.Third was Amazon (AMZN), a giant in e-commerce and web services, with a $14.4 billion portfolio value and 2.09% weighting. Classes A and C of Alphabet (GOOGL) were fourth and fifth, with values of $13 billion and $10.4 billion and weightings of 1.88% and 1.51% respectively. Software titan Microsoft (MSFT) was worth $9.5 billion to Fidelity, with a 1.38% weighting.Still, several of those favorites' allure faded in Fidelity's eyes. Fidelity sold 6.6 million shares of Apple, trimming its share count by 5%.

414,MA,"U.S. stock indexes loitered near the break-even line Friday morning, as the market headed toward a mixed finish for the week.The Nasdaq was down 0.1%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average sanded off 0.2%. The small cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.5%. Volume was in the stock market today was running lower on both major exchanges.For the week, the Nasdaq gunned for its fourth weekly gain in a row.

Apple (AAPL), McDonald's (MCD), Walt Disney (DIS) and Visa (V) were the only early gainers in the Dow.Trouble continued in the retail space, as J.C. Penney (JCP) piled ugly on ugly. The stock stumbled 7% Thursday and 9% early Friday and is now a below-$5 stock. Penney reported quarterly results before Friday's opening bell. Earnings came in almost 130% above the consensus target, but the market didn't seem to care.Penney's adjusted profit was 6 cents a share but part of that was from asset sales. Revenue was slightly softer than expected.Credit-card stocks have held up well despite the weakness in retail. Mastercard (MA) has moved sideways in soft trade in recent sessions, and Visa (V) has shown similar action. Both stocks are near 52-week highs and reported weeks ago. Mastercard's 29% earnings pop in Q1 was its biggest in at least 19 quarters. Visa's 26% earnings gain was its third quarter in a row of EPS growth at or above 25%.Another area of strength in retail is the restaurant group.

419,MA,"Apple (AAPL) initially fell more than 1% Monday but trimmed its losses to around 0.6% at 156.70 as the major indexes continued to avoid an eclipse of their strong year-to-date gains.XBy late afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were nearly break-even, while the Nasdaq composite limited its loss to 0.2%. The Nasdaq 100 was also off 0.2% and is trying to stay near its flattening 50-day moving average.Volume was running sharply lower on both main exchanges; Friday saw the expiration of weekly and monthly equity and index options.Apple on Aug. 2 cleared a 156.75 flat-base entry and only has gained roughly 3.7%. As seen on a daily chart, the stock has shown zigzagging action, briefly slipping below the proper entry three times already. However, no sell signal has triggered for now.At 156.68, shares are just 3% below the all-time peak of 162.51, while small-cap indexes have dipped more. The S&P SmallCap 600, off 0.1%, has fallen 6% below its all-time peak of 878.At 5779, the Nasdaq 100 is up 18.8% since Jan. 1, far outstripping the S&P 500's 8.4% lift.Losing stocks are edging out winners on the Nasdaq by a 4-to-3 margin. But on the NYSE, advancers are leading decliners by a slim margin of fewer than 100 issues.As e-commerce activity does not show signs of letting up anytime soon, at least five top operators in the retailing space have fallen much more than the major equity benchmarks. All but one have triggered new sell signals.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) continued to fade, sinking nearly 4% to 235.49. The cosmetics and hair care products chain has broken through support at the 200-day moving average near 270 and failed to lift back above the long-term support line. Notice, too, how the stock's 50-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day line. That's bearish.Wall Street expects July-ended fiscal Q3 earnings rising 24% to $1.78 a share. That's a decent gain, but a little shy of the 25% increase one would expect from a CAN SLIM market leader. Plus, it would mark a considerable slowdown from EPS gains of 26%, 33% and 41% in the prior three quarters.Target (TGT) (18 Relative Price Strength) is trying to bottom out after falling as much as 17.6% in the past three months. Check out the week ended July 28, when the giant discount chain fell hard during the week but ended it with a solid 1% gain in sharply higher gain. Such reversals at the bottom of a stock's decline are bullish.But Target, which still depends a lot on consumers to visit their stores to keep sales flowing, needs to rise back above the 40-week moving average (roughly equivalent to a 200-day moving average on a daily chart) to show that institutional investors are seriously accumulating shares. For now, Target is just 11% below the 52-week high.Target is forecast to grow FY 2018 earnings by 11% to $3.92 a share. But the 1.8% annualized dividend yield is inferior to the S&P 500 (around 1.9%).Home Depot (HD), the biggest gainer in the 30-stock Dow, rose more than 1.3% to 149.62 and is currently forming a new base. It recently posted a 14% EPS increase for the second quarter, marking a 14th quarter in a row of double-digit earnings-per-share growth.The IBD Big Cap 20 doesn't currently hold any traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. However, consumer-oriented firms help pack the list, including Mastercard (MA), PayPal (PYPL), energy drink marketer Monster Beverage (MNST) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL).Michael Kors (KORS) and Five Below (FIVE) are trying to buck the general sell-off in the apparel and discount retail sectors, respectively.Michael Kors, famous for its jet set-styled handbags and clothing, may be working on a new bottoming-base pattern, which would be first stage. The stock had collapsed more than 60% from a February 2014 peak near 101. But shares are now up more than 15% in August so far and are on track for a third monthly advance. Quiet action from here would possibly yield a new buy point near recent upside resistance, at 46.Kors' Q2 profit dropped 11% to 80 cents a share, but that was a far smaller decline than viewed. Sales fell 4% to $952.4 million, marking a fourth quarter in a row of shrinking sales.Five Below, which sells toys, accessories and clothing for $5 each or less, rallied more than 3% to 48.58. A cup-with-handle base is forming. For now, the Philadelphia-based retailer shows a legitimate entry of 51.62, 10 cents above the two-week handle's high. The base barely passes the midpoint test (handle's midpoint is 49.29, base midpoint 49.21).Five Below holds a decent Composite Rating of 87 on a scale of 1 to 99 from Stock Checkup, second only to group peer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI). Five Below shows an excellent A grade for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + ROE) but the 54 RS Rating needs more work.RELATED:Here Is The Easy And Fast Way To Spot Major Market Tops Before Stocks CrashIBD Sector Leaders: Why YY Is Leading The Market, Fundamentals And Technicals-WiseStocks Near A Buy ZoneThe Best Large Cap Growth Firms Today: Inside Big Cap 20

424,MA,"Credit-card giants and Dow Jones industrial average components American Express (AXP) and Visa (V) report quarterly earnings this week.Here's a look at what to expect.American Express reports Q1 earnings late Wednesday. Analysts expect earnings per share to fall 12% to $1.28, with revenue down 4% to $7.746 billion.The results will come as American Express tries to keep its cards at the top of the rotation in wealthier consumers' wallets. The card issuer last month said it would give Platinum Card holders five-times rewards points to eligible hotels and $200 worth in credits for ride-hailing service Uber.AmEx has had to compete with the perks that adorn JPMorgan Chase's Sapphire Reserve card, which a recent  New York Times story indicated had begun to attract more millennials. That generation's tastes lean more toward meaningful experiences, rather than the traditional standards of luxury to which AmEx has appealed in years past.Longtime AmEx partners Costco (COST) and JetBlue (JBLU) also left the card issuer last year.Shares of AmEx were up 1.15% at 76.67 on the stock market today.Visa reports fiscal Q2 earnings late Thursday. Wall Street expects EPS to climb 16% to 79 cents on a 19% hike in revenue to $4.308 billion.To some extent, American Express' losses have been Visa's gains. Costco switched to Visa after its relationship with AmEx ended.USAA, which issues debit and credit cards, has also begun using Visa after a long partnership with MasterCard (MA).Visa also stands to benefit from its acquisition of Visa Europe, ever-digitizing forms of payments, and international growth.""Governments and emerging middle classes are leading the way to digitize more payments in developing countries, while e-commerce is displacing cash and check in developed countries,"" CEO Alfred Kelly said on the company's Q1 earnings call in February.Shares of Visa were up 1.1% at 89.82, remaining above buy range after breaking out in early February.RELATED:MasterCard Tops On Q4 Earnings, Revenue Just MissesAmazon Sales, Outlook Weak; Visa, Amgen Beat; Chipotle Profit Misses

But shares of Ryanair (RYAAY) and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (GOL) are flashing buy signals with Southwest Airlines (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU) not far behind. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL) will report Q1 results, the first airline and the first big company to issue financials this earnings season.U.S.-listed shares of Brazilian airline Gol jumped 7.1% to close at 32.90 on the stock market today, clearing a 31.92 buy point. The stock has been helped by the trading debut of Azul Linhas Aereas Brasileiras (AZUL), Brazil's third-largest airline by passengers, which climbed 7.2% to 21.50 after pricing American depository shares at about 20.06 Monday and raising $571.2 million.

430,MA,"JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) is barreling down the fast lane. Manager Giri Devulapally's fuel? Lots of financial and technology stocks, including Morgan Stanley (MS), Mastercard (MA) and Applied Materials (AMAT).X (IBD)And amid a Friday rally by the broad market as of midday, key fund holdings are rising too.Chip gear maker Applied Materials was up 2.92%. Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) was up 1.77%. Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN), maker of the Eylea macular degeneration eye treatment, was up 1.35%. Consumer electronics colossus Apple (AAPL) was up 0.84%. And credit card provider Visa (V) was up 0.69%.The $12.5 billion fund was up 23.04% this year going into Friday, topping 94% of its large-cap growth fund peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., which averaged 15.66%. The S&P 500 was up 9.96%. The mutual fund's 23.23% gain the past 12 months topped 96% of its peers as well as the S&P 500.How has the fund achieved such eye-popping gains? It starts with the fund's investment approach. Fund literature boils it down to: ""Targeting companies with large markets, sustainable competitive advantages and strong price momentum, the Large Cap Growth Fund seeks to harness the return potential of America's fastest-growing companies.""The fund is rare in its naming strong price momentum as a trait sought in stocks and indicates acknowledgement that technical analysis plays an important role in its stock selection.Financials and tech were JPMorgan Large Cap Growth's largest sector overweights as of June 30 vs. its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index.Devulapally recently told shareholders that among financials he still has ""a positive view on companies with exposure to capital markets and interest rates."" His information technology overweight, he added, ""continues to be driven by a variety of industries, such as payments, semiconductors, video games, software and mobility.""That outlook has led Devulapally's fund to such holdings as money-center bank Morgan Stanley. The stock is up 9% so far this year.Brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW), up 1% this year, benefits from the float on customers' cash. Float is profit on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account. Rising interest rates lift the profit on float.In the tech stock grouping, credit payment processor Mastercard is up 28% this year. Chip gear maker Applied Materials is up 38%.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA), another member of the IBD 50, is up 49% this year. Earnings per share grew 40%, 70% and 343% the past three quarters. That's a nice rally from the prior two quarters, in which EPS fell.In the software space, digital media and marketing software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) vaulted past Wall Street's estimates for its fiscal second quarter on June 20, reporting accelerating sales and earnings growth for the period. It also guided analysts higher for Q3. EPS grew 45%, 42% and 44% the past three stanzas.Its digital media segment provided 68% of total corporate Q2 revenue.And online payment processor PayPal (PYPL), an IBD 50 stock, is up 51% this year.Among other holdings, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) has an IBD Composite Rating of 98.Share price has soared 104% this year. Strong data for a triple-pill to treat the underlying genetic mutations tied to cystic fibrosis have been a key driver of the stock. The biotech company expects to spend more in research and development costs for the year as it continues development of its triple-pill.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), yet another member of the IBD 50, benefits from the shift toward more use of graphics processing units, away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as gaming, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.EPS grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters.Nvidia is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It earned that spot in part by posting a 56% jump in sales last quarter and a 27.6% annual pretax margin. You can compare its other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.What else does the fund have going for it? Large-cap stock mutual funds have outperformed other U.S. diversified stock fund categories over the past six and 12 months as well as the past two, three and five years. Reflecting this fund's commitment to large-cap stocks, it owns four Dow Jones Industrial stocks: Visa, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple and Home Depot (HD).Visa, which is also one of the fund's payments stocks, is up 32% this year.Software titan Microsoft is up 17% this year.IPhone maker Apple, up 37% this year, is another one of Devulapally's mobility stocks.Home improvement retailer Home Depot fell nearly 3% on Tuesday. The company reported Q2 results that beat Wall Street expectations. But, as IBD reported, analysts see a potential slowdown in its stronger full-year outlook.After pulling back Thursday and Friday, shares were up 10% for the year.RELATED:Reynolds American Bolsters JPMorgan Large Cap Growth FundHow To Make Your Boss Add $76K To Your 401(k)

433,MA,"Mastercard (MA) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings before Thursday's market open.XEstimates: Analysts expect an 8% EPS gain to $1.04 with revenue up 10.5% to $2.978 billion.Results: EPS climbed 24% to $1.10 a share. Revenue rose 13% to $3.05 billion. Adjusted gross dollar volume and purchase volumes both increased 9%.Stock: Shares fell 1.5% to 127, ending a 14-day winning streak. Mastercard popped to 132.20 shortly after the opening bell on the stock market today, but reversed to trade down as low as 126.55, nearly undercuttinga  126.29 buy point from a flat-base cleared on July 14.Mastercard has had a few above-average-volume days in its breakout move, but not many.Mastercard has a Composite Rating of 96, which means it outperforms 98% of all stocks based on a variety of fundamental criteria. Big stock winners often have 95+ Composite Ratings near the start of their big runs.IBD'S TAKE: Despite Mastercard's 96 Composite Rating, it's only the seventh-best stock in the Finance-Credit Card/Payment group. To see which payment stocks are the real leaders, and how they stack up vs. objective criteria, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Visa (V) and American Express (AXP), which reported earnings last week, are in buy ranges.

434,MA,"Futures for the S&P 500 index and especially the Nasdaq 100 rallied early Thursday, fueled by Facebook (FB) rallying late on its strong Q2 earnings. Facebook's fellow FANG stock Amazon.com (AMZN) is on tap Thursday evening, with Amazon shares currently in buy range. Electronic Arts (EA), Baidu (BIDU) and Mastercard (MA) also are in buy zones with earnings set for Thursday.XAmazon, Electronic Arts and Mastercard all have stellar Composite Ratings of 95 or above, while Baidu's is a solid 83. But three of the four stocks have already moved into the upper half of their 5% chase zones, with Amazon's chart offering additional reasons to be wary.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.15% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.55%, with Facebook trading 4% higher in the after-hours session. PayPal (PYPL) and Lam Research (LRCX) also contributed with after-hours earnings gains. Futures for the Dow industrials ticked 0.1% higher.All eyes will be on the e-commerce giant Thursday. Economists expect a 21% earnings per share drop to $1.40, with revenue up 22% to $37.214 billion.Amazon apparently had a successful Prime Day on July 10, with big sales of its Alexa-enabled Echo speakers as well as new Prime memberships. But those won't be included in Q2's results.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. That options strategy is highlighted in IBD's weekly Earnings Preview column.Amazon rose 1.2% to 1,052.80 in Wednesday stock market trading. That's above a 1,016.60 flat-base buy point. The 5% chase zone rises to 1,067.43, so Amazon is still buyable. However, it's always better to buy as close to the entry point as possible to minimize the potential losses. Amazon is 3.6% above the entry as of Wednesday, and was trading at 1,061.50 in premarket trading.Meanwhile, Amazon cleared a fourth-stage base. Late-stage patterns are more prone to failure. Also, Amazon's breakout came on lackluster volume.On the upside, Amazon's relative strength line is at new highs, a bullish sign and reflecting the stock's outperformance of the S&P 500.Amazon has a 98 Composite Rating, which means it outperforms 98% of all stocks based on a variety of fundamental criteria. Big stock winners often have 95+ Composite Ratings near the start of their big runs.The Chinese search giant has struggled in recent quarters, especially in comparison to many other Chinese internet giants. Baidu is making a big throw on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence. In the meantime, analysts expect Baidu to report Q2 EPS of $1.42, up 16%, on revenue of $2.78 billion, up 1%.Baidu climbed 2.1% to 201.17 on Wednesday. The stock was still within buy range from a cup base at a 193.84 entry, though it's nearly 4% above that point. You could also view Baidu as being within a pattern going back into 2016, but the buy point would remain the same.Baidu has the opposite problem of Amazon. Baidu is in a first-stage base, but because the stock has largely gone sideways over the past year, its relative strength line is lagging.Electronic Arts is expected to report EPS of 28 cents, up 300% vs. a year earlier. Revenue should climb 12% to $766 million.The video game publisher's stock broke out on Wednesday, rising 3.8% to 118, clearing a 116.14 flat-base buy point with volume that was 41% above normal. Electronic Arts has a 95 Composite Rating and a strong RS line.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is at new-high ground, while Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) cleared an entry point on Tuesday.Mastercard reports before the market open. Analysts expect an 8% EPS gain to $1.04 with revenue up 10.5% to $2.978 billion.Mastercard rose 0.8% to 130.99, its 14th straight gain, mostly in small doses. The stock cleared a flat-base entry of 126.29 on July 14 and is now 3.7% above that level. Mastercard has had a few above-average-volume days in its breakout move, but not many.Visa (V) and American Express (AXP), which reported earnings last week, are in the upper end of buy ranges. PayPal, which topped views late Wednesday, and Square (SQ), are among the other recent stock breakouts in the finance-payment group, though they are both extended.RELATED:Facebook Earnings Soar; Users Hit New Milestone4 Big Earnings You Can't Miss Thursday: Investing Action PlanVideo Game, Chip Stocks Climb To New Buy PointsHere's What Analysts Are Saying About Amazon Ahead Of Earnings

435,MA,"CSX (CSX) easily topped Q2 forecasts as the rail sector rebounds from year-ago results weighed down by weak commodities, but also suggested shareholder returns may not be as bountiful.XThe railroad operator will be followed by Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) on Wednesday, Union Pacific (UNP) on Thursday, Kansas City Southern (KSU) on Friday and Norfolk Southern (NSC) on July 26.Estimates: CSX's Q2 EPS is expected to climb 25.5% to 59 cents as revenue grows 5.4% to $2.85 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: Adjusted EPS of 64 cents as revenue increased 8%, with growth across nearly all markets. Gains were driven largely by coal, stronger pricing and volumes, as well as a recovery in fuel.Buyback: The board authorized an additional $500 million for the current share repurchase program, which now totals $1.5 billion.""At the same time, the company is currently evaluating its cash deployment strategy with respect to capital structure and shareholder distributions, and is committed to an investment grade rating,"" according to CSX's earnings statement.Stock: CSX sank 3.9% late after climbing nearly 4% initially. Shares closed virtually unchanged at 54.64 on the stock market today, still extended beyond buy range after breaking out in April.The outlook for CSX and its peers has been looking cloudier lately. While shale companies are back pumping more oil, and shipping it over rails, U.S. crude prices have fallen below $50 a barrel again, resulting in recent wobbles in drilling activity as well as domestic output.Meanwhile, slowing demand for autos could be another headwind in shipping, and U.S. sales have been steadily declining this year after setting a record high last year.Another concern is the consumer sector. U.S. retail sales in June unexpectedly slipped. And even excluding autos, gasoline, building materials and food services, sales were still lower vs. the prior month.Still, CSX on Tuesday backed its full-year EPS growth outlook of about 25%, below consensus for 27% growth.

437,MA,"PayPal Holdings (PYPL) reports second-quarter earnings late Wednesday amid a big stock run-up on stellar first-quarter results, but Wall Street is wondering whether a more subdued report is inevitable this time around.XShares are up 47% in 2017, reaching an all-time high on July 20, with most of the gain coming after its first-quarter beat-and-raise. Analysts estimate that PayPal will earn 43 cents per share, up 19% from a year earlier, with revenue rising 16.7% to $3.09 billion.""PayPal's recent momentum has investors wondering what exactly is baked in,"" Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette said in a note to clients. ""Investors don't seem to expect massive blowout results, and instead are focused on key levers that can deliver upside.Faucette has an equal-weight rating on the stock.At Jefferies, analyst Ramsey El-Assal said in a note: ""Given elevated investor expectations going into Q2 earnings, this quarter has less catalyst potential than last.""Shares in PayPal edged up 0.8% near 58.75 in premarket trades on the stock market today.Since it was spun off from eBay in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments service provider, while expanding from online check-out to mobile payments.Like Amazon.com (AMZN), analysts expect PayPal to gain as consumers shift to online shopping.Citigroup analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar says other second-quarter metrics investors will be watching include user growth and total payment volume. PayPal had 203 million active consumer accounts as of March 31, up from 197 million in the previous quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Which companies are hitting 52-week highs? That easy to find at IBD's New Highs, but that list goes one big step better. That is, it ranks the companies making new highs by Composite Rating. So the best are at the top, making this a quick and easy read to find stocks for your watch list.PayPal announced in June that consumers will be able to use their PayPal account for purchases across Apple (AAPL) platforms.PayPal has shifted its strategy to give consumers more payment options at checkout, such as using credit cards. PayPal in 2016 announced online checkout deals with credit card firms Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA).Analysts have been looking for an update on PayPal's ""asset-light"" strategy. The company may sell off its credit business, which makes loans to small businesses.RELATED:How These Two Online Payment Processors Figure In Future MergersElectronic Payment Sector Swipes Ahead Of S&P, Gets Price HikesSecond Payment Stock Breaks Out, This Time On Apple DealThis Top Payment Stock Is In A Buy Zone; Analyst Says PayPal Should Buy It

Apple has the world's largest market cap at $769 billion, with shares trading at all-time highs. Investors are looking past current sluggish growth to the iPhone 8 — and possible dividend hikes and new buybacks. And Apple's results and guidance are likely to have a big impact on a slew of suppliers, especially chipmakers.Several other megacaps are on tap, including drug giants Pfizer and Merck before the open. Like Apple, Pfizer and Merck are part of the Dow industrials, which continue to lag, falling slightly Monday as the Nasdaq composite powered to a new all-time high — thanks to Apple, Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN) and other big-cap techs.Altria (MO), CVS Health (CVS), ConocoPhillips (COP), Emerson Electric (EMR), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Mondelez (MDLZ) round out the S&P 100 companies on tap.Late Monday, Dow and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.1% above fair value.

442,MA,"As the cryptocurrency market cap cracks the $100 billion barrier, digital cash like bitcoin has become increasingly difficult for finance's old guard to ignore.XGoldman Sachs (GS) in a note this week outlined the basics of bitcoin investing to clients. CBOE Holdings (CBOE) last week said it planned to debut its own bitcoin futures. Fidelity Investments on Wednesday said it partnered with Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, in a test project that allows most customers to view data on Fidelity.com which shows the digital cash they hold on that exchange.""This integration demonstrates the continued commitment of traditional financial institutions to adopt digital assets and widen access for customers,"" Coinbase said in a blog post about the Fidelity test.But actually allowing clients to trade bitcoin? That could take some time for the nation's largest financial institutions.Even as bigger investors step into the bitcoin arena, regulations across the world are inconsistent, observers say. Access to an exchange where someone can trade bitcoin depends on geographic location. Different states have different license requirements. Regulatory agencies might have different rules around trading cryptocurrency from nation to nation.Goldman, in its note, also pointed out that the market was still relatively small and subject to whipsaw price swings, but that investors could use block trading for bigger orders.""What the big players and the reputable companies need is, in particular, a legal and regulatory stable environment,"" said Marco Khron, CFO of Genesis Mining, a bitcoin mining company. ""They are reluctant also because, or in part because, some of it is kind of a new area for them.""Bitcoin and blockchain — the ledger technology that underpins bitcoin transactions — are ""emerging from their infancy, but mass adoption is still many years away,"" Hadley Stern, senior vice president and managing director at Fidelity's R&D unit, Fidelity Labs, said in a statement on Wednesday.Still, Coinbase Partnerships Lead Kristen Stone, in an email, said the company has seen a ""significant uptick"" in interest from bigger financial players. The company said that over the past six months, financial firms like hedge funds and proprietary trading firms have started trading bitcoin and ether, another digital currency. Many were still exploring the possibilities, but a few had started to test strategies in the market, she said.""As bitcoin liquidity increases, I expect that major US banks would also become interested in exploring the space,"" she said.The moves from the larger financial institutions come during an eventful few weeks for bitcoin. After a dispute over the best way to speed transaction-processing, a portion of the bitcoin community this month spun off Bitcoin Cash, an offshoot of bitcoin. Bitcoin surged to a record high earlier this week, while Bitcoin Cash nose-dived, possibly as more traders flocked to bitcoin or returned to it after waiting out the split, an analyst told Bloomberg.Bitcoin's prices can be sensitive, twitching higher or lower depending on when a bigger investor makes a move. Perception also goes a long way.""People's impression of how valuable this is, because the market is still fairly young, is more important than, let's say, when you're trading equities or certain fixed income, or traditional and regulated asset classes,"" said Lex Sokolin, global director, fintech strategy at Autonomous Research.That proneness to volatility has attracted traders with an appetite for risk. Bitcoin also tends to move independently from stocks and bonds. The currency is also seen as a cushion against political turmoil, given its ""decentralized structure,"" according to a statement from crypto-asset broker Bitcoin Suisse.Banks' adoption of blockchain, the ledger technology that is the basis for bitcoin transactions, has already been widespread. At least one bank has become more open to trading bitcoin.Switzerland's Falcon Private Bank said last month that it got the OK from regulators to allow clients to buy, sell and hold bitcoin through the bank. The bank will be working with Bitcoin Suisse to provide that service to clients.Meanwhile, the currency continues to attract investment firms sometimes backed by more well-known, deep-pocketed names. The Digital Currency Group has gotten investment money from Mastercard (MA) and Bain Capital Ventures. Pantera Capital, another cyrptocurrency-centric firm, has a bitcoin investment fund that has been backed by the likes of Fortress Investment Group.Harmonizing regulations could take time. Fraud and security remain concerns for traditional investors.The SEC in July said that U.S. securities law ""may apply"" to offers of digital assets like popular Initial Coin Offerings, which raise funds via digital assets. But the cryptocurrency market could claim more victims before solid rules are established.""I think the question is: How much money do people first need to lose in order for a regulator to step in?"" Sokolin said.Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup (C) declined to answer questions about their plans for bitcoin trading. JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs did not respond to requests for an interview.But Goldman analysts, in their note to clients, signaled that cryptocurrencies are no longer a fringe, cyberpunk endeavor.""Indeed the debate has shifted from the legitimacy of the 'fiat of the internet' to how fast new entrants are raising funds,"" Goldman analysts said in a recent note that contained an FAQ to clients.""Whether or not you believe in the merit of investing in cryptocurrencies (you know who you are) real dollars are at work here and warrant watching especially in light of the growing world of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and fundraising that now exceeds Internet Angel and Seed investing,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), an exchange traded fund tailored to the price of the digital currency, rose 10% in the stock market today.RELATED:Frustrated JPMorgan CEO Unleashes This Tirade On U.S. 'Stupidity'Here Is The First Bank To Warn On The Q3 Trading Environment

444,MA,"ConocoPhillips (COP) agreed to sell an interest in an oil-sands partnership as well as most of its Western Canada Deep Basin gas assets for a combined $13.3 billion, allowing the oil and gas company to reduce its debt and double its repurchase program to $6 billion.Conoco is selling its 50% nonoperated interest in the Foster Creek-Christina Lake oil sands partnership and the gas assets to Cenovus Energy (CVE). In return, the Houston-based company will get $10.6 billion in cash and 208 million Cenovus shares valued at $2.7 billion. Conoco will also get contingent payments if Canadian crude prices hit certain levels.With the sale, the company will be able to reduce its debt to $20 billion, providing more leeway to return capital to shareholders.In January, Conoco raised its quarterly dividend 6% to 26.5 cents, after slashing it by 66% last year as it coped with the oil price bust.Shares jumped 6% in late trading on the stock market today, after closing up 1.3% at 45.95 in the regular session. Cenovus Energy fell 7% in late trading.For its buyback, Conoco will triple its planned 2017 repurchase to $3 billion from $1 billion, with the remaining $3 billion allocated to 2018 and 2019.""We laid out a bold and unique value proposition in late 2016 that was focused on free cash flow generation, a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders, disciplined growth and improved returns,"" Chairman and CEO Ryan Lance said in a statement.""Our stated plan was to accelerate our value proposition by reducing debt with asset sales. Clearly, this transaction significantly accelerates those efforts and provides an important catalyst that should allow investors to have clarity and confidence in our future direction. Today's announcement clears the way for us to execute a plan that we believe will create long-term value and deliver double-digit returns to shareholders annually.""In Q4, Conoco's revenue rose for the first time since 2014 as oil prices rebounded, and its 2017 capital spending forecast of $5 billion is up from $4.9 billion in 2016.But as the recovery in crude has stalled with prices trending lower since the start of the year, high-cost oil sands projects have been less attractive.Earlier this month, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) agreed to sell its Canadian oil sands interests to Canadian Natural and reduce its share in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project to 10% from 60%.

GM also said later Einhorn's plan would have no positive effects on business and would lead to a cut in its credit rating.Shares of GM climbed 2.5% to close at 35.56 on the stock market today, indicating a market cap of $53.7 billion. Rival Ford (F) rallied 1.7% to 11.65 as it announced $1.2 billion in previously planned investments in three Michigan factories, and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) gained 2% to 11.13.Auto shares were hammered last week on a series of troubling signs for the industry.On Thursday, Ford gave Q1 earnings guidance that was well below consensus, citing weaker demand, higher costs and lower used-car prices, among other things.Last Tuesday, lender Ally Financial (ALLY) warned on profit, citing weaker auto prices. And Fitch Ratings said Wednesday that falling used-car prices and a shakier subprime loan market will put pressure on lenders.""Subprime credit losses are accelerating faster than the prime segment, and this trend is likely to continue as a result of looser underwriting standards by lenders in recent years,"" Fitch Ratings Director Michael Taiano said in a statement.Fitch added that lower prices for used cars ""have accelerated more recently which will likely pressure recovery values on defaulted loans and lease residuals.""Morgan Stanley recently issued a bearish note on Ford, saying Ford Credit is particularly exposed to falling used-car prices. Ford said it continues to expect Ford Credit's pretax profit to be about $1.5 billion in 2017 and to improve in 2018.

447,MA,"PayPal (PYPL) and JPMorgan (JPM) will join forces in an effort to boost their online payment services, easing the way for Chase credit card customers to link to PayPal accounts.XThe deal aligns with PayPal's strategy to give consumers more payment options at checkout, such as using credit cards. Last year PayPal announced online check-out deals with Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA).As part of the deal, PayPal now process payments on the ChaseNet payment network. JPMorgan will offer customers the option of paying with Chase rewards points when linked through Chase Pay at PayPal's millions of online merchants, the companies said in a press release. The agreement should help JPMorgan advance Chase Pay, a payment method accepted by some large merchants such as Starbucks (SBUX) but has relatively few agreement with e-commerce and technology firms.""This partnership is about deepening our relationship and leveraging each other's core assets to deliver simple, secure and truly transformative payment experiences for our joint customers,"" Dan Schulman, PayPal's chief executive, said in prepared remarks.PayPal stock climbed 1.3% to close at 59.09 on the stock market today, hitting a record high.

448,MA,"Dow Jones industrial average components American Express (AXP) and Visa (V) report quarterly earnings on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.XMeanwhile, Capital One Financial (COF) and Alliance Data Systems (ADS) report on Thursday.The results come as shares of those credit card giants and others in the payments space flirt with buy zones.Here's a look at what to expect:Estimates: Fiscal third-quarter earnings per share of 81 cents, a 17% increase, on revenue of $4.361 billion, a 20% jump, according to Zacks Investment Research.Stock: Visa cleared a 96.70 flat-base buy point on Friday, hitting a record high and closing at 96.93.Shares edged down 0.1% to 96.83 Monday stock market trading. Rival Mastercard (MA), which reports second-quarter earnings on July 27, was holding above 126.29 buy point, dipping rising 0.3% to 127.42. Mastercard also broke out of a flat base on Friday.Even though weak loan growth in a cautious business environment, a tamer forecast for net interest income, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon's rant about ""the stupid s**t we have to deal with in this country"" became the main take-aways from JPMorgan's second-quarter earnings on Friday, the bank's credit card sales volumes remained solid. That figure rose 15.3% for Q2, better than in Q1.""We view JPMorgan's results as having positive implications for Visa, as JPM is Visa's largest issuer,"" Mizuho analyst Thomas McCrohan wrote in a research note on Friday.And amid a fight between banks for the biggest spenders, JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake on Friday also said the ""extraordinary success"" of the bank's Chase Sapphire Reserve card — which carries the Visa label and is jammed with perks intended to draw a  wealthier, younger consumer — has been a major accelerant in card revenue.""I always feel compelled to point out that these are extraordinarily good customers,"" she said. ""Their characteristics, their engagement, their spend — these are the customers that everybody wants to acquire. We now have them and we intend to deepen relationships with them.""Visa also stands to benefit from being the sole credit card provider for Costco (COST), a relationship that came at American Express' expense. Its acquisition last year of Visa Europe, growing support of digital payments and its forays into nations where many people still pay largely in cash are also seen working in the company's favor.But more exposure internationally means the company's revenues risk taking a hit from a stronger dollar. Rising client incentives also threaten revenue, Zacks said.Visa and other card investors should pay attention to Bank of America (BAC) earnings Tuesday, for more insight into credit card trends.Estimates: Second-quarter EPS is expected to plunge 43% to $1.47, with revenue dipping 1% to $8.154 billion.Stock: Shares dipped 0.1% to 85.23 on Monday. The stock is still within range of an 82.10 buy point of a flat base cleared nearly a month ago.American Express' breakup with Costco last year, along with a less-friendly foreign-exchange translation and higher provisions for losses are likely to weigh on revenue and margins this year, Zacks said.""Costco used to be a major acquisition channel for American Express' U.S. consumer and small business areas,"" Zacks said. ""Though the company replaced all the volume it used to derive through the Costco channel with other proprietary channels and other products, the adverse impact of the loss of the partnership should continue for next few quarters.""But like Visa, AmEx is also poised to grow as more people use electronic payments and as countries outside the U.S. adopt credit cards. The company has also tried to compete with the Chase Sapphire Reserve by adding its own sweeteners to its high-end Platinum Card.Meanwhile, Capital One is expected to report an 8% EPS gain to $1.90, with revenue up 6.5% to $6.67 billion. But Capital One has missed earnings estimates in four of the last five quarters, including the last two. Revenue has been below views in the last two quarters. The stock is trading between its 200-day and 50-day moving averages as it tries to build a new base. Capital One stock fell 0.4% Monday.Alliance Data Systems, which manages private-label credit cards for retailers and other businesses, is slated to boost per-share profit by 6% to $3.47, with revenue up 5% to $1.837 billion. Shares fell 0.9% to 261.85 Monday. That stock peeked out past a 264.56 buy point from a cup-with-handle base on Thursday, then dipped back below that entry on Friday.RELATED:2 Key Financial Stocks Break Out While Bank Giants Sell OffThis Hot Payment Stock Flirts With Breakout As 3 Peers Forge Buy Points

449,MA,"The latest list of new buys by top performing mutual funds shows strong demand for stocks in sectors like health care — UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), building — NVR (NVR) and Thor Industries (THO), and chips — Applied Materials (AMAT) and Microsemi (MSCC).X Defense and financial stocks are also well represented, with Boeing (BA), Heico (HEI), Bank of America (BAC) and T. Rowe Price (TROW) making the cut.While Donald Trump and Republicans battled over how and whether to repeal and replace ObamaCare, mutual funds invested over $1 billion in just two managed care companies. Sixty-six funds scooped up approximately $805 million of shares in UnitedHealth, and 46 funds invested just over $600 million in Aetna.Additionally, 50 funds picked up $367 million of shares in Cigna (CI).That high level of institutional demand is reflected in the share prices of both stocks, which have climbed steadily higher in recent months. The consistent support along the 10-week line seen in the charts for Aetna and UnitedHealth is another indicator of how fund managers have been stepping in to protect and add to their positions.Outside of health care, big bets were also placed on BofA ($490 million), Boeing ($253 million), superregional bank PNC Financial Services (PNC) ($376 million) and Applied Materials ($214 million).On the flip side, credit card giants Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped the list of the latest sells by leading funds. The net number of funds selling Visa (99 selling minus 56 buying) was 43, while the number for MasterCard was 39.Despite that selling, both stocks have continued in an upward trend.E-commerce and cloud computing services behemoth Amazon (AMZN) was also on the sell list, with 26 more funds selling than buying.Since reporting a 78% decline in earnings growth for Q2 on July 27, Amazon has been pulling back and is trying to find support at its 10-week line.RELATED:Top Fund Managers Are Buying These 4 Highly Rated StocksTop Fund's Picks Include Stocks Within Buy Ranges Like Global Payments

But with the deal expiring in June and oil prices retreating recently, discussion also included whether to extend it another six months.A draft statement from the energy ministers said the committee ""reports high level of conformity and recommends six-month extension,"" according to Reuters. While some individual ministers voiced support for an extension, the group's final statement only said it should be studied.

With Joseph Fath in his fourth year as manager, the fund has outperformed 94% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. so far this year and over the past one and three years respectively.The fund was up 17.46% for 2017 going into Thursday, far outrunning the 7.94% gain for the S&P 500.Fath has done it without resorting to any trick plays. He's of course aware of how last November's election offers ongoing opportunities to companies that can benefit from rising interest rates, a lighter regulatory load and heightened spending on infrastructure, he wrote to shareholders in January.But his investment approach remains largely the same as in the past. ""We believe that disciplined fundamental analysis will enable us to identify high-quality companies with durable growth prospects that are poised to stand out from the broader market,"" he said. ""We continue to favor companies that have more control over their destiny, are positioned to benefit from powerful secular trends, and are using innovation to disrupt less efficient business models and create new ones.""You can see how that strategy is expressed in the fund's top holdings. Among top holdings as of April 30 was Alphabet (GOOGL), up 20% so far this year. Amazon (AMZN), which is an IBD Leaderboard stock, is up 27%. Apple (AAPL), another Leaderboard stock, is up 32%. Facebook (FB), which is on the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals, is up 31%. Mastercard (MA) is up 13%.Fath had placed 63% of his shareholders' money in just two sectors as of the end of last month. The fund's weighting in information-technology stocks was 39%. Its weighting in consumer discretionary was 24%.Some smaller holdings also illustrate Fath's appetite for innovators driven by secular trends. MGM Resorts (MGM) is holding tight after its recent 30.72 breakout from consolidation.It broke out April 27, the day it reported that first-quarter earnings per share jumped 138%. In the U.S., newcomers to MGM's portfolio, the Borgata and National Harbor casino resorts, kicked in to results. Gaming stocks got a boost from news that Macau's gaming revenue rose 18.1% in March, then gained 16.3% for April. MGM has one property in Macau and is slated to open a new resort in the Cotai section of Macau later this year.In addition, the firm has been taming its debt. Its debt-to-equity ratio is down to 209% as of Dec. 31 vs. 313% in 2014.IBD'S TAKE: MGM Resorts ranks No. 1 in IBD's Leisure-Gaming/Equipment industry group. See how its fundamental and technical data stack up against those of rivals at IBD's Stock Checkup.ServiceNow (NOW), trading around 97, is within a 5% buy zone that stretches above a cup pattern's 94.82 buy point.The company develops cloud-based IT software for workflow automation.

It broke out above a double-bottom base that had a buy point of 80.47. It's now extended past that buy point, trading around 87. Demand for cloud-based applications is driving growth of this company, which provides customer-relationship-management software and services.Sporting a 95 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating, EPS rose 14% and 47% the past two quarters.A more recent buy for the mutual fund is MercadoLibre (MELI), which runs an online marketplace and provides an electronic payment service in Latin America. Although widely described as poised for growth the way Amazon was at an earlier stage of its life cycle, the stock is up 81% so far this year and is now extended.MercadoLibre is another IBD 50 member. Shares gapped up 16% on May 5 after the e-commerce giant reported Q1 EPS up 64% on 74% revenue growth. The firm's core marketplace performed well.

A separate Bangladesh-based clothing supplier said it may ask Sears for advance payments on orders after negotiating to receive payments within about two weeks of a shipment vs. the typical two-month period.And New Jersey-based Kent International, a maker and importer of bicycles, told the news service it refuses to sell Sears more products.Meanwhile, Atradius Trade Credit Insurance no longer insures Sears vendors against missed payments.""We tried to hang in as long as we could,"" said Doug Collins, the company's regional director for risk services, according to Reuters.

464,MA,"If you haven't heard of the ""mattress girl,"" it's not for lack of trying among liberal opinion-shapers. Emma Sulkowicz, who dragged a blue mattress around Columbia University's campus in 2014 to dramatize her plight as a rape victim, was profiled sympathetically in New York magazine, The New York Times and other publications. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY, invited her to attend one of President Barack Obama's State of the Union speeches. Artnet pronounced her mattress stunt (for which Columbia awarded her course credit as an art project) ""one of the most important art works of the year,"" and she was honored by the Feminist Majority Foundation and other groups.Her story is this: A consensual sexual encounter with a male student named Paul Nungesser suddenly turned violent. Without warning, he choked her, struck her, and anally penetrated her while she cried out in pain.Such things do happen. In the course of researching a book due out next year, I've spoken to dozens of college students. Every single one knows someone who has been raped. Some know more than one. And the list of colleges that have disciplined or expelled students for rape or sexual assault is long. Some college students have been criminally prosecuted, and rightly so.We can debate why sexual misconduct and rape have become such pressing problems (spoiler alert: it has everything to do with the sexual revolution and hookup culture), but facts are stubborn things, and it has become clear that in Sulkowicz's case, Nungesser, not she, was almost certainly the victim.Sulkowicz filed charges with the university and the New York police. (She later alleged that the New York police mistreated her.) Both investigated. Both declined to take action against him. It was then that Sulkowicz undertook her mattress performance as an attempt to brand Nungesser a rapist and drive him from Columbia. He was shunned and anathematized. As Cathy Young reported in Reason magazine, Sulkowicz launched a full-on harassment campaign.""In the summer of 2014, other students and a professor pressured Nungesser to drop out of a scholarship-paid class trip to Russia, Mongolia, and China. That October, on a 'Day of Action' against sexual assault, several mattress-toting activists showed up in one of his classes, where they stared at him and took his picture. Keyboard warriors in the social media urged making his life 'a living hell' and sometimes called for violent retaliation.""Nungesser finished his degree, but he also supplied evidence to Young that undermines the case against him — evidence that was not even admitted to the tribunal that cleared him. Nungesser produced Facebook messages the two exchanged within 48 hours of the alleged rape. In one, Nungesser invited her to a ""small shindig"" in his room and asked her to ""bring cool freshmen."" She replied ""lol yussss ... Also I feel like we need to have some real time where we can talk about life and thingz because we still haven't really had a paul-emma chill sesh since summmmerrrr."" Ten days later, she texted him ""whatever I want to see yoyououoyou. respond-I'll get the message on ma phone."" After he sent her an effusive message on her birthday, she responded, ""I love you Paul. Where are you?!?!?!?!""On July 17, Columbia settled a lawsuit Nungesser had filed. While the details are confidential, the university issued a statement acknowledging that ""after the conclusion of the (sexual misconduct) investigation, Paul's remaining time at Columbia became very difficult for him and not what Columbia would want any of its students to experience. ... Columbia will continue to review and update its policies toward ensuring that every student — accuser and accused, including those like Paul who are found not responsible — is treated respectfully and as a full member of the Columbia community."" Nungesser's parents told Newsweek that they felt vindicated after what they described as a ""four-year effort"" to clear his name.It has become a feminist catechism that women must be ""believed"" when they make accusations of rape. As the University of Montana tells incoming freshmen, ""almost no one lies."" But of course they do. The woman who spun the lurid tale to Rolling Stone about being gang-raped at the University of Virginia invented every detail. The Duke lacrosse players were falsely accused. So were the Scottsboro boys.Again, this doesn't mean all accusations are false or malicious, nor is every case of alleged sexual misconduct merely a matter of ""regretted sex."" But Sulkowicz has dined out on dubious victimhood for years, and it's high time she was discredited.

468,MA,"Third Point, the activist hedge fund run by Dan Loeb, reportedly has issued a letter calling for Honeywell (HON) to spin off its aerospace unit, which is the industrial conglomerate's largest segment by revenue.Loeb says Honeywell's stock trades at a ""substantial discount"" to its peers and that an aerospace spinoff would produce a ""sustained increase in shareholder value"" of more than $20 billion, according to the New York Times.Shares of Honeywell jumped 3.2% to 134.00 in after-hours trading on the stock market today. The stock remains near record highs after topping first-quarter earnings forecasts last week.Shares of General Electric (GE), which has been under pressure from Trian Fund Management to improve results, edge up 0.1% late to 29.10. United Technologies (UTX) wasn't active late but closed up 0.5% at 118.78. Rockwell Collins (COL) was also quiet after falling 0.6% to 104.48.In February, Third Point disclosed a new stake in Honeywell. In its letter Thursday, it said several Wall Street analysts are in favor of a spinoff, the Times reported.Honeywell's wide array of aerospace products include gas turbine auxiliary power units and cockpit systems and displays. In Q1, the segment's revenue slipped 4% to $3.55 billion, though on an organic basis it was flat.

469,MA,"China successfully completed the first test flight of its home-built modern passenger jet, bolstering President  Xi Jinping's ambition of turning China into an advanced economy.Amid cheers from onlookers, the C919 airliner took off Friday from Pudong International Airport in Shanghai, the home base of its builder Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac. The jet landed back about an hour and 19 minutes later after cruising at 3,000 meters (9,840 feet). The single-aisle plane, which is designed to seat as many as 174 people, is slated to enter commercial service with China Eastern Airlines Corp. in 2019.""It shows China made a historic breakthrough in its years-old dream of building a big aircraft,"" Comac said in a statement, calling the test a ""complete success."" The nation's State Council, the top administrative authority, sent a congratulatory note to the designers.The test flight, after repeated delays, marks another step in Xi's ambitious 'Made in China 2025' program, which identified aerospace among sectors that could accelerate China's advancement. The government has said the ability to build and fly a large commercial aircraft is the ""flower'' and ""pearl'' of modern manufacturing.The C919 would be the first major competitor for Airbus SE and Boeing Co. in the most popular sector of the airliner market and gives Comac a home advantage in what is set to become the world's biggest aircraft market. Boeing estimates China will need 6,810 aircraft worth more than $1 trillion in the two decades through 2035.""There's a lot riding on the C919,'' said Xu Yongling, a military test pilot and a member of the Beijing-based Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics. ""The expectation for the C919 is not to become the best-selling single-aisle aircraft in the market, but rather become a stepping stone for COMAC to build something better, with indigenous technology.''COMAC plans to make six planes for tests, and the second one is getting ready at the final assembly workshop in Shanghai, the builder said. Guests who witnessed Friday's test flight included Vice Premier Ma Kai and Han Zheng, Communist Party secretary from Shanghai.The five people on board the test plane were the captain, co-pilot, an observer and two engineers.Getting into the major league with Airbus (EADSY) and Boeing (BA) may be a few decades away as customers typically prefer aircraft with proven track record, reliability and safety, analysts said. COMAC is seeking certification for the C919 from European agencies.""Comac could well be an option for us,"" said William Walsh, chief executive officer of IAG SA, the owner of British Airways Plc, adding he'd only seriously consider the plane when IAG reviews its existing fleet of short-haul Airbus A320-family jets in the long-term. More immediately, he's expecting lower prices from the added competition.Walsh, a former pilot who's flown in the plane's simulator, said he's due to meet with Comac next month to further advise on features that IAG looks for in a new model.""A new entrant will have an impact on pricing,"" Walsh told analysts on a call Friday. ""We've seen that to some degree with the launch of the CSeries. It's something that both airlines and the manufacturers are aware of.""The C919 designation was chosen partly to reflect the idea of long life in Chinese numerology.With a maximum range of 3,450 miles, the plane is powered by two LEAP-1C engines from CFM International Inc., a joint venture between Safran SA and General Electric (GE). Other key system suppliers include Honeywell International (HON), Rockwell Collins (COL), Liebherr-International Deutschland GmbH, Thales SA and Panasonic Corp.The test flight of the plane follows China's launch last month of its first domestically built aircraft carrier. The milestones, coming within weeks, burnish Xi's credentials as a modernizer before he presides over the ruling Communist Party's twice-a-decade congress later this year.Almost a billion people will fly to, from or within China by 2025, the International Air Transport Association estimates. Over the next two decades, about 75 percent of the jets ferrying those passengers will be single-aisle -- a category dominated by Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320 family.In an email, Boeing congratulated Comac for the ""successful development"" of the C919, while Airbus said it welcomes competition, ""which is good for the development of the industry.""Comac, which had postponed the test flight at least twice, says it has commitments from 23 customers for about 570 planes, with Shanghai-based China Eastern lined up to take the first delivery.Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said China may have to wait till its next aircraft to really break the duopoly for jets that can carry more than 100 passengers.""At the moment, they are in a real replication mode, which is not where you want to be,"" he said. ""First off, they need to privatize and open their supply chain up to a global network, rather than just people who will transfer yesterday's technology.""Comac has set its sights on building a wide-body aircraft. It is forming a joint venture with Russia's United Aircraft Corp. to develop a twin-aisle jet.""The C919 is a testament to China's civil aviation research and manufacturing capability,"" said Yu Zhanfu, executive director at Roland Berger Management Consultants Shanghai Co. ""China's had a lot of success in making rockets, making spaceships. It shows the country is capable of mega tech-intensive manufacturing projects.""

470,MA,"X The stock market was mixed in midday trade as the Federal Reserve's two-day interest rate meeting kicked off. The Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged.The Dow Jones industrial average led the way with a 0.1% gain, aided by Apple's (AAPL) 0.9% move to the upside ahead of the iPhone maker's Q2 earnings release after the close. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were barely below the break-even mark. Volume rose on both major exchanges. Among the other Dow industrials, Intel paced the advancers with a 1.6% rise. Fellow chip company AMD (AMD) plummeted almost 19% after missing its Q1 sales estimates and AMD's loss was Intel's gain. Visa (V) followed up with a 1.4% gain. Its move coincides with fellow credit card company Mastercard (MA), which reported better-than-expected Q1 profit and revenue early Tuesday. Shares of Mastercard jumped more than 2% to record highs.Among earnings reporters on the Dow, drug stocks Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK) both reported Q1 results early Tuesday. Pfizer dropped 1.4% after the company exceeded earnings targets, but fell short on revenue estimates. Shares of Merck moved up 0.4% after the company surpassed top and bottom line estimates.Automakers sold off in the stock market today after Ford Motor (F), General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) reported worse-than-expected April U.S. auto sales. Ford's stock dropped 4.1%, GM fell 3.3%, and Fiat declined 4.8%.The electric automaker Tesla (TSLA) only moved down 0.5% and shares remain just off all-time highs. It will report earnings Wednesday after the bell.Among stocks breaking out today, Cummins (CMI) gapped up 6% out of a flat base with a 155.61 entry after it reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings and sales. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) is approaching a 244.08 cup-shaped base buy point after its own bullish Q1 report. Shares rose 8.2%. Leading growth stocks were mixed Tuesday through morning trade. On the upside, Cognex (CGNX) jumped 2.6% despite cautious revenue guidance, while China e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) moved up 1.4%.On the downside, Nvidia (NVDA) fell 2.4% in conjunction with the AMD decline. Shares of Nvidia have rebounded valiantly over the last two weeks, reclaiming their 50-day line.RELATED:Pfizer Earnings Top, But Sales Come Up ShortDow's Merck Tops Views And Raises Outlook, But Key Drug LagsApple Q2 Earnings Preview: What To ExpectWhere Is The Stock Market Headed?

"
472,MA,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 indicated modest gains at Monday's open following strong market gains last week. Investors will get a key reading on the U.S. economy Monday, with earnings from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) on tap following Friday's selloff in chip stocks.Last week the Nasdaq composite rose 2.3%, its best showing since January, with the tech-heavy index hitting record highs. The S&P 500 index climbed 1.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average 1.9%, both close to all-time levels.Futures for the Dow industrials rose near 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.2%. In overseas trading Monday, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.6% while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.55%. Many major Asian and European markets were closed for the international labor day holiday.Advanced Micro Devices is one of a handful of earnings reports on Monday, ahead of Tuesday, when Apple (AAPL), Mastercard (MA), Papa John's (PZZA), a pair of fiber-optic plays and dozens more release quarterly earnings.AMD is expected to report a 4-cent per-share loss after Monday's market close, narrowing vs. a 12-cent loss a year earlier. Revenue should climb 18% to $984.38 million. For the full year, AMD is expected to turn an 8-cent profit vs. a 14-cent loss a year ago.IBD'S TAKE: All-time winning stocks tend to have Composite Ratings of 95 or more near the start of big price moves. Here are the five ""top 5%"" stocks with earnings due this week.AMD shares have been trying to get above their 50-day moving average, moving above that key support intraday on Thursday and Friday but turning back, falling 2.3% to 13.30 in Friday stock market trading.AMD is working on a double-bottom base. A double-bottom pattern is a ""W""-shaped consolidation in which the second leg of the W undercuts that first. As a result, AMD has a potential buy point at 14.85, jut above the center of the ""W.""AMD's chips are used for PC gaming graphics as well as new AI uses. Its results and guidance may offer clues for rival Nvidia (NVDA), which reports on May 9.AMD and Nvidia have similar-looking chart patterns at first glance. But there is a key difference. In Nvidia's case, the second leg of the ""W"" did not quite undercut the intraday low of the first leg. That means it did not shake out as many weak holders as AMD's true double-bottom. Thus, Nvidia's potential buy point for now is 121.02, just above the old high. Nvidia's stock has moved just above its 50-day line.AMD's report also will key for the chip sector, which has been a leading group but faltered at the end of last week. Intel (INTC), which just missed on sales late Thursday, fell 3.4%. But Apple chip supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and chip-gear maker KLA-Tencor (KLAC) sank 4.3% and 5.2% despite better-than-expected profits and sales.Skyworks dragged down other Apple iPhone chipmakers, including Qorvo (QRVO), which fell 4.3%. Qorvo technically fell back into buy range but the heavy-volume decline to just below the 50-day line raises concerns. Qorvo reports earnings Wednesday.For iPhone chipmakers generally, Apple earnings late Tuesday may be the big mover. Expect another quarter of slim profit and sales growth. Investors are betting on strong demand for the upcoming iPhone 8, and perhaps new buybacks and higher dividends from Apple's huge cash pile.The Institute for Supply Management will release its April manufacturing survey at 10 a.m. ET. Economists expect a slight dip to 56.5 from March's 57.2. However, the ISM index has topped the Econoday forecast for seven straight months. Even an in-line reading would be well above the neutral 50 level.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will wrap up its two-day policy meeting. Economists don't expect any change in policy, but the central bank's statement could offer clues about future meetings. The odds of a Fed rate hike by the June meeting are now at 63%.On Friday, the Labor Department will release its April employment report.RELATED:The Big Picture: This Key Tech Sector FaltersThis Is Why You Should Consider Amazon, Netflix, Alibaba For Your PortfolioWhich Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?Apple, Tesla, Facebook, Fed To Grab Spotlight: Investing Action Plan

473,MA,"HealthEquity (HQY), whose health savings accounts could get a lift from GOP plans to repeal and replace ObamaCare, beat fourth-quarter forecasts Tuesday but gave mixed fiscal-year guidance amid reports that President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan are continuing to run into Republican opposition to the legislation.Q4 Estimates: EPS to drop 43% to 4 cents, marking its first earnings decline since going public in 2014, while revenue climbs 27% to $45.6 million.Results: EPS of 7 cents on revenue of $46.8 million. Service revenue rose 21% to $20.6 million, custodial revenue jumped 44% to $16 million, interchange revenue climbed 33% to $10.1 million. At the end of Q4, HSA members were up 28% from a year ago at 2.7 million.Outlook: Full-year EPS of 50-55 cents, below consensus for 56 cents, on revenue of $220 million-$225 million, with the midpoint above consensus for $221.6 million.Stock: HealthEquity was up 3% at 45.00 late. The IBD 50 member, which carries a 94 Composite Rating, closed down 5% at 43.63 on the stock market today, diving below its 50-day average and threatening to unravel the cup base with a 49.35 buy point that had formed.HealthEquity shares soared immediately after the presidential election, as Trump's campaign pushed HSAs in a promised overhaul of health policies. But any problems that the health effort runs into could also put other legislative GOP priorities, like tax cuts, in trouble.IBD'S TAKE: Health savings accounts are becoming the norm at U.S. corporations, and HealthEquity expects HSAs to become as ubiquitous as retirement savings vehicles like 401(k)s.There are few pure-play HSA players in the market, and most of HealthEquity's competition comes from banks and brokerages. HSA assets at HealthEquity were bolstered last year by the acquisition of 195,000 accounts with $453 million in assets from M&T Bank (MTB) and Bancorp (TBBK).Meanwhile, HealthEquity also wants customers to see their HSAs as investment and savings accounts vs. simply accounts for health-related expenses.The company was the first HSA administrator to offer individualized, web-based investment advisory services.

But cheaper oil can be good news for refiners, which could see wider profit margins as their input costs drop, and one stock in particular has drawn the attention of Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) Warren Buffett.Shares of Marathon Petroleum (MPC) are in a cup base with a 54.69 buy point and closed Friday at 50.79. The stock broke out previously in September and November.Valero Energy (VLO) is in a flat base with a 71.50 entry and will start the next trading week at 68.90.Western Refining (WNR) is in a flat base with a 40.19 buy point. It finished Friday at 36.75.Phillips 66 (PSX) has a longer way to go. Shares are in a flat base with an 88.97 entry but are about 10% below that threshold.But for what it's worth, Berkshire has built up its stake in the refiner in the last few years and now holds more than 15%, making Berkshire the top shareholder.The rapid accumulation of shares has raised speculation about a buyout. Last year, an S&P Global Markets Intelligence analyst told IBD that Buffett's pattern of Phillips 66 stock purchases is reminiscent of his transactions leading up to his $9.7 billion acquisition of lubricant and chemical maker Lubrizol in 2011.

As of Thursday, IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment group was ranked No. 1 among 197 industry subgroups.Other computer-related issues bought by top funds included Arista Networks (ANET), Mercury Systems (MRCY), NetEase (NTES) and Veeva Systems (VEEV).Household names such as fast food retail chain Domino's Pizza (DPZ) saw some heavy buying from leading funds. DVD and video streaming kingpin Netflix (NFLX) was also a fan favorite, with 45 top funds investing an estimated $268 million in their latest reporting periods.The latest new buys list also shows the smart money slowing their purchases of regional banks, with the exception of SVB Financial (SIVB).

490,MA,"But Southwest also noted ""unexpected softness in close-in demand"" in the latter part of February, referring to last-minute bookings, though it has rebounded in March.Shares closed down 0.85% to 55.88 on the stock market today, erasing most of its intraday loss. Delta rose 1.4% and American climbed 1.3%, both reversing higher from modest losses. United Airlines (UAL), which kept its Q1 unit revenue view unchanged, fell 0.3%.Meanwhile JetBlue soared 5.1%. The carrier said February traffic rose 0.1% as capacity climbed 0.7%. JetBlue sees first-quarter unit revenue down 4%-5%, citing a big impact from the shift of the Easter holiday to April this year from March.On Thursday, American said it now sees Q1 total unit revenue growing 1.5%-3.5%, down from an earlier forecast for growth of 2.5%-4.5%, citing an improved rate of flight cancellations vs. a year ago that pushed capacity up. American still sees an adjusted pretax margin of 3%-5% in Q1.On Monday, Delta said it sees flat Q1 unit revenue vs. an prior forecast for no change to a 2% increase, sparking a sell-off in airline stocks.

491,MA,"Lower Treasury yields Friday pressured most financials, including Dow Jones industrial average components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS) and American Express (AXP).But Visa (V), the second-best performer on the Dow industrials this year, rose to a fresh all-time high Friday. Its archrival Mastercard (MA) also reached record levels and its stock is still within buy range.The 10-year yield fell below 2.5% intraday, resuming their retreat following the Fed's rate hike on Wednesday, as policymakers did not signal faster tightening ahead.Rates on mortgages and the value of other types of credit are tied in with those yields. The yields also serve as a window into investors' expectations for higher prices in the future — potentially prompting the Fed to raise the benchmark interest rate, which, in turn, can help banks' finances as banks hike their own interest rates and other costs to compensate.Visa rose 0.2% to 90.21 in the stock market today, hitting a fresh all-time high of 90.63  intraday. The stock has been tailing upward since the beginning of the year, logging a 16% gain since Dec. 30.Mastercard climbed 0.1% to 112.83, wthin range of a 109.03 buy point of a flat base initially cleared in mid-January. Mastercard sold off at the end of the month, closing below its 50-day line on Feb. 1. But the stock rebounded, retaking its still-value 109.03 buy point and marching on to new highs.Visa has been gaining on a variety of factors. Among them: stronger consumer optimism, the acquisition of Visa Europe, and the potential in cross-border and electronic payments.Visa and Mastercard, while known for their credit cards, are not technically card issuers. They make money on transaction fees, and aren't directly affected by interest rate shifts. Issuing banks, such as JPMorgan Chase,  Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC), actually carry the balances.IBD'S TAKE: Banks and financials have been among the biggest Trump plays this year, on hopes for a combination of fewer regulations and higher interest rates. Steel stocks, potential beneficiaries of Trump's plans for a massive infrastructure investment, are among the others. JPMorgan Chase fell 1.05%, Bank of America 1.4%, Citigroup 1.3% and Wells Fargo 1.1%.Goldman Sachs and fellow investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 1.7% and 2.8%, respectively, both closing just above their 50-day lines.The Dow's American Express, which does issue cards directly and carry the balances, trickled 0.65% lower. Capital One (COF), which also issues cards, fell 2.2%, undercutting its 50-day line.RELATED:Apple, Nike, Visa Among Dow's Top 5 Gainers So Far This YearDow Stock American Express Ups Ante In High-Fee, High-End Card Race

The stock has drifted higher since last summer and is extended from a buy point that MasterCard cleared for good in mid-February. Rival Visa (V), which reported quarterly earnings in late April, edged up 1.4%, also extended from a breakout point.Mastercard faces elevated costs due to global growth and more spending on digital initiatives, such as its Masterpass digital wallet, Zacks said in an earnings preview last week. Greater incentives and rebates, as well as an unfavorable foreign exchange environment, could also weigh, Zacks said.But expansion of the card industry stands to help Mastercard and others. Visa, on its earnings release, cited ""robust growth"" in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions.Both companies have also rushed to capitalize on the growing interest in mobile payments, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.Visa, for instance, has a partnership with IBM (IBM) unit Watson intended to facilitate transactions on connected devices. Mastercard, management noted on its fourth-quarter earnings call, has debuted an AI bot that has functions ""similar to human interaction"" and enables purchases through Facebook (FB) Messenger and other messaging services.Following Visa's acquisition of Visa Europe, Mastercard said at a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods conference in February that it ""does not expect its trajectory of market share gains to change (in the region) and has not seen any let-up in the last 6-7 months,"" the investment firm said.Meanwhile, credit-card companies have had to find more ways to attract a wealthier consumer. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has  drawn the interest of millennials via its high-end Chase Sapphire Reserve, which is on Visa's payments infrastructure. That prompted American Express (AXP) to pile on more perks for its Platinum Card holders.U.S. Bank (USB) is touting its new Altitude Reserve Visa Infinite Card to compete for well-to-do professionals.RELATED:PayPal Beats Views, Sets New $5 Billion Buyback; Stock JumpsEBay, American Express, Qualcomm, CSX Move On Late Earnings

PayPal has recently announced agreements with credit card networks Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) as well as social media firm Facebook (FB).EBay (EBAY) spun off PayPal in 2015, giving the payments company more leeway to make alliances.""A potential Amazon-PayPal partnership could be a win-win, even if the direct financial impact is insignificant,"" George Mihalos, a Cowen analyst, said in a research report Monday. ""It would, however, give the PayPal wallet a more ubiquitous presence, which could lead to greater overall customer engagement — a key consideration behind PayPal's recent in-store payments strategy consummated with the networks Visa and Mastercard.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom, Inphi and GrubHub are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors.

497,MA,"The broad stock market outpaced JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) in three of 2016's four quarters. But the market has turned into a brisk tailwind for the fund this year. That's a boon for investors holding the fund in retirement accounts and other portfolios.The $12.5 billion fund's 9.07% advance year-to-date going into Friday topped 87% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its direct rivals averaged only 7.52%.That recent run contrasts with the past 12 months, when the fund's still-enviable 21.40% gain lagged 55% of its peers.The fund's recent spring got a boost from chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), an IBD Leaderboard stock and part of the IBD 50. The stock is up 19% so far this year.IBD'S TAKE: Despite reversing lower Thursday, Broadcom is generally acting well after clearing a 208.85 three-weeks-tight entry Feb. 17. Shares have notched a 20% profit since their initial breakout. Many stocks pull back or start a new base after this level, so investors may want to consider locking-in some profits, as IBD's Leaderboard notes. Investors with more conviction may decide to hold for further gains before taking profits.The fund also got a lift from electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA), a smaller holding that is up 20% this year. On Wednesday, Tesla said its aggressive production plan for its mass-market Model 3 sedan was still on track. But the car- and battery maker reported a fourth-quarter loss of 69 cents per share, which was more than the 42-cent loss expected by analysts. Earnings per share rose 88%, beating the consensus estimate.Tesla also released information about development of its battery factories.Tesla shares' fall on Wednesday and Thursday triggered the stock's move from IBD's Leaderboard to the Cut List. The pullback left shares well below an alternative buy point of 269.44 and mildly below a regular 258.57 entry.Facebook (FB), a top-10 holding as of Jan. 31 and part of the IBD 50, was another top performer for the fund. The social media giant, which the fund has been trimming in recent disclosures, is up 18% this year.Facebook is ranked No. 4 in IBD's Internet-Content industry group. It has a good 89 Composite Rating from IBD. And its annual pretax margin is 60%.Amazon (AMZN), another top-10 holding, is up 14% so far this year.The online retailer and provider of cloud services sports a so-so 78 IBD Comp Rating, but that has not prevented mutual funds from boosting their stakes as a group for eight quarters in a row. The estimated earnings per share growth this year for the company is a solid 48%.Among other holdings, five of seven top new buys as of Dec. 31 had Comp Ratings in the 80s or 90s.Those included UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Southwest Airlines (LUV), MercadoLibra (MELI), Morgan Stanley (MS) and FedEx (FDX). UnitedHealth and FedEx are forming basing patterns. The others are extended from recent buy areas.UnitedHealth, a health care insurer and benefits provider, has posted EPS growth of 17%, 13% 23% and 51% the past four frames. It is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, thanks in part to four straight years of annual EPS growth.Southwest has seen two quarters in a row of declining EPS, with another decline expected for the current quarter. Still, its three-year average annual EPS growth rate is 56%. And its annual EPS have grown for five straight years.Argentine-based MercadoLibra is Latin America's No. 1 e-commerce company. It is often referred to as the eBay (EBAY) of Latin America. It is ranked No. 3 in IBD's Internet-Retail group. It boasts a good 94 Comp Rating, and four consecutive years of annual EPS growth.Morgan Stanley, with a strong 98 Comp Rating, is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Banks-Money Center industry group. Revenue grew 14% and 22% the past two quarters. EPS is expected to rise 17% this year.Delivery service FedEx is another No. 1 ranked stock in its industry group, Transport-Air Freights in its case. Still, EPS growth has slowed for two quarters, growing 24%, 20% and 9% the past three stanzas. Its three-years average annual EPS growth rate is 23%. And it has delivered three straight years of annual EPS growth.Several of the fund's top holdings are household names like Apple (AAPL) and MasterCard (MA). In addition, four top-10 holdings have Comp Ratings in the 80s and 90s, including Home Depot (HD), Nvidia (NVDA) and Comcast (CMCSA).Graphics chipmaker Nvidia, for example, has a top-notch 99 Comp Rating — the highest possible — and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration.

MasterCard and Visa. But they stand to benefit from the growth of electronic and mobile payments.Mastercard and Visa are technically payment processors or payment networks that make money on transaction fees, as opposed to card-issuing banks such as Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) that carry cardmembers' account balances and thus benefit more directly from higher interest rates.Visa reports fiscal first-quarter results on Thursday.

""Everyone laughed at me, but what I predicted then has finally started to happen. We have players in all arenas — Europe, America, Asia. It's a gathering storm.""That could provide schadenfreude fodder for Delta, United and American, who saw trans-Atlantic revenue suffer a few years ago at the hands of Emirates, Qatar Air and Etihad Airways as they went on buying sprees of long-haul Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY) planes.The U.S. companies also have been pressuring the U.S. government to renegotiate Open Skies Agreements with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, claiming Persian Gulf airlines have received unfair subsidies to fuel their exponential growth in recent years.Despite the backlash, Clark also said Thursday that Emirates will go ahead with a new flight to Newark, N.J.Shares of Delta closed down 0.9% on the stock market today. United fell 1.2%, and American dropped 3.5% after cutting its Q1 unit revenue guidance.Unlike their European peers, the big U.S. carriers have decided not to set up separate low-cost businesses in favor of dividing airplane cabins into more segments, including ones meant to appeal to no-frill travelers.U.S. airlines also have vowed to compete aggressively, including on price, amid the growth of international options.""We don't intend to cede our position across the Atlantic to anybody,"" American Airlines Chief Marketing Officer Andrew Nocella told analysts in January.The airline will shrink trans-Atlantic capacity during Q1 but plans to increase it again in Q3, when summer travel makes flights more lucrative.But on Thursday, American said it now sees Q1 total unit revenue growing 1.5%-3.5%, down from an earlier forecast for growth of 2.5%-4.5%, citing an improved rate of flight cancellations vs. a year ago that pushed capacity up. American still sees an adjusted pretax margin of 3%-5% in Q1.The news follows Delta's announcement on Monday, when it cut its Q1 operating margin and unit revenue forecasts, sparking a sell-off in airlines stocks.

514,MA,"Shares of Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), which was accused in the final days of the Obama administration of violating emissions standards, jumped Tuesday after President Trump said environmental permitting rules are ""out of control"" and promised a speedier process for manufacturers and oil companies.At a meeting with the CEOs of Fiat Chrysler, General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), he vowed to cut taxes and reiterated a threat to punish companies that move production abroad then sell goods in the U.S. On Monday, he also backed a ""very major"" tax on goods that American companies produce overseas.""We're gonna make a very short process, and we're going to either give you your permits or we're not gonna give you your permits,"" he said Tuesday. ""But you're gonna know very quickly. And generally speaking, we're gonna be giving you your permits. So we're gonna be very friendly.""Earlier this month, the EPA said Fiat Chrysler illegally installed software on 104,000 pickups and SUVs, causing them to release harmful nitrous oxide emissions. The company blasted the EPA and said it had done nothing illegal.""I appreciate the President's focus on making the U.S. a great place to do business,"" Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said in a statement after the meeting. ""We look forward to working with President Trump and members of Congress to strengthen American manufacturing.""Shares of Fiat Chrysler were up 5.9% at 10.89 in late afternoon trading on the stock market today, nearly erasing its 10% loss on Jan. 12, when the EPA made its claims. GM rose 1% and Ford climbed 2.4%.After attacking the auto industry during the campaign and his transition, GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler announced plans to invest billions of dollars in the U.S. and add jobs, though executives and analysts noted the moves were already in the works before the election or would have happened regardless of the outcome.Ford also said it would cancel plans to build a new factory in Mexico for small cars, but cited weak demand in the segment.The U.S. automakers, along with the rest of the auto industry, have come to rely on Mexico as a key hub in their global supply chains and haven't announced plans to shut down existing plants there in favor of moving them to the U.S.Among U.S. automakers, GM has the bigger footprint in Mexico and relies less on U.S. production.In 2015, 63% of GM's North American output came from the U.S., vs. 80% for Ford and 64% for Fiat Chrysler, according to IHS Automotive.RELATED:With New Nafta Terms, Trump Wants 'Yuge' Min.-Wage Hike — In MexicoAre Your Stocks Trump-Proof?

U.S. same-store sales at company-owned locations jumped 13.7%, easily exceeding the Consensus Metrix forecast for a 10.5% increase.Outlook: Over the next three to five years, Domino's now sees domestic comp sales growth of 3%-6%, up from a prior view of 2%-5%, and global retail sales growth of 8%-12%, up from a prior view of 7%-11%. Net unit growth is now seen at 6%-8%, up from an earlier view of 5%-7%.Stock: Shares closed up 2.4% at 189.81 after falling as low as 182.26 on the stock market today. Papa John's (PZZA) edged up 0.5%. Yum Brands (YUM), which owns Pizza Hut, dipped 0.3%.Domino's has been at the forefront of mobile ordering technology. Digital ordering platforms seem likely to become more important in the restaurant industry as more people do more things via their phones and find more reasons to stay in. Domino's is in a good position, because pizza travels better than most other fast food. Meanwhile, mom-and-pop pizzerias can't afford to develop their own mobile platforms, though they could sign up with food ordering hubs such as Grubhub (GRUB).IBD'S TAKE: Domino's Pizza CEO Patrick Doyle recently spoke to IBD about how his company should continue to benefit from digital ordering, even as other fast food companies try to catch up. He also discussed Netflix and a future of self-delivered pizza.Last week, Papa John's turned out middling quarterly results and guidance as the restaurant sector struggles with cheaper groceries and competitive discounting.Domino's and Papa John's were rare bright spots in the industry last year. Other restaurants struggled with, among other things, bad weather, discounting, cheaper groceries relative to menu prices and difficulties in keeping up with a strong performance in 2015, analysts have said.Yum Brands reported weaker-than-expected revenue earlier this month, citing ""disappointing and not acceptable"" Pizza Hut results. Yum is hiring outside experts to review Pizza Hut, with some analysts calling for the chain to be sold off.RELATED:Should Yum Brands Dump Pizza Hut Amid Heat From Domino's, Papa John's?

520,MA,"Dow component American Express (AXP) on Thursday said it's giving Platinum Card holders $200 worth of Uber rides a year and five-times rewards points to eligible hotels — the latest round in fight for the high-end consumer.The new benefits — along with an annual fee hike to $550 from $450 — kick in on March 30.The offerings follow the huge demand seen for JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) own luxury-level card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, which was launched in August with a $450 annual fee and drove up new card account originations by 35% in the third quarter.The Chase card, which gave members 100,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 within three months, was so popular the company ran out of materials used to mint it, according to Bloomberg. The Sapphire Reserve offers three-times points on an assortment of travel and dining-related spending.Shares of American Express fell 2.2% to 80.10 on the stock market today. JPMorgan, which is also on the Dow, slipped 1.6%. Payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) dipped 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. (Visa also is a Dow component).American Express' five-times rewards announced Thursday — for eligible hotels booked through amextravel.com — come after the card issuer introduced similar rewards points for flight tickets booked with airlines or American Express Travel.Airlines have increasingly relied on a mixture of high-end and low-end fares and seating classes to fill seats and prop up unit revenue.The new Platinum benefits also provide automatic Uber VIP status when available, Amex said.Analysts, however, have expressed concern about rewards' programs impact on credit-card companies' finances, the Wall Street Journal noted.In January, American Express reported mixed fourth-quarter results, with Morgan Stanley attributing the weakness to more marketing and promo costs. But its full-year earnings-per-share guidance was solidly above estimates.The company has also suffered from the loss of its partnership with Costco (COST).Meanwhile, AmEx's latest attempt to draw a wealthier, discretionary-income-flush consumer comes at a delicate time for Uber.The ride-hailing service faced criticism over its response to the Trump administration's temporary immigration ban, a lawsuit alleging attempts to pilfer technology from Waymo, claims of sexual harassment within the company and a video in which CEO Travis Kalnick got into an argument with an Uber driver about fares that prompted an apology from the chief executive.RELATED:PayPal Q4 Earnings, Revenue In Line; Q1 Guidance Bit LightAmazon Sales, Outlook Weak; Visa, Amgen Beat; Chipotle Profit MissesMastercard Tops On Q4 Earnings, Revenue Just Misses

523,MA,"After vowing a border tax, then calling it ""too complicated,"" then saying it was still being considered, President Trump told a group of CEOs Monday that the U.S. will incentivize domestic production and impose a ""very major"" tax on goods that American companies produce overseas.During a meeting with a manufacturing advisory group, Trump also reiterated pledges to slash regulations and income taxes.Afterward, Ford (F) CEO Mark Fields told reporters the meeting was positive. The carmaker had earlier canceled plans to build a new plant in Mexico. While Trump criticized Ford during the campaign for making cars there, the company said canceling the plant was due to lack of demand for small cars.Others at the meeting included CEOs of Tesla Motors (TSLA), Under Armour (UA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Arconic (ARNC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and U.S. Steel (X). The advisory panel is led by Dow Chemical's (DOW) CEO.Shares of Ford closed down 0.4% on the stock market today.

527,MA,"Wal-Mart's (WMT) fourth-quarter earnings and U.S. same-store sales beat forecasts Tuesday as online sales jumped, and its guidance for full-year revenue growth exceeded Wall Street estimates.The retail giant's earnings per share dropped 13% to $1.30, topping views by a penny, while revenue edged up 1% to $130.9 billion, missing estimates of $131.27 billion.Wal-Mart U.S. same-store sales rose 1.8%, the biggest increase in four years and better than the Consensus Metrix forecast for a 1.3% gain, as traffic climbed 1.4%. Wal-Mart U.S. e-commerce sales jumped 29%, including Jet.com and online grocery sales.The dividend was also hiked by 2% to $2.04.Wal-Mart also sees Q1 EPS of 90 cents-$1.00, with the midpoint slightly below consensus for 96 cents, and full-year EPS of $4.20-$4.40, with the midpoint also a bit shy of the consensus for $4.33. It sees Q1 U.S. comp sales up 1%-1.5% and full-year total sales growth of 2%-3%, better than consensus for a 1.8% uptick.Shares rallied 3% to 71.45 on the stock market today.

Macy's (M), which also reported Q4 results early Tuesday, gave up much of its earlier gains and closed down 1 cent to 32.29.Wal-Mart stock has been volatile since the election but has suffered more recently on another weak holiday shopping season for brick-and-mortar stores and efforts in Washington, D.C., to impose a 20% border tax on imports.CEOs from the nation's top retail chains traveled to Congress and the White House last week, lobbying lawmakers against the border tax.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart continues to look for ways to counter Amazon (AMZN). Last year, it bought Jet.com for more than $3 billion.And last month, Wal-Mart ended its fee-based ShippingPass program, which provides two-day shipping. Instead, the company said it will offer free two-day shipping on more than 2 million items for receipts of at least $35, without a fee.Amazon this past weekend responded by cutting the minimum order on its non-Prime shipping to $35, though deliveries will take five to eight business days.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is gaining ground in large retail markets beyond its core markets of electronics and media, putting the e-commerce giant in position for a strong performance in 2017.And even as Wal-Mart tries to fortify its e-commerce flank, Amazon is starting to build its own physical stores.Amazon Go, announced in early December, is envisioned as a small (1,800-square-foot) convenience store with no check-out lines that instead uses wireless technology to charge customers' Amazon accounts.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May Collapse

531,MA,"Shares of rail giant CSX (CSX) soared Thursday after a report said Canadian Pacific (CP) CEO E. Hunter Harrison will step down and team with an activist investor to try to put the industry veteran in a top management position at CSX.Harrison, who helped lead Canadian Pacific's failed Norfolk Southern (NSC) takeover attempt last year, will leave five months earlier than planned, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that he will partner with Paul Hilal, who left William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management to launch his own fund, Mantle Ridge, last year.Harrison is also cutting ties to Canadian Pacific, which agreed to a limited waiver of non-compete obligations, according to a company statement late Wednesday. COO Keith Creel will take on the CEO role.CSX, which reported mixed Q4 results Tuesday, jumped 23.4% to 45.51 on the stock market today.CSX's board is open to talks with Mantle Ridge, but is happy with its current growth strategy, the Wall Street Journal reported.Norfolk Southern shares climbed 4%. Union Pacific (UNP), which beat earnings forecasts Thursday, added 2.4%, while Kansas City Southern (KSU), which reports Friday, reversed to end down 0.5%. Canadian Pacific climbed 3.5%.Creel will become Canadian Pacific's president and CEO effective Jan. 31, following Harrison's decision to retire.The company said Wednesday that ""Harrison had approached the board to discuss his retirement from CP and potential related modifications to his employment arrangements that would allow him to pursue opportunities involving other Class 1 Railroads.""In return for the limited non-compete waiver, Harrison agreed to end all roles with Canadian Pacific, forfeit benefits and stock awards totaling 118 million Canadian dollars, and no longer carry out a previously agreed-upon consulting role.Last summer, the company said Creel would take over July 1, 2017. He had already had stints serving as interim CEO during periods when Harrison had health issues.In April, the company abandoned its effort to buy Norfolk Southern for $30 billion amid broad opposition from industry and lawmakers.

532,MA,"TAL Education (TAL) easily topped fiscal third-quarter forecasts and guided Q4 above consensus estimates Thursday, sending shares into buy zone, days after rival New Oriental Education (EDU) beat quarterly revenue views.The provider of K-12 after-school tutoring services in China earned 26 cents a share, up 33% and 4 cents better than expectations, as revenue jumped 83% to $260.55 million, above views for $230.3 million. Enrollment leapt 74.6% to 834,420.TAL also sees fiscal Q4 revenue of $285.3 million-$288.8 million vs. Wall Street forecasts for $271.1 million.Shares shot up 7.45% to 80.50, clearing 77.93 buy point from a sixth-stage base on the stock market today. But buying a stock from such a late stage is riskier.New Oriental shares rose 0.3%. Tarena Education (TEDU), a Chinese provider of professional education services, closed unchanged.On Tuesday, New Oriental posted adjusted earnings of 8 cents per American depositary share on a 23% revenue bump to $341.2 million, well above forecasts for $329.4 million. But according to Thomson Reuters, the company earned 7 cents a share, a penny short of views.Shares of both companies sold off in December, when Reuters reported current and former New Oriental employees accused the company of helping students engage in college application fraud and found in a separate investigation that found New Oriental has ""regularly provided items from the (SAT) tests to clients shortly after the exams are administered.""The company has condemned ""illegal and illegitimate business practices,"" and told Reuters it would review the issue and discipline anyone in violation of its policies and procedures.

536,MA,"Here's your Investing Action Plan for Tuesday: what you need to know as an investor for the coming day.As the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq set fresh record highs, investors will get a dose of economic reality, for better or worse, as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen heads to Capitol Hill. Quarterly reports from more shale producers will continue to trickle in, this time from Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Devon Energy (DVN), while hot biotech Incyte (INCY) reports as well as construction materials provider Martin Marietta (MLM).The Fed chief gives her semiannual testimony on monetary policy at 10 a.m. ET before the Senate Banking Committee and follows it up Wednesday at 10 a.m. before the House Financial Services Committee. Investors will parse her words for clues on when the next rate hike will come. Recent data have been mixed, with the January jobs report showing a strong gain in payrolls but a slowdown in wage growth.Expect questions on how the agenda of the Trump administration and the GOP on spending and tax reforms could affect the Fed's stance. Trump's economic team has also talked about using alternative gauges of unemployment that incorporate people too discouraged to actively seek work, so watch for that too.The shale producer reports Q4 results after the market closes.Estimates: EPS to slip 7% to 54 cents while revenue surges 46% to $167.5 million.Stock: Shares fell 0.5% to 104.30 on the stock market today, but are still near a 113.33 buy point.Crude prices retreated Monday amid signs that U.S. production gains may offset the effects of OPEC's output cuts. The Permian Basin in particular has been the focus of U.S. activity and investment since oil prices started recovering last year. And as a Permian-focused company, any guidance from Diamondback on capital expenditures and output may indicate where other companies are headed.The oil exploration and production company reports Q4 results after the close.Estimates: EPS is seen plunging 73% to 21 cents, with revenue down 1.8% to $2.8 billion.Stock: Shares eased 0.3% to 45.26 but are within striking distance of a 50.79 entry.The biotech reports Q4 numbers before the opening bell.Estimates: EPS to sink 55% to 13 cents while revenue climbs 33% to $324.4 million.Stock: Shares slid 55 cents to 121.15 but broke out last month and are above buy range.RELATED:Incyte Gets $112 Million Boost On Novartis Jakavi Royalties: RBCIncyte Stock Breaks Out, It And Partner Merck Will Advance Key Trial The provider of construction aggregates reports Q4 results before the open.Estimates: EPS to jump 41% to $1.62 as revenue rises 15% to $896.65 million.Stock: Shares rose 0.5% to 231.39, as they try to retake a 236.51 buy point. Martin Marietta broke out in late January then fell below the buy zone days later amid doubts about an infrastructure spending package that was seen benefiting the company.Also, rival Vulcan Materials (VMC) recently missed estimates, citing an earlier-than-expected seasonal ramp-down of construction activity, and 2017 guidance was also softer than expected.
"
537,MA,"The International Energy Agency said Thursday that the U.S. shale sector has emerged from the oil bust much ""leaner and fitter"" with productivity showing improvement in ""leaps and bounds,"" threatening a production-cut deal by OPEC and key non-OPEC members.Last year, oil production per rig jumped as much as 39% in the Bakken shale formation, 41% in the Permian Basin, and 26% in Eagle Ford, according to IEA's latest monthly report. While that is also due to companies focusing on their most productive wells, it said improved well completion techniques, longer lateral wells, and the use of more proppants have increased recovery estimates.The energy watchdog now sees U.S. oil production rising by 320,000 barrels per day this year, up from its prior view for only a ""marginal increase,"" after contracting by 475,000 barrels a day last year.Still, that increase is small compared with the 1.8 million barrels a day in production that OPEC and non-OPEC countries have pledged to reduce. But concerns that U.S. shale will roar back have already weighed on crude prices.On Thursday, U.S. crude settled up 0.6% at $51.37 a barrel after diving by 2.8% Wednesday, but pared gains after the Energy Department reported  a U.S. crude inventory buildup of 2.3 million barrels last week vs. expectations for a drop of 342,000 barrels. The American Petroleum Institute's report showed a plunge of 5 million barrels late Wednesday. U.S. production was essentially flat at 8.94 million barrels a day.After OPEC agreed in late November to trim output for six months starting this month, IEA noted that the U.S. rig count increased by 48 for the month of December, the biggest monthly gain since 2014.The stepped up U.S. activity has been focused on the Permian Basin, where acquisitions are also ramping up. On Tuesday, Exxon Mobil (XOM) agreed to pay up to $6.6 billion to more than double its Permian resource holdings, a day after Noble Energy (NBL) agreed to buy Clayton Williams Energy (CWEI) for $2.7 billion to expand in the lucrative shale area.Last week, Parsley Energy (PE), already a Permian player, said it bought $607 million worth in acreage in the area from various sources. And last month, Diamondback Energy (FANG) agreed to pay $2.43 billion for Permian acreage from Brigham Resources.IEA warned higher material and service costs will erode productivity gains, and increases in production will lag growth in rig counts by several months.But bigger gains may be ahead. While well completions are estimated to grow by 26% this year, ""more substantial growth"" is seen in 2018, IEA said.Shares of Exxon fell 1.8% to 84.73 on the stock market today, after receiving a downgrade from UBS to sell. Noble Energy rose 1.2%, Parsley added 0.9%, and Diamondback rallied 1.7%.

538,MA,"Retail brokerages Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) saw an influx of client assets last quarter as soaring consumer confidence and the Dow Jones industrial average's flirtation with the 20,000 mark prompted individual investors to jump into the stock market.Estimates: Q4 EPS to surge 50% to 36 cents as revenue grows 17% to $1.98 billion.Results: EPS of 36 cents on revenue of $1.97 billion. New retail brokerage accounts jumped 21% to 182,000. Financial planning help conversations rose 10% to 32,000 clients. Total client assets at year-end were up 11% at $2.78 trillion.Stock: Shares closed up 1.9% at 41.10 on the stock market today, reversing earlier losses. Like its banking giants peers, Charles Schwab took off in the weeks immediately after the election but has since cooled off. E*Trade Financial (EFTC), which reports Jan. 26, finished 1.7% higher.Estimates: Fiscal Q1 EPS up 5% to 41 cents as revenue increases 5.6% to $857.3 million.Results: EPS of 41 cents on revenue of $859 million. New client assets grew at an annualized rate of 10% to $19 billion. Total client assets up 15% to $797 billion. Average client trades per day rose 11% to 487,000.""Strong organic growth from net new client assets, rate-sensitive assets and new accounts, coupled with emerging tailwinds from the improving interest rate environment, provides a solid base for future earnings growth,"" said CFO Steve Boyle in a statement.Stock: Shares climbed 1.7% to 46.65.IBD'S TAKE: Brokers that rely on trading commissions face the risk of a severe drop in revenues if the market is dull and customers are not active. But a brokerage like Schwab that acts as a custodian of assets can grow both the top and bottom lines by charging a variety of fees.In a recent interview with IBD, Charles Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger said he intends to do for investment planning what low-cost ETFs, mutual funds and robo-advice platforms have helped his company do for asset allocation.In other words, use technology to make high-level financial planning accessible and affordable to all investors, at next-to-nothing cost.Schwab's Q3 report showed core net new assets grew by $30 billion, sustaining what the firm called a ""solid"" 5% annualized organic growth rate. At the end of Q3, the company had 10 million brokerage accounts and 1.1 million bank accounts, up 4% and 6%, respectively.Schwab financial consultants also held planning conversations with 34,000 clients in Q3, up 17%.

541,MA,"Many investors began to drool over the energy and financial sectors after the November elections. The prospect of lower corporate tax rates and less restrictive regulatory yokes was a big reason. But Larry Puglia, manager of $34.2 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX), began to place a lot of new bets on the technology sector.That's despite the fact that the tech sector stands to benefit less from changes in corporate taxes. Many tech companies already have less-than-peak rates, Puglia says. In addition, tech industry leaders worry that President Trump's immigration policies could deprive them of skilled workers. Also, investors feared there was friction between President Trump and Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, over the newspaper's campaign coverage.But Puglia feels the benefit to corporations — including many tech companies — of repatriation of bank accounts stuffed with cash has been overlooked somewhat. And Puglia thinks the likelihood of antagonism between the tech sector and the White House is overblown. ""We do not think that would happen to a great degree,"" Puglia said.Puglia's warm outlook for tech is reflected in the fund's most recently disclosed top-10 additions in the past six months. They included not only banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM), but also techies Microsoft (MSFT), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Alibaba Group (BABA), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Priceline (PCLN) and Facebook (FB).Fast-food restaurant operator Yum Brands (YUM) was another top-10 addition. And the fund began a new position in brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW) that was large enough to also enter its top 10.IBD'S TAKE: As the Trump agenda continues to steer the stock market, read IBD Leaderboard and The Big Picture every day to find highly rated stocks and sectors poised to move higher.Puglia's moves are worth watching. Going into Thursday, his fund's 14.64% average annual gain over the prior five years outperformed 94% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500's 14% pace also trailed. He's in the top 84% year to date, which marks a rebound from 2016's modest 0.98% gain.JPMorgan shot higher shortly before Election Day. After four quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 1%, 20% and 20% in the past three stanzas. Like other banks, JPMorgan benefits from investors' expectations that this corner of financial services will face a lighter regulatory burden than it would have under a Democratic-held White House or Congress. In addition, banks are expected to carve out wider net margins as interest rates increase. They are not expected to raise interest paid to depositors by much if any, yet they will be able to charge more for loans.Microsoft is well-positioned to keep on generating strong growth in its Office 365 suite of products, Puglia says. He also likes the outlook for its corporate cloud operations and Azure, its public cloud-computing platform.Chipmaker NXP is a leading provider of semiconductor solutions used in automotive connectivity and infotainment, he says. NXP's chips are also used in smartphone near-field communications payment applications. On Tuesday, Qualcomm (QCOM) extended its takeover bid for NXP until April 4.Alibaba offers consumer-to-consumer e-commerce services through its Taobao business and it runs T-Mall, a business-to-consumer platform. Both have dominant market share, Puglia says. Alibaba is also a leader in cloud processing services. The Chinese government is a key customer. Trading around 103 as of early Thursday, shares are below a 104.67 cup-with-handle entry.Money-transfer services provider PayPal has a five-year earnings annual growth rate of 25%. And it has reached deals with Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) that are mutually beneficial, Puglia says. Many investors had feared a more adversarial competition among the three companies. And Puglia likes PayPal's Venmo, Braintree and One Touch services.Trading around 43, shares are still trading just under a 43.17 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. EPS grew 9%, 13% and 17% in the past three quarters.Priceline gapped up nearly 6% on Feb. 28, a day after reporting a 32% increase in fourth-quarter EPS. Its top line grew 17% to $2.34 billion. Both earnings and revenue topped the company's own guidance. Hotel bookings have been the stock's largest growth driver. Airline ticket sales fell. That's despite steadily low oil prices, which have helped keep airfares down. The company's EPS grew 12%, 23% and 32% the past three quarters.Facebook shares are up 20% this year. Investors have begun to appreciate how well the company's advertising products, video strategy and Instagram photo sharing are being received, Puglia says. He adds that its investment in WhatsApp and Messenger also provides solid positioning in the messaging market, which is growing in popularity. ""We especially like the company's efforts to promote the use of video on its platform and to better monetize Instagram and video,"" he said.Facebook reportedly made the launch of its Facebook Live video service a priority last year. But enough users have posted videos of violence and crime to make at least some advertisers wary of the platform, according to CNBC.com. Facebook also has been hit with measurement controversies.Yum shares rose 9% this year through Feb. 13 to a 52-week high, but they've pulled back 7% since then. That has left them a scant 3% above where they were when Yum spun off its China division last Oct. 31. After EPS grew 44% for three quarters in a row, EPS grew 18% in Q4.Schwab has done a nice job of growing customer assets under management, Puglia wrote to shareholders on Dec. 31. ""Its earnings should benefit substantially from rising interest rates,"" Puglia added. ""This is enhanced by the fact that Schwab has a significant bank embedded within the company. That enables it to sweep brokerage deposits into the bank, creating more net interest income.""Rain fell on Schwab's parade recently when it got caught up in a pricing war with Fidelity Investments and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) over brokerage commissions. But Puglia says Schwab is far less dependent on commissions than TD Ameritrade is.RELATED:12 Blue-Chip Beauties That This Top Money Manager Likes NowDoes Your Mutual Fund Manager Have Skin In The Game?

544,MA,"More than 33 million Amazon (AMZN) customers used the company's payment system to make a purchase in 2016, as payment volume nearly doubled.The 33 million customers of Amazon Payments is up from 23 million since April 2015, the company said.Amazon is making a concerted effort to expand its online payment abilities. It relaunched Amazon Payments in 2013 after years of experiments in the online payments field.Payment processor PayPal (PYPL) recently said it's in talks with Amazon about a partnership. PayPal already has agreements with Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), as well as with Facebook (FB).Cowen analyst George Mihalos, in a research note, said he does not believe a PayPal deal with Amazon is imminent, and he expects the companies ""likely will remain competitors on multiple fronts.""Amazon stock rose 0.6% to 812.50 in the stock market today. PayPal stock rose 0.7% to 40.02. PayPal stock has retreated from an all-time high of 44.15 set on Oct. 21. The company was spun off from eBay (EBAY) in July 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts mostly gave Amazon a thumbs down on its fourth-quarter earnings report posted late Thursday, which missed on revenue, as did its Q1 outlook, sending the stock down on Friday.With Amazon Payments, merchants can choose to integrate services such as Pay with Amazon, offering simpler ways for online shoppers to authenticate with their Amazon account on a third-party website.The increase in users of Amazon Payments is attributable, in part, to the expansion of Amazon Payments into France, Italy and Spain and into new markets such as government payments, travel, digital goods, insurance, entertainment, nonprofits and charities.Amazon Payments competes with PayPal, Visa, Mastercard and others in the payment processing field.""As consumers shop in more and more ways — online, in store, and on the go — their expectations for speed, convenience and personalization continue to grow,"" said Patrick Gauthier, vice president of Amazon Payments, in the company's press release.RELATED:Workday Adds Amazon As Customer, After Wal-Mart Deal

545,MA,"American Century All-Cap Growth Fund (TWGTX) is enjoying an uptick in performance so far this year relative to its large-cap growth rivals. The outperformance stems from recent gains by the type of stocks it has long favored: U.S. stocks with sustainable accelerating growth. Two of the places it's finding those are in internet leaders and electronic payment platforms. The surge has $1 billion All-Cap Growth pointing back in the direction of its long-term outperformance.So far in this young year, the fund is up 3.31%, going into Thursday. That tops 66% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged a 3.04% gain as the S&P 500 rose 1.56%. The fund topped 49% of its direct rivals over the past year. It beat 90% of its peer group over the past 10 years.During the fund's year-to-date romp, best performing investments included such top holdings as social media giant Facebook (FB), with a good 90 Composite Rating from IBD, which is up 11% this year. The social network has entered the enterprise software market with a business collaboration suite called Workplace. Workplace is a challenge to a lot of intraoffice email. It looks almost identical to Facebook itself. But it gives businesses the ability to guide conversations back to work topics.Trading near 128, Facebook is building the right side of a cup base with a 133.60 buy point.Alphabet (GOOGL), the No. 1 holding as of Nov. 30, jumped 4.6% this year. Trading around 829, Alphabet is within the buy range of its 824.40 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. EPS grew 16%, 20% and 23% the past three quarters.Earnings growth is expected to toggle between 17% this year to 19% next year and back down to 17% the year after, according to Thomson Reuters.And credit-and-debit card titan MasterCard (MA), No. 5 in the portfolio, is up 5.2% this year. Sporting a nice 82 Comp Rating — a 99 Comp Rating is the highest possible — its EPS growth has gone from a 12% decline to a 13% and 19% gain in the three most recent quarters. It benefits from rising use of mobile digital payments.While the fund's prospectus allows managers David Hollond, Michael Orndorff and Marcus Scott to invest in companies of all sizes, about 75% of shareholder money was in large caps as of Sept. 30, according to Morningstar. Information technology was the fund's largest sector as of Dec. 31, with a 31% weighting. Consumer discretionary was next with a 21% weighting.In addition to Facebook and Alphabet, tech-oriented holdings included Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) among top holdings as of Nov. 30. Broadcom (AVGO) and Applied Materials (AMAT) were two additional tech names.Broadcom is on IBD's Leaderboard. The company makes analog and digital semiconductor systems for wireless communications and other applications. IBD's Patrick Seitz recently detailed why at least six investment banks have increased their price targets for the stock. One key reason is Broadcom's three quarters in a row of accelerating sales and earnings growth. The bulk of gains stem from Broadcom's merger with Avago, which closed in February.Applied Materials is in the IBD 50.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials is No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its top-notch 99 IBD Composite Rating and three quarters of accelerating EPS growth — stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.Among other holdings, veterinary services provider VCA (WOOF) is up 32% and sports a very strong 94 Composite Rating from IBD. Its shares got a boost from news this month that candy maker Mars plans to acquire VCA.Biotech Incyte (INCY) is another top performer, up 15%, with a 94 Comp Rating.Incyte broke out earlier this month.

546,MA,"Crude prices continued to rally Thursday on fresh signs of OPEC production cuts and improving demand, but more U.S. producers are getting ready to take advantage of higher prices.West Texas Intermediate futures rose 1.5% to settle at $53.01 a barrel, but down from intraday highs. Brent crude climbed 1.7% to $56.01.Top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia has reduced deliveries to Asia, as it implements its promised output cuts. Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzouq said at a conference Thursday that Kuwait has already cut output by more than what it pledged to cut, according to CNBC. His Iraqi counterpart said that country reduced its exports by 170,000 barrels per day and cut them by another 40,000 barrels this week.Meanwhile, China said net crude imports will rise 5% this year as total demand hit a record high amid a jump in car sales.IBD'S TAKE: The pact between OPEC and non-OPEC countries seems to be holding, but a reinvigorated OPEC may not be enough to overcome U.S. shale's long-term disruption.As prices recover from a two-year slump, Hess Corp. (HES) said Thursday it will spend $2.25 billion on exploration and production in 2017, up from $1.9 billion in 2016, and will add four rigs in the Bakken shale formation this year.But the company also said it booked $4.6 billion in charges in Q4 to account for tax valuation adjustments and deferred development of natural gas fields, sending shares down 4.8% on the stock market today.On Tuesday, Parsley Energy (PE) said it plans to spend $750 million-$900 million this year, with 60% headed for the Midland Basin in the Permian formation, vs. its estimated 2016 capital budget of $460 million-$510 million.Parsley also said it expects net production to surge 60% this year to 57,000-63,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and announced a deal to buy 23,000 net leasehold acres in the Permian for $607 million.As oil prices topped $50, other shale companies like Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and RSP Permian (RSPP) have ramped up spending and output forecasts for this year.On Monday, Barclays predicted North American oil companies will boost exploration and production spending by 27% in 2017, with large-cap companies increasing upstream outlays by 58%, with small- and midcap companies spending 43% more.But the net effect of the added spending on drilling activity and output will be more muted as costs go up.Parsley shares rose 1.3% Thursday, Pioneer dipped 0.2%, Diamondback lost 0.3% and RSP Permian was down 2 cents at 43.38.RELATED: Oil Prices Near $50 Floor As Iraqi Exports Raise OPEC Deal Doubts

550,MA,"JD.com (JD) reported fourth-quarter earnings before the market open Wednesday that beat on the top and bottom lines, sending shares up as much as 5.9% Thursday to a 14-month high, though the stock gave away most of its gains by session's end.The company also announced it would sell most of its finance arm to a group that includes Richard Liu, its CEO and chairman, looking to create a bigger rival to the Ant Financial, the financial firm run by archrival Alibaba Group's (BABA) CEO Jack Ma.The China e-commerce services provider reported revenue of 80.3 billion yuan, or $11.6 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $11.1 billion, or 76.56 billion yuan. Revenue rose 47% in local currency.Earnings per share minus items of 6 cents beat analyst consensus views for a 6-cent loss.Shares of JD.com rose 0.85% to 30.93 on the stock market today. The stock broke out Feb. 10 at a 29.33 buy point, but on below-average volume.JD.com's is China's largest e-commerce company by revenue and its largest online direct-sales company. The big-cap company offers a wide range of electronics, home appliances, and general merchandise products. JD competes directly with Alibaba.In a complex transaction, JD said that it had entered into agreements to reorganize JD Finance, selling its 68.6% equity stake in the finance business for 14.3 billion yuan, or nearly $2.1 billion, and also getting 40% of future pretax profit. Liu will own a 4.3% stake.Alibaba in January reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, as China's e-commerce leader by volume raised its guidance. Alibaba reported revenue of $7.67 billion, up 54% year over year in local currency and above the Wall Street consensus estimate of $7.33 billion. It reported earnings per share minus items of $1.30, beating the consensus estimate of $1.13, for its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31.Alibaba shares dipped 0.81% to 103.20 Thursday.

551,MA,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 20,000 to start the week as President Trump's immigration policies and other moves worried investors, but it moved back to that level on Friday's jobs report.  Apple (AAPL) boomed on its return to earnings growth, but investors didn't care for Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) results and guidance. United Parcel Service (UPS) is struggling with the e-commerce boom, while Charles Schwab (SCHW) launched a new stock trading pricing war.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell back below that key level, but regained 20,000 on Friday on the January jobs report and Trump's move to ease Dodd-Frank and other financial regulation. The Dow fell 0.1% for the week while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 0.1%, with all three ending the week near record highs. Trump's immigration orders created conflict with tech firms and trading partners. Earnings were a mixed bag. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) rallied from extreme levels, but not by much.RELATED:Dow component Apple earned $3.36 a share, up 2%, on sales of $78.35 billion, up 3%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31.

Drug stocks popped 1.8% over two days in response.RELATED:Drugmakers Eli Lilly and Pfizer (PFE) disappointed Tuesday with Q4 earnings that lagged the consensus, though sales topped and met, respectively. Roche (RHHBY) sales were light, but revenue and earnings both rose by mid-single digits. Merck followed on Thursday with in-line sales and earnings, though that included $40 million in one-time deferred revenue. Amgen (AMGN) late Thursday reported better-than-expected Q4 earnings and said its LDL cholesterol fighter reduced cardiovascular risk in a study.RELATED:After missing their merger deadline expired, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) extended their agreement end date to July 31. Walgreens cut its takeover price to $6.50-$7 a share from $9 per share, depending on how many Rite Aid stores have to be divested in order (up to 1,200, per the new terms) to get the regulatory OK.

555,MA,"President-elect Donald Trump tweeted late Thursday that he has asked Boeing (BA) for a price on F/A-18 Super Hornets, citing the cost of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35.Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016Shares of Lockheed were down 2% in late trading on the stock market today, after closing up 0.1% in the regular session. Boeing edged up 0.7% late. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and United Technologies (UTX), which are major F-35 subcontractors, lost about 1%.Earlier this month, Lockheed and Boeing were targets of Trump, who called the F-35's costs ""out of control"" and vowed to cancel Boeing's Air Force One replacement jets due to the cost.The CEOs of both companies met with Trump on Wednesday, and Boeing promised to keep the cost of the Air Force One program below $4 billion.On Monday, the F-35's program office told reporters that costs for the next batch of jets will be down ""significantly."" The Pentagon plans to negotiate prices for the 10th lot of F-35s, with the cost for each variant seen coming down 6%-7%, said Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program manager.The cost to develop and build the F-35 is about $400 billion, and the program is perennially under fire for cost overruns and delays. The Pentagon is buying more than 2,400 F-35s for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, and U.S. allies will buy hundreds more.With its stealth technology and advanced system integration and avionics, the F-35 is considered a ""fifth generation"" fighter, while the Super Hornet lacks stealth technology and is considered a fourth generation fighter.Boeing's export opportunities for the Super Hornet have been challenged as countries wait for the more advanced F-35. But last month Canada said it is buying 18 Super Hornets as a stopgap measure after backing away from a decision to buy the F-35 and, instead, restarting a fighter competition. Kuwait is also buying 32 Super Hornets, while Israel added to its F-35 purchase.

564,MA,"In 2010, the earthquake that tore through Haiti killed thousands, displaced more than a million people, and brought down the presidential palace. It also destroyed reams of land records, posing an immense obstacle to rebuilding a nation where property ownership has been either largely informal or controlled by wealthy landowners.The fundamental question at hand: Who owns what?To address that question, nations like Haiti, Georgia and Estonia are increasingly considering the use of blockchain, the shared, tamper-resistant record-keeping technology behind bitcoin that can also be used to verify other transactions. Laurent Lamothe, Haiti's prime minister from 2012 to 2014, began looking into blockchain after the earthquake, according to a post this month on the website of ConsenSys, a blockchain startup.Blockchain could also be used to better track the flow of humanitarian aid money into countries after questions about how much of it actually went to the nation following the disaster.""Humanitarian groups often face allegations that they aren't using money well, which damages their reputations whether justified or not, this deters generous people from donating,"" Sam Cassatt, ConsenSys' chief strategy officer, said in that post. ""Blockchain offers an interesting solution here for rebuilding trust in charitable groups.""The plans come as developing countries also try to find better ways to ensure the integrity of the basic information that underpins a well-functioning economy — and in the process improve their image to officials and potentially outside investors.""Forget the details, all the facts that are needed to be able to see what belongs to whom, and have the degree of certainty that you need to make transactions in a market economy remain to be done,"" said Hernando de Soto, an economist from Peru who has researched property rights and their relationship to economic development. De Soto is working with the Bitfury Group, a tech company whose advisory board includes a variety of former U.S. government officials, on a pilot project to develop a Blockchain-based land registry in the Republic of Georgia. Georgia, a nation in the diverse Caucasus region that became independent after the Soviet Union's collapse, has worked since the 1990s to strengthen the way its government functions and keeps records. How, exactly, the blockchain land-registry project will work in Georgia is not yet clear. But the nation's land registry system is already among the world's most user friendly, according to the World Bank. The nation uses a what is called a one-window system, or a one-stop-shop online system that residents use to interact with the government, said Tomicah Tillemann, director of the Bretton Woods II Initiative at the think tank New America and a member of Bitfury's advisory board.

""With blockchain, that process is streamlined, really profoundly. And you're able to take a lot of the friction and a lot of the transaction costs out of what would otherwise be a very complex transaction.""IBD'S TAKE: Along with human rights, observers say blockchain could save banks billions by removing the middlemen who get paid to verify transactions.Elsewhere, Dubai wants to blockchain all its documents by 2020 and hopes to use the technology to reduce illegal residency and help patients manage their health information. A digital identity system in Estonia could also be strengthened if placed on a blockchain.Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the former president of Estonia, will co-chair a group that was established by the World Economic Forum to help ""design innovative governance models.""Staff from Barclays (BCS), Thomson Reuters (TRI), Deutsche Bank (DB), MasterCard (MA) and the Alphabet (GOOGL)-backed blockchain company Ripple comprise other members of that group. The group also includes staff from the People's Bank of China, the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve.Blockchain's roots in transparency and consensus could also serve as a check against corruption. The government, in theory at least, would have a harder time doctoring or destroying information, potentially making it easier for people to use the facts in their defense.  ""You have an Internet of Things,"" de Soto said.

566,MA,"On Tuesday, Alibaba CEO Jack Ma, one of the richest men on the planet, met with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower. After emerging from the meeting, he stood alongside Trump and announced: ""We specifically talked about ... supporting 1 million small businesses, especially in the Midwest of America. Small businesses on the platform selling products — agriculture products and American services — to China and Asia because we're pretty big in Asia.""Trump shook Ma's hand in front of the cameras and announced, ""Jack and I are going to do some great things,"" before shaking hands.This is good news, obviously. Bringing investment to the United States is worthwhile, and opening trade is excellent. The minipresser was skimpy on details, as most of Trump's economic big-win meetings have been. What does Ma get in return for the headline? Or is he simply moving toward investment in the United States on the basis of broad-based economic policy, including deregulation, from Trump?There is one big problem with photo ops like this: They promote the myth that great men run the economy.Since Trump's election, he has met at Trump Tower with CEOs from major companies and then trotted them out to the press, shaken their hands and announced new investments. This is in Trump's interest — he gets terrific headlines about how his very presence has boosted the economy. It's in the interest of the individual companies, too — they are on the good graces of the president-elect, plus they get the halo effect of being perceived as more patriotic and self-sacrificing.But this routine creates the impression that the economy is essentially a series of negotiations between the president of the United States and individual companies, that the economy is, in simple terms, a rigged game. Advocates for such optics thrill to them. Isn't it showing that Trump is business-friendly? Doesn't it demonstrate that an activist commander in chief can bring the economy roaring back so long as he exerts the force of his will?It's the force-of-will argument that's troubling to advocates of economic freedom. Economies do not thrive because command-and-control businessmen determine the fortunes of individual companies, or because they threaten individual businesses with governmental repercussions if they dare to engage in profit-maximizing activities. Economies thrive because of broad, consistent policies that create reward for positive risk-taking and increased productivity.But the aesthetic of the Great Leader standing beside the Great Businessman runs precisely contrary to this reality. It fulfills a public thirst for someone to run things, even though that thirst generates an outsized picture of what the president can and should do.The aesthetic perpetuates an ugly cycle: Great Leader purportedly runs the economy in coordination with business; economy goes south; Great Leader blames business; public calls for more power for Great Leader; and businesses are called onto the carpet to make concessions to the Great Leader. All of this generates a less free, less dynamic economy.We can all cheer news that more companies want to invest in the United States; we can all hope and pray that Donald Trump's economic policy draws more dollars and jobs to the country. But we should not fall prey to the economic misconception that the president ought to act as a benevolent economic dictator, bestowing favor upon all those who please him.RELATED:Rekindling The Underappreciated Spirit Of Capitalism, One Company At A TimeScandals At State: How Clinton, Kerry Used Office To Enrich FamiliesHere's Why Trump's Carrier Deal Is So ImportantTrump, Clinton And The Forgotten Consumer

569,MA,"Ant Financial, the Alibaba Group (BABA) affiliate controlled by billionaire Jack Ma, stepped up its international expansion by buying U.S. money transfer service MoneyGram International (MGI), it was reported Thursday.The $880 million acquisition marks Ant's first deal with a U.S.-listed company, as it begins to explore markets beyond a home arena it already dominates. The transaction will connect MoneyGram's network of 2.4 billion bank and mobile accounts with Ant Financial's customers, who use a broad suite of technology-based financial services, including payments, credit and insurance.""This gives us a very attractive businesses that's already quite engaged with a substantial consumer base in the U.S.,"" said Douglas Feagin, who runs Ant Financial's global operations, in a phone interview. ""Remittance is a very important activity, and we think this is a great way for us to build a presence around U.S. consumers.""Ant Financial is offering $13.25 per share in cash, according to a statement Thursday. That's about an 11.5% premium to MoneyGram's closing price of 11.88 Wednesday. The company will continue to be based in Dallas and operate under its existing brand.The deal ""seems rational,"" as Alibaba could help MoneyGram obtain a more robust presence in big global corridors, said Andrew Jeffrey, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. MoneyGram shares gapped up 11.5% to 13.25 in early trading, then settled back for a gain of 9.6% in recent action.MoneyGram lets consumers and businesses send cash to one another, generating revenue from transaction fees and spreads on foreign-exchange rates. MoneyGram and larger rival Western Union (WU), the dominant players in the global remittance industry, have been battling increased competition from cheaper digital alternatives such as PayPal's (PYPL) Xoom, WorldRemit and TransferWise.Ant Financial, whose Alipay handles the majority of transactions on Alibaba's online shopping sites, last year appointed a new chief executive officer to steer its next phase of growth and possibly oversee a public market debut in 2017.Formally known as Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group, the Chinese company has begun making investments abroad, notably in India and Southeast Asia, to take its model of online finance and local services to emerging markets. Last year, executives of Ant Financial visited Silicon Valley to size up potential investments and lay the groundwork for an IPO.Ant started out as a unit of Alibaba before Ma spun it out in 2010, inviting objections from shareholders like Yahoo (YHOO).

570,MA,"Boeing (BA) plans to reduce its commercial-aircraft workforce by 8% by the end of this year with more reductions coming next year, according to reports of a company memo, as European rival Airbus (EADSY) grabs market share.That also comes a week after the aerospace giant announced a 30% dividend hike and a $14 billion stock buyback program.Boeing had signaled earlier this year that it would cut about 4.8% from the commercial division this year, with management reportedly telling workers that the Airbus A321neo was ""stealing massive orders from the 737,"" which makes up the bulk of Boeing's sales.The 8% cut this year, which includes a 10% reduction of executives and managers, was billed as a way to increase overall competitiveness, Reuters reported.The 2017 reduction is expected to be voluntary but Boeing could resort to involuntary cuts, according to Dow Jones.Boeing shares finished 1.1% higher at 156.18 on the stock market today, rising further above buy range after an October breakout.The layoffs come amid several changes for Boeing. Last month, the company named Kevin McAllister, a 27-year veteran of General Electric's (GE) aviation business, to head the commercial unit.Production rates for the current-generation 777 are also set to slow as the company gears up for the 777X, and demand for the 747 is waning.Meanwhile, Boeing said earlier this year there's a ""realistic possibility"" it will launch a new midsize plane as well as a longer version of its 737 Max in response to the A321 neo.While that sounds like a major drain on cash, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told analysts at a conference that the company could do both without ""changing our R&D and capex profile"" in the next five years, according to Bloomberg.IBD'S TAKE: Delta Air Lines and Alaska Air shares are both near record highs, but the carriers will end their code-sharing alliance next April.And the election of Donald Trump has proved to be another question mark for Boeing. While the stock has rallied since Election Day, Trump's anti-trade stance could result in some blowback for Boeing's export orders, and his skepticism on big-ticket defense spending could hit Boeing's military programs.Trump has criticized plans for new Air Force One plans with Boeing and decried the cost of the F-35 fighter jet by Lockheed Martin (LMT).But shares of Pentagon contractors like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) have suffered more, as Boeing is seen as less exposed to the defense budget.Northrop Grumman, Lockheed and Raytheon shares rose 0.8%.RELATED:Boeing Sets $16.6 Billion, 80-Jet Iran Air Deal, Still Curbs 777 ProductionLockheed's F-35 Isn't Stealthy Enough To Avoid Trump's Latest Attack

572,MA,"Small business owners' optimism soared in December to the highest level since 2004, the National Federation of Independent Business said Tuesday, as President-elect Trump unleashes ""animal spirits"" on Main Street, even as corporate titans such as General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) tread carefully with the president-elect.NFIB's small business optimism index shot up 7.4 points to 105.8, the best reading since December 2004. It was the biggest monthly gain in decades. A net 50% of smaller firms see business conditions improving vs. 12% in November and -7% in October.""We haven't seen numbers like this in a long time,"" said NFIB President and CEO Juanita Duggan. ""Small business is ready for a breakout, and that can only mean very good things for the U.S. economy.""Stock markets have taken off since Election Day — the Nasdaq hit a fresh high Tuesday — as investors bet that Trump's agenda for corporate tax reform and deregulation will boost the economy. Investor, business and consumer optimism suggests a revival of ""animal spirits,"" a term coined by famed economist John Maynard Keynes on how companies' confidence can fuel investment and spending.The share of small firms saying now is a good time to expand is triple what's normally seen in an expansion.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks are among the few sectors that should benefit from Trump's fiscal plans and Federal Reserve rate hike.But there are concerns on Wall Street about Trump's protectionist instincts and his zeal for praising or criticizing individual companies — and how they respond.Trump last week criticized General Motors for selling Mexico-made Chevy Cruze cars in the U.S., as well as plans by Toyota (TM) to set up a plant in Mexico with plans to export Corollas to America. Ford, which also has come under fire from Trump for its Mexico ventures, scrapped a $1.6 billion Mexico plant. Since his election, Trump has criticized the cost of contracts for new Air Force One jets by Boeing (BA) as well as the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 fighter jet.Alibaba (BABA) founder Jack Ma on Monday became the latest tech titan to visit Trump Tower, following a Trump tech summit with the heads of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla Motors (TSLA) and many others late last month.Trump has called on Apple to bring back iPhone production to the U.S., a move that would undoubtedly make the smartphone far more expensive. Apple on Monday requested to make ""finished products"" and use ""high tech manufacturing"" at a Mesa, Ariz., site. Apple already has permission to make various components at the plant.It's unclear how much Trump's high-profile tweets and other remarks have actually influenced corporate strategy, though the president-elect has been quick to take credit for any decisions that seem to show businesses following his lead.Ford will still make small cars for U.S. export in Mexico, but from an existing plant. And that switch may have to do with declining demand for smaller sedans, which are less profitable in any case.Regardless, Trump's protectionist, highly public management isn't an issue for small businesses. Smaller firms export and import far less than s&P 500 giants, and there's little risk that the incoming president will target a mom-and-pop operation in Topeka, Kansas. Also, corporate tax cuts could especially benefit smaller firms, who have less scope and expertise to adopt global tax avoidance strategies like Apple and other multinationals.November's NFIB survey also showed notable increases, with postelection responses particularly strong. December's results confirm that bounce, with newfound optimism continuing to rise.A net 31% expect sales to rise, up 20 points from November and 30 points from October. Now 29% of small firms are planning on more capital expenditures.Sixty-three percent of small businesses boosted capital spending, up 8 points from November.""Business owners are feeling better about taking risks and making investments,"" NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said.However, hiring plans remain lackluster. Job creation increased by 0.01 worker per firm in December and job openings dropped two points, NFIB said. It cited tight labor markets and a lack of qualified staff.The National Association of Home Builders' Housing Market Index for December sprinted to its highest level since 2005, even with higher mortgage rates making housing less affordable for new buyers, creating a headwind for demand and prices.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index leapt to a 10-year high in December, even with Democrats turning gloomy. The January IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index will be released on Wednesday.RELATED:Alibaba Founder Ma Describes Trump Meeting As Very ProductiveTrump Praises Ford, Chrysler, But GM Bypasses U.S. In GMC MoveEconomic Optimism Hits 10-Year High On Trump, But Democrats Are Blue

585,MA,"The postelection stock rally has injected significant volatility into the market, with some big names shooting through buy zones while others have tumbled back down. But General Electric (GE), IBM (IBM), United Technologies (UTX), DuPont (DD) and Comcast (CMCSA) remain in buying territory as 2017 begins.GE stock cleared a 31.59 buy point early in December and has stayed in the zone since, except for a brief dip below that level. The industrial conglomerate has largely shed its finance unit and stands to gain from an expected infrastructure spending package as well as any boost to GDP that it produces.IBM topped a 161.96 entry in late November and also has stayed in buy range but for a brief wobble in early December. Ahead of a meeting between President-elect Donald Trump and top tech leaders on Dec. 14, CEO Ginni Rometty said IBM plans to hire 25,000 people in the U.S. and invest $1 billion over the next four years.United Tech decisively moved above its 109.52 buy point in early December and has largely stayed there since. The diversified manufacturer's Carrier unit reversed plans to close an Indiana plant, helped by state incentives and expectations that Trump and the GOP Congress will lower corporate taxes.DuPont broke out at the end of November and edged just above buying territory, but then returned back to the zone. CEO Ed Breen has said the incoming administration is unlikely to affect its merger with Dow Chemical (DOW), which would create a behemoth in seeds and crop protection.Comcast broke out in late November and has been fairly steady since.

586,MA,"Alibaba Group (BABA) posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings before the market open Tuesday, sending the shares up in premarket action as China's e-commerce leader raised its guidance.Alibaba reported revenue of $7.67 billion, up 54% year over year in local currency and above the Wall Street consensus estimate of $7.33 billion. It reported earnings per share minus items of $1.30, beating the consensus of $1.13, for its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31.Alibaba stock finished 3.1% higher at 101.43 in the stock market today and touched a more than two-month high.IBD'S TAKE: Investors have been anxiously awaiting a sign that Alibaba stock is ready to turn around after consolidating for the past four months, a correction that saw the stock fall more than 20% from its peak reached back in September.""With three quarters of the year coming in ahead of expectations, we are adjusting up our 2017 fiscal year revenue guidance from 48% to 53% year-over-year growth,"" said Maggie Wu, Alibaba CFO, in the earnings release.Results included revenue from Alibaba Nov. 11 ""Global Shopping Festival,"" also known as Singles Day. For that day alone, Alibaba said it processed $17.4 billion in transactions, of which 82% was generated through mobile devices.Among its various businesses, revenue from its cloud computing unit rose 115% to $254 million. Paying customers for cloud computing grew to 765,000, an increase of about 114,000 from last quarter. Revenue from digital media and entertainment rose 273% to $585 million.Alibaba ended December with 493 million monthly mobile active users, up from 450 million in the September quarter.""We are driving the age of 'New Retail,' which leverages big data and innovation to provide a seamless online and offline experience for nearly half a billion mobile monthly active users,"" said Alibaba Group CEO Daniel Zhang in the earnings release.Alibaba has been pursuing international markets and expects 40% of revenue will come from outside China in the next 10 years.

591,MA,"Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) reports fiscal third-quarter earnings before the market open Tuesday, with expectations of ongoing double-digit growth.The consensus estimate is that earnings per share minus items rose 21% year-over-year in local currency to $1.13 a share, on 46% revenue growth to $7.3 billion. Alibaba's sales have been rising at double-digit rates for more than four years.Alibaba has been pursuing international markets and expects 40% of revenue will come from outside China in the next 10 years. But it hopes for making headway in the U.S. hit a hurdle last month when the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative placed Alibaba on its ""Notorious Markets"" list for counterfeit and pirated items.Alibaba was taken off the list in 2012 after implementing a robust anti-counterfeiting program the company says surpasses every other company worldwide and is above and beyond what the law requires. The designation isn't expected to have a major impact on Alibaba's China operations.IBD'S TAKE: Investors have been anxiously awaiting a sign that Alibaba stock is ready to turn around after consolidating for the past four months, a correction that saw the stock fall more than 20% from its peak reached back in September.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated an outperform rating on Alibaba and a price target of 120, in a research note Monday morning.Alibaba stock rose 2.5% to 98.49 in the stock market today, hitting a more than two-month high.

594,MA,"""Wait and see"" is the mantra of ETF investors as Donald Trump assumes the reins of the highest office in the land. Will his ambitious campaign proposals translate to policy or get lost in translation?""The U.S. equity markets have enjoyed a classic 'buy the rumor' rally,"" built around Trump's promises, said David Haviland of Beaumont Capital, an expert at investing in exchange traded funds. ""The question is, what will be the news that causes the sell?""Haviland is one of two money managers who spoke to IBD recently about their stock market outlook as well as their best ETF investment ideas for the year ahead. For the moment, Haviland is making some bullish bets.One of Haviland's picks, O'Shares FTSE U.S. Quality Dividend (OUSA) holds stocks that could rocket if Trump delivers fiscal stimulus as promised and allows U.S. companies to bring home their offshore cash.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017Henry Ma of Julex Capital, another investing pro, expects two postelection rotation trades — from bonds to equities and from high yield to growth — to continue. His ETF picks, too, reflect an overall optimism.Still, both Haviland and Ma have eyes wide open to downside risks. Like many other investors, they straddle hope and caution as the White House welcomes its newest resident.Here they are in their own words:David Haviland is managing partner and portfolio manager at Beaumont Capital Management, a Needham, Mass.-based asset manager offering ETF-based growth strategies with defensive capabilities since 2009; assets under management and advisement: $3.7 billion as of September 2016.After the Nov. 8 election, the U.S. equity markets have enjoyed a classic ""buy the rumor"" rally. The rally has focused on the promises made during the election and the prospects for beneficial change.Specifically, some of the key topics include a $1 trillion, 10-year Federal stimulus package to improve infrastructure, the reworking of the federal corporate tax system to make our tax code more competitive, the renegotiation of several trade agreements that currently induce the exportation of jobs, and the likelihood of large amounts of repatriation of U.S. multinational foreign profits.All of these items should serve to stimulate growth and reflation here in the U.S. The question is, what will be the news that causes the sell? Investors tend to buy the rumor and sell the news.Here are four ETFs that should do well in 2017. These ETFs are currently owned or could be purchased at any time within BCM strategies.In a low-interest-rate environment, the baby boomers need income from their portfolio to live off of. O'Shares has distilled the universe of large-cap equities down to a portfolio of 151 companies across all sectors that should provide better long-term, risk-adjusted returns.Examples of these portfolio companies with superior balance sheets include Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Procter & Gamble (PG). (Editor's note: OUSA has a 2.32% 12-month yield.)To be included, at least 50% of a company's sales and revenue must come from the internet. The ETF also uses a more limited screening process for liquidity and size. The top holdings include the ""FANG"" stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and (Google parent) Alphabet (GOOGL).Over one-third of humanity currently lives without clean water. The infrastructure required for this most important resource will be massive here in the U.S. as well as across the globe in both developed and emerging markets.The ETF should benefit from Trump's infrastructure build here in the U.S. We do not currently own this ETF but we have in the past, and it could make its way back into the portfolio in 2017.Top positions in the fund include Danaher (DHR), London-based Wolseley, Switzerland-based Geberit and France-based Veolia Environmental, which illustrates the global reach.(Editor's note: While the ETF has relatively low average trading volume, a large asset manager like BCM can access the underlying liquidity of the stocks in the index through the create/redeem process.)In a rising-rate environment, Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) tend to perform better than regular bonds given their yield plus inflation construct — the principal rises with inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, while the yield is fixed.This ETF also uses a short duration, currently 2.4 years, as added protection against rising rates. It yields 0.89%.Henry Ma is president and chief investment officer at Julex Capital Management, an SEC-registered quantitative investment management firm based in Boston. The firm's tactical unconstrained investment solutions aim to limit downside risks while maximizing upside potential; total client assets as of September 2016: $358 million.As we enter 2017, we may be witnessing major shifts of economic policies, which could have significant impacts on financial markets. The new year is likely to see a continuing rise of protectionism, which is evidenced notably in the Brexit referendum and the U.S. presidential election.This trend could undermine global growth, but there will be winners and losers. The export-dependent sectors have the most to lose.After eight years of monetary stimulus, policymakers among the developed countries have realized that loose monetary policies are no longer effective and fiscal policies are needed to spur economic growth. In the U.S., President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to reduce taxes and spend $1 trillion on infrastructure.These potential fiscal expansion programs have improved growth prospects, fueling higher inflation expectations, pushing bond yields upward, and causing losses for bond holders. We will see more rotation from bonds to equities in this reflationary environment. Within the equity markets, the yield-seeking trade has run its course as investors rotate from high-yielding sectors to growth sectors. We expect these two rotation trades to continue, and recommend three ETFs that could outperform in 2017.The Fed is likely to raise interest rates to 1.25%-1.50% at the end of 2017. This higher rate will certainly boost the profit margin for financial stocks. The potential appeal or revision of financial regulations such as Dodd-Frank by the Trump administration will also help improve their profitability and earnings growth.As we expect the U.S. economy to grow above 3% in 2017, the tech sector will benefit from increasing demand and higher revenue growth. The valuation is still attractive as the sector is traded at a slightly lower forward PE ratio than the S&P 500 index.Potentially protectionist trade policies and fiscal expansion programs will generate more domestic demand for small companies' products. The trailing PE ratio of IWM is 21.4, which is close to the PE ratio of the S&P 500 Index (20.4). Better growth prospects will provide small-cap stocks with more upside potential.(Editor's note: These ETFs are currently owned/were recently owned by Julex Capital strategies and could be purchased at any time within their client portfolios.)RELATED:High Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Deliver All-Weather Income With Low Risks6 Best ETFs For When You're Both Bullish And Cautious About The Markets

595,MA,"General Motors' (GM) self-driving cars immediately will begin testing on public roads in Michigan, where winter storms will put the automaker's autonomous technology to the test.The announcement came after state lawmakers OK'd legislation to permit driverless testing. GM also said its next batch of self-driving test vehicles will be produced at the same Michigan plant that's making the Chevy Bolt electric car, the first of which was delivered this week in northern California near the Tesla Motors (TSLA) headquarters in Fremont, Calif.Shares of GM closed up 0.8% at 36.24 on the stock market today. Tesla dipped 0.6% at 197.58.Since this summer, self-driving GM cars have been tested on roads in San Francisco and Scottsdale, Ariz. Tests have also been conducted on the campus of GM's Warren Tech Center in Michigan. But testing in a ""polar vortex"" could present a different set of challenges.For example, autonomous cars from other manufacturers reportedly have been tripped up by clouds of condensation, mistaking them for solid objects. Navigating icy roads could also be tricky for autonomous systems.GM's expanded testing program comes as Tesla's Model 3, which will have the Autopilot feature, is supposed to go on sale next year. While not fully self driving, Autopilot has autonomous functions like lane changing.Meanwhile, Uber began operating self-driving cars in Pittsburgh earlier this year with humans on board also overseeing the vehicles. The company also began offering rides in autonomous cars in San Francisco without a permit from regulators, earning a stern warning from California's DMW.Also Thursday, former Tesla partner Mobileye (MBLY) and auto supplier Delphi (DLPH) previewed what they will showcase at next month's CES in Las Vegas, where they will demonstrate their self-driving technology in a prototype vehicle that will go on a 6.3-mile drive on highways and surface streets.Mobileye, with partners Intel (INTC) and BMW, aims to deliver a fully automated all-electric vehicle by 2021.Earlier this week, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) said it separated its self-driving car efforts into a new company, called Waymo, which also confirmed that it isn't trying to be a carmaker, instead focusing on technology that enables autonomy.RELATED:Alphabet Spinning Out Self-Driving Cars Into Own Unit, Waymo

597,MA,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson, who has been tapped to serve as secretary of state, will step down from the energy giant by the end of the year, ahead of what is expected to be a contentious confirmation process in the Senate.Darren Woods, who is currently president of Exxon Mobil, will take over as chairman and CEO effective Jan. 1, the company said in statement.Tillerson was set to retire in March when he turns 65, Exxon's mandatory retirement age for his position. But due to the confirmation process, Tillerson and the board agreed to move up his retirement.Exxon shares fell 2.2% to 90.58 on the stock market today, as crude prices tumbled more than 3%.The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a confirmation hearing in early January.But some top Republican senators have joined Democrats in expressing concerns about Tillerson, especially his ties to Russia.Tillerson was awarded the Russian Order of Friendship in after Exxon and state-owned Russian energy giant Rosneft formed a joint venture in 2012 to explore offshore Arctic assets.Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has said he has ""serious concerns"" about Tillerson. Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have signaled they will explore his relationship with Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin.But key establishment figures in GOP foreign policy circles, such as ex Defense Secretary Robert Gates and ex Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, support Tillerson.Democrats have also raised conflict-of-interest concerns about Tillerson and any interests he might still have in Exxon.RELATED:Oil Sinks As Fed Hikes Rates, Oversupply Fears LingerExxon Mobil Chief Tillerson Named To Be U.S. Chief DiplomatChevron Cuts Spending To Keep 'Dividend Printing Machine' Going

599,MA,"Facebook's (FB) plan to acquire scripted, unscripted and sports videos moves the social networking giant closer to becoming a media company, joining tech rivals like Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Twitter (TWTR) and Netflix (NFLX) that are jumping into the content space.Facebook has long insisted that it isn't a media company, but streaming videos on its Live service feature content from users as well as content from media partners like CNN (owned by Time Warner (TWX)), the New York Times (NYT) and BuzzFeed. It also is cracking down on fake news spread via the site, taking a more active role in curation.Now Facebook's new head of global creative strategy, Ricky Van Veen, said the company is looking to ""kickstart an ecosystem of partner content"" for its new Video tab by funding some ""seed video content.""""Our goal is to show people what is possible on the platform and learn as we continue to work with video partners around the world,"" he said in a statement Wednesday.Facebook shares closed down less than 0.1% on the stock market today. Amazon lost 0.7%, Alphabet rose 0.3%, Netflix dipped 0.3% and Twitter dropped 2.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix's recent Hollywood spending spree for new content has highlighted what could be an emerging identity crisis: Is it still a hot tech play or a media company that acts like its tech?Amazon, Alphabet's YouTube and Netflix have been ramping up efforts to produce original content. Twitter has also been streaming some NFL games, and on Wednesday released an update ""powered by"" its Periscope live video app that lets users send video without installing Periscope or creating an account.Like Facebook, Google and Twitter have also signaled more oversight over content that appears in their services, edging away from being just platforms for users.Meanwhile, media giants like Walt Disney (DIS) and CBS (CBS) are getting more aggressive in streaming as they lose subscribers to cord-cutters.Disney has said it will use its investment in BAM Technologies to launch a standalone streaming service for ESPN, which has been hemorrhaging viewers in recent years.RELATED:Facebook's Instagram Brings Live Video Feature To All U.S. UsersFacebook Reportedly Working On Curated News From Picked Partners

601,MA,"Boeing (BA) said late Monday that it will increase its quarterly dividend by 30% to $1.42 a share and replace its stock repurchase program with a new $14 billion buyback, while key uncertainties linger over the longer term.The aerospace giant enjoys a backlog of more than 5,600 commercial aircraft order as airlines scrambled to recapitalize their fleets in recent years, and Boeing is ramping up production of planes to meet demand, providing a steady source of cash for the company.""As our team delivers on our large and diverse order backlog, and drives greater efficiency across our business, Boeing is well positioned to generate increasing cash flows and meet our commitment to provide competitive returns to our shareholders,"" said Boeing Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg in a statement.Shares were up 1.6% at 159.70 in late trading on the stock market today, after closing 0.4% higher in the regular session at 157.16. The after-hours action suggests that Boeing may top its February 2015 peak of 158.83 on Tuesday.But Boeing has seen United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) delay hefty orders this year as carriers look to cut costs or invest money elsewhere. United even said it may add more used jets to its fleet.Cheap fuel costs have allowed airlines to fly older, less efficient models since the oil bust. While OPEC and non-OPEC members just reached a deal to trim production and prop up prices, increased output from U.S. shale companies could keep downward pressure on oil, and doubts remain about the credibility of the deal.Meanwhile, Boeing also said earlier this year there's a ""realistic possibility"" it will launch a new midsize plane as well as a longer version of its 737 Max, after losing market share to rival Airbus' (EADSY) A321 neo.While that sounds like a major drain on cash, Boeing's Muilenburg assured analysts at a conference that the company could do both without ""changing our R&D and capex profile"" in the next five years, according to Bloomberg.The incoming Trump administration also represents another source of uncertainty, as he has taken to Twitter (TWTR) to signal displeasure with costs for programs like Boeing's Air Force One replacement and Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35.And Boeing's $16.6 billion, 80-jet deal with Iran, which was made possible by Tehran's nuclear deal with the U.S. and other western powers in January, is at risk as President-elect Donald Trump has harshly criticized the nuclear agreement and threatened to tear it up.Boeing late Monday also said it would cut its 777 production to five a month from seven, starting next August. That assumes that the Iran deal, which includes 30 777 jets, will go through.Airbus, which has its own pending Iran jet deal that may close soon, rose 1.75% to 15.99 on Monday.

602,MA,"Half of the 18 components of IBD's ETF Sector Rotation index are financials, which gives you an idea just how strong the sector has been performing.One of the new faces in that batch is iShares U.S. Financial Services (IYG), a fund with a more-diversified profile than the various banking ETFs in the index, but one that still draws most of its strength from banks.Nearly 60% of the fund is in big banks such as Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) plus many small regional players. But the fund expands its scope with more than 30% of holdings in financial services firms such as NYSE operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and BlackRock (BLK), which happens to be the parent of the iShares family of ETFs.About 10% of the portfolio is categorized as software, where credit card companies Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) are found.The fund differs from its larger cousin, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), in a couple of significant ways. Financial Select Sector has about two-thirds as many holdings and they're generally bigger stocks. The average market cap for Financial Select Sector is $89.6 billion, compared with $69.5 billion for iShares U.S. Financial, according to Morningstar.A great many of the 110 stocks in the iShares fund are near the 10-week moving average, including most of the largest holdings. Similarly, iShares U.S. Financial Services is testing support as it pulls back to the 10-week moving average. A rebound from its current level would create a buy area for the ETF.The outlook for the financial sector is improving, as the first round of earnings has been mostly favorable. But uncertainly over tax proposals rattled bank stocks the past week.Financial are reporting the second-highest earnings growth of all 11 S&P sectors, 16.2% as of a week ago, according to a report from FactSet Research. Insurance companies are expected to have the highest earnings growth at 45%, followed by Capital Markets at 29%.""At the company level, AIG (AIG), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America are the largest contributors to earnings growth for this sector,"" FactSet noted.But financial stocks have been following a couple of other important trends. First, bond yields have been climbing as the Federal Reserve weans the U.S. economy off an easy monetary policy. Second, Republicans in Congress have a chance to unwind or eliminate regulations that have dampened bank profits. In fact, the Nov. 8 election sparked a rally in the fund that resulted in a 13.7% surge in November, its best month since April 2009.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

606,MA,"Credit-card issuer American Express (AXP) reported mixed fourth-quarter results after the close Thursday and gave strong guidance.Estimates: A 20% earnings-per-share drop to 98 cents, with revenue down 5% to $7.949 billion.Results: Adjusted EPS of 91 cents on revenue of $8.02 billion. Provisions for losses rose 9% to $625 million.Outlook: Full-year 2017 EPS of $5.60-$5.80, with the midpoint above consensus estimates for $5.61""We continued to grow our lending portfolio faster than the market while maintaining industry-leading credit metrics. We acquired over 10 million new cards globally last year, and we added more than a million new merchants to our network in the United States alone,"" Chairman and CEO Kenneth Chenault said in a statement.Stock: American Express fell 0.8% late. Shares closed down 1% at 76.69 on the stock market today. Visa (V) dipped 0.15% after finishing 0.2% higher at 81.73, closing in on an 84.06 buy point, while MasterCard (MA) was flat late, but ended 0.1% lower at 108.53, after clearing a 109.03 entry earlier in the day before reversing lower.Last year, American Express' partnership with Costco (COST) ended as the warehouse membership giant switched allegiances to Citigroup (C) and Visa. The strong dollar and low gas prices have also weighed on American Express.Q4 marked the second straight quarter of lower EPS, with further declines seen in Q1 and Q2, until comparisons ease as American Express laps the end of its Costco partnership.Adjusted for the Costco business, currency swings and interest expense, American Express said Q4 revenue rose 6%.IBD'S TAKE: Within the S&P 500, banks are among the few stocks that can benefit when interest rates go up.As with other financial institutions, shares of American Express have risen after the election on the prospect that the new Trump administration would usher in economic growth and higher interest rates.Banks that issue credit cards, like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC), carry customers' balances and stand to earn more income from interest payments as rates rise.Likewise, American Express, Capital One Financial (COF) and Discover Financial (DFS) also carry balances, and shares in those companies shot up along with those of banks. Visa and MasterCard, however, make their money from transaction fees.RELATED:American Express, Lam Research Guide High; eBay Guides LowVisa Fiscal Q4 Earnings, Revenue Beat But Outlook Light

619,MA,"Top U.S. shale stocks re-entered buy range Monday as crude prices spiked following Saturday's agreement between OPEC and top non-OPEC producers to cut output next month, but they erased much of their gains or even traded lower as oil prices pared gains.U.S. crude futures rose 2.6% to $52.83, their best close since July 2015. But oil rose more than 5% intraday.Shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) rose as high as 57.81 intraday, clearing a 54.42 buy point, but closed down 2.8% to 52.80 on the stock market today.The stock previously broke out with a 23% pop after OPEC announced its production agreement on Nov. 30, but drifted lower amid doubts that it can actually be implemented.Diamondback Energy (FANG) surged to 113.16 intraday, easily topping its 106.94 entry point, but settled off 1% at 104.99. Diamondback shot up 13% on Nov. 30 that initially put it in buy zone.Concho Resources (CXO) fell 1.1% to 140.84 after initially rising to 147.55, breaking out from its 143.70 buy point.

620,MA,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) became the latest company to come under attack by President-elect Donald Trump, who criticized the defense giant's F-35 stealth fighter program for having ""out of control"" costs.It came a week after he vowed to cancel Boeing's (BA) Air Force One replacement planes, citing the cost.The cost to develop and build the F-35 is about $400 billion, and the program is perennially under fire for cost overruns and delays. The Pentagon is buying more than 2,400 F-35s for the Air Fore, Navy and Marine Corps, and U.S. allies will buy hundreds more.In a tweet Monday, Trump was hammered to program for escalating expenses.The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016In an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Trump reiterated his attack on Boeing and said the F-35's cost is ""out of control.""""We welcome the opportunity to address any questions the president-elect has about the program,"" said Jeff Babione, Lockheed's F-35 general manager, on Monday.He added that the company has reduced the price by more than 70% and predicted it will reach $85 million per plane by 2019-2020. In addition to the acquisition cost, Lockheed is also working on reducing the F-35's operating and sustainment costs, he said.Shares of Lockheed fell 2.4% to 253.23 on the stock market today, but rebounding from a low of 245.50 and closing above their 50-day average. Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, retreated 2.7%, closing near session highs but just below its 50-day line. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the F-35's engines, reversed earlier losses to edge up 0.6% at 110.40, still in range from a buy point of 109.52 Boeing seesawed between gains and losses and ended 0.4% higher.Last Wednesday, Cowen & Co. warned that while Trump's Air Force One criticism likely won't hurt Boeing much, his habit of using Twitter (TWTR) as a bully pulpit could pose a bigger risk for Lockheed and Northrop.""This is in line with his campaign comment that he wants to boost defense spending but feels DoD could 'buy smarter,' "" Cowen said. ""Presumably he won't comment on all defense contracts but will focus on high profile programs. However, given his power as president, this can have an impact on specific programs.""But even if Trump restricts himself to a ""bombastic Twitter shoutout,"" a tougher stance could still affect defense stocks, Cowen added.Among other defense giants, Raytheon (RTN) was down 1.7% Monday, closing above its 50-day. General Dynamics (GD) fell 0.9%.Trump has already taken on Ford (F) and United Tech's Carrier unit for moving production to Mexico.

628,MA,"Blockchain, the shared record-keeping technology behind bitcoin, is creating links to more industries and could upend entire sectors of the economy by eliminating middlemen who currently thrive as brokers of money, products, services and information.Banks have been racing to adopt the technology — by one estimate, investment management firms could realize up to $16 billion in savings over the next five years. But it has the potential to overhaul everything from purchasing a home to buying groceries. Proponents even see people booking rides and lodging directly with blockchain, instead of going through Uber, Lyft or Airbnb.IBM's (IBM) blockchain technology is already being tested to track where high-end goods like diamonds and fine art are coming from to address theft and counterfeiting. And Wal-Mart (WMT) is using blockchain to trace some food items, potentially allowing the retail giant to respond more quickly to food-safety issues like the kind that hit Chipotle (CMG) last year.The potential power of the technology lies in its speed and transparency, analysts say. The need for companies that oversee transactions, shipments and supply chains could be greatly reduced or eliminated, in theory. Working off the same ledger, often called a distributed ledger, everyone sees the same thing.""That means that you have that single version of the truth, basically,"" IDC analyst James Wester said. ""You have that single version of what everybody is looking at.""Still, analysts caution that blockchain is new and largely untested. And if some of the applications seem a bit lofty, that might be because they are. Meanwhile, an entrenched army of lawyers, middlemen and regulators look to push back against blockchain's encroachment into everyday transactions.As opposed to passing documents from person to person or using a database that only allows one person to edit at a time, blockchain works a bit more like Google Docs, William Mougayar, who authored a book on blockchain, said in a blog post in September.Transactions are recorded on a ledger, which is shared among the participants, and sealed in a cryptographic block of code. That block of code links, like a chain, to the next block of code. The information stored can't be modified without changing everything else.Today when you pay for something at the grocery store with your credit card, your request to buy something goes from the store to a payment processor, which checks with the bank that issued your card to make sure you can buy the thing you want to buy. Blockchain, while unlikely to dislodge the ubiquitous Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), could remove layers from that process.A 2008 paper often seen as the basis for bitcoin outlined the idea that online payments need not rely on such third parties that earn profits and take up time clearing purchases, and instead proposed a system that operates ""without relying on trust.""The problem? ""Digital goods, theoretically, are infinite. You can copy and paste them forever,"" Lex Sokolin, global director of financial tech strategy at Autonomous Research, told IBD. ""How do you actually trace that something exists? Blockchain is the solution to that question of how you make something that's digital actually scarce and identifiable.""By giving every participant access to a universal record book via a blockchain network, bitcoin helps keep transactions honest.But that network doesn't have to be so public, despite bitcoin's roots in cyberpunk decentralization, and the financial world has realized it doesn't have to use bitcoin.A blockchain network can be open to, say, only a few companies, or within a company. A variety of startups — ConsenSys, Chain and Alphabet (GOOGL)-backed Ripple — have developed their own blockchain-based technology to facilitate cross-border payments, accounting, asset tracking, and trading.Banks, seeing either a huge threat or opportunity, want in. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has said it plans to develop blockchain technology, while Bank of America (BAC) in September announced a collaboration with Microsoft (MSFT) to develop and test such a network. More than 50 of the world's biggest financial firms have joined a consortium headed by the company R3, which helps its partners research and develop potential blockchain technology.Visa is also experimenting with blockchain to make cross-border transfers easier. Deutsche Bank (DB), UBS (UBS) and others are creating a blockchain-based currency to speed the clearance of securities trades. The central banks of the United Kingdom and China have mulled the adoption of using a shared ledger for digital currency transfers.The finance industry's rush to blockchain comes as high-frequency-trading firms have boiled that process down to a fragment of a second. But there is still a one- to three-day lag time between when a trade takes place and when it is actually settled, intended in part to ensure that all participants agree that a trade took place as desired.""Lots of reconcilement, lots of confusion,"" said Grainne McNamara, principal in capital markets, advisory, at PwC. ""Lots of issues between various banks keeping their own records of that and then reconciling back out to a custodian or an agent or to the market.""And that requires extensive back-office, human grunt work — and costs. Autonomous Research estimates that investment management firms could save about $16 billion by 2021 through blockchain.That same foundation for settling trades can be used not just for trading, but for any transaction that requires a third party to clear it. The list of possible uses seems to grow by the day:South Carolina Republican Rep. Mick Mulvaney, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for budget director, and Democratic Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado announced the formation of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus this year to educate Congress on the technology and how to best create policy around it. In September, Mulvaney said blockchain ""has the potential to revolutionize the financial services industry, the U.S. economy, and the delivery of government services.""But Gartner analyst Ray Valdes believes supply-chain management ultimately represents a bigger opportunity for blockchain than finance once the startup boom and bust settles.""In today's world, there are very real problems, in some cases life-or-death problems, involving counterfeit medicine, counterfeit foodstuffs like baby formula, counterfeit auto parts (like brake parts), counterfeit industrial components,"" he told IBD. ""There's an opportunity for blockchain as a shared authoritative record, a distributed ledger, that can unify not just payments but shipments.""Such applications could also help countries that are developing or struggling with corruption draw new investment.""You need to have a track record that creates trust by foreign investors in your country,"" Sokolin said. ""There are plenty of countries in the world that do not have that, that do not have a strong court system where there's corruption, a demonstrated record of countries seizing assets, things like that.""Consumers and investors may still have to wait several years for blockchain to make their lives easier or less costly. In the meantime, its critics will point out holes in the technology and the legal restrictions it faces. A labyrinth of laws, for example, governs the escrow process and is unlikely to be tossed out anytime soon.And as the broader financial-tech industry comes under greater regulatory scrutiny, IDC's Wester says the growth of smart contracts could run up against the middlemen that interpret agreements today.""There are a lot of things that those third parties actually do — and third parties in a contract would be attorneys, or basically the courts,"" Wester said. ""And what they're supposed to do is also not just provide a backstop for risk, but actually provide information on what's the best way to do things, look for potential issues, understand what might be problems, what might be illegal in the case of a contract or unethical or immoral or open you up for additional risk.""On Gartner's 2016 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, a curve on a graph that measures just that, blockchain sits close to what the firm calls the Peak of Inflated Expectations, right between smart robots and the connected home.From the peak, the curve shows blockchain and other technologies nose-diving into the Trough of Disillusionment, rebounding into the Slope of Enlightenment and, finally, settling into the Plateau of Productivity.The technology, Gartner estimates, has another five to 10 years before it becomes mainstream. That means several more years of blockchain being offered up as a replacement to technologies that actually still work pretty well — despite the urgings of newly converted CEOs.""Basically, the CEO goes on a trip, or to a conference, reads in an airline magazine or a business press article or trade press article that blockchain is the next big thing,"" Valdes said.""They come back to the office, they call in the CIO and say, 'Everyone's saying blockchain is the next big thing — are we working on blockchain?' And if that's your boss asking that question, you have one answer, which is 'Yes, we're doing it.' ""

Among other things, this Industry Snapshot notes that demographic trends are adding a boost.Last month, Winnebago reported fiscal Q4 earnings and sales that topped Wall Street forecasts, helped by demand for towable trailers and lower raw-material costs.Earlier this month, Winnebago completed its acquisition of towable-RV maker Grand Design as it seeks to counter Thor's towable brands like Airstream.Travel trailers are seen as lighter, less expensive, more fuel efficient and less costly to register and insure, helping sales rise 16% for the year through August, according to the Recreational Industry Vehicle Association.RELATED:A Towable Feast: Winnebago's Long-Term Base Maturing

637,MA,"Some of Silicon Valley's biggest companies are trying to smooth over frictions with President-elect Donald Trump, but the soon-to-be tweeter-in-chief's possible protectionist trade measures and strained relations with China could spell trouble for the tech industry.Trump met with 14 tech leaders on Wednesday, and the tech summit's main topic included China. Those attending included the CEOs of Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA) and Intel (INTC). Facebook's (FB) No. 2 exec also attended. But few details about the closed meeting were revealed.Trump, who took shots at Apple, Amazon and tech in general during the campaign, looked to forge some common ground with the tech leaders. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, in the only public comment by a tech attendee, called the meeting ""very productive."" At the meeting's start, which was open to the press, Trump complimented the industry and said he wanted to help it do well.But Trump is off to a rocky start with China's government, starting with a breach of long-held protocol by accepting a phone call from Taiwan's president. China claims Taiwan as part of China, and the U.S. has officially recognized ""One China"" diplomatic relations since 1979. The Trump camp has suggested the One China policy could be used as a bargaining chip to win future trade concessions.During the campaign, Trump promised to brand China a currency manipulator. He warned of slapping a 45% import tariff on all Chinese goods.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix is a current member of the exclusive IBD Leaderboard, where only the very best stocks at or near buy points reside. Netflix has a conventional buy point of 129.39, but investors willing to be more aggressive should check out Leaderboard for some more information.If Trump follows through and elevates the international status of Taiwan and enacts protectionist trade measures, China's government would retaliate, observers say. China did protest Trump's phone conversation with Taiwan's president.U.S. tech, and other, companies should be ""plenty worried"" about Trump's statements, says Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. But if Trump's words don't turn into action, it could blow over. China will hold Trump more accountable once he's sworn in as president on Jan. 20, Lardy says.""He's not president yet,"" Lardy said. ""There are a lot of things China could do, but I don't think they will do any of them until there's something that goes beyond rhetoric.""Talking about how he's going to be a hard deal maker, all these things are not going to set the Chinese off on a path of retaliation immediately. But if it becomes more concrete than just rhetoric, at that point you could see retaliation in the commercial sphere. There are lots of screws they can turn on U.S. companies.""China's possible retaliatory actions include case-by-case enforcement of anti-monopoly laws and business regulations, slapping tariffs on U.S. goods and favoring European multinationals in purchases. China also could put an economic embargo on Taiwanese products.One worry for Silicon Valley is that Trump's transition team and early Cabinet appointments have few ties to the tech industry. Trump has focused on manufacturing jobs, not the digital economy. Wilbur Ross Jr., selected to head the Commerce Department, is well-known for deals in the steel and coal industry.Trump has named Gov. Terry Branstad, R-Iowa, as his ambassador to China. Branstad calls President Xi Jinping of China an ""old friend."" Lardy, though, says it's not clear how much of a ""moderating effect"" Branstad will have on Trump's dealings with China.Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA) has warned Trump about raising trade barriers. And a Chinese state-run newspaper warned in November that companies such as Apple and Boeing (BA) would be among the first to be punished if a trade war erupts.For its fiscal Q4 ended Sept. 24, Apple garnered 19% of its revenue from the Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong. Amid tougher competition from local smartphone makers, Apple's revenue from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan fell 30% year over year in the quarter to $8.8 billion. The was by far its worst-performing region, but Apple has high hopes for its business in the world's biggest nation.Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) gets some 38% of revenue from China, says a JPMorgan report. Qualcomm in 2015 agreed to pay a $975 million fine as part of a settlement with Chinese antitrust authorities that probed its licensing deals.IBM (IBM), Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) head a long list of computer companies that could be impacted by a U.S.-China trade battle, as well as chipmakers Intel and Micron Technology (MU) and data storage product makers such as Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX).Some companies have already been harmed from revelations by Edward Snowden that U.S. tech firms' products have been used by the National Security Agency for spying. China's government responded by telling state-owned companies to buy more local equipment.One wild card is whether Trump can be more helpful to U.S. companies aiming to crack China's market than the Obama administration.Video streamer Netflix (NFLX) recently shelved its expansion in China, saying ""the regulatory environment for foreign digital content services in China has become challenging.""IBM, Intel and Microsoft have complained of Beijing pressure to hand over the keys to intellectual property to win more business.China's censorship and monitoring of social networks has stymied U.S. internet firms. Google pulled out of mainland China in 2010. Facebook, anxious to break into China, has developed censorship tools designed to let the nation's regulators suppress content, according to reports from the New York Times and others.Cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA), which acquired movie studio DreamWorks in April, is ""very, very bullish"" on its China business, Steve Burke, CEO of Comcast's NBCUniversal, said on the company's earnings conference call in July.""I'm talking movies, television, consumer products and theme parks,"" Burke said.Comcast is on track to open a new theme park in Beijing, with local partners, in 2020. Meanwhile, China is poised to become the world's No. 1 film market.Then there are companies like Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) that have a stake in trade relations. China last year said it would open up its fast-growing electronic payments market, including bank card transactions, to foreign companies. China has been under World Trade Organization pressure to open up its payments card business since 2001.One risk for U.S. companies is that joint ventures on the mainland could be put on ice if trade frictions rise. Wang Jianlin, China's richest man and chairman of real estate and entertainment giant Dalian Wanda Group, has warned Trump of trouble if Chinese acquisitions of U.S. assets are blocked.Since China joined the World Trade Organization 15 years ago, U.S. exports to China have risen by more than 600%, while U.S. exports to the rest of the world rose by 80%, Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia, told IBD in an email.The U.S. ran up a $366 billion trade deficit with China last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It has been declining, but Trump aims to lower further.""Many American jobs and corporate profits would be lost if China would retaliate against new tariffs, including in the Republican-leaning Farm Belt, as China is the second-largest market for American agricultural exports, led by soybeans,"" Rothman said. ""Prices for goods sold at places such as Wal-Mart (WMT) might rise by 10% or more.  That would hurt the spending power of Trump's working-class political base.""RELATED:Apple, Palantir Among Loose Ends At Trump Tech SummitApple Hits Great Wall Of iPhone Competition In ChinaAlibaba Singles Day Breaks Record, But Growth SlowsChina GDP Rises 6.7% In Q3, Same As Q2, Q1

Target also noted ""meaningful"" improvements in sales of Apple products in Q3.On Tuesday, however, Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) gave weak earnings guidance for the holiday quarter after cruising past Q3 forecasts.RELATED:Department Store Rally Continues Despite Weak J.C.

648,MA,"Shares of General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) are zooming ahead Thursday as the Mexican peso's plunge since Donald Trump's election victory means the auto giants will see lower costs on cars and parts produced there.The peso lost another 2% after tumbling 8% Wednesday, which was its worst one-day drop since the so-called Tequila Crisis in 1994, when fears over Mexico's debt load, trade gap and foreign exchange reserves triggered a sharp sell-off in the currency.Mexico has emerged in recent years as a key hub in the global supply chains of top carmakers, including those based in Europe and Asia, helped by the country's low labor costs, proximity to the U.S. market, and NAFTA trade deal.GM plans to make $5 billion in investments in Mexico by 2018. And in September, Ford said it will move all production of small cars to Mexico, turning the company into an election-year pinata for Trump and his anti-free trade message.A cost-savings windfall from Mexico would come at an opportune time for carmakers as demand in the U.S. starts to level off, with monthly sales showing weakness in recent months.Shares of GM popped 5.7% to close at 32.73 on the stock market today, shooting above their 50-day average and more than recouping Wednesday's 2.4% drop. Ford rose 3.1% to end at 11.94, nearing its 50-day line, and Fiat Chrysler leapt 9.7% to 7.59.IBD'S TAKE: As concerns about auto demand weigh, automakers have increasingly turned their attention to the development of self-driving cars. That development is unlikely to slow despite safety concerns.But Trump has also said he would renegotiate NAFTA and even threatened to pull out of the agreement altogether, threatening the auto sector's Mexico strategy.On Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is pro-free trade, said he is willing to renegotiate NAFTA. And Mexican Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu told CNN late Wednesday that the country is ready to ""modernize"" but not renegotiate NAFTA.Any talks would be lengthy, and a full withdrawal would likely be tangled in legal challenges.But for now, markets appear to be betting that the immediate upside of a weak peso outweighs the future uncertainty of NAFTA and the havoc a withdrawal could wreak on automakers' supply chains and costs.RELATED:Mexico Is The New China For GM, Other MultinationalsSlowing U.S. Sales Take A Big Bite Out Of Ford's ProfitsGM, Caterpillar Fall Below Buy Points As Industrial Giants Guide Low

650,MA,"Homebuilder LGI Homes (LGIH) topped quarterly forecasts Tuesday while D.R. Horton (DHI) missed earnings and sales estimates as housing data have weakened recently.Estimates: EPS up 12% to 85 cents, with home sales revenue rising 22% to $213.8 million.Results: EPS of 86 cents on revenue of $216.3 million. Closings increased 12.6% to 1,052 homes, and average sales price grew 10.4% to $205,613. Gross margin shrank to 26.3% from 26.4% a year ago but adjusted margin widened to 27.7% from 27.5%.Stock: Shares jumped nearly 3% to close at 32.26 on the stock market today.Last week, the homebuilder said October home closings rose 33% vs. a year earlier, sending shares up 5% Friday. Year-to-date closings are up 24%.Estimates: Fiscal Q4 EPS up by 26% to 77 cents with home sales up 20% to $3.67 billion.Results: Adjusted EPS of 76 cents on home sales of $3.64 billion. Closings increased 16% to 12,247 homes. Gross margin widened to 20.5% from 19.9%.

A key reason is that investors are starting to believe the Fed will raise rates soon.Housing starts have fallen for two straight months, according to Commerce Department data. And while homebuilders could benefit improving wage growth and steady hiring, rising costs for materials and labor have weighed.RELATED:KB Home Sees Higher Housing Revenues, But Stock RetreatsHousing Starts Dive 9% To 18-Month Low, But Single-Family Activity Strong
"
651,MA,"Payment processors Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and PayPal (PYPL) sold off sharply on Monday, breaking key technical levels.Visa shares fell 4.3% to 78.38 on Monday, losing sight of a tight consolidation in recent weeks near the 50-day line. That also undercuts an earlier buy point of 81.83. Visa did manage to close just above its 200-day moving average after falling below that support level intraday.MasterCard pulled back 3.3% to 101.14 on Monday, falling in heavy volume below its 50-day line. The stock is in danger of a round trip from a late September breakout, but for now is still above the 100.10 buy point.Visa and MasterCard rose modestly before the opening bell on the stock market today.PayPal, which recently announced alliances with Visa and MasterCard, sank 3.2% to 38.81 on Monday, closing just above the 200-day line after undercutting it intraday. PayPal broke out of a consolidation on Oct. 21, a day after reporting quarterly results, hitting a new high. But shares have been retreating since then, undercutting the pivot point earlier this month and closing below the 50-day line on Friday.PayPal was flat before Tuesday's opening bell.Global Payments (GPN) and Vantiv (VNTV) also have retreated.It's unclear what it is hurting Visa, MasterCard and PayPal. They make their money from transaction fees, letting card-issuing banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) get the risk and reward from customers' balances. With the yield curve steepening sharply in recent weeks and especially since Donald Trump became president-elect, card interest rates may rise. Bank stocks are soaring on widening yield spreads generally.IBD'S TAKE: While Visa and MasterCard slump, investors continue to rush into bank stocks. They're mostly extended from proper buy points, but you should pay close attention to this new leading group for entry points down the road.That could be why American Express (AXP), Capital One Financial (COF) and Discover Financial (DFS) are soaring. All three carry customers' balances. American Express rose 2.7% Monday to its best levels since November 2015. Capital One jumped 3.4% to its highest since July 2015. Discover Financial advanced 3.3%, hitting an all-time high intraday.Jefferies analysts said Tuesday that the sell-off in some payment stocks is unwarranted.""Major payments stocks including V, MA, PYPL, GPN and VNTV are off 5-10% in the four trading sessions since Election Day. We don't believe this is because of fundamental concerns on these stocks, but rather because of investor rotation into core Financials which have significantly lagged the payments stocks for years, but are now expected to benefit from rate and regulatory tailwinds under the Trump Administration.""Jefferies added that financial deregulation could repeal the Durbin limit on interchange fees and rein in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""If Trump's general plans for deregulating the financial services industry ends up including a repeal of the Durbin Amendment and a less-powerful CFPB, this should generally be a tailwind for the Payments industry, though impacts to PYPL/SQ/merchant acquirers may be less clear.""

653,MA,"Things are breaking in favor of manager Joseph Fath and the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) he manages. The $44.6 billion portfolio was outperforming 98% of its large-cap growth fund rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the three months, going into Thursday.That could help lift the mutual fund, which has been roughly in the middle of the pack so far this year, back to its longer-term record of outperformance, as Fath approaches his three-year anniversary at the helm in January.Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain of 9.53% has topped 85% of its peers, which averaged 7.37% yearly. The S&P 500 notched a 9.18% annual pace.The fund's recent rally stems from the market's rotation back toward the type of growth stocks that Fath favors. Earlier in the year, the market was rewarding deep cyclical stocks. ""That's not an area we play,"" Fath said.Fath prefers stocks with superior growth in earnings and cash flow, in good times or bad.The fund's long-term success has made it one of IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award winners. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds accomplished that. And it was in the top 100 in three categories: all U.S. equity, all growth funds and all large caps.How is the fund managing this rebound? Eight of its 10 largest holdings as of Sept. 30 had IBD Composite Ratings of 83 or better. Five of its top 10 new buys also had Comp Ratings of at least 83.IBD'S TAKE: The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating. Here's where to learn more about reading the Comp Rating road signs.MasterCard (MA) is one the fund's top holdings. It has trended higher since early July, and it did well on Wednesday, the first day after Donald Trump's election victory. But it pulled back on Thursday, finishing 4% below its all-time high.Illinois Tool Works (ITW) is among the fund's top buys. The stock has rallied this month, adding 8% this week. Many investors look at it as a way to benefit from investments in U.S. infrastructure under a Trump administration. Fath instead is focused on the stock's ongoing fundamentals, not its potential macroeconomic drivers.""It's more of a mergers-and-acquisitions story within industrials,"" he said. ""And it is a disciplined, well-run company with seven business units. They're all doing well, all pushing margin structure over 20%. Only the welding unit is under pressure.""Fath added that the company management has executed ""good deployment of capital. They've gotten rid of bad stuff, focused on their best stuff and made good deals in recent years.""Another of his holdings, Martin Marietta (MLM), is more of a Trump infrastructure play, he says. The stock, which has an IBD Composite Rating of 94, gapped up 12% on Wednesday on massive volume and was up again Thursday. That puts Martin Marietta shares above the level at which you'd want to buy them under CAN SLIM rules.IBD'S TAKE: CAN SLIM rules establish buy ranges above buy points to keep investors from ""chasing"" stocks beyond low-risk buy zones. Leading stocks executing powerful gap-up breakouts operate according to a slightly different set of rules.The company produces crushed stone, and an other aggregates for construction.Earnings per share grew 886%, 56% and 22% the past three quarters.The company stands to benefit from programs like the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program, which is a commercial clearance program for known low-risk shipments entering the United States from Canada and Mexico. ""(Those programs) have been slow to roll out but are ramping up now,"" he said.Also, Fath sees the company's low single-digit volume and high single-digit pricing as set to recover into high single-digit growth as the heavy rain and flooding in the Southeast that hurt them earlier this year have passed.Many investors expect certain financial stocks to benefit from a lighter regulatory burden during a Trump regime as well as from a rising-rate environment. Morgan Stanley (MS) gapped up 7% on Wednesday and was up again Thursday.Trading around 38, that left the big financial firm's shares extended above their 32.47 buy point.""(A bullish outlook for a) lot of financials is predicated on a rising-rate environment,"" Fath said. ""We think Morgan Stanley is a good company-specific story.""Fath likes Morgan Stanley's heightened focus on wealth management.And the company's bank is becoming a bigger source of income and profit as the firm does more lending.Ferrari (RACE) is another holding that Fath likes. The Italy-based sports- and luxury-car maker was spun off from Fiat just over a year ago.""This stock does not get a lot of attention,"" Fath said. ""European car analysts follow it. But it is really a luxury goods company. It does not have a lot of capital requirements and it does have a lot of demand backlog.""The company enjoys production growth of roughly 4% a year, Fath says. And it has annual pricing power of about 3% to 5%.""This is a company that can grow in the midteens for the rest of the decade,"" Fath said. ""Other luxury goods makers like Hermes trade at much higher multiples. In today's market, we like a company that can be defensive as well as offensive.""Generally, superwealthy consumers don't downshift their car buying even during a time of slow or uncertain economic growth, Fath says.RELATED:Franklin's DynaTech Wins With Stocks Of InnovatorsWhat Fidelity Trend Fund Likes About Apple, Amazon and Alphabet

656,MA,"PayPal (PYPL) expects to grow its consumer accounts by making its sign-up process easier and expanding its partnerships with technology companies such as Facebook (FB), says Nomura Securities.Nomura analyst Bill Carcache says PayPal is taking steps to clinch consumer sign-ups that have slipped away. Having announced a mobile payments deal with Facebook in October, PayPal is in talks with other tech companies, though Amazon.com (AMZN) is not a candidate for a partnership, says Carcache, who has a buy rating and price target of 54 on PayPal stock.""There's an increased willingness to consider partnering with PYPL because of its consumer choice stance,"" said the Nomura analyst in his research report Tuesday.Carcache says he recently met with PayPal management, including CFO John Rainey.IBD'S TAKE: Cardtronics, the world's biggest nonbank automated teller machine operator, MasterCard and PayPal are the top-rated stocks in IBD's Finance-Credit Card Payment processors group. Learn more about these and other companies at IBD Stock Checkup.PayPal has nearly 180 million active consumer accounts.""Roughly 1 million customers go to PayPal to sign up each month and enter their card information but never activate their accounts due to friction in the sign-up process (for example, requiring users to input bank account information when they prefer to use payment cards),"" Carcache said. ""By enabling customer choice and streamlining the sign-up process, (CFO Rainey) believes PayPal will be able to activate these customers.""By our math, adding 1 million active accounts per month (12 million annually) could translate into 8% to 10% EPS upside (although we note that incremental customer service and support costs could dampen the upside).""PayPal recently announced partnerships with credit card networks Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA).The payment processor in October posted Q3 earnings and revenue that edged Wall Street views and raised its revenue growth forecast for a three-year period to 16%-17% from its previous guidance of 15%.PayPal stock is up 15% in 2016 but has slipped from its all-time high of 44.52, touched on Oct. 24, and is near its 50-day moving average.

657,MA,"Leading tech stocks tumbled last week as mutual funds sold shares in the likes of Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google. But the manager of $3 billion Franklin DynaTech Fund, an IBD Best Mutual Fund 2016 Award winner, isn't panicking.Judging by DynaTech's (FKDNX) lowly portfolio turnover rate of 31% and comments by lead manager Matthew Moberg on the power driving growth in several key holdings, the fund remains hitched in a big way to the market's leading stocks.DynaTech has an outsized bet on technology, with a 48% weighting as of June 30, according to Franklin Templeton.That sort of megabet on a single sector could make a fund volatile. But this fund's performance is consistent as well as strong. The fund was up 3.15% so far this year as of Oct. 31. The S&P 500 was up 5.87%. DynaTech's return topped 78% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged a 0.91% gain.The fund generated average annual returns of 8.42%, 13.2% and 9.26% the past three, five and 10 years.The fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner for having outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds met that standard. It was in the top 100 in three categories: all U.S. equity, all large caps and all growth funds.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersMoberg, 45 years old, has been shepherding DynaTech since 2004. He talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in San Mateo, Calif.IBD: Matthew, why does the fund have such a large technology weighting?Moberg: The fund focuses on innovation and growth.Our name, ""DynaTech,"" stands for dynamic technologies. We define dynamic as a force that stimulates change or progress. Innovation is where the bulk of wealth creation occurs. But we view this as a broad mandate. We're able to look for innovation anywhere.And we believe you need active management to invest in innovation. It's a part of the market that is often misunderstood. Some people believe it is too expensive, or too unknown. So that's an area we look through because those misunderstandings mean opportunities get overlooked.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance LeadersIBD: Is your current tech weighting typical for the fund?Moberg: It's been as high as 50%. But sector classifications change. Amazon (AMZN) is now classified as a consumer discretionary stock. Early on, it was tech.Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) are holdings. They're still considered information technology companies. But one could argue that they are financials.We look for innovation, which can be found in a lot of places.IBD: Health care was your second largest sector, with a 27% weighting. That's another hotbed of innovation, right?Moberg: It's not a great year for health care because of the election (and some candidates talking about price controls). But, yes, there's a lot of innovation there. You see it in possibly emerging treatments for diseases like hepatitis C, cystic fibrosis, even cancer.IBD: What are some names you like in that space?Moberg: Celgene (CELG) and Incyte (INCY).Click Here To See A List Of Biggest Mutual Funds Ranked By PerformanceIBD: Is the fund's performance consistent because it is diversified? Because it's exposed to other sectors, not just tech and health care? Why else?Moberg: Yes, we are diversified. And consistency is also due to our fundamental research. Sometimes we find stocks that the market doesn't appreciate how quickly they will come to market. The best example is Facebook (FB). They launched their mobile ads in Q2 2012. In the first quarter they only did $13 million in revenue. That was 1.3% of their total revenue. Two years and three months later, mobile was doing $1.659 billion. That's more advertising revenue than CBS' $1.63 billion in the similar quarter.Technology adoption is accelerating. The world is more global. Investors often don't appreciate how fast a new technology rises. So we try to think long-term. Our short-term performance is just a byproduct of how we think long-term.IBD'S TAKE: See how near Facebook and other highly rated stocks are to proper buy points. Visit IBD's Leaderboard.IBD: What part of Facebook's story do you like the most now?Moberg: First, mobile usage. Mobile ads will be more effective than other ads, one could argue. Facebook probably has the best set of mobile applications. And there's a runway for growth there.Second, they're starting to monetize Instagram, where people share pictures. The next step is to monetize Messenger and WhatsApp. Usage on them has been explosive. And there's a good chance that this goes into commerce (rather than remain solely a social activity).Finally, when you're thinking about what they could monetize five or 10 years out, Oculus (which makes a virtual reality headset) is another interesting acquisition. Facebook didn't pay much for it. And they can probably monetize it in five to 10 years. It has a long runway, like Messenger and WhatsApp.IBD: Edwards Lifesciences (EW) seems to be benefiting from a new management fiscal discipline and from a key new product, their transcatheter aortic value replacement (TAVR).Moberg: Yes, right now they're going through a very nice product cycle with TAVR. It had a rough start. But now TAVR is an example of a sensational innovation. It enables patients to avoid the need for open-heart surgery, cracking open your rib cage, making a giant incision. Instead, they put the TAVR in through an artery with a small incision. Patients spend less time in the hospital, go through less pain. And with each iteration, the valve gets smaller and easier to insert.That product cycle will last another five-plus years.They're also working on something for mitral valves, which are harder to reach. We hope and expect them to be the leader in that field as well. If they can do it, it would double their addressable market.IBD: Edwards had disappointing sales in Q3 and its stock plummeted. How has this changed your outlook for the company and stock?Moberg: We remain positive on Edwards Lifesciences. Edwards is still in the early stages of capturing the transcatheter aortic valve replacement opportunity (65% share of a $2.5 billion or so market that is only about one-third penetrated).  Its stock also fails to account for any potential for the transcatheter mitral valve replacement opportunity, and mitral valve disease is twice as prevalent as aortic valve disease.  It has faced missteps in new products before — again the world doesn't work as linearly as we would like — but we believe this is an excellent business.IBD: I'll make a wild guess that you are not one of those investors who finds Amazon's product experiments wasteful.Moberg: They're incredibly innovative. They're continually investing in new things. They've had three big successes. The first was Prime. They get money upfront (from consumers). And it drove up usage of Amazon significantly. The second was letting third parties sell on the website, with fulfillment by Amazon. It required no investment in inventory, and generated higher margins.In addition, they have Amazon Web Services, which is increasingly important. It's one of the fastest growing software-as-a-service companies ever.Amazon continues to invest, find new ideas. They've had quite a few failures along the way, but I understand you need to take risk to succeed. That attitude gives us confidence in their continued growth.IBD: Any concerns about Amazon's miss on Q3 results? Any sign of more weakness to come?Moberg: They have gone through many investment cycles in the past. Step-ups in investments don't always, in fact rarely, work within a quarterly reporting cycle. We understand that.  Over the long term Amazon has had very good returns on invested capital, prefers to grow organically and has a culture of innovation.  We didn't see anything in the quarter that suggests that is no longer the case.IBD: Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) is somewhat new to the portfolio. But it has seven straight quarters of slowing earnings. What's your thesis?Moberg: We like to invest in small positions, see how they do and try to hold on for the long-term. If anything fundamental changes and it's right, we add to it.Pioneer is one of the best positions in oil services. They are one of the lowest priced producers. We think oil will stabilize in the 50 to 60 per barrel range.IBD: Why do you like Chinese online gaming company NetEase (NTES)?Moberg: We believe the gaming space is a secular winner. NetEase has some games that have done well. And the secular trends on gaming are better in China than in the U.S., and it is very strong in the U.S. We will see more virtual reality and different kinds of games and ways for people to spend leisure time playing games.IBD: Do you still like Broadcom (AVGO) as much as you used to?Moberg: We don't believe it is as innovative as it used to be. Most of their accelerating earnings per share is due to consolidation. We prefer companies with innovation, which this was at first.Still, they are doing a great job buying companies, rationalizing costs, raising prices. Their CEO is incredibly well thought of in the (chipmaking) industry. He's executing on strategy extremely well. We're pleased that someone is taking the lead and starting consolidation in that industry.IBD: Nvidia (NVDA) is another relative newcomer to your portfolio. What do you like about their chipmaking?Moberg: They were viewed as a provider of graphics chips inside PCs. Then they expanded, making chips inside game consoles. Now they're broken free of that prison and making central processing units for virtual reality. They're also needed in cars, for autonomous driving. Also in hyperscale servers, they're used as co-processors. CAD-CAM, artificial intelligence — their total addressable market is exploding.We think there's a lot of sustainability to the company and a long trajectory for earnings growth.IBD: You have exposure to the pet care industry. What do you like there?Moberg: It's shocking how well we treat animals now vs. 20 or 30 years ago. Cancer treatment, CT scans — they were unavailable years ago. So we like the secular trend. The company we like most and have owned longer and have the largest position in is Idexx Labs (IDXX). Idexx is a particularly well-positioned business competitively, given its unique ability to single-handedly bundle both outsourced diagnostics and in-practice diagnostic instruments.  Idexx also offers superior information management capabilities regarding animal diagnostic reporting and record-keeping relative to competitors.IBD: What's special about Aspen Technology (AZPN), the software firm?Moberg: They do supply-chain management for process industries. This software is so important that even when companies go bankrupt, they pay their Aspen bill. It is the backbone for many companies.They have tremendous operating margin and profitability. There's some competition, but if you are a serious and large company, you need their technology. And customers are incredibly sticky.IBD: Tell me about your co-manager.Moberg: I am lead manager. The fund was founded in 1968. Rupert Johnson, my co-manager, was the fund's first manager. And as you may know he is also vice chairman of Franklin Resources.IBD: Matthew, people often wonder what portfolio managers do in their off hours. How about you?Moberg: I used to run 25 miles a week. I used to have hobbies. Now I have a 7-, 5- and a 1-year-old. They're my hobbies.And I forgot to mention that I'm an avid reader of history. I was a history major in college. I find that useful in looking at micro trends, adoption rates, periods of major and minor innovation, and pattern recognition of new technologies, as well as macro trends like low interest rates, Federal Reserve actions, periods and government responses.RELATED:Top Mutual Fund Manager Captures Solid Returns Without Messy EmotionsThis Top Mutual Fund Manager Wins With 3 Flavors Of Growth StocksHow Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund Targets Stocks With GiddyapHow Fidelity Contrafund Manager Will Danoff Played The Downturn

661,MA,"In America, innovators tend to act and think a certain way. They take risks, seek bold solutions and envision a better future. But to what extent does their hunger for big breakthroughs carry over into other cultures?How the innovative mindset varies around the world:Go wild vs. narrow focus. Americans love to brainstorm in groups and embrace blue-sky thinking where anything goes. Facilitators urge participants to share whatever pops into mind, no matter how half-baked or downright silly.Some other cultures opt for a more structured brainstorming process. Groups may focus on a limited sampling of potentially promising ideas.""With Americans and Israelis, you get more outrageous ideas that haven't been considered before,"" said Melissa Lamson, a global leadership consultant in Scottsdale, Ariz. ""They're willing to throw out 20 ideas and if two of them work, it's considered a success. In Germany and some other parts of Central Europe, they throw out three preselected ideas"" and stick to those possibilities.Bottom up vs. top down. Innovation thrives when individuals can pursue their dreams free from government control with unfettered access to the internet. Yet visionaries can still emerge from nations that restrict the flow of information.When Jack Ma's first web-based startup, China Pages, struggled in 1996 to meet payroll, a powerful unit of a state-owned enterprise in China took a 70% stake in Ma's firm. A resilient Ma left China Pages within two years, and later explained, ""It is difficult for an elephant to trample an ant to death, as long as you can dodge well."" He went on to build Alibaba Group (BABA) into a global giant.""Top-down innovation doesn't always produce results,"" said Duncan Clark, author of ""Alibaba."" ""When the government gets involved in innovation, it often doesn't work.""Change vs. status quo. Different cultures welcome change to varying degrees. In America, leadership gurus often champion the ""change is a constant"" mantra. In other parts of the world, resistance to change can prove more formidable.Author of ""Speaking Globally,"" Beth Urech has lived in Switzerland for half her adult life. She says that the Swiss tend to exhibit a ""we've always done it that way"" outlook.""The process of innovation differs in cultures that have a 'we don't want to rock the boat' attitude,"" said Urech, a Chicago-based consultant.Startup support. Some cultures offer entrepreneurial education, incubators that support innovators and investment opportunities to turn breakthroughs into viable businesses. Innovation tends to thrive in these environments.James O'Flynn, founder of Global Innovation magazine in Leicestershire, England, says that countries that have this ""startup ecosystem"" in place increase an innovator's odds of success. He has interviewed people from South America and India who, after visiting Silicon Valley, adopt the communication style of young techies pitching their startups.""If you're working within a highly competitive infrastructure like Silicon Valley, then that's probably the model and culture you're going to emulate,"" O'Flynn said. ""The language used is often complex, full of acronyms and hard to decipher if you're not from that world.""Shared traits. Despite cultural differences in cultivating an innovative mindset, some entrepreneurial characteristics transcend geographic borders. Clark, the Beijing-based chairman of BDA China, an investment advisory firm, has studied Ma and other leaders of Chinese internet companies.""Jack Ma's story feeds into the Horatio Alger story,"" Clark said. ""He's opportunistic. He knows his constituency and gives them value. And through force of personality, he's a very good communicator.""America no longer has a monopoly on the American dream.""RELATED:Turn Workplace Conflict Into Innovation, CreativityCopy His Success: Joe Wilson Zeroed In On Innovation At XeroxGreat Stock Market Leaders Feature Something Innovative And New

Bradley Berning, a Craig-Hallum analyst, set a price target of 52 on the online payment processor's stock.""PayPal already has about 30% market share of U.S. e-commerce payment volume and we believe that will increase to 35% by 2020,"" said Berning in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal stock is trading above its 50-day moving average, a positive trend. The payment processor has an IBD Composite Rating of 92 out of a possible 99. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Berning says Apple (AAPL) Pay is less of a threat to PayPal than some analysts claim. He says PayPal's acquisition of Braintree in 2013 was a key step in building a mobile payments platform.He expects a boost for PayPal from recent deals with Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA). Berning expects PayPal to disclose more details on the financial impact of the credit card network deals.""A big misconception in the PayPal story is that competition from the large smartphone operators will eventually take share, impacting PayPal negatively in the long term,"" said Berning in the report. ""We believe the opposite. Competitive mobile payment solutions, most notably Apple Pay, will drive adoption and lift all boats.""PayPal was spun off from eBay (EBAY) in 2015. PayPal has 180 million users globally.""PayPal's key differentiator is its compatibility with every mobile OS, hardware, and browser. PayPal will also accept funds from any credit issuer on any card network or directly with a bank,"" added Berning. ""There is no other digital wallet in the market today capable of mobile, peer to peer, point of sale, in-app, online and remittance payments, with the ability to store funds and transmit money between both debit and credit accounts.""PayPal stock closed up 2.2% at 40.83 in the stock market today, hitting the highest level in more than four months.RELATED:Who Got Best Of Visa-PayPal Deal?

667,MA,"The market has underestimated Copa Holdings' (CPA) ability to fuel a rebound in its unit revenue, said a Morgan Stanley analyst, who sees a spike in the key metric next year, while top U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) struggle to turn around their revenue.Morgan Stanley's forecasts for Panama-based Copa ""are significantly above consensus and we don't think the market is recognizing its full potential"" for a recovery next year in revenue per available seat mile (RASM), analyst Josh Milberg wrote, according to Benzinga.While Copa's yield, a measure of airfare, is expected to drop 10% this year, Milberg sees it rising 5% next year with RASM up 6%.Shares jumped 7.8% to close at 85.70 on the stock market today, snapping back into profit-taking sell territory, as Milberg upgraded Copa to overweight and hiked the price target to 94 from 56. Delta rose 1%, United gained 1.3% and American Air added 1.55%. Southwest Airlines (LUV) edged up 0.2%.Among leading airline stocks, Hawaii Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) fell 0.5% to 48.99, falling barely back into buying range from a 47.02 pivot point cleared last week. The stock is in range to 49.37, 5% above the entry area.SkyWest (SKYW) rose 0.5% to 29.78, on the edge of a 29.81 buy point atop a short consolidation.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Transportation-Airline industry group ranks at 128 out of 197 groups tracked, but Copa and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes have been standouts. Here's how a close reading of Copa's stock chart last decade would have predicted a breakout.
"
668,MA,"Major U.S. carriers rallied Wednesday, as Delta Air and Southwest pledged to curb capacity growth.Delta also wants to return unit revenue to growth this year, a goal that has been looking shaky. In December, the company expected it to be ""flat to positive"" by the summer. The goal was later moved back to year-end, and in July, Delta appeared to soften its outlook further, saying it was making the right decisions to reverse its declines in unit revenue, ""even if it takes longer than year-end.""An Imperial Capital analyst said last month that Delta's unit revenue may not grow until 2018, though that would still be earlier than United and American.Morgan Stanley also upgraded Brazil-based Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (GOL) to equal weight from underweight and boosted its price target to 23 from 6.50, according to Benzinga.While Milberg warned Gol is a ""high risk play,"" the airline has seen a ""dramatic improvement"" in its financial situation, due to Brazil's currency strengthening and restructuring moves like fleet reductions, refinancing and cost cuts.Still, Milberg remains cautious, adding that ""While we are shifting to a Equal-weight rating on GOL we continue to believe it presents elevated risk and that it has yet to fully overcome its weak financials.""Shares gapped up 5.15% to 23.90 and has doubled since breaking out of a cup base in July.

Apple (AAPL), a major component of the main indexes, was little changed in the stock market today when it announced what's expected to be a new iPhone model.Volume was tracking higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE. Despite index losses, winning stocks led losers by 7-to-5 on the NYSE and by 3-to-2 on the Nasdaq.Sprouts Farmers Market gapped down to a 13% loss in huge volume, touching the lowest level in more than a year. The company warned that same-store sales in Q3 will be flat, and it forecast full-year comps growth of 1.5% to 2.5%. Analysts had expected closer to 4% comps growth in Q3 and the full year. The natural-foods grocery chain's forecast for full-year profit of 83 to 86 cents also was below views for 94 cents.The company sees weak pricing.

The company earned $1.70 a share, an increase of 8%, while sales fell 4% to $1.97 billion. It was the seventh straight decline in quarterly sales. Wednesday's plunge ruined a chart that had been shaping up well for Casey's, which was forming a base-on-base pattern.The financial sector performed much better Wednesday, with credit-card firms, payment processors, real estate investment trusts, some banks, and savings and loans bucking the market's decline.PayPal shot up more than 3% in active trading after the payment processing firm announced an agreement with MasterCard (MA) that makes it easier for PayPal users to pay with MasterCard. PayPal users also will be able to select a MasterCard as a default payment option, and they'll be able to transfer money to their MasterCard debit cards instantly.PayPay climbed back above its 50-day moving average as it works on a new pattern. MasterCard, which is forming a base with a 100.10 buy point, rose a fraction.Tempur Sealy (TPX) broke out of a large cup-with-handle base, clearing an 80.88 buy point. But volume was only about average for the maker of mattresses and bedding products.

675,MA,"Boston Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz -- productive though ancient at age 40 among Major League Baseball players -- says he will retire after the season that is now nearing its end. But don't count on it. Big Papi may say he won't subject his aching feet and tired legs to the rigors of another 162-game season in uniform. Yet the aging, widely liked slugger will likely actively keep earning income as the pitchman for such product as MasterCard (MA), JetBlue (JBLU), Coca-Cola (KO) and Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN).And surely the Red Sox or some other ballclub will consider hiring Ortiz -- whose 536 career home runs rank 17 on the MLB all-time four-bagger list -- as a hitting coach.If Ortiz does keep drawing paychecks, he will be hanging up his spikes the same way that 70% of Americans who are still working want to: by working as long as possible during ""retirement,"" according to a new Bankrate.com (RATE) survey.The survey also found that 26% of Americans plan to work because they like it. Twenty-five percent said they will work because they need the money. And 19% they will continue to work for both reasons -- they like it and they need the income.Only 25% said they have no plans to work during retirement.Dreams of early retirement also seem to be fading. Only 13% of nonretired people who were surveyed said they hope to head to the postgame showers in their fifties. That was less than half of the respondents who were aiming to retire in their fifties when the question was asked in 2007.IBD'S TAKE: What if you're forced to retire early? Here's nuts-and-bolts advice about how to cope if it happens, how to prepare in advance financially.Still, as that popular but aging band of geriatrics known as the Rolling Stones once sang, you can't always get what you want. Most workers by far lack Ortiz's existing roster of endorsement clients. Only 17% of retirees find a job, according to the Society of Actuaries.So what are some real-world, practical steps you can take to land a paying position during your golden years?IBD'S TAKE: This IBD report explains ways to cut your debt and boost your income during retirement to make retirement more affordable.Cornfield's point is that many people have business and community connections that they can milk. If you are not already plugged into other organizations, look around for volunteer opportunities to get the process started.Post notices of your availability in local stores, the community center and in your local newspaper.""Tutors in New York City can make over $100,000 a year,"" Cornfield said. ""Even if you're making $15 to $35 an hour in a less heated market, that is very good for people with solid skills who like to teach.""""Chances are you can undercut high-cost professionals,"" Cornfield said. Post notices in your community calendar or community center. If you live in a large retirement community, odds are that you'll be handier, better known and lower cost than the professional repairman who lives a couple of miles away.

678,MA,"In just the past year and a half, antitrust concerns have undone or jeopardized several merger deals, adding to doubts that AT&T (T) can consummate its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner (TWX).AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 a share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock fell 3.1% to 86.74 on the stock market today, well below the bid price and an indication investors are skeptical that the deal will go through. AT&T fell 1.7% to 36.68. Still, the companies see the deal closing in late 2017.The Obama administration has become more aggressive on mergers and acquisitions lately, either suing to block them or demanding conditions that were too onerous to accept. Donald Trump has said he would block an AT&T-Time Warner deal as president, while Hillary Clinton has voiced concerns.In February  2014, Comcast (CMCSA) agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, combining the top two cable and broadband providers. The Federal Communications Commission raised concerns, with consumer groups and Netflix (NFLX) also objecting. With regulators expected to block the deal outright, Comcast gave up in April 2015.Charter Communications (CHTR) moved in, agreeing in May 2015 to buy TWC. That deal closed in May 2016.In November 2015, Pfizer (PFE) reached a deal to buy Allergan (AGN) for $160 billion in a so-called tax inversion that would've allowed Pfizer to change its domicile to Ireland and slash its tax bill.The deal, which would've created the world's largest drugmaker, came at a time when politicians were already bashing tax inversions. The Treasury Department introduced a series of new rules that made inversions less attractive.In April, Pfizer walked away from the deal, citing the Treasury rules.RELATED:Forget Allergan: Pfizer Has Its Sights On This Cancer Drugmaker Allergan, Pfizer Strike Off Down Separate Paths After Merger Killed As crude prices were collapsing in November 2014, oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) agreed to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI) in a deal that was worth $34.6 billion at the time. It also would've put the combined companies above Schlumberger (SLB), prompting regulators to warn of a duopoly.Halliburton scrambled to find buyers for assets it sought to shed to win regulatory approval. But the Justice Department reportedly pushed Halliburton to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets to a single buyer.Then in April, the DOJ filed a lawsuit to block the merger, and in May the companies called off the deal, which by then was worth about $28 billion.RELATED:Why Halliburton's Failed Buyout May Actually Hurt CompetitionHalliburton Eyes New Deals After Ending Baker Hughes Bid In February 2015, Staples (SPLS) agreed to buy Office Depot (ODP) for $6 billion as the retailers faced pressure from e-commerce rivals like Amazon (AMZN).It was their second attempt. An earlier one was blocked by the Federal Trade Commission in 1997, but Staples and Office Depot said this time was different because the industry landscape was completely different, citing Amazon and other competitors.The FTC disagreed and sued in December 2015. In May, a judge sided with the federal government.In September 2014, General Electric (GE) inked an agreement to sell its home appliance business to Electrolux (ELUXY) for $3.3 billion as the industrial conglomerate sought to shed noncore assets and focus on areas like aviation, power systems, and oil and gas.The DOJ sued in July 2015, saying the merger would hurt consumers. Before a judge could rule on the lawsuit, GE walked away in December. The next month, GE sold the unit to China's Haier for $5.4 billion.In December 2013, top food distributor Sysco (SYY) agreed to buy rival US Foods for $3.5 billion. In February 2015, the FTC sued, arguing that a merger of the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the market would result in higher prices for restaurants, hotels and other companies that buy food and related supplies.In June 2015, Sysco abandoned the deal after a judge ruled in favor of the FTC.In July 2015, Anthem (ANTM) said it would buy Cigna (CI) for $54 billion, creating the largest health insurer by membership. It came just three weeks after Aetna (AET) reached a deal to acquire Humana (HUM) for $37 billion. The consolidation efforts came as the health sector struggled to find savings and address higher-than-anticipated costs associated with ObamaCare mandates.In July, the DOJ filed lawsuits to block both deals, saying much of the U.S. health insurance market would be controlled by just three companies. But in August, the DOJ signaled it might be willing to reach a settlement with Anthem and Cigna to allow their merger.In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) said it plans to buy Rite Aid (RAD) for $17 billion, bringing together the No. 2 and No. 3 drugstore chains and leapfrogging No. 1 CVS Health (CVS).Walgreens has been looking for buyers who could help the company offload stores and pass regulatory muster. Management is also in talks with the FTC and appeared to be making progress this summer.But Kroger (KR) seems unwilling to buy hundreds of stores that Walgreens and Rite Aid are trying to divest. Kroger had been interested, but wanted to close the locations and reopen them in its grocery stores. The FTC wants to preserve the stand-alone drugstores, sources told the New York Post.

681,MA,"Stock: Shares rose 3.2% to 106.90 by the close on the stock market today, hitting a record high. Visa (V) added 0.4% to 82.22.The results follow Visa's weaker-than-expected fiscal 2017 earnings-per-share outlook, with somewhat slower international payments volume growth likely in Europe and China. American Express (AXP) reported strong results and guidance earlier this month.However, the credit-card payments network's fiscal fourth-quarter results beat views, bolstered by its acquisition of Visa Europe. Visa's performance came despite the strong dollar and weakness in commodity prices and in China's economy, Wedbush analyst Gil Luria noted.Visa also cited its credit card deal with Costco (COST) as a future bright spot.""We enter 2017 certainly with fewer headwinds as we did entering 2016, and we do have some tailwinds,"" said Charles Scharf, Visa's departing CEO. ""On the negative side, the global economy is not improving. Geopolitical tensions are high. The U.S. election is a wild card, and we continue to watch the impact of Brexit.""IBD'S TAKE: As more people pay for things online, Visa's recent agreement with PayPal seems likely to benefit both companies. But analysts have wondered which will benefit more. The comments from Visa's management echoed those from MasterCard in July.During MasterCard's Q2 earnings call in July, CEO Ajay Banga said the U.S. economy was ""still holding steady,"" but that the company remained cautious on Asia and that it was too early to tell how the aftermath of the U.K.'s Brexit vote would play out. While Banga said Mexico was growing steadily and Brazil's recession has shown signs of nearing a bottom, Venezuela's economy was still struggling.""And so as a result, it's likely we're going to remain in a period of economic and political uncertainly, at least for the near term,"" he said.

682,MA,"The conventional wisdom sometimes advises caution when boldness is required. For example, when a stock gaps up out of a base, it's natural to think it's too late to buy.You'll hear remarks like this: ""You should've bought it last week. After today's big gain, it's way too late to buy.""That kind of thinking paralyzes many investors.If IBD was about momentum investing, then the too-late argument would be valid. The investor who buys a junky or mediocre stock simply because of a big price gain is assuming more risk than is prudent.Sometimes you'll see a stock with weak fundamentals notch a big gap-up gain, often within a sloppy base. Those moves seldom hold up.That's not too surprising: If a stock has weak fundamentals, there's no reason to buy it.But what if certain conditions are met? What if the market is in a confirmed uptrend? What if the stock has strong fundamentals and its industry group is a market leader? What if the stock breaks out of a base in heavy volume?If those conditions are met, then the huge gap-up gain is one of the least risky stocks you can buy. Yes, it's counterintuitive to think you should buy a stock that you could've bought much cheaper a day earlier. But that's exactly what you should do.Let's consider a few examples. (Gains were calculated from the closing price of the gap-up rather than the ideal entry that the stock skipped.) In each case, the market was in a confirmed uptrend.A year after its IPO, MasterCard (MA) gapped up 10% on May 2, 2007, clearing a saucerlike base (1). Volume was 556% above average (2). In 2-1/2 months, the stock rose an additional 38% (3). The Composite Rating was 90 on the day before the breakout.The next day, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters gapped up 9% in huge volume. The stock rose 79% further in three months. The Composite Rating was 95.On July 20, 2007, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) gapped up 32%. Surely, this was too much to consider a buy. Not at all: The stock advanced an additional 71% in three months. The Composite Rating was 96.Priceline Group (PCLN) gapped up 22% on Aug. 8, 2007, after a quiet trip to its 50-day line. The stock rose 52% further in four months. The Composite Rating was 98.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the Feb. 7, 2012, edition of IBD. Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, which later changed its corporate name to Keurig Green Mountain, was acquired in March 2016.)

683,MA,"U.S. stock indexes struggled to stay positive Thursday afternoon, while small caps led for a second straight day.The Nasdaq rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 hovered near the break-even line, and the Dow Jones industrial average edged 0.1% lower. But the small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 0.3%. Volume in the stock market today was running slightly lower than the previous session's pace.Blue chips were mostly up, but only narrowly so. Visa (V) popped 1.1%, the day's top gainer in the 30-stock Dow industrials. Visa is sketching a somewhat unorthodox, double-bottom base with handle. The middle peak is only 2 cents below the left-side high. Normally the middle peak is further below the left-side high. A handle with an 80.27 buy point might provide a better entry.Other payment processors show similar chart action. MasterCard (MA) could be seen as a flat base or as a double bottom with handle. The middle peak entry would be at 98.09 (best seen on the daily chart). The handle, which looks like it will complete the five-day minimum requirement today, could offer an entry at 96.60.Discover Financial Services (DFS) has etched a flat base with a potential entry at 58.20.The problem with all three of these stocks is that none have top-notch ratings. Wall Street expects Visa's earnings to rise 6% this fiscal year ending in September. For MasterCard and Discover, earnings are estimated at 5% and 12%, respectively, in the current calendar year.So why are these stocks stirring? Wall Street expects turnarounds for Visa and MasterCard in 2017. Earnings next year are expected to jump 19% for Visa and 16% for MasterCard. That is good growth for two mega-cap stocks. (Discover, which is smaller, is expected to grow earnings only 6% in 2017.)In the IBD 50, a proxy for top-rated stocks, winners for the day led losers by a 2-1 ratio. Stocks striking new highs included invisible braces provider Align Technology (ALGN) and telecom infrastructure stock Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT).

685,MA,"Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings Wednesday morning, with revenue growth accelerating to a three-year high on mobile gaming, sending its U.S. shares to a record high.Tencent follows recent strong earnings from three other large China internet companies: Alibaba (BABA), JD.com (JD) and Vipshop Holdings (VIPS).Tencent, the China-based leader in messaging and gaming, reported revenue of 35.7 billion yuan ($5.38 billion), up 52% vs. a year earlier and beating the consensus estimate of 33.2 billion yuan or $5 billion.Tencent reported net income of  10.9 billion yuan ($1.64 billion), beating views for 9.8 billion yuan. Excluding one-time gains and losses, Tencent reported earnings per share of  17 cents, matching the consensus estimate. Operating margins dipped to 41% from 44%, as cost of revenue shot up 69%.Social network revenue rose 57%, fueled by increased sales of virtual items. Online game revenue was up 32%. Online ad revenue swelled 60%. Monthly active users for WeChat, China's biggest mobile messaging app, soared 34% to 806 million, Tencent said.Tencent stock, which trades in the U.S. on the over-the-counter market, was up 4.4% to 26.21 in the stock market today, hitting a fresh record high.IBD'S TAKE: Tencent stock has been on an upward trend since March. On May 27, Tencent broke out of a base-on-base pattern with a buy point of 21.65 and is currently extended. But one way to play the sector with less individual risk is via a sector ETF. KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) holds positions in many of the top Chinese net stocks, including Alibaba, NetEase and Tencent. For more on KWEB, check out IBD's ETF article.""During the second quarter, we sustained solid growth in our platforms and businesses, including our social and media platforms, games, digital content, advertising and payment services,"" said Tencent CEO Pony Ma, in prepared remarks with the earnings release.NetEase (NTES), which competes with Tencent in the gaming field, is set to report Q2 earnings after the close Wednesday. NetEase develops and operates some of China's most popular PC and mobile games and provides advertising services, e-mail services and e-commerce platforms.NetEase shares rose 0.1% Wednesday.The Chinese internet market is booming. It has the world's largest internet user population at 686 million, yet the market still considered to be only about half penetrated.Alibaba and JD.com both posted double-digit growth in revenue and earnings that topped estimates. Alibaba showed its fastest revenue growth since its initial public offering in September 2014. Alibaba and JD.com are fierce competitors in China's booming e-commerce market.Tencent may be Alibaba's biggest rival, and has a big stake and alliance with JD.com.China online discount retailer Vipshop turned in a stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings report Tuesday.

686,MA,"Stocks crawled higher Thursday amid another deluge of quarterly results. But Celgene raised hopes for biotech investors with a superb gain following a robust report on the top and bottom lines for the second quarter.The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%, adding to Tuesday's 0.6% gain for its third straight up session. At 5,154.98, the Nasdaq is now up almost 3% year to date.The S&P 500 edged nearly 0.2% higher, but the Dow Jones industrial average was slightly lower on the back of sharp declines by Boeing (BA) (down 2.2%) and Caterpillar (CAT) (down 1.4%). The former is reversing Wednesday's gains after reporting an adjusted net loss of 44 cents a share in Q2 on a 1% lift in revenue, according to William O'Neil + Co. data.Small caps more or less followed suit; the Russell 2000 eased 0.1%. Crude oil futures, in a slump all week, lopped off another 2% to $41.08 a barrel. Gold and silver moved higher.Volume fell on both the NYSE and Nasdaq, according to preliminary data.Celgene (CELG) gapped up at the open and rose 3% to 111.70, marking its highest close since Jan. 7. Before the open, the biotech reported adjusted earnings of $1.44 a share, up 22% in the second quarter. Net product sales rose 22% to $2.74 billion, while total revenue was $2.75 billion, up 21%.Celgene also gave a bullish outlook for the rest of the year. It sees full-year net product sales of $11 billion, up from a prior target range of $10.75 billion-$11 billion. Its adjusted EPS outlook also increased to a range of $5.70-$5.75 from $5.60-$5.70. Celgene also boosted its adjusted operating margin forecast from 53.5% to 54%.The stock earlier this week took back its 200-day moving average, an important development as the former big winner tries to end its long downtrend and bottom out. Last year in late July, Celgene had broken out of a later-stage base at 129.16 and got to as high as 140.72 before quickly turning tail. At this year's low of 93.05, Celgene fell 34%, just within the maximum range allowed for an ideal cup base.Given how long Celgene has been correcting, one should also keep an eye out for a potential saucer pattern to form. Learn more about this bullish chart pattern by reading this Investor's Corner column.Celgene gets an 80 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. That's good, but not great. However, if the stock continues to climb, an improving Relative Strength Rating and Accumulation/Distribution grade could hoist the Composite score higher.In the financial services industry, MasterCard (MA) sprang to its highest level in more than a month, rising 2% to 95.80 after the credit and debit card processor posted a 13% rise in Q2 profit to 96 cents a share. It was MasterCard's second quarter of double-digit EPS growth in three quarters. Revenue lifted 8% to $2.59 billion.Watch to see if MasterCard can keep rebounding and potentially surpass a 98.09 proper buy point. That buy point comes from adding 10 cents above an interim peak of 97.99 within a somewhat lopsided double-bottom base. In such a base, the stock encounters two distinct sell-offs, and in the second sell-off the stock undercuts the first low. In MasterCard's case, the first low was 94.08 on May 19.This base has formed within a larger consolidation in which MasterCard fell from a high of 101.76 to a low of 78.52. The 23% decline falls within normal range for most key chart patterns monitored by IBD.IBD'S TAKE: In the stock market today, the Finance-Mortgage, Retail-Internet and Medical-Products industry groups helped lead the upside.

687,MA,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings early Thursday, with per-share profit topping views but sales coming up a little light. The drugstore giant extended its merger deadline with Rite Aid (RAD) to give more time to gain regulatory approval amid new doubts about whether the deal will pass muster.Estimates: EPS to climb 13% to 99 cents with revenue up 1.9% to $29.06 billion.Results: EPS grew 22% to $1.07. Sales rose 0.4% to $28.6 billion.Outlook: Walgreens sees fiscal 2017 EPS of $4.85-$5.20, roughly in line with analyst expectations for $5.02.Stock: Walgreens jumped 5% to 81.02 at the close on the stock market today, finding resistance at the 200-day line. Shares have been moving sideways for much of 2016, bobbing above and below both their 50- and 200-day moving averages. Rite Aid climbed 6.8% to 7.11. Rival CVS Health (CVS) was up 1.5% to 87.30.IBD'S TAKE: The big drugstore chains sell beauty products, which have been a bright spot in an otherwise bleak retail landscape. Here's why e-commerce giant Amazon has had trouble breaking into that market.Last year, Walgreens agreed to buy Rite Aid for $17.2 billion but skepticism that it would get antitrust approval has weighed on shares.In July, Walgreens held talks with the Federal Trade Commission over how many of the combined 13,000 stores it needs to sell to get approval for the deal, according to the New York Post, and appeared to be making progress winning over regulators.And last month, Walgreens said it is ""exploring potential divestiture remedies"" and signaled it expects to get the FTC's OK soon, saying it sees sales of 500-1,000 stores combined.But Kroger (KR) may balk at buying hundreds of stores that Walgreens and Rite Aid need to divest to win regulatory approval.Kroger had wanted to close the locations and reopen them in its grocery stores, but the FTC wants to preserve the stand-alone drugstores, sources told the New York Post and Reuters Wednesday.RELATED:CVS Earnings Beat On Specialty Pharma Bet; Guidance Raised

689,MA,"When Hong Kong-based financier Michael Nock wanted a place to escape in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, he looked beyond the traditional havens of the rich to a land at the edge of the world, where cows outnumber people 2-to-1.Nock, the founder of hedge fund firm Doric Capital, bought a retreat 5,800 miles away in New Zealand's picturesque Queenstown. In the seven years since, terror threats in Europe and political uncertainty from Britain to the U.S. have helped make the South Pacific nation — a day by air away from New York or London — a popular bolt-hole for the megawealthy.Isolation has long been considered New Zealand's Achilles' heel. That remoteness is turning into an advantage, however, with hedge-fund pioneer Julian Robertson to Russian steel titan Alexander Abramov and Hollywood director James Cameron establishing multimillion-dollar hideaways in the New Zealand countryside.""The thing that was always working against New Zealand — the tyranny of distance — is the very thing that becomes its strength as the world becomes more uncertain,"" Nock, 60, said by phone from Los Angeles during a recent business trip.Nock's five-acre estate is named ""Giverny"" after artist Claude Monet's iconic home and garden in northern France, and the ""funny old farmhouse"" is surrounded by ponds and mature plants, he said. Nock is converting a barn into an art studio on the property, which overlooks Queenstown's Shotover River — a fast-flowing, turquoise stretch of water that tourists speed down on jet boats and white-water rafts.Twice the size of England, but with less than a tenth of its people, New Zealand ranks high on international surveys of desirable places to live, placing among the top 10 for democracy, lack of corruption, peace and satisfaction. With its NZ$250 billion ($180 billion) economy dominated by farming and tourism, the nation last month overtook Singapore as the best country in the world to do business and was rated second to the Southeast Asian nation as the top place to live for expatriates in a survey by HSBC Holdings (ADR) in September.House prices in New Zealand increased 12.7% in the year through October, and the average price in largest city Auckland has almost doubled since 2007 to more than NZ$1 million.Jack Ma, founder of e-retailing behemoth Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) and China's richest man, told Prime Minister John Key in April that he'd like to buy a home in his country, according to the New Zealand Herald. At least 20 of Ma's 40-something colleagues have retired there, the newspaper said.Key, a former currency trader, once described New Zealand as ""England without the attitude."" It's changed leaders just twice in almost 17 years and the last hint of terrorism came a generation ago, when French spies bombed a Greenpeace campaigning ship docked in Auckland harbor in 1985.It's that kind of stability that's attracting a wave of Brexit-inspired migration to the island nation that gained prominence as the otherworldly backdrop to the ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"" films.New Zealand received 998 registrations from U.K. nationals interested in moving to the country the day after the referendum on European Union membership, vs. 109 the day before the vote, according to data from the immigration department. That grew to 10,647 registrations in the 49 days after June 23, more than double the same period a year earlier.""If the world is going to go to hell in a hand basket, they're in the best place they could possibly be,"" said David Cooper, director of client services at Malcolm Pacific Immigration in Auckland, the country's biggest migration agency. ""People want to get the hell out of where they are and they feel that New Zealand is safe.""Cooper has seen an uptick in inquiries from U.S. citizens over the past few months, he said, with the raucous presidential contest, as well as the recent spate of mass shootings, cited as reasons to flee.""The world is heading into a major crisis,"" said internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom in an Oct. 31 Twitter post. ""I saw it coming and that's why we moved to New Zealand. Far away & not on any nuclear target list."" The German-born founder of Megaupload was granted residency in 2010, but is now fighting attempts to extradite him to the U.S.Successful Kiwis who have worked in investment banking and other lucrative professions in New York and London are also returning home to raise their families, said Ollie Wall, an agent with Auckland-based Graham Wall Real Estate. The firm helped broker New Zealand's most expensive house sale in 2013, when a seven-bedroom mansion on the city's Paritai Drive was sold to a China-born businessman for NZ$39 million.""The world has got smaller,"" Wall said in an email. ""You can run multinational corporations from paradise now. So why wouldn't you?""Fidelity National Financial (FNFV) Chairman Bill Foley owns a luxury homestead in the Wairarapa region north of Wellington, and Julian Robertson, chairman of Tiger Management in New York, owns two of the nation's most prestigious golf courses and a luxury lodge overlooking Queenstown's Lake Wakatipu. He says New Zealand is ""the most beautiful place on Earth.""Billionaire Facebook (FB) backer Peter Thiel described New Zealand as a ""utopia"" in 2011 and is reported to have bought residential property in Auckland and Queenstown. Thiel and a spokesman for the PayPal (PYPL) co-founder didn't respond to emailed requests for comment.New Zealand has actively courted the wealthy. For an investment of NZ$10 million in local assets or funds over a three-year-period, migrants can qualify for residency provided they spent 44 days in New Zealand in each of the two latest years. These investors don't have to speak English or live for a set amount of time in the country after the qualification period. They also don't have to become tax residents.Since the program started six years ago, 121 people have gained so-called Investor Plus visas, and more than 800 have secured a residency pass that requires a NZ$1.5 million investment over four years, government data show.""It provides a bolt-hole, a place for 'just in case,' "" said Willy Sussman, a partner at Auckland law firm Bell Gully, which has worked with wealthy migrants from all over the world.The desire for a haven nestled among snow-capped alps close to an international airport helped house prices in Queenstown increase at more than twice the pace of Auckland in the year through October, reaching an average of NZ$974,564.Mark Harris, managing director of the town's Sotheby's Realty office, said he has sold properties for more than NZ$20 million, including ones with private landing strips.""We hedge fund people all love optionality,"" said Nock, the part-time Queenstown resident from Hong Kong. ""Will I live in New Zealand permanently? I'm not sure, but I want the optionality of being able to do that.""MORE ABOUT GETAWAYS: 3 Ways To Turn A Second Home Into A Gold MineEntrepreneurs Fit A Tiny House Into An 'Anti-Vacation' PackageThe Election Is One More Reason For Canadians To Sell U.S. Homes

Analysts see revenue growth of 19.6%.Stock: Shares of Visa were down 1.1% late after closing 1% higher at 83.20 on the stock market today. The stock this month has found support at its 50-day line and is still in buy zone after breaking out from a flat base last month.MasterCard (MA) gave up fractional gains late after finishing up 0.3%. It also remains in buy territory following a September breakout. American Express (AXP), which reported strong results and guidance last week, closed down 0.4% at 67.09 but is still back above its 50- and 200-day averages. Discover Financial (DFS) rose 1.9% as it works its way through a flat base.Visa's results will follow a partnership with PayPal (PYPL) announced in July that is intended to expand consumers' payment options by sharing a variety of resources. Analysts will likely be seeking more detail about the partnership, and there was some debate over which company benefited more after the two announced the agreement.Among other conditions, PayPal ""will make it easier for new and existing customers to choose to pay with their Visa cards"" under the deal, the companies said in July. The electronic-payments giant would also get access to Visa's token and other digital services, in turn enhancing transaction security and expanding ""acceptance for PayPal's digital wallet to all physical retail locations where Visa contactless transactions are enabled.""The deal would also allow customers to immediately withdraw money and move it to their bank account from their PayPal and Venmo accounts via Visa Direct, the companies said.PayPal and MasterCard announced a similar agreement last month.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal's partnerships with Visa and MasterCard are the latest among many struck by the company. Analysts say such partnerships, including ones with Facebook and China's Alibaba, could bring more upside. Earlier Monday, Visa and Intel (INTC) said they would work together to develop stronger payment security for connected devices. That announcement comes after hackers allegedly used connected devices to deliver a massively distributed denial-of-service attack that hamstrung Internet service in much of the U.S. on Friday.Shares of Intel rose 0.3%.

Revenue also rose 13% to $2.7 billion, topping views for $2.589 billion.Processed transactions rose 14% to 13.7 billion. Cross-border volumes rose 10%.MasterCard has been making its way through a flat base -- a possible prelude to a breakout -- begun in May. Rival Visa (V) tacked on 0.5%, while American Express (AXP) eased by 0.1% and Capital One Financial (COF) slipped 0.8%.The results come during an earnings season in which the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union has been a frequent topic of conversation during conference calls. MasterCard said the so-called ""Brexit"" vote was unlikely to have much of an effect on their business this year, according to Reuters.Shares of bank and payments companies were hammered after the vote, after which the pound withered against the dollar -- potentially translating into less revenue. Investors were also concerned the financial climate might be less favorable to those companies once the U.K. formally separated from the EU.IBD'S TAKE: As MasterCard makes its way through a flat base, stocks of other card companies have struggled in recent weeks amid worries about the state of consumer debt. Compare and contrast MasterCard and rivals at IBD's Stock Checkup. MasterCard last week announced that it agreed to acquire the vast majority of VocaLink, a London-based company whose technology helps speed up payments, for around $920 million.""With last week's VocaLink announcement, we will expand our capabilities beyond core card-based solutions into a broader set of transactions and payments,"" Chief Executive Ajay Banga said in a statement.

694,MA,"PayPal (PYPL) and Visa (V) late Thursday announced a wide-ranging partnership, easing tension between the online payment processor and credit card network.PayPal's online payment system will no longer steer customers away from Visa's credit card network. Visa cards will be a payment option for PayPal users. The companies said their pact would make transactions more efficient and secure. PayPal will gain access to Visa's ""tokenization services,"" starting in the U.S., for in-store PayPal transactions. These services boost security.""PayPal is walking away from steering their customers to ACH (automated clearing house) as the preferred payment type,"" Thad Peterson, an analyst at Aite Group, told IBD. ""PayPal is essentially making Visa the preferred payment option for PayPal customers.""From a customer experience perspective, the agreement will allow issuers to provide more detail for PayPal transactions on customer statements, and (processing) will be much simpler and faster than with ACH.""PayPal's online checkout service has used an ACH system set up by bank partners, bypassing credit card companies.Both companies also released mixed earnings for the quarter ended June 30. PayPal stock was up 2% in after-hours trading, while Visa stock was flat.Visa posted adjusted earnings of 69 cents in fiscal Q3, vs. Wall Street estimates of 66 cents. Visa said revenue rose 3% to $3.6 billion, slightly below expectations of $3.65 billion. Visa announced a new $5 billion share repurchase program.PayPal reported EPS ex items of 36 cents, meeting views and up 9% from 33 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Sales rose 15% to $2.65 billion, edging the $2.6 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.PayPal said it expects Q3 revenue in a range of $2.62 billion to $2.67 billion vs. consensus estimates of $2.61 billion. PayPal said it expected EPS ex items of 33 cents to 35 cents, where analysts expected 35 cents. PayPal raised full-year sales guidance to $10.75 billion to $10.85 billion, topping expectations of $10.7 billion.PayPal has been a growing rival of Visa, MasterCard (MA) and other credit card companies.PayPal, spun off from eBay (EBAY) a year ago, and the credit card networks are both eyeing mobile payments, where Apple Pay, the mobile wallet of Apple (AAPL), is a rival.

695,MA,"As sometimes with a baseball trade, it's too early to know who got the best of Visa's (V) agreement with PayPal (PYPL), though it could be a win-win for both.Visa and PayPal late Thursday announced a wide-ranging partnership, easing tension between the online payment processor and credit card network.""We expect to see many opinions that proclaim this is favorable to Visa or to PayPal -- but the fact is that it is too early to tell,"" Citigroup analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar said in a research report.Mizuho Securities analyst Neil Doshi says the deal helps PayPal.""We view the enhanced partnership with Visa as a strong positive, as it quickly allows PayPal to scale to retail locations and also reduces the threat that PayPal could be singled out by Visa,"" he wrote in a research note. ""But we think this will increase transaction expense in 2017, and PayPal may have to offer similar deals with MasterCard (MA) and American Express (AXP).""Visa stock closed up 1.4% in the stock market today, while PayPal stock -- which had risen in after-hours trading Thursday after the deal's announcement and an earnings beat -- fell 6.8%. PayPal and Visa late Thursday each posted June-quarter EPS that beat Wall Street views.PayPal's online checkout service has used an automated clearing house (ACH) system set up by bank partners, bypassing credit card companies. PayPal's online payment system will no longer steer customers away from Visa's credit card network, and Visa cards will be a payment option for PayPal users.PayPal will receive economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume.""While PayPal reported Q2 revenues above expectations, in-line EPS, and raised revenue guidance, we believe that the agreement with Visa will be the main driver to near-term stock price performance,"" said RBC Capital analyst Daniel Perlin, in a report.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal stock is up about 11% so far in 2016. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup. PayPal could be acquired, some analysts have speculated, though the company has said it's not up for sale.PayPal will gain access to Visa's ""tokenization services,"" starting in the U.S., for in-store transactions. Visa and Mastercard have developed security technology that replaces the 16-digit account numbers in credit cards. Tokens are essentially electronic security keys. Visa launched the service on Apple (AAPL) devices in 2014. Visa also has been working with online retailers.""The (Visa deal) clearly opens the door for contactless payments using PayPal, and that could create a lot of different possibilities,"" said Thad Peterson, an analyst at Aite Group.PayPal, spun off from eBay (EBAY) a year ago, and the credit card networks are both eyeing mobile payments, where rivals include Apple Pay, Apple's mobile wallet.
"
696,MA,"A digital crook needs only $70 for an encoder available on Amazon.com (AMZN) to ransack your Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) or American Express (AXP) credit card -- unless you're armed with a chip-and-pin card, says Mark Lanterman of forensic analysis firm Computer Forensic Services.There were 400 million EMV cards -- aka chip-and-pin cards -- in U.S. circulation by the end of 2015, but that's merely 8% of 4.8 billion EMV cards worldwide, according to EMVCo.com. Both figures are rising as EMV cards are protected by end-to-end encryption, reducing fraudulent transactions.Like Apple's (AAPL) Apple Pay and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Wallet, EMV cards represent a major security advance from the magnetic stripe cards that remain prevalent in the U.S., Lanterman, Computer Forensic's chief technology officer, told IBD.Magnetic stripes carry personal information and can be counterfeited. EMV cards -- the initials stand for credit card giants Europay, MasterCard and Visa, though many other cards are in the fold -- encrypt information on the chip and use a six-digit ""token"" that changes with every transaction.EMV is your best security bet, says Lanterman, and despite some persistent resistance, the U.S. is picking up the pace in user adoption and improved technology.In the days of Target's (TGT) 40 million-card breach in 2013, most transaction encryption took place on the point-of-sale terminal. In the Target case, hackers breached its POS system and then stole tens of millions of card numbers. With chip-and-pin cards, that can't happen, assuming the encryption is property configured.""Now, the encryption is taking place from that chip all the way to the bank,"" Lanterman said. ""It's point to point. There's no millisecond on the screen, and then it's encrypted. (The account number) is always encrypted.""Chip-and-pin cards reduced Visa's U.S. counterfeit fraud by 26% in January vs. a year earlier, says Stephanie Erickson, vice president of risk products for the credit card giant. It would have cut it even further if more EMV chip cards were in use compared to magnetic stripe cards. As of May, 53% of Visa credit cards and 35% of debit cards were backed by EMV technology, she told IBD.The U.S., though, continues to face not only adoption hurdles, but also technology issues, Lanterman said. Of 10 EMV cards he recently tested, he says he was able to bust into eight. He says the problem with those eight is likely that they weren't properly configured by the card-issuing banks, which clear all transactions on their cards. (More on this below.)Some retailers resist moving to the technology because of the time and cost of getting new card terminals and getting the certification they need from each credit card network.""The technology has great potential,"" Lanterman said, ""but we need to get more retailers on board.""Europe leads in adopting EMV, according to EMVCo.com, an entity set up by its six member organizations -- AmEx, Discover (DFS), Japan's JCB, MasterCard, China's UnionPay and Visa -- and supported by dozens of banks, merchants and others in the payments industry.As of last year, Europe's two zones -- roughly Western and Eastern Europe -- had deployed more than 1 billion EMV cards and boasted 84.3% and 52.3% adoption rates, respectively. In Western Europe, EMV cards accounted for more than 96% of card-present payments -- payments in which the cardholder is physically present along with the card at the point of purchase, such as at retail checkouts.Globally, 35.8% of all card-present transaction in 2015 used EMV tech, up from 32% in 2014. In the U.S., chip-card adoption jumped to 26.4% in 2015, up from just 7.3% in 2014.The U.S. was late to the EMV game in part because the need was less urgent here. Visa's Erickson says the U.S. lagged in EMV because it leads in sophisticated, predictive analytics that help financial institutions detect suspicious or fraudulent card transactions. Other countries had more motivation to move faster to chip-and-pin cards to bolster authentication efforts.Now, the two approaches are converging, she says.""They moved to chip technology to help provide some enhanced authentication and protection against counterfeit, knowing they were doing a deferred transmission of that transaction,"" she said. ""In the U.S., we're adding this chip cryptogram with this one-time code to provide better protection against counterfeit.""As of June, Visa counted 302 million EMV cards in circulation in the U.S. -- 145.7 million credit cards and 156.2 million debit cards -- with 1.2 million merchant locations accepting them. About 23,000 to 25,000 new retail locations come online weekly, Erickson says.Credit cards are the preferred payment method for international travelers and therefore have a head start on debit cards in the U.S., she said.In the meantime, the credit card companies are pushing EMV adoption. In October 2015, Visa changed its liability policy. Now, the bank isn't liable if a customer using one of its chip-and-pin card is hacked, but merchants that haven't installed EMV card readers will be liable, she said.""The liability shifted to the party that had not invested in the chip,"" she said. In October 2017, that policy will extend to fuel pumps and ATMs, adding more incentive to move to EMV tech.So far, say the experts, chip-and-pin cards have proved impossible to counterfeit. And, in any case, the six-digit tokens change for every transaction, so it is useless to hackers, says Erickson. Still, magnetic stripe cards far outnumber their EMV counterparts in the U.S.""The U.S. is the largest market,"" Erickson said, ""but in terms of the percentage of our spending, the U.S. is still in its early days.""Last summer, a Visa poll found that 70% of cardholders had at least one chip-and-pin card in their wallets. The U.S. has made strides, just not enough, says Computer Forensic's Lanterman. He sees the country three years out from real headway in displacing magnetic stripe payments.And ""as long as magnetic stripe cards are accepted, credit card fraud will still be committed,"" he said.But improper configuration, not any fault of users, is another hurdle. When he tested the 10 cards, it was at the behest of a news crew in Minneapolis, where he's based. Lanterman attempted to steal personal information from 10 chip-and-pin cards -- a relative impossibility if they had been encrypted properly at the chip. But as mentioned above, he was able to break into eight.""The two that I could not get were from large, national banks,"" he said. ""I could not steal those numbers. I think the banks outsmarted me and were implementing end-to-end encryption correctly.""Armed with Lanterman's skill, a crook could get a customer's name and account number through a hole in the encryption. Properly configured EMV cards are encrypted from the chip all the way through the processing bank. But eight of those cards had a fissure somewhere in the encryption, he says.Properly configured chip-and-pin card are as secure as Apple Pay and Google Wallet, Lanterman says. He calls the mobile wallet ""brilliant."" Despite popular belief, mobile payment applications don't store a user's actual account number. Like EMV, that account number is tokenized, and a token is worthless to hackers.""The best anyone can do is get a fake number they can't use, because the approval code is a one-off,"" he said. ""It's worthless.""So, fairly solid security in card-present payments is close, though it will be years before EMV tech reaches all of America's mom-and-pop shops.""Small credit unions don't have the resources to configure the technology correctly,"" Lanterman said. ""Issuers need to educate consumers, retailers and local financial institutions. (Broad adoption) will take buy-in from all three.""

725,MA,"U.S. stocks rolled Tuesday morning, with the Dow Jones industrial average hitting a record high, although bulls and bears each found news to boost their convictions.The Dow industrials rose to 18353 soon after the opening bell, just eclipsing its May 2015 peak. The blue-chip index has settled to a 0.5% gain at 18319, led by Goldman Sachs (GS). The S&P 500, which set a record mark Monday, advanced 0.6% intraday. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.65%. The small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 0.9% gain. Early volume was running sharply higher vs. Monday's levels.BlackRock analysts offered a gloomy perspective. Reuters reported that the world's largest asset manager sees Britain falling into a recession over the coming year. On June 23, Britain voted to leave the European union.However, back in the States, a small-business gauge signaled optimism on the U.S. economy. The National Federation of Independent Business' small-business optimism index for June ticked up to 94.5, topping Wall Street's consensus number, as well as the highest estimate in the range. The survey includes hiring plans, capital outlay plans, plans to increase or decrease inventories, views on the overall economy and profit trends. The gauge is considered important because small businesses create most new jobs.Blue chips were mostly higher. On the Dow, the top gainers included Goldman Sachs, up 2.6%, and American Express (AXP), up more than 1%.Other credit card payment processors, such as Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and Discover Financial Services (DFS) also rose.In the IBD 50, a proxy for top-rated stocks, winners led losers by a better than 3-to-1 ratio.In the commodities markets, West Texas Intermediate crude oil gained nearly 2% to just under $46 a barrel. Gold faded 1%.
"
726,MA,"Southwest (LUV) missed second-quarter expectations and forecast its first unit-revenue decline for the year, while warnings from European carriers on the effects of recent terror attacks weighed on Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL).Southwest's Q2 earnings per share rose 15.5% to 1.19, missing estimates by 2 cents. Revenue rose 5% to $5.38 billion, shy of views for $5.405 billion. Traffic growth of 6% outpaced capacity growth of 4.8%, leading to a unit revenue gain of 0.6%.But the discount carrier expects Q3 unit revenue, which measures revenue as it relates to an airline's carrying capacity, to fall 3%-4%. That's worse than consensus for a 1.3% drop, according to a research note from Cowen.""While solid traffic demand has continued into July, thus far, the fare environment remains challenging, and close-in yields have softened in recent weeks,"" CEO Gary Kelly said in a statement, referring to an airline's ability to charge more for tickets booked closer to a flight's departure.Shares plunged 11.2% on the stock market today, diving below their 50-day average. A computer glitch Wednesday also forced Southwest to cancel flights, but it has since been fixed. United lost 3.4%, Delta dropped 4.2%, and American retreated by 2.7%. European carriers Lufthansa and easyJet said Thursday that terror attacks in the region and international upheaval were likely to discourage travel.IBD'S TAKE: Southwest and other domestic-focused carriers have been more insulated from the international troubles faced by its bigger network rivals. But low fares continue to affect fundamentals. See how Southwest and rivals stack up at IBD Stock Checkup. Southwest also said it expected unit costs to rise around 2% for Q3 and roughly 1% for the full year.Southwest began offering more flights after federal limits on its Love Field hub in Dallas expired in 2014. But as oil prices crashed that year, the big three network carriers and low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE) also stepped up flight coverage, creating a competitive, lower-fare landscape that weighed on unit revenue.On Tuesday, Spirit warned on its Q2 unit revenue, citing ""more fare discounting than what is typical for a peak summer travel period.""Southwest noted Thursday that Q3 comparison will be more difficult as its co-branded credit card agreement JPMorgan Chase (JPM) went into effect a year earlier. American Airlines recently forecast a $1.55 billion pretax income boost over the next 2-1/2 years from a similar deal with Citigroup (C), Mastercard (MA) and Barclays (BCS).Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) said earnings per share jumped 20% to $2.12, topping analyst forecasts. Total revenue rose 4% to $1.494 billion; analysts expected $1.498 billion.Alaska Air Group agreed in April to buy Virgin America (VA) to strengthen its West Coast presence.Alaska Air stock climbed 1.9%.Hawaiian Holdings (HA), the parent of Hawaiian Airlines, closed down 0.6%. After the market close, Hawaiian rose modestly after reporting Q2 EPS of $1.21 on revenue of $594 million. Analysts had expected EPS of $1.15 on revenue of $591 million.American reports earnings on Friday.

727,MA,"Stock indexes climbed higher Thursday afternoon, but volume remained in a lower gear.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average rallied 1.1% while the Nasdaq climbed 1%. The Philadelphia semiconductor index outperformed with a 1.4% gain. Volume in the stock market today was running lower on the Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges vs. Wednesday.The S&P 500 and Dow industrials retook their 50-day lines, while the Nasdaq was knocking on the door of its nearly converged 50-day and 200-day lines.Among chip stocks, Cypress Semiconductor (CY) rallied 9.5% in very heavy volume average. In April, Cypress announced it would acquire Broadcom's (AVGO) Internet of Things unit. The deal is expected to close in Q3. The chip space rode a merger and consolidation trend in 2015, and that trend doesn't appear to be entirely over.Semiconductor stocks fell with the Brexit news, but they have been recovering. The semiconductor industry isn't all that dependent on Europe. According to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, Europe accounted for about 10% of sales, as of April. Within Europe, Germany, not Britain, has the biggest exposure to chips.Blue chips, meanwhile, were up almost without exception. In the Dow, Visa (V) was the day's only loser, down 3% in heavy volume. A judge overturned a Visa and MasterCard (MA) settlement with merchants. The Dow's biggest gainer was General Electric (GE), up 2% in volume about 15% above average.In the IBD 50, a proxy for the best stocks via fundamentals and technicals, more than five stocks were up for every stock that was down.

731,MA,"Mike Brown uses a baseball analogy when talking about Euronet Worldwide, the provider of electronic payment services where he serves as chief executive.
"
732,MA,"Specifically, Brown compares Euronet (EEFT) to the newly crowned World Series champion Kansas City Royals, who reside just down the road from the company's Leawood, Kan., headquarters.
"
733,MA,"Kansas City beat the New York Mets in the series by playing ""small ball"" — baseball jargon for scoring runs with singles and smart base-running rather than power hitting. The Royals hit only two home runs during the series — New York had six — but Kansas City ran away with the championship, four games to one.
"
734,MA,"Euronet is like that, Brown says. The company isn't that big or heavily traded.
"
735,MA,"But it racks up consistent financial growth and has rewarded investors with an upwardly mobile stock price.
"
736,MA,"""We are not a flash in the pan,"" Brown said in an email interview with Investor's Business Daily. ""Our colleagues are hardworking, modest and creative. We're just like the K.C. Royals — not many home runs, but lots and lots of singles; moving runners around the bases for the win.""

"
741,MA,"Euronet management doesn't even worry much about the macro headwinds that keep other executives up at night. ""We have such huge opportunities, our worries are more about execution,"" he said.
"
742,MA,"Those opportunities stretch across all three of Euronet's business segments: electronic funds transfer — or EFT — processing, e-pay and money transfer.
"
743,MA,"The EFT processing segment provides electronic payment services, from ATM withdrawals to point-of-sale, or POS, products.
"
744,MA,"The e-pay segment offers electronic distribution and processing of prepaid mobile airtime and other electronic payment products, as well as gift card distribution and processing services. This segment operates a network of around 681,000 POS terminals.

"
746,MA,"Walmart-2-Walmart
"
747,MA,"One of the money transfer segment's biggest wins came last year, when Wal-Mart (WMT) selected Euronet subsidiary Ria Financial Services to operate its store-to-store money transfer service. The service is called, fittingly enough, ""Walmart-2-Walmart.""
"
748,MA,"It lets shoppers transfer money to and from thousands of Wal-Mart stores nationwide at a big discount compared to competing money transfer services.
"
749,MA,"""Walmart-2-Walmart has set a new price point and superior service level that totally disrupted the domestic money transfer model and accrued profits to us while pumping hundreds of millions of dollars back into consumers' pockets,"" Brown said.
"
750,MA,"In the third quarter, Euronet's EFT, e-pay and money transfer segments had constant-currency operating profit growth of 39%, 38% and 110%, respectively, he said.
"
751,MA,"Foreign Resources
"
752,MA,"Nearly three-quarters of the company's revenue comes from outside the U.S., though the U.S. is its biggest single market, followed by Germany. Euronet is rapidly expanding its footprint both here and overseas.
"
753,MA,"""We continue to expand geographically in all three of our segments,"" Brown said. ""Just in the last year, we added four to five new countries for EFT, tens of thousands of locations for money transfer, and hundreds of new products across new countries in e-pay.""

"
761,MA,"""Euronet has added almost 1,700 ATMs in the first nine months of the year,"" Shutler noted. ""Pacing of ATM additions is ahead of management's goal of adding 2,000 ATMs this year.""
"
762,MA,"Roughly two-thirds of the ATMs are expected to be added in Europe.
"
763,MA,"""Looking ahead, key EFT growth drivers should include the continued addition of more ATMs and value-added services, as well as growing contributions from prepaid debit cards and point-of-sale DCC (dynamic currency conversion) transactions,"" Shutler predicted.

772,MA,"Yahoo (YHOO) has ""hidden assets"" that could drive up the bidding price for the struggling Web portal, says SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.""Perpetual"" royalties from Yahoo Japan, thousands of patents and plentiful real estate could boost Yahoo’s bids, wrote SunTrust analyst Robert Peck in an industry report Wednesday.Those three critical aspects of the company’s valuation ""are not well understood and could have material upside to bids, potentially driving them higher than our $6 billion to $8 billion published range,"" wrote Peck.SunTrust raised its price target on Yahoo stock to 44 from 40 while maintaining a buy rating on the company.Yahoo stock was down a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 37.While the company could bring in $6 billion net after taxes, Peck said, ""Investors should expect bids in Round 1 (due Monday) to start lower than this, as bidders aim to bid just enough at first to make it into the next round. In Round 2, the bidding could become more intense and rise to the high end of our range, as we think there are several very qualified buyers.""The royalty stream from Yahoo Japan ""is in perpetuity and represents 30% of Yahoo’s core advertising EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in 2016,"" Peck wrote.He also said that Yahoo has more than 6,000 patents, ""which could be worth more than the $1 billion to $3 billion range the company has cited."" The patents include deriving a user profile from questions and creating a system for customizing a website, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.And, Peck said, Yahoo owns more than 1 million square feet of building space and real estate that could be worth $1 billion. The company is reportedly is looking to sell a large parcel of undeveloped land near its Sunnyvale, Calif., headquarters that had been slated for possible development, signaling that it has now scrapped the building plan.Yahoo sent a letter to possible buyers last month, asking them to submit bids. Some buyers might be interested in all or part of Yahoo’s core Web business, while others might want Yahoo’s stakes in China e-commerce Alibaba Group (BABA) or Yahoo Japan. Yahoo has reportedly set an April 18 deadline for first round bids.Yahoo stock has more than doubled since the company hired Marissa Mayer, who had been a top executive at Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, as CEO in July 2012. But she’s been unable to spark significant earnings and revenue growth, and Yahoo has struggled to build online-ad and mobile-ad revenue vs. rivals Google and Facebook (FB), among others.In the meantime, the company faces a proxy fight from activist investor Starboard Value, which wants to oust Yahoo’s entire board.An estimated 40 groups have expressed interest in buying all or part of the financially wilting Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Web portal. News site Re/Code said last week that documents Yahoo provided to potential bidders predict that the Web portal’s 2016 revenue will drop by close to 15% and its earnings by more than 20%. Yahoo is axing 15% of its workforce, or about 1,600 jobs.Rumored bidders for Yahoo include the Daily Mail, the British tabloid newspaper that on Monday reportedly confirmed its interest, attracted to Yahoo’s popular news and media properties. The Daily Mail is in preliminary talks with other investors to launch a bid for Yahoo, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, confirming a previous WSJ report out Sunday.Google reportedly is considering a bid for Yahoo’s core business, as is Verizon Communications (VZ).In 2011, Alibaba CEO Jack Ma publicly declared his interest in acquiring Yahoo.

The theme centered around how brands are increasingly interacting with consumers in a wave of “digital experiences” online that leverage social networking.Actor George Clooney spoke at the Adobe Summit on Wednesday, but most presenters were from the tech and business worlds.

In recent years, Adobe has moved headlong to host its products in the Internet cloud, using the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, with platforms that handle content’s entire life cycle from creation through tracking consumer interaction with it. Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen summed up a broad Adobe goal: being able to “make, monetize and measure” the digital experiences that people have.""Management highlighted that it is investing around the 'experience business’ wave of disruption and innovating at the platform level, both of which will be important in driving long-term growth for the digital marketing business,"" Samana wrote. ""While it is in the early stages, we see the platform play as strategically smart, as it should enhance the value proposition for Adobe’s entire product suite, making it stickier with customers.""Adobe, which is on the IBD Big Cap 20 stock list, closed up 0.4% Thursday at 92.52, down 1% for the week.

774,MA,"Apple (AAPL) and Starbucks (SBUX) are expanding the reach of their mobile payment systems, aiming to get a bigger edge on rivals such as PayPal (PYPL) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.Apple Pay -- which supports in-store shopping at retail checkout as well as in-app purchases for Uber, Disney stores and others – will be included in Apple’s Safari browser in time for Q4 holiday shopping, says a Re/code report. The payment system will continue to work with Apple’s fingerprint ID technology as a substitute for inputting 16-digit credit card numbers.Apple aims to solve a problem with mobile shopping; smartphone users tend to browse for products but often don't pull the trigger to buy.“The checkout page tends to be clunky and requires much in the way of manual entry. Apple Pay boils the checkout down to putting your finger on Touch ID, eliminating multiple steps,” Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451Research, told IBD. “This is troubling news for dominant Web players such as PayPal.""PayPal stock was down 4.5% in early trading in the stock market today while shares of Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) were down a fraction.“While this (Apple Pay-Safari) could represent some near-term headline risk for PayPal, we believe the competitive impact introduced by Apple Pay in-browser will be limited due to potential consumer and merchant adoption hurdles,” said Jason Kupferberg, a Jefferies analyst, in a research report. “PayPal's own expedited checkout process, One Touch, is already in use by more than 250 of the top 500 internet retailers”Apple Pay will also be more competitive with Visa CheckOut. Visa, though, has been active making deals, said Josh Beck, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a report.“Visa has certainly not been sitting idle as shown by recent minority investments in Chain, Stripe and Square (SQ) and product enhancements, including Visa Commerce Network, Visa Token Services and Visa Checkout,” wrote Beck.Starbucks, which has one of the most successful mobile wallets, is expanding its rewards system using a branded prepaid Visa card.Starbucks on Wednesday said the loyalty rewards system will allow customers to earn points for all purchases made with the prepaid  card.

""Deadpool, a brash antihero most people had never heard of, wove his way into their lives through using one of the most innovative digital and social media campaigns ever.""""Deadpool,"" by film folks at Twenty-First Century Fox (FOX), ""shattered all box office records and is on the way to becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie in film history,"" Narayen said. He went on to talk about how MasterCard (MA), too, had moved to ""pivot"" a bit from traditional ad strategy toward online and social forms, exemplified by its #Priceless Surprises campaign that included things like winning a trip to the Grammy Awards.""Businesses must re-imagine how they interact with customers in a digital-first and digital-enabled world,"" Narayen said, adding that ""getting content to the right person at the right place at the right time takes data"" -- that is, the ability to analyze and target.Adobe made several announcements in conjunction with its annual Summit show, including these three Adobe Marketing Cloud enhancements, among others:After viewing started migrating away from the television itself toward online viewing via devices such as mobile phone screens and tablets, some online video viewing is now ""going back to the living room,"" Jeremy Helfand, Adobe's vice president of video solutions, told IBD. ""Over 20% of 'TV Everywhere' viewing is happening on (television-) connected devices -- Apple (AAPL) TV, Roku or (Sony (SNE)) PlayStation or (Microsoft (MSFT)) Xbox, which is quite remarkable.""Historically, ""there was one currency -- it was Nielsen -- that's what was used in order to purchase advertising,"" Helfand said, ""largely through upfronts and some residuals -- that's how advertising was bought and sold.""But tracking how many people are watching what these days, across a bunch of devices and websites, hasn't been easy and that has hampered online video monetization efforts. Adobe Certified Metrics, which involves a developing partnership with ComScore following last year's link-up with Nielsen, is one way that Adobe aims to make audience measurement easier and more standardized.""You've seen ComScore merge with Rentrak trying to bring digital and linear together just as Nielsen is,"" Helfand said. ""And you're also seeing some media companies build their own definitions of who their audiences are, and go out to (ad) buyers and say 'here's my audience'.""The partnerships and platform development further Narayen's goal of Adobe products and services being able to ""make, monetize and measure"" the digital experiences that people have in today's world of content. The hope is that in turn will make Adobe software more crucial across a breadth of industries.In its Q1 report last week, digital marketing segment revenue at Adobe reached $406.2 million, which Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle said, in a research note, was ""better than the expectation of $402.7 million."" He added that the Summit event this week was ""likely  to  provide  additional  positive  announcements  on  the marketing business.""Adobe added 798,000 new subscribers for its Creative Cloud businesses last quarter, and Barnicle noted that 30% of them were new to Adobe. He sees more CEOs driving adoption of Adobe products.""Like Salesforce.com (CRM) and Workday (WDAY), Adobe is seeing more CEOs make purchasing decisions,"" he wrote. ""In the 2016 Pacific Crest CFO Survey, both CIOs and CMOs saw a decline in the portion of the IT budget that they control. We believe that CEOs are making more IT decisions than ever before. They are looking to move their businesses to digital and to the cloud, and Adobe is one of several beneficiaries.""The Adobe Summit runs through Thursday, with actor George Clooney among speakers listed for the event -- albeit most come more from the tech side than from Tinseltown.San Jose, Calif.-based Adobe has offices around the globe, including in Diegem, Belgium. It's just outside Brussels, where terrorist attacks hit the airport and a subway station early Tuesday. Narayen started his talk with condolences, and despite its Summit event @Adobe said it was keeping its Twitter account silent for the day, in light of the Brussels situation.

776,MA,"Latching on to an IPO when it's breaking out of an early-stage base can often be a lucrative endeavor, especially in the early stages of a new bull market. In the later stages of a bull market, it's a little tougher.When Google (now known as Alphabet (GOOGL)) cleared an IPO base in mid-September 2004, it was an easy stock to hold. Post-breakout, it never came close to the buy point and went on to a huge gain. The same with MasterCard (MA), which never looked back after clearing an IPO base in August 2006.For growth investors, fishing in the new-issue pond is smart strategy, especially when it comes to firms with innovative products and services with bright growth prospects. These are the types of stocks that can deliver explosive gains. And a solid market uptrend always helps, but sometimes the market doesn't cooperate.Some gains from IPO bases can be eye-popping. Other times, gains are more subdued. Knowing when to sell is critical.One IBD rule says that if a gain from a base breakout hits 20% within three weeks or less, the stock should be held eight weeks. The eight-week hold rule also applies to IPOs, but such a big gain is not necessary to trigger the rule. Whether it's a high-flying stock or a new issue with potential, the eight-week hold rule is there to help you stay patient with a potential big market leader.Alibaba (BABA) didn't suffer from lack of exposure when it came public in September 2014. And why not? A company with big earnings and sales growth smack dab in the middle of a booming China e-commerce market? Investors saw dollar signs in spades. It ended up raising $25 billion, the most ever for an IPO. A breakout from an IPO base with a 99.80 buy point yielded a solid gain in short order.When an IPO shows resilience and is up at least 5% to 10% after the first few weeks of the breakout, try to hold it for eight weeks. If the stock behaves itself over that time, you can decide to hold or sell part or all of the position at the end of the eighth week.In Alibaba's case, the eight-week hold rule would have been tough to follow. After rising 20% to a high of 120, the stock drifted lower and paid a visit to its 10-week moving average. It found support during the week ended Dec. 19, but then it fell for the next two weeks, putting the rally in doubt. With eight weeks passed since the initial breakout, one could have exited the stock at that time or at least sold half the position. If an IPO sputters, the main thing is not to let a decent profit cycle into a loss.When Michael Kors (KORS) went public in December 2011, it didn't take long for the stock to clear an IPO base in January 2012. Kors posted four straight weekly price gains after the breakout week. After eight weeks, the gain from a 27.68 buy point hit 83%. It was decision time for those following the eight-week hold rule. Taking at least partial profits turned out to be the right move, as Kors was just on the cusp of a new base-building period.

780,MA,"Darden Restaurants (DRI) earned 88 cents a share in fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings from continuing operations, up 29% vs. a year earlier. Sales rose 1.6% to $1.71 billion.The operator of the Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse chains had been expected to report EPS of 82 cents, up 21%, on sales of $1.72 billion, up about 2%.Same-store sales rose 1.3% slightly below forecasts. Olive Garden comps led the way with a solid 2% rise, including a 2.4% gain in August, the last of the quarter.Darden Restaurants raised its full-year EPS forecast to $3.87-$3.97 from $3.80-$3.90. It still sees full-year same-store sales up 1%-2%.Darden also announced a new $500 million stock buyback program.Shares jumped 6% in the premarket and as high as 63.90 during the regular session, but closed up just 0.6% at 61.72 on the stock market today. Shares of Brinker International (EAT), which operates Chili's and Maggiano's Restaurants, fell 0.9%.A broad swath of restaurant stocks have been suffering this year amid food deflation, tougher competition, consumer anxieties and uncertainty from global affairs.The breadth of the sell-off has also been notable: Fast-food, fast-casual and casual-dining stocks have not been spared.Now pizza chains, which had stood out as one of the few strong stock performers in the sector, are showing some weakness.Papa John's (PZZA) fell 1.4% to 76.96, just above its 50-day line, marking a seventh straight decline after undercutting a 78.19 buy point Monday. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) edged 0.1% lower Tuesday as it approaches its own 50-day test. Domino's is only down about 3% from a high.IBD'S TAKE: The restaurant sector is also grappling with rising labor costs while consumers are finding the costs to eat at home are falling, especially compared to prices at fast-food chains.  Meanwhile, Yum Brands, which is spinning off its China operations, reports Wednesday. Yum, the operator of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut is expected to grow EPS by 9% to $1.09, with revenue rising 2% to $3.48 billion.Yum Brands stock finished 0.7% lower.RELATED: Restaurant Stocks Continue To Turn Investors' Stomachs Investors Are Losing Faith In McDonald's, Losing Hope In Chipotle

781,MA,"PayPal's (PYPL) revenue growth surpasses that of Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), but it might not be as well positioned as the credit card networks, says Oppenheimer & Co., which initiated coverage on PayPal stock Friday with a buy rating.Oppenheimer analyst Glenn Greene set a price target of 43 on PayPal stock.""We believe PayPal's positioning within the payment processing ecosystem is less attractive than that of the card networks (MasterCard and Visa). However, PayPal's revenue growth of perhaps mid-teens over the next few years is more robust than either the networks or merchant acquirers,"" wrote Greene in his research report.Paypal stock ended unchanged in the stock market today. PayPal, which faces increasing competition from Apple (AAPL) Pay and other digital wallets, has an IBD Composite Rating of 73 out of a possible 99. It's been trading below the key 50-day moving average for the past month.PayPal recently launched its redesigned mobile app, which works on Apple iPhones and Android-based devices, in 145 countries. Prior to being spun off by eBay (EBAY) nearly a year ago, PayPal acquired Braintree, a mobile payment service, and Venmo, a hybrid peer-to-peer mobile payment app and social network targeted at millennials.PayPal's relationship with Visa remains a topic of interest, said Greene in his research report. He says that, based on comments by Visa executives, there could be closer ties or more direct competition coming.""To quote Visa CEO Charles Scharf on May 23, 'Anyone that's trying to take your customers and disintermediate you is not a friend. … We'd love to figure out a different model with them (PayPal) where it's consumer choice first where they're not disintermediating. … The other door is where we go full steam and compete with them in ways that people have never seen before.'  We suspect this rhetoric wasn't meant as loud as it sounded,"" Greene wrote.
"
782,MA,"With merchants shifting to chip credit cards more slowly than expected, Visa (V) on Thursday stepped up its campaign to spur adoption.Visa plans to speed up the process by which merchants certify equipment to start accepting chip cards, which use  EMV technology. The credit cards replace the magnetic strip with an embedded microprocessor chip that encrypts transaction data. The aim is to reduce fraud. EMV is a global technical standard that stands for ""Europay, MasterCard, Visa.""Visa on Thursday also said it will modify its liability policy to limit the number of fraudulent transactions issuers can charge back to merchants. Merchants were required to join banks and payment processors by Oct. 1, 2015, in using EMV technology or face increased liability.Switching to EMV cards requires retailers to get new point-of-sale terminals. POS terminal maker Verifone (PAY), whose stock plunged nearly 25% on June 8 on disappointing earnings, cited slow acceptance of EMV-equipped cards as a drag on its growth.American Express (AXP) on Wednesday joined Visa and MasterCard (MA)  in rolling out speedier check-out technology for EMV-equipped retail stores.The slow EMV adoption doesn't just involve small retailers, says Thad Peterson, an analyst at Aite Group. Peterson told IBD in an email that some midsize and large merchants have also struggled in switching to chip-based cards.He says Visa's moves target value-added resellers (VARs) and independent software vendors (ISVs) that work with merchants.""A significant number of midsize to large merchants work through VARs and ISVs, and to some extent that's been the largest roadblock to implementation,"" Peterson said.Visa says it added about 100,000 EMV-enabled merchants in April, to reach 1.1 million in total.But credit card companies and retailers have battled for years, and Canada is the setting for a current fight between Visa and No. 1 retailer Wal-Mart (WMT).Visa, in an open letter to Canadian newspapers on Thursday, said Wal-Mart was ""unfairly dragging"" millions of shoppers into private negotiations over card fees, Bloomberg reported.Wal-Mart's Canada unit said Saturday it will reject Visa cards, starting July 18 at some stores in Ontario, saying it's looking out for shoppers and aims to save them money, Bloomberg said.""Wal-Mart has initiated a public flight -- something we never wanted -- as they are using their own customers as negotiating leverage,"" Visa said in the open letter, according to the Bloomberg report.Wal-Mart, in an emailed statement, said, ""We believe Visa's fees should be lower for everyone, whether they are a large retailer, small retailer or a charity. Canadians deserve better than paying a hidden fee that is four-times higher than consumers pay in other countries. We are taking a stand for our customers because Visa's high fees can result in increased prices.Visa stock rose a fraction in the stock market on Thursday, as did Wal-Mart stock.
"
783,MA,"A federal appeals court rejected a $5.7 billion settlement of claims that Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) improperly fixed credit-card swipe fees, potentially renewing years of litigation with millions of U.S. merchants.The ruling is a blow to credit-card firms that sought to put an end to bitter court battles over fees amounting to tens of billions of dollars annually. The lawsuit, brought on behalf of 12 million merchants nationwide, was filed a decade ago after earlier disputes over the fees. The rejection of the deal raises the prospect that it will have to be renegotiated or the case may go to trial.Dozens of big retailers who opposed the accord cheered the decision, in which the appeals court said provisions barring merchants from suing over fees were unfair. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan also said that lawyers who represented retailers nationwide didn't do enough to protect their interests.""This is not a settlement; it is a confiscation,"" U.S. Circuit Judge Pierre Leval said in one of two opinions in the case. The judge said he was particularly troubled by the broad litigation release that ""binds in perpetuity, without opportunity to reject the settlement, all merchants who in the future will accept Visa and MasterCard, including those not yet in existence.""Visa declined 2.3% to $74.94 at 11:58 a.m. in New York, while MasterCard slipped 2% to $90.29. The world's largest payment networks were the worst performers in the 68-company S&P 500 Information Technology Index.""We are disappointed by today's ruling,"" Seth Eisen, a spokesman for MasterCard, said in an e-mailed statement. ""We believe we presented a clear case to the court that the settlement was fair and appropriate based on more than four years of negotiation and the close involvement of the district court. We are reviewing the decision to determine our next steps.""Connie Kim, a spokeswoman for Visa, declined to comment.Large retailers including Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Target (TGT), as well as major airlines, health insurers and other consumer businesses, had criticized the deal. On Thursday, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group that represents more than 200 merchants, praised the ruling, saying the settlement would have denied retailers the ability to bring lawsuits over interchange rules and rate setting. The group had formally opted out and objected to the deal two years ago.""Today's decision is a victory for all merchants and consumers,"" Deborah White, the group's executive vice president, said in a statement. ""The settlement orchestrated by the card networks and banks would have undermined merchants' legal rights forever and would have allowed Visa and MasterCard to impose higher and higher swipe fees.""U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York, approved the accord on Dec. 13, 2013, saying he was satisfied with the settlement, which was estimated to be the largest-ever U.S. antitrust deal. Gleeson stepped down from the bench earlier this year.Once owned by groups of major banks, Visa and MasterCard had defended themselves for decades against legal claims that they operated price-fixing schemes. Swipe, or interchange, fees are set by card companies and paid by merchants when consumers use credit or debit cards.The settlement was announced in July 2012. Once worth as much as $7.25 billion, it was valued at about $5.7 billion as of August 2013 after reductions for about 8,000 merchants that dropped out of the damages portion of the lawsuit.The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, 12-4671, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).

787,MA,"Earnings season for the IBD 50 is nearing its peak, with leaders like Facebook (FB) and Visa (V) due to report in the coming week. More than two-thirds of S&P 500 companies have released quarterly results so far, and a Thomson Reuters report said 72% of them topped earnings estimates. Will IBD 50 stocks Facebook, Visa, Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN), Paycom Software (PAYC) and Gray Television (GTN) also beat forecasts?VisaThe credit card and debit payments processor is forecast to report a 15% increase in fiscal Q4 EPS to 63 cents when it reports early Monday. Visa has beaten profit estimates for the last seven quarters in a row. Revenue is expected to grow 10.5% to $3.57 billion.On Thursday, rival MasterCard (MA) reported a 5% hike in EPS to 91 cents that beat views, as revenue edged up 1.2% to $2.53 billion, just below consensus.The payment space has been drawing increased attention, especially from tech giants, with Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) rolling out mobile pay services. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said it will launch a mobile wallet called Chase Pay. Meanwhile, Visa is promoting Visa Checkout, which lets cardholders pay with a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop from virtually anywhere.Paycom SoftwareSmall, fast-growing cloud-based employment management software maker Paycom has been on the IBD 50 list for a while as companies adopt its software to cut costs and help with talent acquisition, payroll and other tasks. It also offers tools to help clients manage ObamaCare plans.Paycom is slated to report Tuesday after the market close. Analyst consensus is for EPS to rise 40% to 7 cents. Paycom has beaten the Street's earnings targets five quarters in a row. Revenue is projected to climb 41% to $51.51 million.Gray TelevisionAnother small, fast-growing IBD 50 stock, Gray Television has a spotty earnings record as acquisition costs rise, missing estimates three of the last six quarters. When it reports Tuesday, analysts expect Q3 earnings to drop 46% to 13 cents a share. Revenue is seen increasing 11% to $145.7 million.Gray Television has bought more than two dozen mostly small TV stations in the last two years. On Oct. 1, Atlanta-based Gray said it bought three more TV stations, one in a new market, among other moves. After its latest transactions close, expected by the end of the year, Gray will own and/or operate more than 150 stations serving 50 markets.FacebookSocial network giant Facebook boasts more than a billion regular users globally, and about 1.5 billion searches daily.Facebook is slated to report after the market close Wednesday. Consensus is for EPS of 52 cents, up 21%. Earnings have topped estimates for at least eight consecutive quarters. Revenue is seen increasing 36% to $4.36 billion, but that would mark the sixth quarter in a row of decelerating growth.Below the headline numbers, Facebook's expenses and mobile growth have come under scrutiny. In Q2, expenses spiked 82% as Facebook spends heavily to drive future growth. But mobile ad revenue accounted for 76% of total ad revenue, up from 62% a year earlier.Regeneron Pharmaceutical""Wet age-related macular degeneration"" isn't an everyday term, but it's the most common eye disease related to aging as baby boomers move into retirement age. Regeneron's blockbuster Eylea eye-disease treatment continues to generate huge revenue, jumping 50% in Q2 to $993 million, putting it on track for a nearly $4 billion yearly run rate.For Q3, analysts are looking for Regeneron to report on Wednesday a 45% surge in revenue to $1.06 billion, with EPS rising 27% to $3.20. Regeneron topped profit views in the last two quarters.Meanwhile, it also has or is developing treatments for colorectal cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. In July, the FDA approved Praluent, a cholesterol fighter and part of a new class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors.Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

788,MA,"Congratulations! After years of hard work, you're about to enter the golden age of retirement. One key consideration: where to live.Arizona, Florida and Nevada have been popular states to retire in for years, and for good reason. There's plenty of sunshine and a low cost of living, and they're among U.S. states most friendly toward retirees.But for retirees craving a change of pace from the tried-and-true retirement havens, here are some other options to consider, both here and abroad. From sandy beaches to vibrant culture to affordable health care, there's something for everyone.Click Here To See Full Special ReportFirst: five countries identified by InternationalLiving.com where retirees can live comfortably on $1,500 a month.Peru: The South American country is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and by the Andes mountains to the east, and offers everything from ancient ruins to coastal living. Single expats can live on $500 to $600 a month, including rent, utilities, dining out regularly, Wi-Fi service at home and a local prepay cell phone, according to International Living correspondent David Hammond, while expat couples can enjoy living in Peru for $1,000 to $1,200 a month.""The cities I visited in Peru offer the highest standard of living for the lowest price that I've seen, especially for singles,"" he said in the report. ""Granted, there are places you may be able (to) live for less, but not on the same levels of convenience and comfort.""An expat living in Peru also notes that healthcare costs, including dental care, run about $50 to $100.Cambodia: If Southeast Asia is more your speed, Cambodia can be another affordable option, with reported monthly costs running as low as $1,200. Rentals range from about $200 to $350 a month in cities like Phnom Penh, which offer modern conveniences. Other perks include restaurant meals for as little as $2.50, 50-cent beers on the beach and $6 manicures.“Most expats can live comfortably on a budget of around $1,250 to $1,500 a month,” Ellie Dyer, who lives in Phnom Penh, said. “It’s easy to tailor life to your means, whether that involves eating street food on a shoestring budget or living the high life at luxury hotels like Raffles Le Royale.""Guatemala: While not yet as developed as other popular Central American retiree destinations like Costa Rica or Panama, Guatemala can provide a couple a comfortable lifestyle for $1,500 a month. That includes rent, utilities, food and luxuries such as a house cleaner, a gardener, massages and three-course meals. Rents can range from $300 a month for a one-bedroom furnished apartment to $700 for a furnished, three-bedroom house in a quiet, gated community in the colonial town of Antigua.What about health care? No worries there, according to InternationalLiving.com: ""I recently went in for a routine physical, and the doctor spent over an hour with me, discussing my medical history and putting me at ease,” said Antigua resident Tara Tiedemann. ""What a delight -- when I can barely secure 10 minutes with my overworked U.S. physician. And the price for this personalized, high level of care? Only $25, including lab work.""Nicaragua: Another alternative to neighbors Panama and Costa Rica, Nicaragua can offer enjoyable retirement living for about $1,200 to $1,500 a month. A furnished apartment walking distance from the beach can be rented for $400 a month or less, including water, electricity and Wi-Fi. Fresh produce is abundant, due to the crop-friendly climate.Bonnie Hayman, an International Living correspondent who lives in the coastal town of San Juan del Sur, found a two-bedroom, two-bathroom home with an ocean view for $132,000. ""I would never have been able to live in an ocean-view home in the States,"" she said in International Living's report. ""I pay real estate taxes of just $151 a year.""Debbie Goehring and her husband, who spend $1,089 a month to live on Ometepe Island, joined the Vivian Pellas Metropolitan Hospital health discount program in Managua, Nicaragua's capital. ""Built to U.S. standards, this hospital provides excellent services to expats at about a quarter of what it would cost in the U.S.,"" she said.Colombia: Once notorious for its high crime rates, Colombia is quickly becoming a popular retirement spot. In Bogota, for instance, residents can enjoy a three-course meal for $10 to $25 and movies for $5, as well as art galleries, museums and coffee culture. A couple can comfortably live there and in cities such as Medellin, Milan and Pereira for $1,200 a month, according to the report.“The affordable cost of living is one of the things that drew me here,” expat Jim Engels, who lives in Bogota, told International Living. “I’m paying just $640 a month for a two-bedroom apartment. The health care is both inexpensive and high quality. You’ll find many physicians who have been trained in the U.S. or Western Europe.”For those who prefer to stay in the States, there are plenty of options, though the overall cost of living will likely be higher. AARP, a membership organization for those age 50 and up, offers plenty of resources for retirees.To help figure out which U.S. cities best fit your lifestyle and income, check out AARP's Livability Index. The Web-based tool gives users community livability scores for seven categories: housing, neighborhood, transportation, environment, health, engagement and opportunity, as well as an overall score. Users can customize the index to put more or less emphasis on the categories that are most important to them.Sun City, a popular Arizona retirement community since the 1960s, scored a 44. Here are five less-obvious cities that get higher scores in AARP's index.Madison, Wisc. (overall score 68): Top scores included a 79 for engagement, 73 for health and 72 for transportation.Arlington, Va. (64): A 91 for health, 74 for neighborhood, 72 for engagement.Minneapolis (64): 82 for transportation, 70 for neighborhood, 68 for engagement.Cambridge, MA (63): 85 for transportation, 82 for neighborhood, 67 for health.Seattle (63): 75 for health, 70 for neighborhood, 70 for transportation.

The announcement coincided with President Obama's historic trip to the island nation.The report dismissed Square (SQ) as a potential acquisition target until it can attract more than just ""small-ticket merchants,"" Luria cited the panelists as saying. Luria speculated that Visa (V) would unload its approximately 1% stake in Square vs. acquiring more.Earlier this month, Square posted its first quarterly earnings reports since its November IPO. Results met Wall Street expectations, but slowing merchant growth led to a disappointing outlook.Square stock rose to a 2016 high on Monday, up 10% near 13, in late-afternoon trading. The gains came with no apparent news. In an email, Luria told IBD, ""Square is very heavily shorted with a very small float -- that has translated into significant volatility in the share price, including today.""The float will rise in less than two months: The IPO lockup period for insiders and major venture capital investors expires May 17.The panelists said that if Square's lending business continues to grow at 200% to 300%, it will likely ""end badly."" Square Capital provides cash advances to some of Square's small-merchant customers. But Square Capital is essentially a subprime lender, Luria has told IBD.

791,MA,"Boeing (BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg envisions hotels and factories orbiting the Earth and said its spacecraft will be the first to deliver a person to Mars, a week after SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk unveiled his Mars colonization plan.The aerospace giant is already developing the Space Launch System, which will be the most powerful rocket ever produced, for a future NASA mission to Mars. NASA plans to send humans to an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars in the 2030s, according goals laid out in the 2010 U.S. National Space Policy.Last week, Musk said SpaceX's first manned landing on Mars may come within 10 years, though he acknowledged ""there's a good chance"" it won't happen that soon. He said he hopes to complete a developmental spaceship in four years.But Boeing isn't going to back down.""I'm convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,"" Muilenburg said at a conference, according to Bloomberg.Boeing shares dipped 0.1% to close at 132.25 on the stock market today. Tesla fell 1.1% to 211.41.IBD'S TAKE: While SpaceX isn't publicly traded, Musk's Mars plan comes as he tries to rally support for Tesla's acquisition bid for sister company SolarCity, and critics could see his colonization vision as another distraction for Tesla, which is already surrounded by doubts about its ambitious car production targets.At the 67th annual International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, Musk described a fleet of 1,000 spacecraft that would eventually be used to colonize Mars and estimated an investment of about $10 billion to realize the project.Boeing's Muilenburg also offered an ambitious vision for a commercialized space industry that could include hotels as well as companies engaged research and manufacturing, with Boeing providing the spacecraft to ferry people into space, according to Bloomberg.The speech is the latest salvo in a growing rivalry between the two companies.SpaceX has become a more formidable competitor to Boeing and Lockheed Martin (LMT), whose United Launch Alliance joint venture once had a virtual monopoly on Pentagon satellite launches.SpaceX has also been contracted by NASA to deliver supplies to the International Space Station. It also won a contract, along with Boeing, to build vehicles to send astronauts to the ISS.RELATED:SpaceX Rocket Explosion Comes At Worst Possible Time For MuskTesla Vision Excellent, But Risks Still Outweigh Rewards Tesla Motors Just Made 3 Big Moves That Are Key To Its Future

792,MA,"The artificial intelligence of IBM's (IBM) Watson will be used to make millions of General Motors (GM) cars smarter through a new partnership between the automaker and tech giant, the companies said Wednesday.Using what is known as a ""cognitive mobility platform,"" the system will take the name OnStar Go and be installed in cars starting in early 2017. GM and IBM, in a joint statement, touted the platform's ability to help drivers save time and increase efficiency. Watson is the IBM technology once used to defeat humans on the quiz show ""Jeopardy.""Among the tasks the system will perform: help drivers avoid traffic when low on fuel, allow them to pay from their dashboard when they do get fuel, order coffee on the go or get news and in-vehicle entertainment tailored to their personalities and location in real time. Watson can also ""learn"" what drivers want, which has the additional bonus of allowing advertisers a way to reach consumers through ""individualized location-based interactions"" even when they're in the car.Exxon Mobil (XOM), MasterCard (MA), Glympse, iHeartRadio and Parkopedia are the first batch of brands to join OnStar Go.IBM's and GM's effort will be officially debuted at IBM's ""World of Watson"" event at 4 p.m. ET later today in Las Vegas.General Motors, which is also working on self-driving technology, is not the only carmaker adding next-gen tech to the dashboard. The move comes as Apple (AAPL), Tesla Motors (TSLA) and others have been working on their own smart-auto strategies.Meanwhile, Bloomberg Philanthropies' autonomous vehicle initiative will roll out self-driving cars in Austin, Los Angeles, Nashville, Paris and Buenos Aires, with five more cities to join them this year, said USA Today.General Motors shares finished trading nearly flat at 31.58 on the stock market today, recovering from earlier losses.

794,MA,"Yahoo (YHOO) stock rose as Citigroup upgraded the web portal’s stock to buy and raised its price target on views that Yahoo’s sale appears much more likely than in March and on developments involving China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA).Selling its core assets would let Yahoo effectively split off its big stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan in a low-tax manner, says Citi.Following Alibaba’ investor day on Tuesday, where founder Jack Ma touted plans to double revenue by 2020, Citigroup analyst Mark May has an upbeat view on Yahoo’s ability to monetize its non-core assets. Alibaba recently repurchased stock from its biggest share owner, Japan-based SoftBank (SFTBY), and May says the same scenario may apply to Yahoo's stake in the e-commerce giant. SoftBank also owns a big stake in Yahoo Japan.Verizon Communications (VZ), AT&T (T), at least two private equity firms and a group led by group headed by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert are all still in the hunt for Yahoo, say reports.Yahoo’s annual meeting is slated for June 30. Shareholders will likely get an update on the auction process. Yahoo reportedly aims to conclude its sale in July.Citigroup’s May had downgraded Yahoo stock in March on views that chances of a company sale were only 60%. May, in a research report Wednesday, said there’s a 95% chance of Yahoo's core assets being sold, although the price tag varies from $5 billion to $6 billion.May says there’s 20% chance Yahoo’s core internet and advertising business, along with patents and real estate assets, will be sold for $6 billion or more. He says there’s a 50% chance Yahoo’s combined assets will fetch $5.5 billion, and a 25% chance the price tag will be $5 billion or lower.Yahoo has a market cap near $35 billion, but the vast bulk of its value stems from its big stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan.May raised his price target on Yahoo stock to 43 from 38.Yahoo stock fell as low as 36.54, but closed up 0.2% at 37.39 in the stock market today. Alibaba fell 12 cents to 78.27, but finished well off intraday lows of 76.20.However, AT&T and Verizon may reportedly rethink their bidding strategy if proposed consumer privacy rules make it difficult for them to share data on the location of wireless subscribers with advertisers.

795,MA,"Capital One Financial (COF) didn't change its outlook despite an uptick in delinquencies, a day after Synchrony Financial (SYF) dragged card-issuer stocks lower when it warned of more debt write-offs over the next year.Capital One, which is among the biggest card issuers in the U.S., said its domestic May net charge-off rate was 3.99% -- up 60 basis points year over year, but down from 4.29% in April. The domestic 30-plus-day performing delinquency rate rose to 3.01% from 2.74% a year ago and 2.96% sequentially. The 30-plus-day performing delinquency rate for auto loans edged up to 5.48% vs. a year earlier.But while Capital One CFO Stephen Crawford pointed to “an accelerating increase in consumer debt” -- potentially even in subprime loans -- other financial metrics prompted the card-issuing giant not to change its loss forecast. Credit stability has held up in recent years as well.""The other side of that message is, there will be a turn,"" he warned at a Morgan Stanley financials conference. ""And one should just anticipate that that’s going to happen at some point in time.""On Tuesday, Synchrony, which issues private-label credit cards, said it expects a slightly higher net charge-off rate -- an indication of credit that a firm writes off as a loss because it no longer expects to be repaid -- over the next 12 months.Synchrony, which was recently spun off from General Electric (GE), said the rate was still ""historically low"" but that consumers this year have had a harder time paying off debt. Concerns have grown that debt from credit cards and auto loans, among other things, could be rising to less-comfortable levels.Meanwhile, Alliance Data Systems (ADS), which provides consumer and commercial lending and auto financing, said the delinquency rate within its card services segment rose to 4.4% as of May 31 from 3.9% a year earlier.Capital One shares ended trading up 0.3% on the stock market today, after diving 6.6% Tuesday. Alliance Data ticked down 0.5% to 207.95. Synchrony rose 0.2% to 26.50 after tumbling 13% Tuesday.Discover Financial Services (DFS) edged 0.3% higher to 53.12 Wednesday, following Tuesday's 4% drop. American Express (AXP) added 0.6% to 61.42, regaining some of the prior day's 4.1% slide.Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) do not issue cards but act as payment networks connecting businesses and banks. Visa lost 0.5% to 78.17. MasterCard dropped 0.8% to 93.34.
"
796,MA,"Synchrony Financial's (SYF) warning that its net charge-off rates would be worse than anticipated over the next year sent shares diving Tuesday, also dragging down American Express (AXP), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Capital One (COF).Synchrony, a recent General Electric (GE) spinoff that provides private-label credit cards to a variety of businesses, said it expected a 20-30 basis point increase in net charge-off rates -- a measure of debt that a company no longer expects to get back and has deemed a loss -- and would build up reserves accordingly in Q2.Shares plunged 13.3% to close at 26.45 in the stock market today, undercutting their 50- and 200-day moving averages. American Express dropped 4.1% to 61.07, while Discover lost 4.1% to 53.27, sinking below its 50-day, and Capital One tumbled 6.6% to 64.43. But GE rose 2% to 30.44.While Synchrony said it expected some level of weakness and that its loss rate was ""at historically low levels,"" the announcement came amid growing anxiety about consumer debt.""The consumer's ability to cure themselves when they get into those later due stages has been challenged,"" CFO Brian Doubles said at the Morgan Stanley Financials Conference in New York on Tuesday. ""It's been challenged all year.""And as auto loans grow, so have warnings about potentially higher delinquencies. Other analysts have said banks are running out of higher-quality borrowers to target, forcing them to reach for less reliable ones.Meanwhile, Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), which do not issue credit cards but act as the middleman between businesses and banks, were less affected. Visa inched up 0.2% to 78.57, while Mastercard eased less than 0.1% to 94.11.Top banks, which issues cards, also sold off, though ""Brexit"" fears have been weighing on financial stocks. Bank of America (BAC) fell 2.5% to 13.26, Citigroup (C) lost 2.8% to 41.96, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) was down 1.9% to 62.08, and Wells Fargo (WFC) surrendered 2.3% to 46.88.

813,MA,"American Decline: President Obama's sending a warship near China's provocative artificial islands is worse than doing nothing. If Beijing attacks, the superpower that ran from Iraq and Afghanistan might run again.The Chinese Communists who have spent over three decades using capitalism to strengthen and expand their economy while simultaneously squelching political freedoms, are not dumb.So when they see the U.S. send one destroyer to violate their declared 12-nautical-mile zone around territory in the South China Sea claimed by Beijing, they know it's no more than a cosmetic gesture.The artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago, with long airstrips obviously built for military purposes, are likely the beginning of something big, but actual aggression is probably a good few years away.That hasn't stopped free Taiwan from getting nervous, however.The independent island's 2015 National Defense Report warns that Beijing's ongoing military build-up would make it strong enough to attack Taiwan by the end of the decade.China's military spending may be as much as three times what it claims, the report said.Ironically, this has been happening while Taipei has been under the rule of President Ma Ying-jeou, who supports conciliation with Beijing. The pro-independence opposition may take power in January's election.We have repeatedly said that Obama's throwing in the towel in both Iraq and Afghanistan sent a dangerous message that would be heard around the world.The U.S. may have the mightiest military force the earth has ever known — although the president has weakened it, most recently by playing politics with Congress' defense-spending authorization — but that power means little if we are unwilling to use it.China may not attack Taiwan tomorrow, just as Russia may not conquer Ukraine anytime soon. Then again, it might.But imagine for a moment what would happen if it did.Does anyone — the Chinese, the American people, our European allies — believe we would go to war to save the free Chinese from their aggressors? Even if it were an invasion with great loss of life, it is far more likely this administration would urge the Taiwanese to make a deal to accept their conquerors.The trick, of course, is for the U.S. to have such credibility geopolitically, backed up by its military power, that any such attack would be deterred.That's how it worked with our nuclear arsenal, which spent four decades being able to destroy the Soviet Union, yet with not a single warhead ever falling on Russian territory.As a result, a notoriously imperialistic global power — which even placed nuclear missiles next door to us in Cuba — refrained from invading Western Europe or attacking the U.S. homeland.But the betrayals of our friends in the Mideast have let that credibility slip away. As a result, when Beijing had a destroyer and a patrol ship warn the USS Lassen, it was with little if any fear of any retaliation.Indeed, it is us who should have feared potential confrontation. Had the Lassen been surrounded, blocked, or even fired on and sunk, what would we have done? Gone to war under Commander-in-Chief Barack Obama?No, we would have notched it as America's latest military humiliation. And what message would that send to Moscow and any other aggressors in the world, including Iran and the other Islamist terrorist powers?As to the Pentagon's statement that what our warship did might well become ""a regular operation in the South China Sea"" that ""shouldn't be seen as provocative,"" this administration may well be setting the U.S. up to slip into exactly that sort of humiliation.And how many demonstrations of U.S. impotence can we withstand before potential aggressors can no longer resist the temptation to strike?

Revenue for its fiscal Q3, which ended Dec. 31, rose 32% in local currency to $5.3 billion. Earnings per share minus items of 99 cents rose 16%.

820,MA,"AT&T (T)— in reality its forerunner local phone company SBC Communications — has been one step ahead of rivals Verizon Communications (VZ) and Comcast (CMCSA) when it comes to telecom and media industry consolidation.AT&T's agreement to buy media giant Time Warner (TWX) for $85.4 billion in a cash and stock deal, a daring move by CEO Randall Stephenson amid growing competition with internet firms Google (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN), is just the latest example.If regulators approve the Time Warner acquisition, AT&T will have a national wireless network plus the assets of satellite broadcaster DirecTV, acquired in 2015, and the programming of TWX, to whisk content to mobile devices.Comcast lacks a wireless network, and regulators blocked its purchase of Time Warner Cable in 2015.Verizon has a top-grade national wireless network but AOL, bought for $4.4 billion in 2015, and perhaps internet firm Yahoo (YHOO), a $4.8 billion deal still pending, are no match for Time Warner's assets.Time Warner's media empire includes HBO and Turner Broadcasting, which has rights to sports telecasts. It also owns Warner Bros. film studio and cable networks TNT, TBS and CNN. Time Warner owns a 10% stake in internet video provider Hulu. With Time Warner's assets, AT&T aims to hyper-charge its online video service DirecTVNow, expected to be launched in Q4. One looming question is whether AT&T's maneuvers will pressure Comcast to step up wireless investments, perhaps even a T-Mobile US (TMUS) acquisition, sooner than preferred.In many ways, AT&T's forerunner — San Antonio-based SBC Communications — has moved faster and more adroitly than its peers. The one blemish — the Obama administration blocked AT&T's proposed acquisition of wireless firm T-Mobile in 2011. AT&T paid a heavy price in spectrum turned over to T-Mobile and a break-up fee.GOP nominee Donald Trump said he would block the deal as president, while Democratic standard-bearer Hillary Clinton has expressed skepticism.Local phone company SBC, under then CEO Ed Whitacre, rolled up the so-called ""baby Bells"" starting with Pacific Telesis in 1997.In 2005, Whitacre-led SBC acquired ""Ma Bell,"" local and long-distance phone company AT&T, for $16 billion and took over its brand. In 2006, AT&T bought BellSouth for $86 billion, taking full control of a national wireless firm branded ""Cingular.""Verizon and U.K.-based Vodafone (VOD) formed a wireless joint venture in 2000. Verizon gained full control of its wireless business in 2014, buying out Vodafone's 45% stake for $130 billion, adding a huge debt load in the process.Comcast has been busy, too. It bought AT&T Broadband for $52 billion in 2001. Walt Disney (DIS) rejected Comcast's brazen takeover bid in 2004. But, Comcast rebounded by acquiring NBCUniversal from General Electric (GE)in two phases, starting in 2011.Comcast's fastest growing units at NBCU have been its theme parks and film studio, not the cable channels or broadcast network. Most regulatory conditions set on the Comcast-NBCU deal sunset in 2018.RELATED:AT&T + Time Warner: It's Happening, But A President Trump Would Kill ItHow Google, Amazon Could Push AT&T Into Media Acquisition

821,MA,"Alibaba (BABA) on Tuesday will host its first investor day since coming public in 2014, with analysts looking for earnings guidance, an update on its Cainiao logistics network, Ant Financial and other company segments.The e-commerce giant will hold its meeting at Alibaba headquarters in Hangzhou, China. Speakers will include Executive Vice Chairman Joe Tsai, CEO Daniel Zhang, CFO Maggie Wu and other members of its senior management team. Alibaba hasn't said whether company founder Jack Ma will be a speaker.Other topics during the day will likely include the resilience of the Chinese consumer during the current period of economic weakness. Alibaba's cloud computing strategy with AliCloud, its video strategy following the acquisition of Youku Tudou and other media assets, and international expansion opportunities are all among the other topics of major interest.“We expect the company to highlight growth opportunities, driven by mobile penetration, growth in the middle class in China, category expansion and e-commerce share gains,” said a report by Stifel, which has a buy rating on Alibaba and a price target of 88.JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth, who has an overweight rating on Alibaba with a price target of 96, will be looking for additional data on Taobao and Tmall, Alibaba’s leading e-commerce platforms.He also expects the company to provide more details about the accounting treatment of Cainiao, which is under an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC is also investigating how Alibaba reported operating data from its Singles Day shopping event on Nov. 11.Alibaba stock dropped 2% to 75.92 at the close in the stock market today.

822,MA,"Delays and staff cuts at Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), a mobile payments consortium, will likely boost Apple Pay, while PayPal (PYPL) management’s view on MCX’s woes should be a hot topic at PayPal's analyst day on Wednesday.MCX said Tuesday it will cut 30 jobs and again delay the launch of its mobile app, a potential rival of Apple (AAPL) Pay and others. MCX has been courting retailers, Apple, Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, PayPal, Samsung, Visa (V) and others in the mobile payments space. Wal-Mart (WMT) has been MCX's main backer.PayPal will be hosting its first analyst day following its 2015 spinoff from eBay (EBAY) last year. The event will be held in San Jose, Calif. PayPal recently launched its redesigned mobile app, which works on Apple iPhones and Android-based devices, in 145 countries.While Apple and MCX were rivals, PayPal has aimed to partner with different players in mobile payments. PayPal in March 2015 acquired Paydiant, which had close ties to MCX and retailers.MCX had aimed to reduce the clout of credit card firms in the nascent mobile payments business, analysts say. Prior to the latest MCX announcement, Citigroup analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar said in a research report that PayPal’s relationship with Visa and MasterCard (MA) was one area of interest heading into its analyst day.At Jefferies, analyst Jason Kupferberg was also hoping for an update on Visa.“PayPal’s relationship with Visa remains a topic of interest for the Street, but we wouldn't be surprised if there is limited commentary at the analyst day on this topic, given ongoing negotiations,” Kupferberg wrote in a report.Prior to the eBay spinoff, PayPal acquired Braintree, a mobile payment service, and Venmo, a hybrid mobile payment app and social network for millennials.Daniel Perlin, an analyst at RBC Capital, expects mobile to be a big theme at PayPal’s analyst day. “We believe management will outline its plans to shift from its legacy e-commerce platform into a leading mobile-first platform for payments, with its Braintree asset being front and center.”

It's one of the highest rated stocks in the finance-credit card group, with a 94 Composite Rating.Global Payments shares touched a record high of 120.29 in early trading in the stock market today before finishing the session down 1.3% to 116.90. The company is expected to deliver another robust earnings gain when it reports fiscal Q1 results before Wednesday's open.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project EPS of $1.43, up 17% from the prior year. That would mark the ninth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth.In a Monday morning note, RBC Capital Markets analyst Daniel Perlin said Global Payments is ""in the middle of a multiyear mix shift to higher-margin, faster-growing revenues in the international market as well as toward direct channels,"" helped by acquisitions and new partnerships.""We believe continued solid fundamental performance, as well as new partnerships (especially in Asia and Europe), pricing opportunities and growth in the integrated and direct channels could act as catalysts for the shares to gain higher multiples, thus propelling the shares higher,"" Perlin said.On Oct. 1, new rules mandated that merchants have credit card readers that can take cards with EMV chip technology. EMV stands for Euro Pay, MasterCard, Visa — but other card companies have adopted it. Many retailers are not ready, though.Meanwhile, merchants are also adapting to mobile payments such as Apple's (AAPL) Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. Global Payments works with both.Visa has not set a date for its fiscal Q4 earnings report, though it will probably be late this month or early next month, according to Thomson Reuters.

With m-commerce, or mobile commerce, maybe Starbucks (SBUX), with its smartphone payment system.C-commerce, or car-commerce, could be down the road, and Visa (V) aims to make a name for itself by partnering with auto makers.At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Visa announced a partnership with Honda as well as ParkWhiz.Visa, as well as MasterCard (MA), has developed security technology that replaces the 16-digit account numbers in credit cards. Tokens are essentially electronic security keys. Mobile payment systems generate a one-time, random digital code during transactions, instead of transmitting 16-digit credit card numbers. Apple Pay uses tokens. Visa launched the service on Apple (AAPL) devices in October, 2014.Visa has also been working with online retailers. With the Visa Checkout Service, transactions are also tokenized.With car-based commerce, Visa expects applications such as automatic payment for parking spaces, gas at service stations or fast-food at drive-in establishments.Visa first talked about car commerce at the WMC in 2015 and followed up Monday with the Honda deal.“Eliminating the need for drivers to take tickets or check out at pay boxes is a giant step toward a frictionless experience and a big win for drivers,” said Aashish Dalal, CEO of ParkWhiz, in a release.

Its expansion efforts include online-to-offline retailing and flash sales to help it compete in China’s burgeoning e-commerce arena against Alibaba (BABA), Vipshop Holdings (VIPS) and others.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect sales to rise 49% in local currency to 51.9 billion yuan, or about $7.9 billion at the current exchange rate.

Vipshop is an online discount retailer that sells branded apparel, accessories, home goods and other lifestyle products. It specializes in so-called flash sales, in which a set number of goods are sold over a limited time.One year ago, JD.com formed a strategic partnership with Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), a leading Internet company in China, aimed at providing superior e-commerce services to mobile and Internet users in China.

830,MA,"SpaceX and Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk described a fleet of 1,000 spacecraft Tuesday that would eventually be used to colonize Mars and estimated an investment of about $10 billion to realize the project.At the 67th annual International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, a video presented by Musk depicted a rocket carrying passengers blasting off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., with the booster returning to Earth while the spacecraft with passengers holds in orbit.Another tanker vehicle carrying fuel is loaded back onto the booster for rendezvous with the spaceship for refueling, with the tanker returning to earth. Musk said about 3-5 trips by the tanker would be necessary to fill up the spaceship for the journey to Mars. About 100 passengers would be on each spaceship.""It will look almost exactly like what you saw,"" he said of the planned Interplanetary Transport System. ""This is not what it might look like. This is what we plan to make it look like.""Eventually, about 1,000 spaceships could be in orbit and depart en masse when optimal launch windows to Mars open up about every 26 months. He envisions about 10,000 trips to Mars.""It's kind of like Battlestar Galactica,"" Musk said. ""Good show.""Earlier, he said the four attributes needed to make the cost of Mars colonization feasible include a reusable vehicle, refueling in orbit, producing fuel on Mars for return trips, and having the right propellant. Musk said methane is  the ""clear winner"" for the fuel not existing oil-based fuels used in rockets today.Musk said he hopes to complete a developmental spaceship in four years but acknowledged the extended timeline for establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars, putting the timeline at 40-100 years.IBD'S TAKE: While SpaceX isn't publicly traded, the event comes as Musk tries to rally support for Tesla's acquisition bid for sister company SolarCity, and critics could see the Mars plan as another distraction for Tesla, which is already surrounded by doubts about its ambitious car production targets.While Musk's plan is to colonize Mars, he said the spaceship would be designed to provide ""full access to the entire solar system.""SpaceX is looking at building the booster and spaceship along the U.S. Gulf coast, involving multiple states, with final assembly done at the launch site, Musk said.To pay for the Mars project, he said a public-private partnership would be needed, likening the effort to the construction of rail lines across the continental U.S., but added that he is personally accumulating assets to help fund his vision.When asked if he would be the first man on Mars, Musk replied probably not because the risk of death on the first mission would be high.Meanwhile, Boeing (BA) is developing the Space Launch System, which will be the most powerful rocket ever made for a future mission to Mars.SpaceX has become a more formidable competitor to Boeing and Lockheed Martin (LMT), whose United Launch Alliance joint venture once had a virtual monopoly on Pentagon satellite launches.SpaceX has also been contracted by NASA to deliver supplies to the International Space Station.

Yahoo (YHOO), which is Alibaba’s second-largest shareholder with a 15.4% stake, also fell on the news.Alibaba stock closed down 6.5% in the stock market today.  Yahoo stock fell 3.4%.SoftBank's plan to reduce its Alibaba stake are driven by its need to raise capital, boost liquidity and improve its leverage ratio after accumulating massive debts for acquisitions that include buying a controlling stake in Sprint (S), the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier, which it is trying to revitalize. SoftBank paid $20 billion to acquire a 70% stake in Sprint three years ago.In the SoftBank stock sale, Alibaba plans to buy back $2 billion of shares, with another $400 million to be acquired by Alibaba’s founders. Another $500 million will be sold to an unnamed sovereign wealth fund. The remaining $5 billion will go into a complex trust sold to qualified institutional buyers in private placement, exchangeable into Alibaba shares in three years, said SoftBank.""A disciplined approach to capital structure and leverage is fundamental to our SoftBank 2.0 transformation strategy,” SoftBank said in announcing the planned transaction.The method used by SoftBank could be scrutinized by Yahoo. The web portal is examining it options, looking to sell its core business and/or its Alibaba stake, which is valued at near $31 billion. The great majority of Yahoo's value -- its market cap is near $36 billion -- is in its stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. Potential Yahoo buyers include Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T).“As SoftBank looks to strengthen its own balance sheet, Alibaba determined that it was the best use of our capital to re-invest in our own business through an efficient buyback of a large number of shares in our own company that is accretive to our stockholders,” said Alibaba co-founder and Executive Chairman Jack Ma, in a statement announcing the plan.SoftBank made its initial investment in Alibaba in 2000, when it was barely a year old.

841,MA,"MasterCard (MA) shares jumped 6.7% Friday after the second-largest card network after Visa (V) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and solid gains in purchase volumes and transactions.The company earned 79 cents a share in the quarter, up from 69 cents a year earlier, to print 10 cents above analyst views, also for 69 cents. Revenue increased 4% to $2.52 billion, slightly below the $2.55 billion expected from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Just as Visa noted in its December-quarter report late Thursday, MasterCard's cross-border volumes were impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar and choppy global environment, decelerating from the prior quarter. But volume still was up 12.3% in constant currency on a year-over-year basis. Gross dollar volume rose 12% to $1.2 trillion, while processed transactions also climbed 12%, hitting 13 billion.U.S. volumes stepped up slightly from the prior quarter, offsetting modest deceleration in international volumes. About 60% of MasterCard's revenue comes from outside the U.S.""MasterCard's Q4 results, much like Visa's last night, demonstrate the resiliency of the company's business model and should be welcomed by investors,"" analyst George Mihalos of Cowen & Co. said in a client note Friday.Visa shares were also up more than 4% early Friday.

843,MA,"AT&T is not your father’s or grandmother’s telephone company.Just take a look at the company's most recent acquisition, the $65 billion purchase of satellite television provider DirecTV in July. It's part of AT&T's (T) vision for its future, which revolves around investments in high-speed connectivity in wireless, broadband and satellite.AT&T stripped off the ""Ma Bell"" nickname eons ago and has come a long way since its forced breakup in the 1980s. Its purchase of DirecTV has firmly pushed the company into a new age of electronic communications, a business where it's getting tougher to maintain a prominent role.“It has been the industry’s most open secret that one day AT&T would buy DirecTV,” said Roger Entner, the founder and lead analyst with Recon Analytics, a telecom research firm. “AT&T was squeezed in the middle of the market. Verizon (VZ) had a stronger network, and Sprint (S) and T-Mobile’s (TMUS) wireless services were cheaper. So if you’re in the middle -- neither the best nor the cheapest -- you die. So they had to differentiate with their convergence strategy, to provide something nobody else has.”But while DirecTV is a key part of AT&T’s new vision for the future, Chief Executive Randall Stephenson noted in the company's fourth-quarter conference call with analysts that “it all has to be integrated.”Video will be a big part of AT&T’s integration strategy. The company is expected to soon announce details of a new video initiative, which likely will include new offerings on mobile phones, and with DirecTV playing a prominent role. DirecTV subscribers already are able to view more than 100 channels over their mobile phones.AT&T’s vision for an integrated communications company “is very compelling and very logical,” said Recon's Entner. “It’s mobile, video and the Internet of Things (including connected cars) all coming together.”The grand initiative is still in its early days, but AT&T has started out this year on a high note. Its unlimited, bundled data plan that rolled out in January gained 500,000 sign-ups within a few days.Still, AT&T’s mainstay wireless business has struggled. It lost about 1.5 million post-paid monthly subscribers last year, Entner says. In prepaid, however, it gained about 1.3 million customers, thanks to its highly promoted Cricket brand, which came by way of its acquisition of Leap Wireless in 2014.“They refused to participate in a price war on the post-paid side,” Entner said. “They would rather see customers leave than lower prices.”Verizon was more promotional, which helped it win new customers, but it “subdued profit growth,” Entner said. T-Mobile and Sprint have been especially promotional.AT&T suggests that patience is in order. Investments in next-generation networks, products and services “are providing us with a platform to project revenue growth into the future,” Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told IBD.As examples, he pointed to Net Bond, which provides cloud services, Network on Demand for easily changing bandwidth as needed, and integrated video offerings.Beyond AT&T’s forecasted double-digit consolidated revenue growth for this year, which factors in a significant contribution from last year’s DirecTV buy, the firm has not given any other revenue guidance.While AT&T’s total year-over-year revenue grew 22% in the fourth quarter to $42.1 billion, rising nearly 11% in all of 2015, to $146.8 billion, a large part of those gains were from DirecTV. It also bought two wireless companies last year in Mexico: Iusacell and Nextel Mexico.“If you actually sort out what is organic year-over-year revenue growth, it would actually be negative 4% for (the fourth quarter),” said Craig Moffett, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson. And because of changes in accounting methods after the DirecTV deal, “earnings growth is nearly impossible to sort out.”“None of (the accounting) is inappropriate. It’s just tremendously misleading during the period of transition,” he said. “You won’t see (clear) year-over-year trends until 2017, when they’ve had a full year of DirecTV under their belt.”AT&T reported adjusted earnings of 63 cents a share in the fourth quarter, up 12.5% from a year earlier. And for the full year, it posted an adjusted $2.71 a share, up from $2.56 in 2014. Management forecast EPS growth this year in the mid-single digit range, or around 4% to 6%.Analysts expect 5% EPS growth in both 2016 and 2017, according to polls by Thomson Reuters, on revenue growth of 14% and 2%, respectively.AT&T has gotten better at managing costs, Entner says. “And in the end, Wall Street cares about profits. If you’re getting more customers and losing money, that’s not a good situation.”But Moffett told IBD: “Right now it’s very hard to find the growth pockets in AT&T. Their wireless business is shrinking. Their wireline business has been shrinking for years. And their DirecTV business is showing some signs of growth, but only because of migrations from their U-Verse platform. The only part of the business that is growing right now is their corporate wireless services.”Corporate wireless is part of the company’s business solutions segment, a new category that emerged as a result of new reporting segments put into place last year after the DirecTV acquisition. Other business units now include entertainment, consumer mobility and international.“Without DirecTV, we would still have revenue growth from strategic services,” Stephens said, referring to such examples as security, hosting and high-speed broadband. Revenue growth in 2015 and in the fourth quarter “would have been in the low-single digits.”AT&T is spending for future growth. Its capital spending in 2015 came to more than $20 billion, and it expects to spend around $22 billion this year. About half of this year’s investments are earmarked for business solutions, especially focused on mobility and cloud applications.Having spent a combined $4.4 billion on the two Mexican wireless acquisitions last year, AT&T also now plans to spend $3 billion through 2018 to upgrade its network in Mexico to 4G LTE.“Mexico has been a bright spot. Customer growth there is very strong,” Stephens said.But business in Brazil and some other South American countries has struggled as economies there slowed. South American business came with the DirecTV acquisition.Analysts are paying close attention to how AT&T’s new initiatives will shake out.“They need to show results in a year to 18 months,” Entner said. “Investors are not very patient folks.”

844,MA,"Tencent Holdings’ investment in NBA broadcasts, mobile games and entertainment content is paying off, driving first-quarter earnings at Asia’s biggest instant messaging company to a record.Net income climbed 33 percent to 9.18 billion yuan ($1.4 billion), the Shenzhen-based company said on Wednesday. That compares with the 8.71 billion-yuan average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.After converting WeChat and QQ from message services into social network giants, with more a billion combined users, Tencent (TCEHY) added streaming content such as National Basketball Association games to attract big-budget advertisers. That spurred a 73 percent surge in online ad revenue during the quarter, even as the Chinese economy slows.“Advertising is rising at a much faster pace than the rest of the company,"" said Li Yujie, an analyst at RHB Research Institute Sdn in Hong Kong. ""It has a huge advantage in attracting advertisers with its huge traffic volume via instant messaging, its portals and video sites.""Sales jumped 43 percent to 32 billion yuan in the quarter, beating estimates for 30.3 billion yuan.Revenue from the Value Added Services unit, which includes online games and messaging, rose 34 percent to 25 billion yuan. Adding titles such as Wind Saga and Kungfu Frontier not only helps make money from existing users, it attracts even more customers to the platforms.The company is buying up the rights for anime, comics and novels to convert them into content and boost its slice of a China mobile gaming market expected to reach 68.8 billion yuan by 2018.WeChat had 762.4 million monthly active users and the mobile version of QQ had 658 million users at the end of the quarter. Adding online payments and facilitating e-commerce are part of Chairman Ma Huateng’s efforts to make money from China’s 688 million Internet users.Shares of Tencent fell 1.1 percent to HK$161.10 in Hong Kong before earnings were announced. The stock has gained 5.6 percent this year, compared with a 2.4 percent drop for New York-listed Alibaba Group Holding (BABA).To strengthen its dominance in instant messaging, it created a service called Enterprise Weixin for the office that enables chat and company notices.Ma has identified online health care, education and the anime industry as potential areas of growth for this year. In a proposal to China’s National People’s Congress this year, Ma suggested that the government allow doctors to freelance, build online personal medical files, and relax digital content policies to help China’s Internet sector to prosper.The company is in the process of raising as much as $4 billion in a syndicated loan to fund its expansions, people familiar with the matter said in May.Tencent announced 40 deals worth $19.6 billion of acquisitions and investments in the past 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

845,MA,"Visa (V) beat views on the top and bottom lines late Thursday as it reported fiscal-second-quarter results amid ""continued headwinds,"" but shares fell after hours as the payments giant lowered full-year guidance and said its pending acquisition of Visa Europe could be delayed.Visa earned an adjusted 68 cents a share, excluding a one-time gain related to currency forward contracts, with the result coming in a penny above views. That was up from 63 cents a year earlier. Revenue rose to $3.6 billion from $3.4 billion a year earlier, slightly above views. Visa's payments volume grew 12% in constant dollars to $1.3 trillion, while total processed transactions were up 9% to 18.5 billion.Visa said continued headwinds from the strong dollar, lower oil prices and an uneven global economy continued to hurt cross-border spending, with weakness noted especially in China, Brazil and oil-based economies. But U.S. spending continues to be ""reasonably strong,"" said CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement.Referring to the second half of the fiscal year, Scharf said on the post-earnings conference call, ""We have not seen improvement in the global economic environment. We assumed these things would improve. Since we're now in the third quarter, we're officially reducing some pieces of our guidance, especially in the third quarter. When things improve, we will be beneficiaries.""The company cut its revenue growth forecast for the full year to 7%-8% vs. its previous target of high single digits to low double digits.Adjusted per-share earnings are seen growing in the low double digits. That includes interest expenses of $390 million, or over 9 cents a share.Visa stock fell 4.5% in late trading. Shares had closed down 0.4% at 80.79 on the stock market today, just below a buy point at 81.11.Smaller rival MasterCard (MA) fell more than 2% after hours, following a 0.4% regular-session dip to 97.54. MasterCard reports its Q1 results on April 28, with analysts expecting earnings to fall 5% to 85 cents a share.Visa now projects currency shifts will cut full-year revenue by 3 percentage points and earnings by 4 percentage points.In the face of a weak global environment, ""double-digit earnings growth this year is pretty good,"" said Douglas Burtnick, an equity investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, which owns shares in Visa. ""That's very powerful as we look at companies across the economy right now.""Meanwhile, its $23 billion Visa Europe takeover was supposed to close in the current third quarter. But under a new agreement subject to regulatory approval, the future earn-out provision will be eliminated in favor of a larger cash payment upfront.""It is possible to close at the end of the quarter, but it could slip past the end of the third quarter,"" said Scharf. He said the delay in closing would not change the company's expectations for low single-digit appreciation in the first full year of the combination and growth in the high single digits by 2020.""We feel terrific about our future together (with Visa Europe). Transition planning is well underway,"" Scharf said.Burtnick said the larger cash payment ""is not a big deal in the longer run.""

846,MA,"If a recent initial public offering breaks out from a base, should investors follow the same rules as they would for a more seasoned stock?Not always. New issues tend to be more volatile, so some rules for handling such shares differ.The Investor's Corner appearing in Tuesday's IBD discusses how to handle short moves produced by IPOs breaking out of bases. In today's column, we'll focus on how to play long moves that can occur following a breakout.First, keep in mind that IPO bases can be shorter than conventional patterns. If a recent new issue breaks out from a period of consolidation and runs significantly higher over a few weeks, should you follow the 20% sell rule as you would with most other stocks?Not necessarily. If the stock doesn't fall right away and advances 5% to 10% within the first few weeks of breaking out, hold it until the end of the eighth week. Don't confuse that with IBD's original eight-week hold rule, which suggests holding shares that long if a stock runs up 20% or more in the first two to three weeks of a breakout.The move for an IPO can be much smaller. Once that eighth week has passed, then assess whether you want to hold, sell some shares or exit the entire position.Let's say you decide to keep all or part of your stake. Now what?Try to hang on to the stock until its first decisive break of the 10-week moving average.Of course, like with any stock, if at any point the new issue triggers a sell rule, then it's time to move on to another idea. For instance, if the IPO starts pulling back near your purchase price, take profits before letting all your gains evaporate.If the stock continues to move higher after the eighth week, it may offer some follow-on buying opportunities. These are the same as with older stocks. You can add shares if a new issue clears a three-weeks-tight pattern, rebounds off its 50-day line or makes additional breakouts from sound bases.MasterCard (MA) debuted May 25, 2006, at 39 a share. It started consolidating after its third week of trading to set up a buy point of 50.73. The stock cleared an eight-week IPO base the week ended Aug. 4 in above-average volume. Within two weeks, it had advanced as much as 8%, so the eight-week IPO hold rule applied.By the end of the eighth week (1), MasterCard had gained up to 39% from the entry. The stock continued to rally, offering chances to add shares. Despite pullbacks along the way, the stock had run up 244% from the initial IPO base buy point when it made its first decisive break below the 10-week line (2) in the week ended Aug. 3, 2007.

The article also took aim at business deals by Alibaba Executive Chairman Jack Ma, and was critical of the company's culture and governance.Alibaba fired back in a letter signed by its senior VP of international corporate affairs, Jim Wilkinson, right after the story published, saying the article lacked integrity, professionalism and fair play.Then, on Oct. 8, Ma penned a 2,600-word letter to shareholders, telling them essentially that things are going to be OK.In his first public letter to Alibaba investors since the record initial public offering of the China e-commerce leader 13 months ago, Ma also reached out to shareholders overseas who might be confused about how the company operates its sprawling business empire.Follow Brian Deagon on Twitter @IBD_BDeagon.RELATED: Alibaba Bid For Youku Threatens Netflix China EffortsAlibaba Gears Up For Biggest Shopping Day Of Year.

The SEC is also getting documentation from that probe as well.BP (BP), Chevron (CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Total (TOT) have written down more than $50 billion in assets since 2014, according to the Journal.But Exxon has said that it has been conservative in its accounting practices with new fields, so it won't have to write down assets in the future.In May, Exxon and Chevron shareholders narrowly defeated proposals that would've required them to determine risks they face from possible efforts to address climate change.RELATED:Exxon Reportedly Probed As Lone Oil Major Not Writing Down Assets

899,MA,"PayPal (PYPL) and its One Touch authentication technology lead all of its competitors in converting buyers online, according to a press release Tuesday from the company, referring to a study by market tracker ComScore.According to the ComScore study, shoppers that pick PayPal converted 87.5% of the time. The runner-up to PayPal was Visa (V), which had a conversion rate of 51.1%. ComScore lumped other competitors such as Amazon.com (AMZN) and MasterCard (MA)  into a single group that converted at 45.6%.In the study, conversion rate measures the percentage of shoppers at the checkout page that select a payment method and complete the purchase. The data are based on a behaviorally-tracked panel and measures panelist purchases on 15 retail domains in the U.S.The perceived friction of inputting all the necessary information -- name, address, credit card number, for example -- at checkout has been seen as a big issue for digital payments services, but the study results suggest PayPal has gone a long way toward solving this issue.IBD Take: PayPal is a Leaderboard stock and ranks high in almost all major metrics.PayPal rolled out its One Touch technology about a year ago. ""The results are really showing the success with the One Touch product,"" PayPal global head of product communications, Anuj Nayar, told IBD Tuesday.In its press release, PayPal touted the 21 million consumers who have opted-in to use One Touch.Visa did not immediately return an emailed request for comment.PayPal stock was down more than 1%, near 39, in midday trading on the stock market today. The stock is finding support at its 50-day moving average.

901,MA,"Noting an uneven global economy and continued headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar, credit card processing giant Visa (V) reported earnings that were a penny above analyst forecasts but revenue that was slightly below views.Visa said adjusted earnings were 69 cents a share and revenue was $3.565 billion in its first quarter. Analysts had expected earnings of 68 cents and revenue of $3.62 billion for the period ended Dec. 31.Visa had ended regular trading down 2.2% to 69.33 in the stock market today and were down slightly after hours, as shares gave back some late gains. The strong U.S. dollar and an uneven global economy pressured cross-border volume and revenue growth, Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said in prepared remarks.""While these headwinds do not appear to be abating in the short-term as we had hoped, the fundamentals of our business remain strong,"" he said.In a conference call with analysts, Scharf said that though there has been talk of a slowdown in the U.S. this year, Visa U.S. volumes in January “have been strong.”Canada, Brazil, Russia, the Middle East and Japan were among those that showed some of the weakest volumes.The environment “is clearly a mixed bag,” Scharf said.Overall payment volume in the quarter grew 11% over the prior year in constant dollars to $1.3 trillion. Cross-border volume was up 4%, a slowdown from the prior quarter. Total processed transactions over VisaNet rose 8% to 19 billion.Visa kept its outlook for the full year unchanged, with high single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth expected in constant dollars and adjusted earnings growth at the low end of the midteens range in constant dollars. That includes a negative impact from foreign currency.On its pending deal to bring Visa Europe under its wing, Scharf said a final regulatory approval is needed but that a closing is still expected in the second calendar quarter of the year.“We feel good about our $16 billion debt financing,” he added, in reference to the $23 billion deal.Visa is also awaiting final regulations from China before making a formal application to operate in that massive domestic market.Smaller rival MasterCard (MA) will report fourth-quarter results on Friday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect that earnings will mirror last year's 69 cents a share. It would be the third straight quarter of decelerating earnings growth.

931,MA,"Viacom (VIAB) has reportedly hired Morgan Stanley (MS) to explore a CBS (CBS) merger, as Alibaba (BABA) -- once rumored to be interested in Viacom's studio arm — ties up with Amblin instead.The MTV and Comedy Central parent hired the bank and will also bring on a second financial advisor, said the Wall Street Journal late Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. The outlet's sources said that CBS, which is currently retaining Lazard, might also hire more financial and legal advisors.The move follows Sumner Redstone's National Amusements publicly calling on both companies late last month to consider an all-stock combination. National Amusements controls about 80% of both Viacom and CBS' voting shares.Meanwhile, Alibaba's studio arm and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Partners said Saturday that they will coproduce and finance movies for global and Chinese audiences, with Alibaba Pictures acquiring a minority equity stake in Amblin Partners. Amblin will also welcome an Alibaba representative to its board of directors.Amid the wheeling and dealing, the fate of Paramount Pictures, which could be a key sticking point in any Viacom-CBS merger, remains unclear.Earlier in the summer, Alibaba's Jack Ma and Viacom's Shari Redstone reportedly met up to discuss a potential sale of the media conglomerate's studio arm, according to the New York Post. But The Street, citing people close to the issue, later said that Alibaba preferred licensing deals with the studio over part or full ownership.Shares of Viacom fell 1 cent to 36.26 in the stock market today. CBS climbed 0.9% to 55.73, closing in on a 58.32 buy point from a cup base.IBD's TAKE: Despite getting a bit of a boost from the CBS chatter, Viacom's stock has nevertheless been trading below its key 50-day and 200-day moving averages since late August. Keeping an eye on moving averages is key for investors: ""Law Of Averages: Sell When Stocks Breach 200-Day Line.""China-based firms have been eyeing Hollywood with increased interest.Alibaba has invested in Paramount Pictures films ""Star Trek Beyond,"" ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,"" and ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation.""And in July, Viacom was said to be in talks to sell a 49% stake of Paramount to AMC (AMC) theaters parent Dalian Wanda Group.Alibaba rose 2.3% Monday.

942,MA,"The time when customers paid for their purchases by swiping their credit cards and signing a paper receipt is coming to an end. New cards with a microchip and PIN have made their inroads into the financial payments market. And October 2015 marks an important steppingstone in this transition.
"
943,MA,"Payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) stands to benefit from this industrywide shift. The Ohio-based company operates on both sides of the same market: It provides a full suite of payment services to merchants on the one hand; and on the other, it produces the physical cards for financial institutions across the U.S.
"
944,MA,"Thanks to its extensive distribution network and access to both large and small merchants, Vantiv is the second-largest merchant acquirer in the U.S., representing an 18% market share in total payment transactions, overtaking a unit of Bank of America (BAC) in 2014. First Data ranked at the top. Vantiv also ranks as the No. 1 U.S. merchant acquirer in PIN debit transactions. An acquirer is a bank or other institution that accepts card payments in the merchants' behalf.
"
945,MA,"On the financial services side, Vantiv holds a 10% market share in the U.S., representing more than 1,400 banking and financial customers. ""It is the electronic middleman that enables and links electronically retailers and point-of-sale systems to the card brands and to the card-issuing institutions,"" said Raymond James analyst Wayne Johnson.
"
946,MA,"Among its clients are Macy's (M), Office Depot (ODP), Kroger (KR), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), In-N-Out Burger, Wendy's (WEN), Comerica Bank (CMA) and Fifth Third Bank (FITB). More recent additions include Rabobank, Capital One Financial (COF) and the U.S. Postal Service.
"
947,MA,"Among The Big Processors
"
948,MA,"The company ranks fourth among 28 names in IBD's Finance-Credit Card-Payment Processing industry group. Other players in the group include Blackhawk Network (HAWK), Total System Services (TSS)and Heartland Payment Systems (HPY). The group itself is ranked No. 29 among IBD's 197 industries.
"
949,MA,"Originally a spinoff from Fifth Third Bank, Vantiv loaded up on technology and additional distribution capabilities to conquer the fast-growing market of electronic payments. It expanded its growth organically via a strong referral business and inorganically through a few key acquisitions.
"
950,MA,"As a result, it's been able to grow revenue at a 40%-plus rate for the past nine consecutive quarters. Earnings per share increased 15% to 26% during the past six quarters. Its stock is up 36% so far this year.
"
951,MA,"The transition to chip cards, or what the industry calls EMV migration, has challenged the industry. October is the target for the so-called ""liability shift."" After the shift, when a transaction takes place, the party with the weaker technology will bear the cost of the possible hack or fraud.
"
952,MA,"That's why most national merchants, retailers and banks have been working hard to issue the EMV cards and install EMV card terminals. Those cards carry a chip and are accessible with a PIN instead of the classic magnetic cards that require a signature. The technology embedded in the chip is much more complex; it makes point-of-sale transactions a lot more secure and the cards nearly impossible to duplicate. The chip cards alone do not enhance online payment security, though.
"
953,MA,"This system has already been in use for many years in Europe and elsewhere in the world. EMV stands for Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V), the originators of the standard. The U.S. is the last payment market to migrate to it, mostly due to the vastness of the old tech and the cost and complexity of the transition.
"
954,MA,"The result is that more credit card fraud migrated to the less secure U.S. market over the years. Now that chip cards will enhance the security on that end, the risk may shift to the weaker links in the industry: small and medium-size businesses and online users.
"
955,MA,"That's where Vantiv comes in.
"
956,MA,"In addition to being a leader in the EMV transition, Vantiv also has taken steps beyond it. ""We think that the best way for the merchants to protect information is to do what we call a security suite of products, which is accepting EMV cards but also encrypting the information and tokenization,"" said Vantiv CEO Charles Drucker.
"
957,MA,"Point-to-point encryption helps merchants protect client data. ""If the data is encrypted from the point they swipe the card to the point that it's received by us as payment processor ... that data is now protected and virtually impossible to unencrypt, and that's a value-added service we make revenue on,"" said Andrew Ciafardini, vice president of corporate communications for Vantiv.
"
958,MA,"The other tool is tokenization, which removes the credit card number completely from the retailer's system. Instead, the retailer gets a representation of the number, which is called a token and is specific to that retailer, Ciafardini explained. ""So even if the system were breached, a criminal could not use that token anywhere else.""
"
959,MA,"Growth By Acquisiton
"
960,MA,"Vantiv has made three acquisitions in recent years. At the end of 2012, it acquired Litle, an independent e-commerce payment processor for Internet and direct-response marketing transactions. Its customer base includes Overstock.com (OSTK), Ancestry.com and Wayfair (W).
"
961,MA,"""That was a technology-based acquisition,"" said Nathan Rozof, senior vice president of investor relations at Vantiv. ""Today, we're using that e-commerce technology to win clients like the USPS, where they need help processing not only in all their post offices but also USPS.com and the kiosks.""
"
962,MA,"The other two acquisitions relate to the integrated payment space. Whenever a merchant, such as a restaurant, buys the software to manage its orders, inventory, kitchen, employee time and accounting, Vantiv can integrate the payment processing technology and offers 24/7 help lines for all platforms if any issues arise.
"
963,MA,"Vantiv's purchase of Element in 2013 brought innovative technology into this integrated payment space, while the larger Mercury buyout in mid-2014 brought with it one of the largest distribution channels in the U.S.
"
964,MA,"More Sales, Cybercrime
"
965,MA,"The company is certainly benefiting from a positive secular trend. ""The macro backdrop has been a positive (for Vantiv), and the declining gas prices have helped fan its sales growth,"" said Jason Deleeuw, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. ""We think payment security at the small and midsize merchant level is a key driver of growth for the larger, more sophisticated merchant processors like Vantiv.""
"
966,MA,"Vantiv also plans to use its large cash position to consider offshore acquisitions, grow its core business and return capital to shareholders.
"
967,MA,"As with any business, there are risks. Analyst Johnson mentions integration risk of its acquisitions, pricing pressure from financial institutions, PIN-network transaction-fee declines and economic risk.
"
968,MA,"But the company has ambitious plans to grow its market share. From its spinoff in 2009 to today, Vantiv has grown its U.S. payment transactions share from 13% to 18%.

972,MA,"Yahoo (YHOO) stock climbed for the fifth straight trading day on Tuesday amid chatter that China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA) might buy back the valuable stake Yahoo now holds in it, according to a media report.Rumors that Alibaba might buy back its stake from Yahoo have emerged before, although some observers say such a transaction is unlikely because of high tax implications for Alibaba.Yahoo has said it is approaching buyers potentially interested in all or part of the company — and Alibaba's recent financial moves have some investors wondering if the Chinese conglomerate is ready to make a play for Yahoo, according to a report in Variety.Alibaba senior executives Jack Ma and Joe Tsai said on Monday that they will spend a combined $500 million to buy company stock. It will be part of a $4 billion stock-buyback plan that Alibaba announced in August.Comcast (CMCSA), Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T) “remain the leading candidates to acquire Yahoo,” said Mizuho analyst Neil Doshi in an industry note this week, adding that those companies could offer a higher price than private equity groups, wield huge subscriber bases across Internet and TV, and operate leading mobile services.Time (TIME) has also been mentioned as a possible Yahoo acquirer.Yahoo rose 3.2% Tuesday to 32.80, hitting its 2016 high. Alibaba stock rose 3%. Yahoo has gained 25% since early February, but is down 26% from where it was trading this time last year.Yahoo shares also climbed more than 3% on Monday.Yahoo's Asian assets -- comprised of its Alibaba holdings and a 35.5% stake in Yahoo Japan -- represent the vast majority of Yahoo's $3.8 billion market value. Yahoo owns a 15% stake in Alibaba, or about 384 million shares.Asked about Alibaba's interest in buying back its shares from Yahoo, Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joe Tsai said during an October call with analysts that Alibaba would buy back its shares ""if it is very significantly accretive to our shareholders and that’s the principal we operate on.""Scott Rostan, founder and CEO of Training the Street, a group teaching corporate valuation and merger and acquisition skills, told IBD this week that Alibaba's buyback of its shares from Yahoo “is definitely possible.""He added: ""They could buy back 15% of their own stock and then (effectively) own Yahoo, which would be a very ironic twist.""In 2012, Alibaba bought about half of Yahoo’s then-40% stake in a deal valued at about $7.6 billion with the backing of China's sovereign-wealth fund, China Investment Corp., and a clutch of private-equity firms.Because Alibaba's purchase of the remainder could result in a huge tax bill on Yahoo's gains from the Alibaba, ""I think they have no interest,"" Shanghai-based 86Research analyst Sean Zhang told the Wall Street Journal in December. ""They will continue to focus on growth, focus on building a more competitive company,"" Zhang said.Alibaba said that it had $18.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 2015.Yahoo's directors are close to offering at least two board seats to activist hedge fund Starboard Value in order to avert a proxy fight, according to a report on Friday in the New York Post. Starboard founder Jeff Smith is looking to oust Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and force a sale of the company's core Internet business.Analysts say Yahoo is likely to lose advertising dollars to Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google and high-profile startups like Snapchat and Pinterest.On Monday, Yahoo also said that it may have to write-down the goodwill value of Tumblr, more than two years after the Web pioneer spent $1.1 billion to buy the microblogging site.Yahoo said earlier that it took a $230 million impairment charge related to Tumblr and was considering strategic alternatives for its core Internet business.

995,MA,"Today's Screen Of The Day is Young Guns, highly rated companies that have come public in the last 15 years. Today's list includes four top performers that are in the midst of changes that could set their pace for the coming year: Avago Technologies (AVGO), Facebook (FB), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Alibaba Group (BABA).Avago TechnologiesSingapore-based chipmaker Avago Technologies provides semiconductors for the Apple (AAPL) iPhone, and its sales and profits have soared for a couple of years as it rode the smartphone maker's coattails. But diversification to new products and new customers will be key for Avago this year as the hockey-stick rise in smartphone sales levels off.Over the last three quarters Avago's revenue growth has slowed from 130% to 37% to 16% last quarter. Consensus for the current quarter is a drop to 7.4% growth amid reports of slowing iPhone sales. Still, Avago boasts a best-possible 99 Composite Rating from Investor's Business Daily, meaning it's outperformed at least 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Shares closed down 3% on the stock market Wednesday.FacebookThe social network king, with more than 1 billion global users, continues to expand into adjacent markets.

Oculus recently confirmed it's on track to roll out its long-anticipated Rift VR headset this quarter.Facebook is now readying Facebook At Work, a site for professionals that could challenge LinkedIn (LNKD) and others.

998,MA,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: August Performance Report
"
999,MA,"Sophomore slump? Not for Joe Fath. He took the helm of $47 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund a year and a half ago — on Jan. 16, 2014. In that first calendar year in charge, his fund's 8.83% gain topped only 35% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
1000,MA,"This year — in which the broad market has imitated a bucking bronco — his fund has climbed 5.93% as of Aug. 31 , outperforming a whopping 96% of its peer investors.
"
1001,MA,"Fath is more concerned with the longer term. The broad market's rally of nearly 6-1/2 years has made it increasingly hard for him to find attractively valued growth stocks.
"
1002,MA,"The late-summer volatility has made it harder to find gainers.
"
1003,MA,"Fath, who is about to celebrate his 45th birthday, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore about why his mutual fund is performing so much better this year than last year and about how he is searching for new market leaders.
"
1004,MA,"IBD: When you took charge of this fund, you cut the size of the overall portfolio and of its top 10 names. You initially trimmed to 100, down from 118, and more recently you're at 106 as of July 31. Is your initial retooling complete?
"
1005,MA,"Fath: I'm where I want to be. The tail end of the fund is half what it used to be. It's 10% of the fund now. The top 10 decreased a little bit. The middle is bigger.
"
1006,MA,"IBD: How does each segment differ?
"
1007,MA,"Fath: I describe my philosophy as an upside-down pyramid. The top slice is secular-growth names. That typically makes up 50% to 60% of the portfolio. Those are innovative disrupters that are the most dynamic growth companies.
"
1008,MA,"The middle section would be more cyclical opportunities. These would typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio. They're likely to be more opportunistic and have shorter holding periods in the fund than the average holding.
"
1009,MA,"The last section would be what I generally characterize as special situations. These are in three primary areas:
"
1010,MA,"First, stocks transitioning from value to growth.
"
1011,MA,"Second, companies underway in a lasting industry structural change, like what has been going on the last several years in the U.S. airline sector.
"
1012,MA,"Third, roll-ups, where strong management teams that are good capital allocators are applying discipline and efficiency in fragmented industries through acquisition.
"
1013,MA,"This bucket will typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio.
"
1014,MA,"The top 10 or 20 names are generally the most compelling secular ideas. The tail of my portfolio has the smallest holdings and are typically my farm team — earlier-stage growth names and private companies that I own.
"
1015,MA,"IBD: Give me some examples of special situations, please.
"
1016,MA,"Fath: Gilead Sciences (GILD) went through the value-to-growth transition when it bought Pharmasset and got into (treating) hep C in addition to its core HIV business.
"
1017,MA,"Airlines are in the industry structural change category, and I own American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL).
"
1018,MA,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is in the roll-up category, bringing capital allocation discipline to the pharma industry through an assertive allocation strategy.
"
1019,MA,"IBD: Name examples from your secular bucket, please.
"
1020,MA,"Fath:Amazon (AMZN) would be the poster child. Tesla (TSLA) is a bit more extreme. It's an on-the-come story. Other names include Priceline (PCLN), MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V).
"
1021,MA,"IBD: And name some from your cyclical bucket, please.
"
1022,MA,"Fath: Stuff in financials like TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to a degree, but it is also a shifting business model, looking more like a value-to-growth shift.
"
1023,MA,"In industrials, I hold names like FedEx (FDX), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Flowserve (FLS), an energy industrial for the most part.
"
1024,MA,"IBD: Why has fund performance zoomed up this year — at least until the broad sell-off?
"
1025,MA,"Fath: It was a drag last year when secular-growth names sold off. A lot of that was due to people wanting to see more transparency in big names. They wanted to see Amazon break out its core e-commerce business and Amazon Web Services. That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.
"
1026,MA,"And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).
"
1027,MA,"This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.
"
1028,MA,"I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well. There's been some M&A activity in that space.
"
1029,MA,"IBD: So you have a bigger bet on growth this year, and that has paid off?
"
1030,MA,"Fath: The slowdown in growth happened prior to the sell-off in 2014.
"
1031,MA,"I was positioned for a cyclical recovery, but that didn't play out. It's been the reverse in 2015.
"
1032,MA,"We've been in a slow-growth environment. And the world has been thrown off by exogenous shocks like Greece and China, which is devaluing its currency.
"
1033,MA,"Those external factors help make growth more valuable. That bids up the valuations of companies that are delivering growth.
"
1034,MA,"But you've got to be disciplined about position sizes.
"
1035,MA,"Google, Priceline — their outlooks look good. They've gone through heavy investment cycles.
"
1036,MA,"Google has a new CFO, Ruth Porat, who came from Morgan Stanley. They're creating a new holding company called Alphabet, which will give more visibility to profitability of the core company going forward. People wanted more transparency there, and Google is starting to provide it.
"
1037,MA,"IBD: Let's talk about some of your interesting names, as of your latest disclosure. Do you share the concerns that some people have about Apple (AAPL)?
"
1038,MA,"Fath: It's done well. But I've been underweight. The stock peaked around 130. It's been sort of trading sideways. I'm guarded.
"
1039,MA,"The most constructive part is its valuation and capital structure.
"
1040,MA,"The worry has been about the company after this iPhone cycle.
"
1041,MA,"They've done well with iPhone. Now the issue is its replacement cycle. What we underestimated is how impactful the replacement cycle would be.
"
1042,MA,"I remain concerned about their ability to innovate, and does that drive enough of a replacement? They've done so well. Can they grow (as fast) off this base? It's hard to drive a higher multiple.
"
1043,MA,"We'll see where it will go. The watch doesn't look like it will be a success — or at least not move the needle enough. I do own it. I don't have it overweight.
"
1044,MA,"IBD: Why should anyone like Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth has slowed a lot for two quarters?
"
1045,MA,"Fath: They've done everything right. Right now things are in transition in mobile. As they get a big base (of users), revenue growth is slowing as they invest in new initiatives. And they want a lot of users before they turn on the monetization engine.
"
1046,MA,"They have 300 million users on Instagram, a lot on WhatsApp. They have 1.5 billion users on Facebook. They'll monetize over time, so profit will reaccelerate.
"
1047,MA,"IBD: What's your thesis for Facebook's Oculus, which is buying Israel's Pebbles Interfaces, which specializes in depth-sensing tools that can track hand movement?
"
1048,MA,"Fath: Oculus is a virtual reality play. It's interesting, but not a needle mover, but it's on the come. It's a green banana. It still needs to ripen. It shows (Mark) Zuckerberg is thinking multidecades.
"
1049,MA,"IBD: What's your Visa thesis?
"
1050,MA,"Fath: It ties in with durability of growth because it is at the center of online payments, the movement from cash and checks to digital and disruption.
"
1051,MA,"In the U.S., cards still use magnetic swipes, but they are moving to chips with a PIN. All cards will be reissued with chips imbedded. That makes it much harder to steal card information.
"

Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund a year and a half ago — on Jan. 16, 2014. In that first calendar year in charge, his fund's 8.83% gain topped only 35% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.This year — in which the broad market has imitated a bucking bronco — his fund has climbed 5.93% as of Aug. 31 , outperforming a whopping 96% of its peer investors.Fath is more concerned with the longer term. The broad market's rally of nearly 6-1/2 years has made it increasingly hard for him to find attractively valued growth stocks.The late-summer volatility has made it harder to find gainers.Fath, who is about to celebrate his 45th birthday, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore about why his mutual fund is performing so much better this year than last year and about how he is searching for new market leaders.IBD: When you took charge of this fund, you cut the size of the overall portfolio and of its top 10 names. You initially trimmed to 100, down from 118, and more recently you're at 106 as of July 31. Is your initial retooling complete?Fath: I'm where I want to be. The tail end of the fund is half what it used to be. It's 10% of the fund now. The top 10 decreased a little bit. The middle is bigger.IBD: How does each segment differ?Fath: I describe my philosophy as an upside-down pyramid. The top slice is secular-growth names. That typically makes up 50% to 60% of the portfolio. Those are innovative disrupters that are the most dynamic growth companies.The middle section would be more cyclical opportunities. These would typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio. They're likely to be more opportunistic and have shorter holding periods in the fund than the average holding.The last section would be what I generally characterize as special situations. These are in three primary areas:First, stocks transitioning from value to growth.Second, companies underway in a lasting industry structural change, like what has been going on the last several years in the U.S. airline sector.Third, roll-ups, where strong management teams that are good capital allocators are applying discipline and efficiency in fragmented industries through acquisition.This bucket will typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio.The top 10 or 20 names are generally the most compelling secular ideas. The tail of my portfolio has the smallest holdings and are typically my farm team — earlier-stage growth names and private companies that I own.IBD: Give me some examples of special situations, please.Fath: Gilead Sciences (GILD) went through the value-to-growth transition when it bought Pharmasset and got into (treating) hep C in addition to its core HIV business.Airlines are in the industry structural change category, and I own American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL).Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is in the roll-up category, bringing capital allocation discipline to the pharma industry through an assertive allocation strategy.IBD: Name examples from your secular bucket, please.Fath:Amazon (AMZN) would be the poster child. Tesla (TSLA) is a bit more extreme. It's an on-the-come story. Other names include Priceline (PCLN), MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V).IBD: And name some from your cyclical bucket, please.Fath: Stuff in financials like TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to a degree, but it is also a shifting business model, looking more like a value-to-growth shift.In industrials, I hold names like FedEx (FDX), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Flowserve (FLS), an energy industrial for the most part.IBD: Why has fund performance zoomed up this year — at least until the broad sell-off?Fath: It was a drag last year when secular-growth names sold off. A lot of that was due to people wanting to see more transparency in big names. They wanted to see Amazon break out its core e-commerce business and Amazon Web Services. That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well. There's been some M&A activity in that space.IBD: So you have a bigger bet on growth this year, and that has paid off?Fath: The slowdown in growth happened prior to the sell-off in 2014.I was positioned for a cyclical recovery, but that didn't play out. It's been the reverse in 2015.We've been in a slow-growth environment. And the world has been thrown off by exogenous shocks like Greece and China, which is devaluing its currency.Those external factors help make growth more valuable. That bids up the valuations of companies that are delivering growth.But you've got to be disciplined about position sizes.Google, Priceline — their outlooks look good. They've gone through heavy investment cycles.Google has a new CFO, Ruth Porat, who came from Morgan Stanley. They're creating a new holding company called Alphabet, which will give more visibility to profitability of the core company going forward. People wanted more transparency there, and Google is starting to provide it.IBD: Let's talk about some of your interesting names, as of your latest disclosure. Do you share the concerns that some people have about Apple (AAPL)?Fath: It's done well. But I've been underweight. The stock peaked around 130. It's been sort of trading sideways. I'm guarded.The most constructive part is its valuation and capital structure.The worry has been about the company after this iPhone cycle.They've done well with iPhone. Now the issue is its replacement cycle. What we underestimated is how impactful the replacement cycle would be.I remain concerned about their ability to innovate, and does that drive enough of a replacement? They've done so well. Can they grow (as fast) off this base? It's hard to drive a higher multiple.We'll see where it will go. The watch doesn't look like it will be a success — or at least not move the needle enough. I do own it. I don't have it overweight.IBD: Why should anyone like Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth has slowed a lot for two quarters?Fath: They've done everything right. Right now things are in transition in mobile. As they get a big base (of users), revenue growth is slowing as they invest in new initiatives. And they want a lot of users before they turn on the monetization engine.They have 300 million users on Instagram, a lot on WhatsApp. They have 1.5 billion users on Facebook. They'll monetize over time, so profit will reaccelerate.IBD: What's your thesis for Facebook's Oculus, which is buying Israel's Pebbles Interfaces, which specializes in depth-sensing tools that can track hand movement?Fath: Oculus is a virtual reality play. It's interesting, but not a needle mover, but it's on the come. It's a green banana. It still needs to ripen. It shows (Mark) Zuckerberg is thinking multidecades.IBD: What's your Visa thesis?Fath: It ties in with durability of growth because it is at the center of online payments, the movement from cash and checks to digital and disruption.In the U.S., cards still use magnetic swipes, but they are moving to chips with a PIN. All cards will be reissued with chips imbedded. That makes it much harder to steal card information.A lot of retailers have been reluctant to make this change because they'd have to change their payment hardware at the register. But they're finally starting to change.Visa Europe is another potential driver for Visa. Visa's takeover looks like it's coming to fruition. Maybe there will be an announcement in October.IBD: You've built your stake in Celgene (CELG) for at least four quarters.

1085,MA,"Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) stock slid to a 2 1/2-year low in the stock market today after the retail behemoth reported second-quarter earnings that missed views and it lowered its full-year earnings guidance. Higher labor costs, weaker pharmacy margins, a stronger dollar and increased theft from its stores all weighed on Wal-Mart.Wal-Mart reported net income of $3.475 billion, down 15.1% from $4.09 billion a year earlier. Wal-Mart's earnings slipped 10.7% from a year earlier to $1.08 a share, missing forecasts by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $1.12 a share.Total revenue edged up 0.1% to $120.2 billion, slightly ahead of estimates for $119.721 billion.The giant discounter lowered its full-year EPS guidance to $4.40 to $4.70 from a previous range of $4.70 to $5.05, citing higher labor expenses and weaker margins in its pharmacy business. The range includes third-quarter earnings guidance of 93 cents to $1.05 a share.Wal-Mart shares fell 3.1% to 69.71 in afternoon trading, the lowest since February 2013. The stock is down 23% since hitting a record 90.97 on Jan. 13.Meanwhile, rival Target (TGT) rose 1.3% intraday. Target reports earnings Wednesday. On Tuesday, Target said it reached a settlement with Visa (V) related to the 2013 data breach that resulted in millions of credit and debt card numbers being stolen. Target did not disclose the size of the Visa settlement. In May, a $19 million Target-MasterCard (MA) deal fell through.On the bright side, same-store sales at Wal-Mart U.S. rose 1.5% from a year earlier, driven by a traffic increase of 1.3%. Same-store sales at Wal-Mart's small store format Neighborhood Market increased 7.3% from a year earlier, with strong growth from its new stores, the company said in a statement.Second-quarter earnings were pressured by currency fluctuations, which negatively affected earnings by 4 cents a share, lower Wal-Mart U.S. margins and investments in customer experience, it added.""On the positive side, same-store sales came in better than planned at Wal-Mart U.S., and they are driving more traffic into the stores,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough told IBD.Yarbrough had estimated same-store sales at Wal-Mart U.S. would come in at 1%.On the ""negative side,"" labor expenses, including increased wages and adding more labor in the stores, as well as a major investment in e-commerce are growing faster than sales, he added.""The bigger issue is (the company) taking down the earnings guidance,"" he said. ""That's why the stock was down this morning.""Yarbrough says if same-store sales gains would have come in the way they did and earnings guidance had stayed the same, ""the shares most likely would have reacted positively.""On the conference call, CFO Charles Holley said the lowered guidance reflected Wal-Mart's investments in wages — which it's increased — training, additional hours in its stores and in global e-commerce would have on earnings.The company also said Wal-Mart U.S. pharmacy gross margin was experiencing more pressure than it expected.Wal-Mart was seeing margin pressure from shrink, a term used to refer to a loss of products for reasons such as theft.Separately, the battle between Wal-Mart and Amazon.com (AMZN) heated up last month prior to the back-to-school shopping season as the industry giants one-upped each other with rival Black Friday-like sales on the same day.Amazon held its Prime Day on July 15, offering special mega deals to new and existing Amazon Prime members that day.

1137,MA,"Growth stock investors, take note: The future of some market winners may be driven by China's rapidly growing middle class. This section of the most populous country in the world is expected to offer big opportunities to companies able to tap into rising demand for a wide range of goods, from clothes to food to electronic gadgets.Jack Ma, the founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA), said in the company's annual report in October that China's middle-class population — now close to 300 million, or nearly the size of the entire U.S. — will grow to 500 million in the next decade.""China has an awesome consumer story,"" according to a post in May on the website of consulting firm McKinsey & Co. ""The reality is that Chinese consumers are going to continue to increase in wealth and complexity,"" said the report's authors, Jeffrey Towson, managing partner of investment firm Towson Capital, and Jonathan Woetzel, a director in McKinsey's Shanghai office.They added that Chinese consumers ""dwarf"" developing economies in nations such as Brazil, Russia and India in terms of household income.All of these countries get coverage in IBD's ""Global Leaders,"" today on Page B10.Retail Sales RisingHere's another fact to keep in mind: Ma says the level of consumption among the middle class is ""still well below their income level.""Chinese people tend to save much of what they earn because they lack retirement and health care safety nets.Nevertheless, retail sales jumped 11% in October from a year earlier to $445 billion, the biggest increase this year, according to the latest official data. Sales so far this year are running nearly 11% above last year's pace, led by a 35% jump in online sales.Ma has urged small and midsize Western companies to set up shop in China as the nation shifts from being an exporter to an importer that relies more on domestic consumption to fuel growth.Much of that consumption will be conducted online, which stands to benefit Alibaba and other online malls, such as JD.com (JD) and 58.com (WUBA).EMarketer, which tracks online commerce, says China is the world's biggest retail e-commerce market, estimating that it will account for just over 40% of global retail e-commerce sales this year.On Nov. 11 alone, Alibaba raked in $14.3 billion in the online shopping frenzy known as Singles' Day, an Alibaba creation that has far surpassed Cyber Monday as the world's biggest online shopping event.Costco Wholesale (COST) and Macy's (M) are among U.S. companies already selling to Chinese consumers through Alibaba. Other goods — such as apples from Washington state, seafood from Alaska and Ben & Jerry's ice cream — have also fared well in trials on Alibaba's TMall.com, according to news reports.Big OpportunitiesGoldman Sachs, in a 2015 report entitled ""The Rise of China's New Consumer Class,"" said only 11% of China's population has reached the middle class.""As their ranks swell, so will their effect on the global economy,"" Goldman said, adding, ""There will be huge opportunities for the entertainment, food service, technology and other industries"" able to understand Chinese consumer tastes and align pricing and product offerings accordingly.Cross-border purchases by China's online shoppers rose from less than $2 billion in 2010 to more than $20 billion in 2014, with the U.S. the destination of choice for clothing, personal care items and baby products, Bloomberg said April 21, citing eMarketer.Most Chinese consumers who engaged in cross-border shopping did so because they thought foreign merchants could assure better quality amid concerns about counterfeit goods on Chinese websites, eMarketer said on Sept. 22, citing the China Internet Network and Information Center.Alibaba itself has been hit by accusations that it hosts merchants selling fake goods, which prompted Ma to promise to eliminate counterfeits from the site.

But, should the company strike a deal with Visa (or MasterCard (MA)) and present credit cards as an equal option, the company would likely see a $300 million transaction-expense increase, SunTrust analyst Robert Peck wrote in a research note.To offset the increased expense, Peck says PayPal would have to either negotiate for some kind of expense offset, see a 7% lift in payment volume funded by credit cards, or see a 3% lift in volume from its cheapest funding sources.San Jose, Calif.-based PayPal, through a spokesperson, declined to comment.PayPal stock was up about 2%, below 39, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. PayPal found support at its 50-day moving average Wednesday, a positive move just when the stock needed one. The stock is still below a buy point at 40.03 but above a 38.62 entry.

1160,MA,"Spending trends on U.S. credit cards slowed in the third quarter from the prior quarter, while U.S. debit-card spending on the biggest cards picked up.Credit card spending growth for Visa (V), MasterCard (MA), Discover (DFS) and American Express (AXP) networks fell 30 basis points from Q2 to 8.4%, which analyst Robert Napoli of William Blair attributed to a 27% decline in fuel prices and soft retail sales.Meanwhile, combined debit spending volume rose 190 basis points from the prior quarter to a 5.5% gain, even with a 10.8% decline at Discover, which lost a sizable partner.Still, credit quality trends at card issuers, which include American Express and many of the largest banks, such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C), are impressive, Napoli says, with record-low charge-offs and generally stable though slightly increasing delinquency rates. Visa and MasterCard do not issue credit.""We believe credit quality could remain much better than average for the industry as a whole until at least 2017,"" Napoli said.American Express had the industry's lowest delinquency rate at 1%, followed by JPMorgan Chase at 1.38%, Citigroup at 1.54%, Discover at 1.65% and Bank of America at 1.71% — all below the industry's weighted average of 2.17%.Credit-card loan growth picked up slightly in the the quarter, with U.S. Bank (USB), American Express and Capital One Financial (COF) reporting positive and accelerating portfolio growth, especially compared to relatively weaker trends at Discover, Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup.""Credit standards are being slightly loosened, credit lines are being increased, the economic and employment environment is improving and the consumer leverage ratios seem to be forming a bottom,"" Napoli noted.Shares of JPMorgan, BofA, Citigroup all rose 2%-3% near the market close, also buoyed by hawkish Fed minutes. Visa, MasterCard and American Express rose about 1%-2%.

1171,MA,"Yahoo (YHOO) is about to hold a traditional auction for its core Internet search business and has begun sending nondisclosure agreements to prospective bidders, according to a media report.Rather than talking with buyers individually, ""Yahoo is holding a traditional auction for the sale with formal bids,"" according to an item carried by CTFN late Wednesday.Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is under intensified pressure from major investor Starboard Value, which has urged the exit of Mayer and some directors, as well as the spinoff of Yahoo's core search business. Yahoo directors are close to offering at least two board seats to the activist hedge fund in order to avert a proxy fight, according to a report on Friday in the New York Post.Analysts say Yahoo is poised to lose more ad dollars to Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google and high-profile startups such as Snapchat and Pinterest.On Monday, Yahoo said that it may have to write down the goodwill value of Tumblr, more than two years after the Web pioneer spent $1.1 billion to buy the microblogging site.Bloomberg reported last week that Yahoo was preparing to meet with potential suitors. Among the companies rumored to be interested in Yahoo are Comcast (CMCSA), Verizon Communications (VZ), AT&T (T) and Time (TIME).Rumors re-emerged this week that e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA) might buy back a valuable stake that Yahoo now holds in the Chinese company.Yahoo’s Asian assets -- comprised of its Alibaba holdings and a 35.5% stake in Yahoo Japan -- represent the vast majority of Yahoo’s $3.8 billion market value. Yahoo owns a 15% stake in Alibaba, or about 384 million shares. But some observers say such a transaction is unlikely because of high tax implications for Alibaba.On Monday, Alibaba senior executives Jack Ma and Joe Tsai said they will spend a combined $500 million to buy company stock. It will be part of a $4 billion stock-buyback plan that Alibaba announced in August.Alibaba’s recent financial moves have some investors wondering if the Chinese conglomerate is ready to make a play for Yahoo, according to a report in Variety.Yahoo stock was down 0.5% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 32.75. Yahoo stock had risen in 11 of the previous 12 trading days, gaining 25% since early February, amid the buyout expectations. But shares still are down 25% over the past 12 months.

1175,MA,"Consumer credit rose by a record amount in September. Even better, more-confident consumers stepped up credit card borrowing at the fastest pace in seven years, good news for major card issuers such as Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC).Non-mortgage consumer borrowing rose by $28.9 billion for the month, the biggest dollar gain since records began in 1941. The bulk — $22.2 billion — came in nonrevolving debt — mostly auto and student loans. But revolving debt, which is largely credit cards, advanced by $6.7 billion, or at an 8.7% annual rate. Year over year, revolving debt grew 4.7%, the best since August 2008.Credit card balances peaked in 2008 then fell though 2013 before edging higher last year.JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America are among the top credit card issuers, so larger balances — and current low delinquencies — will bolster their own finances. While most bank cards are Visa (V) or MasterCard (MA), neither card giant profits — or risks — from cardholders' balances. Visa and MasterCard rely on various transaction fees. (American Express (AXP) and Capital One (COF) do carry cardholders' balances.)Bank stocks rallied Friday, after the strong jobs report reinforced a growing sentiment that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at its December policy meeting. Higher rates should boost banks' net interest margin — the spread between its borrowing costs and lending rates.JPMorgan rose 3% on the stock market Friday. Citigroup climbed 3.2% and Bank of America 3.7%.Visa shares fell 0.6% on Friday, but after setting a record high on Thursday. MasterCard rose 0.8% to a new closing high.On Monday, JPMorgan stock fell 1.6%, Citi 0.3% and BofA 1.5% as the broader market retreated.

1176,MA,"With events such as Apple's (AAPL) recent wrangling with the feds pushing the issue of digital security to the forefront, it's no wonder payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) is growing more prominent in the ongoing battle against cybercriminals.The No. 2 company in its field by volume, Vantiv continues to reap the rewards of merchants' and financial institutions' move to chip cards and their corresponding terminals. Its suite of other cybersecurity products continues to play a key role in the company's upward climb.Vantiv processed $842 billion in transactions last year, and this is showing up in the company's numbers. Fourth-quarter results surpassed analyst estimates as adjusted earnings jumped 23% to 65 cents a share, marking a third straight quarter of accelerating growth. Net revenue increased 13% to $453 million.“Vantiv has strong secular tailwinds, in our view, spanning digital payments, security, software and e-commerce with little exposure to macro headwinds like (currency exchange), gas, regulation, credit or discretionary spending,” Pacific Crest analyst Josh Beck said in a recent note to clients. He also notes that Vantiv has ""above-average industry growth.""Vantiv can thank a number of entities for lifting awareness of cybersecurity, with the most recent example being Apple. The tech behemoth brought the issue of smartphone security front and center in recent days with its controversial refusal to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone that could contain terrorism evidence. The company says it wants to protect customer privacy.Cyberhacks have also struck customer databases at such merchants as Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) in recent years, and the threat they'll keep scouring the Internet for further vulnerability persists.One relatively new security measure in the U.S. payments space is that of chip cards and terminals known as EMV. Named for the three consumer credit companies that originated the technology -- Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) -- EMV uses a chip embedded in the card, rather than the traditional black strip, in an attempt to process payments in a much more secure way.The card-and-terminal upgrade cycle is driving significant growth for Vantiv, which plays on both sides of the equation. Some 80% of the company’s revenue comes from merchants, via the sale of new terminals, as well as other e-commerce, mobile, compliance and data analytics products. Clients include Macy's (M), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Kroger (KR) and the U.S. Postal Service.The other 20% comes from financial institutions, with Vantiv behind the reissuance of the cards that contain EMV chips. Partners include Comerica Bank (CMA), Fifth Third Bank (FITB), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Capital One Financial (COF).Fortunately for Vantiv, the EMV upgrade cycle has a long way to go. Vantiv said last month during its fourth-quarter earnings call that, as of the end of 2015, more than two-thirds of the terminals of its merchant clients still needed to be upgraded. And more than half the debit cards of its bank clients still needed to be reissued as chip cards.""Some 15% of Vantiv's merchant transactions are chip-on-chip, meaning a chip card used by a consumer at a merchant that has a chip terminal,"" Beck told IBD. ""That gives you a sense that we're still pretty early, and my view is that this a multiyear cycle for Vantiv.""Further, the urgency for financial institutions and merchants to convert is growing. October 2015 marked a shift in liability to whichever party -- card issuers or merchants handling payments -- has the weaker technology. Prior to that, the card issuers were primarily responsible for cyber fraud liability.The company expects to see continued growth from EMV-related sales at least through early 2017, with an even longer tail from smaller clients on the merchant side, according to Vantiv Chief Executive Charles Drucker.""On the financial institution side, we're seeing the large banks adopt fast and reissue the cards,"" Drucker told IBD. ""The mid-size banks, as you pull into early 2017, you're going to see a lot of the cards out there with chips in them.""Along with upgrades, Vantiv is helping guide clients through the ever-changing regulatory environment, Drucker says. And its large clients are implementing Vantiv’s entire security suite, including end-to-end encryption and tokenization, a process that removes the credit card number completely from the retailer’s system.Beyond that, a number of merchants are buying terminals that also have near-field communication, or NFC, technology, which enables payments from the likes of Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google-owner Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Android Pay.The introduction of Apple Pay in September 2014 helped create a turning point in the payment processing industry, with nearly 1 in 5 point-of-sale terminals in the U.S. now enabled to accept billions of dollars in mobile payments, according to Juniper Research.""Most of the merchants, when they are designing their system, they're designing it in a way that when they get EMV, they are able to implement NFC inside of it,"" Drucker said.Another area of growth for Vantiv has been in the integrated payments space. For example, when a server enters an order into a restaurant's software system, Vantiv is embedded in that process. Plus, Vantiv is expanding into new verticals in the integrated payment category, including health care.Vantiv earns a near-best IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. Shares are trading 1%-2% below a cup-shaped base buy point of 53.46, with the stock retaking its 50-day line several weeks ago.Vantiv also has less exposure to the current volatile economic environment because of its concentration in everyday spending categories, including grocery stores and drug stores. The company doesn’t have much foreign exposure at this time, but in the long term, Drucker sees an international investment in the e-commerce space.And with the vast amount of information its transactions contain, Vantiv sees data analytics as a long-term growth driver as well.""Merchants and banks continue to be more interested in data analytics -- whether it’s banks using it to activate customers or see trends inside their base, or merchants using it to give a better customer experience, or to improve ticket sales that they have,"" Drucker said.

Last night we ended at S&P 2090.....a good 30 pts above support.....earnings are coming to an end and so the focus will return to more broader global macro issues once again....For now - I think we are in the 2060/2100 range...and if the 'data' continues to disappoint then expect the mkt to find its legs and push higher (indicating NO rate increase) ....but if as Janet indicates - the 'data' becomes stronger -then yes....look for the mkt to back off as the reality of an 'increase' hits home....and the mkt re-prices.  Either way - I do not think we get a move in 2015...so I suspect that the mkt churns and attempts to return closer to the yearly highs (2150)  as we approach year end.Now this morning - US futures are off 8 pts  as we await the first release of 3rd QTR GDP...and it does not have a 3 handle on it, and it does not have a 2 handle on it......we will be lucky if it has a 1 handle on it...as the Atlanta FED suggests it will be 0.9% (vs. the robust 3.9% in the 2nd qtr) and some of the biggest investment banks in the country are looking for 1.2% - 1.4% .  The 'official' (govt) expectation is for a reading of +1.6%.... and if it comes in stronger then I think someone will have 'a lot of 'splainin to do' ......Look for earnings today from MasterCard (MA),Western Union  (WU), CME Group  (CME),Air Products  (APD), Good Year Tires  (GT), Coca Cola  (KO), Pitney Bowes  (PBI),  and Marathon Oil  (MRO).....European mkts are in negative territory.....not big, but a bit softer....earnings are the focus.......DBK reports a loss of $6.5 bil  and said that they will CUT their workforce by some 26k jobs over the next 2 yrs - sending that stock lower.........Barclays also missed on their earnings....sending that stock down 4.5%... Frances Total Oil reports a 69% drop in revenue....(no surprise)  and they take the stock UP......Take good care.

1190,MA,"Vantiv (VNTV) CEO Charles Drucker said the payments processing company is ""firing on all cylinders"" after Vantiv reported better than expected third-quarter earnings for the fourth quarter in a row.The report pushed its shares to a new all-time intraday high Wednesday and gave the finance group a lift.Vantiv's earnings came ahead of PayPal (PYPL) Q3 earnings, slated for late Wednesday, its first since it began trading in late July after being spun off by former parent eBay (EBAY). PayPal rose 1.6% at the close — but tumbled sharply after revenue fell short.In the related credit card industry, MasterCard (MA) is slated to report Thursday morning. Visa (V) will announce results on Monday.Vantiv offers traditional and innovative payment processing products, including products for Apple (AAPL) Pay and the fast-growing mobile device sector, to merchants, banks and other financial institutions.The company's Q3 earnings, minus one-time items, climbed 20% to 59 cents per share as revenue grew 13% to $430.45 million. Wall Street expected 56 cents EPS on $413.96 million revenue.Vantiv, the nation's largest acquirer of PIN debit accounts — based on number of transactions — projects Q4 EPS of 61 cents-63 cents and $429 million-$437 million revenue. Both are roughly in line with analyst estimates.Its business net revenue from merchants services grew 16% to $345 million, mainly on an 8% hike in the number of transactions and a 7% increase in net revenue per transaction. Net revenue from financial institution services rose 3% to $86 million.Vantiv shares settled to an 8.4% closing gain to 50.92 on the stock market today after setting a record 52.44 intraday. Its stock has a 96 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 96% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Shares of peer Global Payments (GPN) climbed nearly 5% to a fresh high after Vantiv's report. MasterCard was up 1.7%. IBD Leaderboard list stock Visa was up 1.7%.Late last year Vantiv launched Vantiv Mobile Accept, a card reader that attaches to mobile devices to let retailers take payments anytime, anywhere. Mobile Accept is compatible with Apple's Apple Pay.Apple launched its mobile payment and digital wallet service a year ago in October 2014, with more than 1 million stores signing up within days of its debut, including Walt Disney (DIS), JetBlue (JBLU) and Chevron (CVX).Apple was up 4.1% Wednesday after it topped earnings estimates late Tuesday.Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

The World Trade Organization ruled in 2012 that Chinese policies on electronic payment providers discriminated against foreign credit card companies.Although major international credit cards are accepted in China, Chinese banks can't issue cards with foreign card companies unless the China UnionPay brand is also included.Many details remain to be fleshed out, including the cost of implementing such a system as well as the exact rules and regulations. Also remaining to be determined is whether Visa and MasterCard will be able to issue their own cards or if they will be limited to bank card clearing — the process of settling transactions between banks.In addition to liberalizing the finance sector, another goal for Beijing may be to help expand China UnionPay's global reach.""They've only just started competing outside of China,"" said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""I would expect to see that much more going forward.""

"
1327,MA,"  Netflix stock surged to a record high Friday on reports that the subscription Internet television service is negotiating with partners to launch in China.Netflix (NFLX) jumped 4.5% to close at 613.25. Intraday its shares notched an all-time high of 618.44. Year to date, Netflix stock is up 67%. In just the past four weeks, it has climbed 29%.Netflix is in talks with several Chinese online broadcast firms to enter China through a partnership, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal. Netflix has spoken with Shanghai-based BesTV New Media and Wasu Media, which is partially owned by Alibaba (BABA) founder Jack Ma.A local partnership is necessary given the Chinese government's strict controls over online content. Talks are still in the early stages and issues like objectionable subject matter and restrictions on foreign content need to be worked out.Censorship is a major hurdle for Netflix in China. The company is known for its envelope-pushing shows including the sex- and violence-filled political drama ""House of Cards"" and the prison drama ""Orange Is the New Black,"" which touches on topics of crime and same-sex relationships.Plans to start modestlyIn a letter to investors in January, Netflix said that it hopes to ""operate a small service in China centered on our original and other globally-licensed content.""CEO Reed Hastings said Netflix's operation in China will be ""modest"" at first.""Because we won't have that much content, we're going to be very cautious and feel our way along through that process,"" Hastings told analysts on Jan. 20. Executives did not discuss China during Netflix's most recent quarterly conference call on April 15.Netflix said it intends to complete its global expansion by the end of 2016.Netflix ended the March quarter with 62.27 million subscribers worldwide. For the June quarter, Netflix expects to add 2.5 million subscribers.It expects to be in 200 countries by the end of 2016. Netflix is in over 50 countries today, mostly in the Americas and Europe. It entered Australia and New Zealand in March and plans to be in Japan this fall.Morningstar analyst Neil Macker told IBD that the reports about Netflix negotiating to enter China shouldn't come as a surprise, giving the company's signals this year.""They're exploring their options, which everyone expected them to be doing,"" Macker said. ""China is a huge market with a unique regulatory structure.""Netflix is likely talking to all seven companies in China that have root-level licenses for delivering online video in the country, he said.

1329,MA,"Green Beret Bill Albracht feared that he would be bored to death when he took command of a tiny outpost in South Vietnam on Oct. 28, 1969. At 21, he was the youngest Special Forces captain in the war. And he was eager to experience his first combat.He was in charge of Firebase Kate on a hilltop on the Cambodian border, with 27 American artillerymen and 136 lightly armed Montagnard tribesmen. Intelligence said that any attacks would hit nearby Bu Prang Special Forces camp.Wrong. Just before midnight, upward of 5,000 North Vietnamese soldiers launched a four-day monsoon of fire and steel.Didn't Back Down""I never considered surrender,"" Albracht, co-author with Marvin Wolf of the new book ""Abandoned in Hell,"" told IBD. ""It wasn't something we trained for, but it was a matter of principle. We also knew we had killed and wounded so many of them that we probably wouldn't be treated too well if we were captured.""Incredibly, he and most of his little band survived the onslaught, and he would leave Vietnam with three Purple Hearts, three Silver Stars and three Bronze Stars.Albracht, now 66, was born in 1948 in Rock Island, Ill., part of the Quad Cities metro area of northwest Illinois and southeast Iowa. It would be his home base for much of his life.He was the third of five kids with a mother who suffered from depression and a father who was a harsh disciplinarian. Bill met low expectations in high school, where he was voted ""most fun to be with.""He and a friend decided that it would be a great adventure to join the Army after graduation, even though in 1966 most of their peers were doing everything they could to avoid the Vietnam War.At basic training at Fort Campbell, Ky., Albracht was shocked to be told that he had passed the Officer Candidate School qualification test by a single point.""It sounded like a lot of responsibility and not much fun,"" he said.He tried to get out of it, but the Army insisted.Albracht soon realized that his tough early life had helped him prepare. He completed the grueling infantry leadership course at Fort Benning, Ga., in August 1967 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant.""I learned the most important lesson that applies to any career,"" he said. ""A good leader has to first complete the mission, no matter what. Then he has to take care of those who enabled him to do this. Then he can accept any reward he has earned. Too often you find people at the top have these priorities reversed.""After parachute training, he was surprised to be selected to attend the Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg, N.C., to become a Green Beret. While he was nearly disqualified by the algebra and geometry required, he excelled out in the field.Now wearing the hat of the Army Special Forces, Albracht sought action. He wanted to go to Vietnam to join his older brother, Bob, a legend in the Green Berets.Army policy, however, barred risking the lives of siblings in the same theater. So Bill was shipped to Thailand to help its army with logistics. After volunteering for another year and rising to captain, Albracht finally landed in Vietnam during August 1969.Into The FrayHe was bound for command of a regular infantry company, where captains were in short supply, but persuaded his commander to send him to a Special Forces unit.Disappointment again hit him, this time because the job was at a headquarters desk.He wasn't about to sit still. He persuaded his commander to send him closer to the action — with a Special Forces A Team at Bu Prang in the Central Highlands.Even though the Army figured that the communist enemy was itching for an attack on the Bu Prang camp, Albracht was ordered to sleepy Firebase Kate. The outpost housed just three howitzers and their GI crews, with a Montagnard company for their security.Then came the October surprise. Gunfire woke Albracht at 11:30 p.m., and he barely slept in the next four days. In the first 24 hours, he was wounded but refused evacuation.The Air Force made dozens of attacks to drive back the North Vietnamese and take out their artillery. One of the Americans' most formidable air weapons was the AC-47 Spooky aerial gunship, which could fire up to 18,000 rounds a minute. But it flew at low altitudes and so made its runs only at night.Up Against ItKate had another problem. It was five miles from a road. The enemy assault was so ferocious, the only reinforcements for the American camp that could be delivered by helicopter were 40 more tribesmen.On Nov. 1, Albracht realized that Kate would soon be overrun. Fighting until death or capture served no strategic purpose. With reinforcement impossible, he asked local headquarters for permission to evacuate, which was denied.Certain that he didn't have enough ammo to withstand another major assault, Albracht responded by informing his commander that he and his men would attempt a near-impossible escape through enemy lines. The answer: Go for it.""It seemed slightly less suicidal than staying,"" Albracht said. ""We planned to leave that night, but trying to find our way through the jungle while avoiding the enemy didn't seem likely to succeed.""Of the 27 Americans, nine had been wounded and evacuated by helicopter. The 18 remaining were joined by 126 Montagnards (some 20 had been killed, with 30 wounded and evacuated).About 7 p.m., they crept through the hellish landscape cratered by bombing, escaped a North Vietnamese machine gun ambush and barely avoided another large force.A Special Forces rescue team sent to guide them to safety was not where Albracht figured, but he found it at 11 p.m. and arrived at Bu Prang at 11 a.m. the next day.Here he was ready for comfort, sleeping 10 hours — when suddenly an enemy assault on the camp nearly killed him.Albracht joined the fray and helped beat back the communists.A few days later, he brought wounded men by helicopter to headquarters at Buon Ma Thuot.Albracht then volunteered for and joined the elite Mobile Strike Force and was wounded twice in the spring of 1970 — first during a battle at Dak Seang, then by mortar shrapnel while on the move with the MSF.In August, after recovering and manning a desk, he went home to the Quad Cities, having earned his Purple Hearts, Silver Stars, Bronze Stars and ""the only award I truly coveted,"" the Combat Infantryman Badge.""Bill succeeded in combat because he thoroughly prepared himself through study and training,"" said co-author Wolf, who served in Vietnam in 1965-66 and became a captain a year before Albracht. ""He trusted his instincts and training to overcome all obstacles and deal with any situation. He also demonstrated then, and in his later career, the awareness of what he didn't know and the willingness to enlist the right specialist for the task at hand, displaying unfailing loyalty to those who earned his trust and inspiring their loyalty.""Albracht retired from active duty in 1970 with the rank of captain.Then he began a new career that would draw on the lessons of combat leadership. He enrolled at Augustana College in Rock Island, Ill., graduating in 1975 with majors in business and sociology, and a minor in psychology.Presidential DetailThen he joined the Secret Service, moved to Washington, D.C., and over the next 25 years protected six presidents. He was also involved in anti-counterfeiting operations, which once almost cost him his life in New York City.Until he wrote his book and began talking with others involved in the battle at Firebase Kate, Albracht was confused about many of its details, locked away as a traumatic memory. He now believes that the result was more than the sum of the courage and combat skills of him and his men.""I truly don't know how we escaped from Firebase Kate,"" he said. ""It had to be the hand of God that guided us.""

1387,MA,"Casino resort giant Caesars Entertainment is betting on Vasco Data Security International's multifactor authentication technology to provide an extra layer of security — beyond just username and password — to help prevent hackers from sneaking into its networks.Vasco's (VDSI) recently introduced Cronto authentication and transaction-signing technology is being used by Dutch multinational financial service company Rabobank to improve security, via camera-equipped Rabo Scanner card readers. Vasco's technology provides a graphical cryptogram representing a transaction. When a picture of it is taken and then decoded, customers can securely view financial details on a computer, smartphone or tablet and then authorize the transaction.""Our Cronto technology uses a high-definition color QR (Quick Response) code to deliver a hack-proof method of logging in and signing, which makes the process easier for users by having them perform fewer steps than they do today,"" Vasco CEO T. Kendall Hunt told IBD.In March, Vasco's electronic transaction signing technology was selected by Japanese megabank Mizuho Bank to help protect online banking transactions from hacking attacks.Caesars Entertainment (CZR), Rabobank and Mizuho Bank are among Vasco's 10,000-plus customers in 100 countries.Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.-based Vasco provides authentication and e-signature products and services, specializing in securing online accounts, managing identities and transactions, and protecting assets across financial, enterprise, e-commerce, government and health-care markets.""Much of Vasco's success has been in the online banking vertical, and many banks are upgrading to their next-generation multi-factor authentication and e-signature products,"" said Dougherty & Co. analyst Joseph Maxa.""In addition, they have a new product for securing mobile banking applications,"" Maxa said. ""They're having success in Europe and Asia-Pacific, and several U.S. banks are using or evaluating their mobile products.""Some 95% of Web app attacks make use of compromised credentials, including stolen user names and passwords, according to Verizon Communications' (VZ) 2015 Data Breach Investigations Report.More than 2.4 billion users are expected to embrace mobile banking services by 2020, compared to roughly 800 million in 2014, market tracking firm Research and Markets said in an April report.Growth DriversVasco says more than half of the top 100 global banks use its products and services to protect mobile applications, meet regulatory requirements and enhance overall security. Vasco also secures access to data and applications in the cloud, and provides tools for application developers to integrate security functions into Web-based and mobile applications.Hunt says a confluence of factors is driving its growth: Enterprises need more effective defenses against increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, users want security but also convenience, and there's growth in mobile applications.""Our (security) solutions have been battle tested in the most extreme hacking environment — banking — and we believe they will have appeal in many other segments,"" Hunt told IBD.Las Vegas-based Caesars, with some 50 casinos plus resorts and other properties, turned to Vasco for software that enables a user's mobile phone to serve as a secure authentication device.William Worthington, Caesars' chief information security officer, says it wanted an additional authentication layer while not making it too complex for corporate users.""Having a mobile solution makes it simple for employees to comply with a much higher level of security,"" Worthington said.Rabobank looked to Vasco's Digipass technology, with a one-time password that changes every 30 seconds, to enable a large-scale rollout of secure card readers that meet EMV (Europay, MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V) standards. Rabobank customers can do e-banking and secure e-commerce with Rabobank's secure smart card readers.Banks, retailers and other merchants in the U.S. are readying to support chip-enabled payment cards by an October 2015 EMV deadline, which shifts liability for fraudulent transactions to whichever entity involved has not yet adopted chip technology.Rabobank's purchases alone accounted for more than 30% of Vasco's Q1 revenue, Vasco noted in its Q1 earnings report on April 28 that beat Wall Street expectations.Vasco's Q1 earnings per share excluding items was 34 cents, up 278% from a year earlier. Revenue increased 68% to $65.1 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected EPS ex items of 21 cents and $54.5 million in revenue.Vasco's Q1 results were spurred by an 83% increase in revenue from the banking market, as financial institutions spend on new software and hardware products, particularly payment card readers. Card readers represented 45% of Q1 revenue, vs. 21% a year earlier.Some 73% of Vasco's Q1 revenue came from the Europe-Middle East-Africa region, and 17% came from Asia, while the U.S. accounted for just 4%, and 6% was from other countries. Vasco boosted its full-year 2015 revenue guidance to a range of between $230 million and $240 million, up from a prior range of $220 million to $230 million, citing ""a strong pipeline of potential new orders"" for its traditional and new authentication and anti-fraud products. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters now forecast full-year 2015 revenue of $237.6 million.Vasco faces a wide range of competitors, including more direct rivals such as RSA Security, which is a subsidiary of EMC Corp. (EMC), and Gemalto, as well as other indirect competition from companies such as SafeNet and Symantec (SYMC).Vasco stock currently trades at about 26, down from an all-time high of 44.25 in October 2007.Dougherty's Maxa says Vasco's Digipass for Apps (DPA) product generates a new revenue stream.""It secures mobile banking within the mobile app itself, kind of behind the scenes,"" Maxa said. ""The user may not even know it's there. It's early, but it is being adopted and should help them gain traction in the U.S.""Several banks have upgraded or are in the process of upgrading to their PIN pad tokens,"" Maxa said. ""They're now seeing banks upgrade to their new CrontoSign technology, which is easier to use than their PIN pad tokens. Rabobank placed the largest order in the company's history for this technology, and several other large banks are trialing it. The success of Vasco's e-signature technology is due in part to its ability to prevent man-in-the-middle and man-in-the-browser type attacks.""How An Attack WorksHunt says a man-in-the-middle attack involves a hacker essentially taking over a banking transaction, changing the payee and amount.""For example, you think you are sending $100 to your mother in Kansas, and they change the transaction to instead send $1,000 to Eastern Europe,"" Hunt said. ""By using a tamper-proof, high-definition color QR (Quick Response) code in the process, it becomes extremely easy for the bank customer to see the true transaction details and then verify them.""Governments are eyeing Vasco's technology, as well.""The Singapore government is offering citizens a free authentication token, named OneKey, using our technology so that citizens can utilize two-factor authentication to have a more secure experience"" accessing government applications online, Hunt said.""In Belgium, the government has a similar vision of allowing citizens to use their government-issued ID to verify their identity, but they want to take advantage of the large number of card readers that are already in use by citizens today,"" Hunt said.Maxa sees Singapore as ""probably a bigger near-term revenue opportunity of the two, as Belgium is in the very early stages.""

1389,MA,"Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com (JD) on Tuesday unexpectedly reported a fourth-quarter profit and better-than-expected revenue growth. But its morning breakout ended badly while shares of its larger rival hit a record low.JD.com, which came public last year, reported adjusted earnings per share of 1 cent, beating forecasts for a 2-cent loss and reversing a year-earlier 1-cent loss. The company report a GAAP loss of 5 cents a share. Revenue was $5.6 billion vs. Wall Street forecasts of $5.3 billion. That was a 73% increase in local currency terms. The 68%-69% increase in U.S. dollars was the best in six quarters.""Our commitment to providing the best e-commerce experience for Chinese consumers enabled us to deliver excellent results in the fourth quarter,"" said Richard Liu, founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of JD.com. ""Our growing reputation for product authenticity and amazingly fast delivery drove very encouraging increases in total active customers and total fulfilled orders.""JD, which has an Amazon.com (AMZN)-like direct sales service, reported gross merchandise value shot up 119% in Q4, with customer accounts up 104% to 96.6 million. But costs rose 68% in local currency terms to $4.9 billion.For the current Q1, JD.com sees revenue rising 54%-58% in local currency terms to about 35.3 billion renminbi, or $5.563 billion. That's fractionally higher than estimates for $5.556 billion.JD.com priced its May 2014 IPO at 19 a share. The stock rose to a 33.10 peak on Aug. 27. Shares sold off, losing one-third of their value, but have consolidated to form a cup-with-handle base.JD shares rose as high as 29.90 in the stock market today, above a buy point of 28.59. But the stock erased those gains as the overall market retreated. JD closed down 2.2% to27.53.JD.com is a key rival of Alibaba (BABA). Messaging giant Tencent (TCEHY), Alibaba's archrival, owns a stake in JD.com, which uses Tencent services to drive traffic and sales. JD and Tencent both recently closed a stake in Chinese auto information website BitAuto (BITA).Alibaba shares fell 2.9% to 81.58 after sinking as low as 80.03. That decisively undercut the Oct. 15 post-IPO low of 82.81.According to a late Monday report in the Wall Street Journal, many orders on the the e-commerce giant sited are fake, a practice known as ""brushing,"" as a way to boost sellers' presence.Meanwhile, Chairman Jack Ma pledged full cooperation with Taiwanese authorities. On Monday, Taiwan ordered the e-commerce giant to cease operations within six months over various Alibaba actions. That sent Alibaba stock down 1.1% to 84 on Monday.Yahoo (YHOO), which plans on spinning off its remaining Alibaba stake in separate company, fell 3.4% to 63.05, its lowest close since late October.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

1393,MA,"Alibaba Group's (BABA) profit margins are slipping as it spends to adapt its e-commerce platform to mobile apps, but investments should pay off as Goldman Sachs forecasts mobile revenue to overtake nonmobile revenue in 2017.China's e-commerce leader last week reported fiscal Q4 revenue growth of 45% and said that it had processed $97 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV), up 40% from the year-earlier quarter. Its platforms, including Taobao and Tmall, handle about 80% of China's e-commerce.In the March quarter, mobile accounted for 51% of GMV, up from 27% in the year-earlier period and 42% in the prior quarter. Q4 marked the first quarter where mobile contributed more to total GMV than desktop usage. Desktop GMV declined year over year for the first time.Alibaba ended Q4 with 289 million active mobile buyers, said Goldman Sachs analyst Piyush Mubayi in a research report Friday. Mubayi upgraded Alibaba to a buy rating.""Alibaba's Q4 results set aside fears of slowing GMV and concerns on monetization,"" said Mubayi. ""Spending has been moving to mobile at a pace that has exceeded initial expectations.""We expect this trend to remain unrelenting, given the transition in the wireless infrastructure in China on (4G network) rollout and the opportunities in smaller cities and rural China.""Alibaba's fastest-growing categories in Q4 were car accessories, dietary supplements, furniture decoration and household products.Analysts have had concerns over Alibaba's aggressive investments, rising competition from companies such as JD.com (JD) and Tencent (TCEHY), and a government investigation into alleged counterfeit merchandise sold on Alibaba platforms.No Word On Alipay SpinoffIn the March quarter, Alibaba posted an EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin of 49%, below estimates of 52%. Management said that investments in new business initiatives, including cloud computing and mobile, weighed on EBITDA margins.Alibaba's executives had nothing to say on a possible spinoff of its payments business. Alipay is China's leading PC and mobile payment tool.""We expect Taobao to remain as the major mobile traffic generator, given its leading app penetration nationwide, while midterm GMV pressure remains for Tmall as Alibaba management executes on its new merchant selection strategy,"" Jefferies analyst Cynthia Meng said in a report.Alibaba announced a new chief executive.

"
1398,MA,"Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
1399,MA,"Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.
"
1400,MA,"Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.
"
1401,MA,"IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?
"
1402,MA,"Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.
"
1403,MA,"It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.
"
1404,MA,"He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!
"
1405,MA,"IBD: And at Fidelity?
"
1406,MA,"Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.
"
1407,MA,"I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.
"
1408,MA,"If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.
"
1409,MA,"IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?
"
1410,MA,"Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.
"
1411,MA,"Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.
"
1412,MA,"It's a little harder to predict P-E.
"
1413,MA,"IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?
"
1414,MA,"Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.
"
1415,MA,"IBD: Give me an example, please.
"
1416,MA,"Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.
"
1417,MA,"The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.
"
1418,MA,"I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.
"
1419,MA,"While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.
"
1420,MA,"IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?
"
1421,MA,"Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.
"
1422,MA,"My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.
"
1423,MA,"IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?
"
1424,MA,"Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.
"
1425,MA,"And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.
"
1426,MA,"I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.
"
1427,MA,"If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.
"
1428,MA,"The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.
"
1429,MA,"It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.

1430,MA,"IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?
"
1431,MA,"Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.
"
1432,MA,"I live two blocks from an Apple store. When the iPhone 6 came out there was a line around the block. It was crazy. I can't ignore that.
"
1433,MA,"I could lecture about how smartphones are fully penetrated and the rate of innovation is slowing down. And how Android has outshipped Apple iOS five to one and usually the volume leader wins in tech. Actually, it always does! But the negatives haven't mattered (to Apple's stock performance).
"
1434,MA,"IBD: So you've decided — at least for the moment — that all is not lost for Apple?
"
1435,MA,"Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up. IBM (IBM) for years faced them but somehow always punched out good earnings. But that may be changing. Last quarter was terrible for them.
"
1436,MA,"When secular challenges catch up to a company, it's all over. In the 1990s, I was a tech analyst covering Compaq, Tandem, Digital, Stratus, Data General. They faced secular challenges. When the wave hit, they fell over. They don't exist now (as independent companies).
"
1437,MA,"Apple is a huge, good legacy story relative to other legacy players. That's another justification for owning Apple.
"
1438,MA,"IBD: You held Illumina (ILMN) as of Oct. 31. You're a fan of the outlook for gene sequencing, right?
"
1439,MA,"Weiner: Yes. Illumina is an incredible company, helping to unlock the secrets of sequencing genomes for just $1,000. The way we practice medicine is changing because of companies like Illumina.
"
1440,MA,"If you look backwards, people were doing one human genome. Now they're sequencing thousands. In the future, you will have your genome when you go to the doctor. That's where Illumina comes in.
"
1441,MA,"IBD: Will Alexion (ALXN) remain a play on a single drug, Soliris?
"
1442,MA,"Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.
"
1443,MA,"They've increased the number of indications Soliris is sold for. And behind that there is another drug they're hoping for FDA approval for, for a new set of indications.
"
1444,MA,"It's hard for society to say it will not pay for a drug, and your child will live for only a couple of years. If society pays for the drug, your child will have a normal outcome. It's a big ethics debate. But bottom line: countries are paying for these drugs.
"
1445,MA,"IBD: How similar is Gilead's (GILD) story?
"
1446,MA,"Weiner: They have great risk-reward. They beat the competition. There will be others with cures for hepatitis C. They will get market share. But Gilead will get the majority market share. If you have hep C, you want this drug immediately.
"
1447,MA,"One knock against the drug is that some people don't like to invest in companies that cure a disease. Then the treatment is a one-shot deal. Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug. There are millions of patients who don't have the drug yet.
"
1448,MA,"IBD: Chipotle's (CMG) earnings growth has accelerated for two quarters.
"
1449,MA,"Weiner: It's a great franchise with tons of room for growth. The secret is that people will pay more for food that they think is higher quality.
"
1450,MA,"IBD: What about Sherwin-Williams (SHW)?
"
1451,MA,"Weiner: This is one of the greatest companies that nobody recognizes.
"
1452,MA,"Their paint store franchise is so valuable. They're vertically integrated. Professional painters make their first daily stop at Sherwin-Williams, not Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW). They know how to treat pros. They have lots of pricing power. Material costs are not a big deal. Most (end users) are people restoring or remodeling homes. It does not depend on home sales.
"
1453,MA,"IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?
"
1454,MA,"Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter. And Ulta has a growing number of prestige brands. Years ago, prestige brands wouldn't sell through them. Now they do.
"
1455,MA,"Beauty products have high margins. Profits, same-store sales, sales per square foot are all growing.
"
1456,MA,"Last year, profits had actually been muted. The CEO (Mary Dillon) is investing heavily in e-commerce. She told a credible story to the Street about what her investments can do, so people are on board.
"
1457,MA,"IBD: You were a fan of Alibaba (BABA) as of your latest disclosure, right?
"
1458,MA,"Weiner: Alibaba is like the legend with that name. In 100 years, people will talk about (CEO) Jack Ma in those terms. This is the e-commerce leader in China. Full stop. China is a big market that is growing.
"
1459,MA,"Jack Ma has done a very good job of building a huge business with massive gross merchandise value. He's attracted merchants with a low take rate. That means for a small or medium business, Alibaba is a great tool to grow your business.
"
1460,MA,"He also has G Mall, the place where global brands can sell in a safe place where there are no counterfeits there.
"
1461,MA,"And he's got payments and financial services in his back pocket.
"
1462,MA,"Alibaba's gross merchandise value is larger than Amazon (AMZN) and eBay's (EBAY) combined.Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!IBD: And at Fidelity?Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.It's a little harder to predict P-E.IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.IBD: Give me an example, please.Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years.

1483,MA,"Samsung took the wraps off its new mobile payment system at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, while eBay's (EBAY) PayPal said it would acquire startup Paydiant, whose digital wallet technology is being used by major retailers.PayPal, which eBay plans to spin off, will reportedly pay about $280 million for Wellesley, Mass.-based Paydiant.Mobile payments is a crowded space, with Apple (AAPL), PayPal and Google (GOOGL) among those aiming to win.Google last month said the biggest U.S. wireless carriers — AT&T (T), T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Verizon Communications (VZ) will pre-install the Google Wallet mobile payments app on Android phones later this year.As part of that deal, Google is acquiring technology and intellectual property from Softcard, a joint venture of wireless firms.Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) — a retail consortium with powerful backers including Wal-Mart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and more than 60 others — is expected to launch its payment system later in 2015. MCX last year agreed to use Paydiant's payment processing technology.Samsung announced its payment system as part of the rollout of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge smartphones.Samsung Pay will first be available in Q3 in the U.S. and in South Korea, before being expanded to other markets. Samsung has lined up support from MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V) as well as American Express (AXP), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C)and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Security is a key selling point, as with Apple Pay, says Ashwin Shirvaikar, an analyst at Citigroup, said in a research report. Apple introduced Apple Pay in September as part of its iPhone 6 launch.With both systems, users authenticate transactions with their fingerprint. Samsung also employs ""tokenization"" security technology, which generates a single-use, random digital code during transactions, instead of transmitting 16-digit credit-card numbers.Apple Pay uses near-field communications, a short-range wireless technology, to send data to payment readers. Analysts say just 15% of U.S. retail locations have NFC-equipped sales terminals.Samsung Pay supports NFC but also magnetic stripe transmission technology. Samsung recently acquired LoopPay, which developed MST technology for mobile wallets. When launched, the Samsung mobile wallet will be usable at 90% of merchants, says Shirvaikar.Some retailers have opted not to partner with Apple, so Samsung could have an edge, he says.""(MST) capability is difficult for a merchant to block — recall merchants have successfully blocked Apple Pay. MasterCard and Visa credit, debit and prepaid cardholders should be able to use the new Galaxy S6 to pay in store for purchases,"" Shirvaikar wrote.Goldman Sachs analyst Marcus Shin, in a report, said Samsung ""could embed the LoopPay mobile wallet solution into its phones and eventually into wearables, allowing the company to penetrate into the mobile payments landscape ... . While Apple Pay penetration is partly constrained by NFC adoption, this is unlikely to be a key constraint over the long term.""

1497,MA,"Many investors are drawn to low-priced stocks like bears to honey. Truth is, it's an area of the market where institutional investors rarely fish. That means you shouldn't fish there, either.Prior to today, seven columns in this space have addressed the question: What makes a great base? Today's column is a reminder that when looking for good price setups, make sure stocks are priced at least $10 a share or higher.Retail shoppers love bargains. But in the stock market, what seems like a bargain usually isn't. Cheap stocks are usually cheap for a reason.Of course, it just sounds better buying 1,000 shares of a $1 stock as opposed to 10 shares of a $100 stock. The $1 stock goes up a dollar, yielding a tidy $1,000 profit. Meanwhile, the $100 stock goes up a dollar, yielding a $10 profit.Which sounds better? The logic may be flawed, but it's human nature to favor cheap stocks. Of course, there are stocks priced under 10 in IBD's database that have compelling fundamentals. Some have excellent Earnings Per Share, Relative Strength and Composite Ratings. ( Click on the IBD University tab at Investors.com to learn more about all of these ratings.)But it's not easy making money in low-priced stocks. It's a risky area of the market because most low-priced names lack a critical trait seen in past stock market winners: institutional sponsorship.Why do top mutual fund managers tend to shun low-priced stocks? Because they like liquidity, and cheap stocks rarely have it. Fund managers like to move into and out of a stock without being noticed. They can do that with liquid, highly priced names — not with illiquid ones.Fund managers like to focus on firms with an exceptional track record of earnings and sales growth. This is not easy to find in the low-priced space, where many firms talk the talk but can't walk the walk.It's not that money can't be made in low-priced stocks. It's just that the odds are much less in your favor.Truth is, some of the most profitable breakouts can come from higher-priced names. Not surprisingly, since they're more on the radar of institutional investors.""Expensive"" Often Is Not SoThe second half of 2012 yielded some powerful breakouts from institutional-quality names, as seen in the table above.MasterCard (MA) cleared a pre-split buy point of 448.10 in September 2012.

1518,MA,"Visible Boot: If you think ""call waiting"" is an incredible innovation, you're gonna love it when the FCC starts regulating the Internet like it's Ma Bell. For the rest of us, Thursday's ""net neutrality"" vote is a disaster.For 80 years, the Federal Communications Commission has regulated the telephone industry under its ""Title II"" authority. The result was decades of crappy monopoly service, snail's-pace innovation and high consumer costs.Contrast that with the freewheeling Internet, which has seen waves of new services, faster speeds and new competitors rush into the market.So when we hear FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler say that the Internet is ""simply too important to be left without rules and without a referee on the field,"" it makes us gag.First of all, there is a ""referee on the field.""Hundreds of millions of them, in fact. They're called consumers. And as anyone who's tried to operate a successful business these days knows, they can keep businesses in line far better than a few bureaucrats working out of windowless offices.Second, consumers have lots of choices on how they access the Web these days. Even out in the sticks, there is often a choice of ISPs. (And it's typically government intervention that hobbles competition.)Third, Democrats on the commission keep warning that a lack of rules will lead to a ""two-tiered Internet"" and ""gatekeepers who tell us what we can and cannot do"" and decide ""where we can and cannot go online.""But these are just ghost stories. Nowhere is there any evidence that any ISP has or ever would do such things. Why would they, when such actions would prove to be a marketing disaster?Even if there were such harm being done, it wouldn't come close to justifying the land grab the FCC has just engineered — at the express urging of President ""Fundamentally Transform America"" Obama.The real shame in all this is that companies like Google and Facebook decided to abandon the very freewheeling Internet that made their founders billionaires.Do they really think that ""strong rules"" will help the ""innovation economy"" thrive?Isn't there anyone at these companies who is familiar with the history of airline regulations, trucking regulations or oil and gas price controls? Or, more specifically, the tragic history of the FCC itself? (IBD has a list.)In every case, the result was less choice, less innovation and higher costs to consumers.The truth is that the Internet is simply too important to be left in the hands of clueless paper-pushers and political hacks working out of Washington, D.C.

1540,MA,"Falling fuel prices are great for vehicle-fleet operators but not so much for fuel-card firms that get a cut on sales when customers swipe their cards at the pump.FleetCor Technologies (FLT) is one of the biggest fuel-card companies in the U.S. And it has a sizeable international business, thanks to acquisitions of local fuel-card networks.The Norcross, Ga.-based firm generates revenue from its payments network and card processing services for commercial and government fleets.The company charges fees to fleet operators that use its various fuel cards and a usage fee to gasoline companies that take the fuel cards.FleetCor and analysts who follow the firm remain upbeat about its prospects in the face of lower fuel prices in the U.S.For one thing, FleetCor generates much of its revenue from services that have nothing to do with prices at the pump.In addition to various fees, FleetCor offers productivity tools, fraud protection and fleet-maintenance management, among other money-saving services.What's more, a wide spread between the wholesale price of fuel and the retail price offsets lower fuel prices — at least in the near-term. While wholesale prices react quickly to oil-price changes, retail prices tend to follow more slowly.Profit From Price SpreadsThe spread, for now, offsets some of the negative impact from declining gas prices, acting as a kind of hedge, analysts say.Eric Dey, FleetCor's chief financial officer, said in a post-Q3 conference call that higher fuel-spread margins lifted North American revenue by $5 million in the quarter.Analysts from Evercore ISI noted in a research report earlier this month that the average spread between wholesale and retail fuel prices in the fourth quarter grew 40% year over year.Given the wide spread and a decline in foreign exchange headwinds, Evercore raised its Q4 forecast by three cents a share, to $1.38. That's two cents above analysts' consensus of $1.36. In the year-earlier period, FleetCor earned $1.08.Barclays' analysts also don't seem too fazed by the impact of lower fuel prices on FleetCor's financial health. Barclays has an ""overweight"" on the stock, and it notes, ""Long-term prospects outweigh short-term headwinds.""""We suspect that during 2015, investors will look through the gas price and (foreign exchange) impacts and instead look at normalized growth potential,"" analyst Darrin Peller of Barclays wrote in late December.FleetCor shares rose 27% in 2014 but are down 8% so far this year, however.The company's ""normal"" growth has been impressive. Revenue over the last four years has grown 26% annually on average, while earnings have gone up 36% a year on average over that time.Numerous acquisitions have fueled some of FleetCor's growth. In Q3, the three biggest deals from 2013 — in the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil — accounted for about half of the company's revenue growth, CEO Ronald Clarke said in the last conference call.Total company revenue in the quarter jumped 31% to $295.3 million, while earnings per share rose 27% to $1.37.FleetCor has made more than 60 acquisitions since 2002. They include the recent $3.45 billion deal for Comdata, which closed in November and was its biggest buy ever.Comdata provides electronic fleet, virtual card and gift card solutions to more than 20,000 customers worldwide. Fleetcor management expects sizeable synergies, including cuts in fixed costs and cross-selling opportunities.Acquiring To GrowGoldman Sachs analysts see up to $1 billion of additional ""accretive"" deals this year.New acquisitions, organic growth and cost synergies from the Comdata deal ""will more than offset"" headwinds from weak fuel prices and negative foreign currency translations, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote after a meeting with management in mid-December.FleetCor's forecast for Q4 calls for earnings of $1.33 per share, assuming a foreign currency headwind of 5 cents. Analysts on average expect $1.36, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters.For all of 2014, FleetCor raised its EPS forecast to $5.07-$5.11 from $5.04-$5.10 previously. The company also raised its 2014 revenue forecast slightly, to $1.1-$1.11 billion.For 2015, management kept its previous guidance for EPS of $6.35 at the midpoint, despite an expected $.15-$.20 EPS headwind from unfavorable foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices.The 2015 EPS guidance implies a 25% gain from FleetCor's expected EPS for 2014.The CFO noted in the call that the Comdata business — yet to be acquired then — was doing better than expected and that financing costs were lower than thought.FleetCor's revenue is almost evenly split between North America and international, with faster growing North America slightly higher at 52.9% of the mix.North America revenue in Q3 jumped 35.6% vs. the prior year to $156.3 million, with organic growth of 19%.Double-digit growth in the U.K. fueled much of the growth on the international side, which saw revenue rise 26.4% to $138.9 million.Even FleetCor's business in ailing Russia was ""hanging in there,"" CEO Clarke said in the call. He and other executives declined an interview request.Maine-based rival WEX (WEX), formerly Wright Express, saw Q3 revenue grow 16% to $222.1 million. Earnings rose 17% to $1.56 per share, but analysts expect Q4 earnings to fall 1% from a year earlier.Its shares have fallen off sharply since late November.In IBD rankings, FleetCor is rated higher than WEX, with a Composite Rating of 93 vs. WEX's 74. The highest score possible is 99. The ratings factor in several metrics such as earnings growth and stock gains.Both stocks are in IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processing industry group, which is ranked 83 of 197 groups in performance.FleetCor is No. 3 in the group by Composite Rating, after Vantiv (VNTV) and Alliance Data Systems (ADS). Other stocks rated above 90 are Global Payments (GPN), MasterCard (MA) and Euronet Worldwide (EEFT).

1541,MA,"Transparency: The Federal Communications Commission plans sweeping new regulations on the Internet that it claims will help consumers. If so, why are they keeping these rules hidden before voting on them Thursday?For years, the FCC has been trying to impose itself on the Internet in name of ""net neutrality,"" only to be thwarted by the courts. Even net neutrality backers can point to only fear, not harm, as justification for such intervention.Rather than admit net neutrality is a solution in search of a problem, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler decided — at the urging of President Obama — to regulate the Internet under what's called Title II. That's the part of the law that established the FCC and would let the government regulate competitive Internet service providers as though they were Ma Bell circa 1935.Wheeler has refused to release the 332-page plan he wants the commission to approve on Thursday, citing FCC tradition as the reason.Thankfully, one of the two Republican-appointed commissioners, Ajit Pai, decided not to sit quietly and has been sounding the alarm. Whatever Wheeler claims, Pai says the plan he's proposing will ""impose rules upon almost every nut and bolt of the Internet.""In an op-ed published by Politico on Monday, Pai and Lee Goodman, a Republican on the Federal Election Commission, warns that once this plan is approved, the FCC will be able to decree ""whether companies can offer consumer-friendly service plans ... institutionalize innovation by permission (and) force private companies to physically deploy broadband infrastructure and route Internet traffic in specific ways.""As an added bonus, the rules will unleash trial lawyers to file class-action suits whenever they think the new rules have been violated.Even if the rules did start small, regulators will only find new ways to impose their will on ISPs as time goes by. In the end, the only people harmed will be the consumers who supposedly are in need of the FCC's protection.Pai and Goodman note that Europe has already gone this route with their Internet industry, and the result is slower speeds and a more limited broadband reach.It's unlikely making the rules available would change the vote's outcome — Democrats have a 3-2 advantage. But the public deserves nothing less than to see what FCC has in store for the Internet before the commissioners cast their ballots.

Analysts forecast a 7% rise in EPS to 78 cents per share with a 10.3% rise in revenue to $2.45 billion.Home Depot (HD) and Target (TGT) are among the other retailers with extensive data and credit card security hacks.In response to the breaches, Apple's (APPL) new Apple Pay in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus is supposed to be more secure, as card numbers aren't stored on the device, only a device-specific account number.But analysts wonder if the system really is secure in the wake of hackers leaking personal celebrity photos from the cloud.Rite Aid (RAD) and CVS Health (CVS) won't accept payments from the system and instead are backing CurrentC, a similar technology in development by Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX).MCX has been working on the system since 2011 in an effort to help retailers avoid 2% to 3% fees charged by credit card companies like Visa.""I don't know that MCX will succeed, and I don't care. As long as Visa suffers,"" former Wal-Mart (WMT) CEO Lee Scott reportedly said.Visa shares were dipped 0.1% in the stock market today. MasterCard rose 0.3% intraday.Fuel card firm FleetCor Technologies (FLT) is slated to report earnings Thursday as well.Analysts are expecting EPS to rise 24% to $1.34 and revenue to climb 25.6% to $282.7 million.The Finance-Credit Card group is ranked No. 25 out of the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. Visa has a 91 Composite Rating, meaning it's outperforming 91% of stocks based on key metrics like earnings growth.MasterCard has an 86 rating.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

"
1630,MA,"""In network land, being big is a huge asset,"" said Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst with Credit Suisse. ""Being everywhere is part of what makes a network successful. You're talking about a very large market, and Visa has the dominant market share.""
"
1631,MA,"Its vast network connects thousands of financial institutions with millions of merchants and cardholders every day.
"
1632,MA,"Mid-Century Modernizer
"
1633,MA,"Visa traces its roots to 1958, when Bank of America (BAC) launched the first consumer credit card program to middle-class consumers and small-to-midsize merchants in the U.S. Visa-branded cards appeared in the 1970s, around when the VisaNet electronic payments system launched worldwide.
"
1634,MA,"After a restructuring in 2007, Visa went public in March 2008, one of the largest and most successful IPOs at the time. Visa's Western European operation wasn't part of it. Visa Europe is a separate company owned by member banks. If Visa ever reaches a deal with the banks to acquire Visa Europe, as it would like, it ""could be a kicker down the road,"" Orenbuch said.
"
1635,MA,"Scale has big advantages as Visa keeps adding new customers to its network in the worldwide shift from cash and checks to electronic payments. Top rival MasterCard (MA) benefits from that secular trend too.
"
1636,MA,"""Both have good margins,"" said Orenbuch, ""but Visa's is even larger than MasterCard's because of its large size — its scale.""
"
1637,MA,"In its fiscal 2015 first quarter, ended in December, VisaNet processed 17.6 billion transactions, up 10% year over year. Payment volume hit $1.2 trillion, up 11%.
"
1638,MA,"Earnings per share rose 15% to $2.53. Despite a Q2 that will come up against an unusual tax benefit from the same quarter a year ago, full-year earnings are seen growing 14%, according to Thomson Reuters' poll of analysts. The biggest gains are expected in Q3 and Q4.
"
1639,MA,"Visa has no debt and has been active in share buybacks, 3.1 million shares in the December quarter, plus 2.5 million through Jan. 27.
"
1640,MA,"In the U.S., Visa also has benefited from its ""better partnerships"" with big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America and Wells Fargo (WFC), especially during bank consolidations that occurred several years ago, Orenbuch says.
"
1641,MA,"For example, Visa snagged Washington Mutual's card business after the bank's assets were acquired by JPMorgan Chase in 2008. JPMorgan has since formed a more exclusive relationship with Visa.
"
1642,MA,"Citigroup's (C) close MasterCard ties didn't bring as many benefits for MasterCard, Orenbuch says. ""Citigroup has not been a winner in consolidations and as a bank Citigroup in the U.S. is not that large,"" he said.
"
1643,MA,"Costco Wholesale (COST), the giant warehouse club, on March 2 chose Citigroup as its exclusive card issuer and Visa over MasterCard as the card processing network, replacing American Express (AXP).
"
1644,MA,"Visa and MasterCard had both fought for Costco. The deal goes into effect April 1, 2016.
"
1645,MA,"Checking Out Costco Deal
"
1646,MA,"Analysts say that Costco's decision was a big win for Visa. After the announcement, investors sent Visa stock up 2.6% to a new high.
"
1647,MA,"Credit Suisse estimates the Costco deal will add roughly $100 billion in annualized purchase volume to Visa in fiscal 2016, a rise of 1.2%. Morgan Stanley estimates 5-16 cents in added annualized EPS.
"
1648,MA,"Visa sees revenue this year growing by low double digit percentages and earnings in the mid-teens. That growth is coming off a huge revenue base of nearly $13 billion in fiscal 2014 — and in the face of several macro-economic headwinds.
"
1649,MA,"The stronger dollar has reduced travel into the U.S. from such regions as Europe, Canada and Brazil, and lower gas prices have cut into U.S. payment volume.
"
1650,MA,"As CEO Charles Scharf pointed out in the firm's last conference call at the end of January, ""consumer spend continues at reasonable levels but is not accelerating.""
"
1651,MA,"Visa's ""performing well despite the relative soft global economy and foreign currency headwinds,"" said analyst Bob Napoli of William Blair.
"
1652,MA,"""Secular growth of electronic payments is powering through relatively soft global economic conditions,"" he told IBD. ""Eighty-five percent of global transactions are still cash and checks, so there is still this massive opportunity to convert cash to electronic payments.""
"
1653,MA,"Visa has defied doomsayer fears that regulations and better payment processing mousetraps from tech companies such as Apple (AAPL) and others would weigh on its business, as well as MasterCard, Napoli says.
"
1654,MA,"""Everybody was concerned Apple Pay would hurt Visa and MasterCard, and instead it became a partner,"" he said, letting Apple Pay ""run on the rails"" those networks built.
"
1655,MA,"Not to be left behind by the tech revolution, Visa has invested heavily in digital payments, such as Visa Checkout (formerly V.Me).
"
1656,MA,"Visa Checkout makes it easier for consumers to pay with cards online on any device and continues to expand to new markets. Visa says that will be in 16 markets this year.
"
1657,MA,"Visa will also likely get a boost from price hikes. With October's Q4 fiscal 2014 earnings, Visa said it would raise prices on certain fees to U.S. card acquirers starting this April, the first such pricing action in four years. Shares shot up 10%.
"
1658,MA,"MasterCard hiked fees in 2013, but Visa didn't follow. William Blair analysts estimate that Visa's new pricing action will add 2-3 percentage points to revenue growth. Visa has said the price hike would contribute to stepped-up revenue growth in this year's second half.
"
1659,MA,"Credit-card spending has been growing faster than debit, viewed as a positive for the card networks because credit is more profitable.

1660,MA,"Nomura analyst Bill Carcache notes that Visa and MasterCard are ""big winners"" in card issuers' battle for transactions, and that issuers are rolling out expensive rewards programs and shifting focus to higher-spending prime customers.The law of large numbers doesn't seem to apply to global card processing giant Visa — the principle being that big companies that have been around a long time can't maintain growth and stock price appreciation forever.Visa (V) stock has gained 21% since the end of 2013, the best performer on the Dow. (On Thursday, Visa began trading on a 4-for-1 stock split-adjusted basis.) Earnings have consistently climbed by double-digit percentages.""In network land, being big is a huge asset,"" said Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst with Credit Suisse. ""Being everywhere is part of what makes a network successful. You're talking about a very large market, and Visa has the dominant market share.""Its vast network connects thousands of financial institutions with millions of merchants and cardholders every day.Mid-Century ModernizerVisa traces its roots to 1958, when Bank of America (BAC) launched the first consumer credit card program to middle-class consumers and small-to-midsize merchants in the U.S. Visa-branded cards appeared in the 1970s, around when the VisaNet electronic payments system launched worldwide.After a restructuring in 2007, Visa went public in March 2008, one of the largest and most successful IPOs at the time. Visa's Western European operation wasn't part of it. Visa Europe is a separate company owned by member banks. If Visa ever reaches a deal with the banks to acquire Visa Europe, as it would like, it ""could be a kicker down the road,"" Orenbuch said.Scale has big advantages as Visa keeps adding new customers to its network in the worldwide shift from cash and checks to electronic payments. Top rival MasterCard (MA) benefits from that secular trend too.""Both have good margins,"" said Orenbuch, ""but Visa's is even larger than MasterCard's because of its large size — its scale.""In its fiscal 2015 first quarter, ended in December, VisaNet processed 17.6 billion transactions, up 10% year over year. Payment volume hit $1.2 trillion, up 11%.Earnings per share rose 15% to $2.53. Despite a Q2 that will come up against an unusual tax benefit from the same quarter a year ago, full-year earnings are seen growing 14%, according to Thomson Reuters' poll of analysts. The biggest gains are expected in Q3 and Q4.Visa has no debt and has been active in share buybacks, 3.1 million shares in the December quarter, plus 2.5 million through Jan. 27.In the U.S., Visa also has benefited from its ""better partnerships"" with big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America and Wells Fargo (WFC), especially during bank consolidations that occurred several years ago, Orenbuch says.For example, Visa snagged Washington Mutual's card business after the bank's assets were acquired by JPMorgan Chase in 2008. JPMorgan has since formed a more exclusive relationship with Visa.Citigroup's (C) close MasterCard ties didn't bring as many benefits for MasterCard, Orenbuch says. ""Citigroup has not been a winner in consolidations and as a bank Citigroup in the U.S. is not that large,"" he said.Costco Wholesale (COST), the giant warehouse club, on March 2 chose Citigroup as its exclusive card issuer and Visa over MasterCard as the card processing network, replacing American Express (AXP).Visa and MasterCard had both fought for Costco. The deal goes into effect April 1, 2016.Checking Out Costco DealAnalysts say that Costco's decision was a big win for Visa. After the announcement, investors sent Visa stock up 2.6% to a new high.Credit Suisse estimates the Costco deal will add roughly $100 billion in annualized purchase volume to Visa in fiscal 2016, a rise of 1.2%. Morgan Stanley estimates 5-16 cents in added annualized EPS.Visa sees revenue this year growing by low double digit percentages and earnings in the mid-teens. That growth is coming off a huge revenue base of nearly $13 billion in fiscal 2014 — and in the face of several macro-economic headwinds.The stronger dollar has reduced travel into the U.S. from such regions as Europe, Canada and Brazil, and lower gas prices have cut into U.S. payment volume.As CEO Charles Scharf pointed out in the firm's last conference call at the end of January, ""consumer spend continues at reasonable levels but is not accelerating.""Visa's ""performing well despite the relative soft global economy and foreign currency headwinds,"" said analyst Bob Napoli of William Blair.""Secular growth of electronic payments is powering through relatively soft global economic conditions,"" he told IBD. ""Eighty-five percent of global transactions are still cash and checks, so there is still this massive opportunity to convert cash to electronic payments.""Visa has defied doomsayer fears that regulations and better payment processing mousetraps from tech companies such as Apple (AAPL) and others would weigh on its business, as well as MasterCard, Napoli says.""Everybody was concerned Apple Pay would hurt Visa and MasterCard, and instead it became a partner,"" he said, letting Apple Pay ""run on the rails"" those networks built.Not to be left behind by the tech revolution, Visa has invested heavily in digital payments, such as Visa Checkout (formerly V.Me).Visa Checkout makes it easier for consumers to pay with cards online on any device and continues to expand to new markets. Visa says that will be in 16 markets this year.Visa will also likely get a boost from price hikes. With October's Q4 fiscal 2014 earnings, Visa said it would raise prices on certain fees to U.S. card acquirers starting this April, the first such pricing action in four years. Shares shot up 10%.MasterCard hiked fees in 2013, but Visa didn't follow. William Blair analysts estimate that Visa's new pricing action will add 2-3 percentage points to revenue growth. Visa has said the price hike would contribute to stepped-up revenue growth in this year's second half.Credit-card spending has been growing faster than debit, viewed as a positive for the card networks because credit is more profitable.Nomura analyst Bill Carcache notes that Visa and MasterCard are ""big winners"" in card issuers' battle for transactions, and that issuers are rolling out expensive rewards programs and shifting focus to higher-spending prime customers.

1707,MA,"CEO Tim Cook spotlighted Apple's first foray into payments — a mobile app called Apple Pay — during the company's Sept. 9 iPhone 6 rollout.The tap-to-pay technology lets iPhone and Apple Watch users make purchases by tapping the devices at check-out registers in more than 20,000 participating stores. They include retail chains such as McDonald's (MCD), Macy's (M) and Staples (SPLS).Apple (AAPL) also got major credit-card companies Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and American Express (AXP) to join its mobile payments network, though terms aren't known.Apple Pay is a sophisticated digital wallet that links consumers and merchants directly with credit-card companies and their supporting banks.Mercator Advisory Group described how Apple Pay works in the report ""A Sleeping Giant Awakes: How Apple Pay Works and What It Means for Payments.""Users of the Apple iPhone and Watch can use the credit cards that they have on file in their iTunes accounts and add them to the Passbook app on their devices to activate Apple Pay.Apple Pay can then be used at any participating store.No special acquiring network like PayPal is required, since the payment option runs over the existing payments network that includes credit-card companies and banks, as long as the merchant accepts payments through wireless near-field communication (NFC) technology set up at the merchant's checkout stands.Every iTunes user has given Apple a primary account number (PAN) for each iTunes purchase. Apple has these PANs on file.When users ask Apple to activate Apple Pay, Apple communicates the request to the bank that owns the users' credit cards.If the bank approves the request, the user's PAN is sent to the appropriate network (AmEx, MasterCard or Visa), and the network generates a digital ""token"" to represent the PAN.The network then works with Apple to insert the token into the ""Secure Element"" of the NFC chip on the user's iPhone or iWatch.The iPhone or Watch is then primed to make purchases at any merchant location that has a point-of-sale (POS) terminal that accepts NFC-enabled devices.Users bring their Apple device to the store and take their items to the checkout aisle.They tap or wave the device at the store's POS register using Apple's Touch ID technology feature.The token is transmitted wirelessly to the register. The register forwards the token and other purchase data from the merchant to the appropriate network run by the credit-card/payment provider and its issuing bank.The network receives the data, which includes the token; looks up the PAN with which the token is associated; and inserts the PAN into the authorization request, which is sent to the credit-card issuer.The issuer receives the authorization request and approves or denies the transaction.When an Apple customer walks into a store to make a purchase, the only information that his or her iPhone communicates to the merchant is the traditional card payment information, such as the customer's name. There is only the token where the card account number and other sensitive information used to be.While Apple might be notified that the customer's device has been activated to make a purchase, Apple doesn't see the retailer's name, the transaction amount or any other sales detail directly.But Mercator says that it is possible that some information could be derived from other iPhone sensors that track such data as location, date or time.

1719,MA,"It's sad, but true. Good things don't last forever.In the market, stocks can have monster runs that go on for months or more. But when these massive rallies come to an end, they typically do so in dramatic fashion.Just look at past winners Crocs (CROX) and MasterCard (MA). After skyrocketing 431% in 59 weeks, shares of the shoemaker plunged 99%. MasterCard dived 65% after charging up 565% in 95 weeks.If you caught a major winner through hard work or was just lucky, the worst thing that you can do is to give back those gains. So when things start to get crazy, you don't have to sell right away. But you should start to get cautious and start watching out for signs of climactic activity.Not all stocks top this way. But when they do, investors should be prepared.Climax tops sometimes occur after a stock has been rallying for many months, usually at least 18 weeks after breaking out from a sound base. After such a long advance, take notice if gains suddenly accelerate. A climax top may be on the horizon.One sign of climax action may not be enough to end a stock's run, but watch out when several signs start to appear.•Exhaustion gaps. After a long run, a stock opens above the prior day's high. Such exhaustion gaps are usually a sign of strength and they are welcomed at the start of a breakout, but not at the latter stages of the game. There may be a series of these before a stock finally caves in.•Largest daily point increase. After an extended run, a stock that stages its biggest one-day point gain since the beginning of the move may be close to peaking.•Heaviest-volume day. A stock's top can occur on the day that it trades the most shares since the start of the run.•Consecutive up days. A stock goes straight up for seven or eight sessions in a row, following a long run-up. Or one that rallies for eight out of 10 days.•Largest weekly price spread. The difference between the week's high and low price is the biggest since the start of the move.•Price pierces an upper channel line. A stock that breaks above its upper channel line after a run-up. The channel line should connect at least three highs over the past four or five months.•Distance above 200-day moving average. The stock is extended when the price gets to be 70% to 100% or more stretched above its 200-day moving average. Few stocks can maintain that kind of momentum.In the late 1990s Qualcomm (QCOM) nearly quadrupled after coming out of a rare ascending base in October 1999. From Dec. 13 to Dec. 21, the stock rallied for seven straight sessions (1). On Dec. 29, the stock had its biggest one-day point gain since its initial breakout back in January 1999 (2). At the high of that day, the stock soared 251% above its 200-day moving average.In the week ended Dec. 31, the stock had its largest weekly price spread (see weekly chart).Qualcomm also suffered from excessive stock splits. The company had a 2-for-1 split in May of 1999 and then had a 4-for-1 split just over seven months later. The stock topped Jan. 3, 2000, and was nearly cut in half by Jan. 28 (3).

1725,MA,"Online retail giant Alibaba Group (BABA) reported its Singles Day holiday sales soared to $9.3 billion, a bit less than double last year's one-day tally of $5.7 billion. The company said it booked 278 million orders, 43% of those placed on mobile devices.

1727,MA,"The operation, a crucial piece of Alibaba's online retail operation and China's dominant online payment processor, would potentially be listed on one of China's mainland exchanges, Ma said.News rumbled out of China this week as the country hosted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum ahead of the two-day summit that was set to begin Tuesday evening between President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping.Late Monday, the U.S. and China agreed to expand the Information Technology Agreement to include a range of tech equipment, including medical devices, semiconductors and global positioning technologies. The expansion of the ITA adds 200 categories of technology to the trade pact initially forged in 1997, stripping tariffs from goods with value estimated as high as $9 trillion. The modified ITA will be put up for ratification before the World Trade Organization countries in Geneva in December.The surprise accord capped a year of frustrated negotiations, and lent some sense of momentum to the summit between Washington and Beijing. The two countries pressed ahead with competing visions of Pacific trade zones. Obama supports the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership that does not include China. China on Tuesday won support from the 21 countries of the APEC to study a free trade zone that it would head, called the Free Trade Area of Asia Pacific.U.S. officials said the two presidents would also finalize on Wednesday two significant protocols governing military activity. One of those will set rules for notification between the U.S. and China prior to notable activities, including military exercises. The other agreement, sources cited by the Wall Street Journal said, revolves around rules governing interactions at sea and in the air.For China's consumers, the talks were perhaps background noise to the country's Singles Day holiday — a counter to Valentine's Day and the largest shopping day of the year.Online retail giant Alibaba Group (BABA) reported its Singles Day holiday sales soared to $9.3 billion, a bit less than double last year's one-day tally of $5.7 billion.

1785,MA,"After it spins off from eBay in 2015, PayPal will face a brace of challenges, three of which go by the names Apple, Alibaba and Google.Apple (AAPL) has entered mobile transactions with Apple Pay, a payment app that piggybacks on existing credit card and bank networks.China e-commerce leader Alibaba Group's (BABA) affiliated payments business Alipay plans to expand outside China and increasingly threatens PayPal in world markets.Google Wallet, Google's (GOOGL) payment service, looms as another competitor.Other rivals, including WePay and 2Checkout, also are nipping at PayPal's heels against a backdrop of fast-changing payments technologies.""Not only is PayPal going head-to-head with other mobile wallet providers such as ApplePay, Google Wallet, CurrentC and SoftCard, but the banks and their co-branded partners (retailers, airlines, hotels) are coming out with their own mobile apps that incorporate and create an advantage for their co-branded Visa (V) or MasterCard (MA) card,"" Phil Philliou, a former MasterCard executive and CEO of TruBeacon, told IBD.""The good news is that we are all chasing a multitrillion-transaction pool, and any percentage of it is meaningful,"" Philliou said. TruBeacon is developing mobile apps that incorporate Visa or MasterCard credit and debit cards directly into the app.Apple Pay uses a tap-to-pay technology in which iPhone owners touch or wave their devices at specially equipped store registers to transmit a secure digital ""token"" that represents — but doesn't carry — the customer's credit card account data. More than 20,000 U.S. stores already accept Apple Pay.Analysts say that Apple Pay's convenience, security and reach can undermine PayPal's efforts in mobile. PayPal's mobile tap-to-pay offerings are seen as limited compared with Apple Pay. And the eBay (EBAY) unit's plans to branch into offline point-of-sale transactions have fallen short, according to some analysts.Alipay boasts more than 300 million users in China and serves as the main payments platform for Alibaba's e-commerce websites Taobao and Tmall. Analysts estimate that Alibaba, which launched a U.S. website this year, has 75% to 80% of China's e-commerce market. PayPal, in comparison, has 157 million active users worldwide.So Alipay has more users, but PayPal has a far wider global footprint. It has ties with 15,000 financial institutions worldwide, is offered in 203 geographic markets and accepts payments for PayPal accounts in 26 currencies.PayPal's Q3 revenue jumped 20% year-over-year in Q3, powering eBay's 12% overall increase.Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt said in a December research report that PayPal would continue to grab market share after its spinoff from eBay.Alibaba founder Jack Ma spun off Alipay from Alibaba in 2011 but controls Alipay through a stake in Alipay's holding company, Ant Financial Services Group.Ma said in a Nov. 11 interview with China's state TV network that Ant Financial ""will definitely go public,"" possibly in China.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Cheng Cheng said in a recent report that Alipay could expand beyond online payments into financial services such as wealth management and payroll services. Cheng values Ant Financial, whose main business is Alipay, at about $70 billion.Analysts say that Alipay can make inroads in global markets where PayPal's presence is still limited, such as Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and Africa.It's also possible that Alibaba will opt to cooperate rather than compete with PayPal in some markets. Alibaba Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai reportedly said last month that Alibaba would consider working with PayPal to expand its payment options for Chinese consumers. He said they would be interested in doing the same with Apple Pay.""If you look at (Alipay's) footprint of being the largest online payment company in China, and Pay Pal's position of having a very good international position not just in the U.S. but also in some other countries, these are some complementary footprints,"" Tsai told Bloomberg.

1787,MA,"New details are out on how Apple Pay, Apple's (AAPL) new mobile payment solution debuting with the iPhone 6, could both benefit and potentially take a bite out of the credit card industry.In a note Tuesday highlighting a meeting with Visa (V), Cowen & Co. analyst Moshe Katri said Visa believes card issuers ""are seen as essential partners to Apple Pay's success."" But ""it remains to be seen if Apple demands and gets a portion of the merchant acquiring fee.""A merchant acquiring fee is one kind of payment that merchants such as stores owe to their processing services for the work of handling a card transaction. Some of the largest merchant acquirers are arms of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and First Data.Apple Pay uses a technology called near field communication — or NFC — for contactless payments, such as while standing near a cash register.Merchants ""are accelerating investments in NFC-enabled terminals,"" Katri said in his research note.Although Apple Pay introduces a ""frictionless"" mobile payments solution, he added, the most important metrics to watch are consumer adoption and the ability to convert traditional cash users to card users.""Apple will generate fees from card issuers for including their card on its digital wallet,"" he added. ""Furthermore, NFC-enabled transactions at the (point of sale) will be facilitated via the roughly 800 million iTunes accounts which are already pegged to a card.""In its Apple Pay announcement on Sept. 9, Apple noted that ""hundreds of millions of users can simply add their credit or debit card on file from their iTunes Store account.""Katri says private label cards ""will likely be included (at a later stage) in Apple's digital wallet,"" which should benefit companies such as Alliance Data Systems (ADS), whose services include credit card processing for private-label retailers.In a report issued last week, Sterne Agee analyst Thomas McCrohan initiated coverage on both Visa and MasterCard (MA) with buy ratings, saying the two credit card companies should benefit from growth in cashless transactions worldwide as well as a rise in mobile payment options.Visa, the No. 1 card company by market cap, ""is well positioned to benefit from the global secular shift to electronic-based forms of payments,"" McCrohan added.Katri said in his note that at the outset, Apple Pay will likely be a neutral event for the networks, while it remains uncertain if merchant acquirers will be impacted.Related: How Apple Pay Helps Mastercard, Visa One-Up Merchants.

The huge sales surge for its latest smartphones has put Apple on track for record growth, according to market tracker Kantar Worldpanel.""Apple has experienced a huge jump in sales share across almost all major markets thanks to the launch of the iPhone 6,"" Kantar analyst Dominic Sunnebo said in a Dec. 3 report, adding, "" In major European economies, the U.S. and Australia, Apple's share of sales has risen.""Apple shares have actually fallen 3.3% since Thanksgiving, after running up to a closing high on Nov. 26.Note: Apple iPhone chip suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) also are on the IBD 50 and should benefit from extra iPhone demand.Advance Auto Parts (AAP) is a leader in the auto retailer group and will likely benefit from increased auto travel as gas prices at the pump continue to hit multiyear lows.Gas is below $3 a gallon nationwide, and fell below $2 in San Antonio, a CNN report said on Friday. More driving means more wear and tear on autos and more repairs.Auto-parts retailers also benefit as the average age of vehicles on the road climbs, boosting demand for replacement parts. Market research group IHS Automotive expects the average age of cars on the road will rise from the current record high of 11.4 years to 11.7 years in 2019.Advance Auto Parts stock is up 5.8% since Thanksgiving.Note: Rival parts retailer, AutoZone (AZO) reports earnings on Tuesday.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is a leader in the hot fast casual restaurant sector. Fast casual combines the speed of fast food with higher-quality food, including fewer frozen and processed foods. It's also capitalizing on the growing popularity of Mexican food.Chipotle is one of three restaurants with a 99 Composite Rating in the 58-company Retail-Restaurant group. The group itself is ranked a lofty 10 on IBD's list of 197 industries. Chipotle is the only fast casual to carry that top rating.Chipotle shares are fractionally higher since Thanksgiving.MasterCard (MA), like Apple, is seeing gains as increasingly confident consumers loosen their purse strings.Additionally MasterCard, along with Visa (V) and other credit card companies, have greater access to China — the world's largest consumer market — after the Chinese government in early November said it would loosen credit regulations to promote consumer spending.MasterCard stock is up 2.9% since Thanksgiving, hitting a fresh high on Friday. Shares have risen for 13 straight sessions — and that followed a consolidation following a 13.6% run-up over five days following its latest earnings report.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.RELATED:Who Should Be Thankful For OPEC's Decision?Spirit Airlines Rides Cheap Seats To New Heights.

1822,MA,"The most direct way Alibaba can build its U.S. presence, analysts say, is through a big acquisition or two. And some analysts suggest eBay (EBAY), which recently disclosed that it will split into separate e-commerce and payments (PayPal) companies, is a possible target.
"
1823,MA,"While Alibaba has loads of cash from its record $25 billion U.S. IPO in September, a big acquisition could irk U.S. regulators and politicians at a time of rising tensions between Washington and Beijing.
"
1824,MA,"In the meantime, Alibaba has room to grow at home. Alibaba boasts 500 million registered users in China, a huge figure that nevertheless is still far less than half the country's population. But it faces mounting competition in China from rivals such as Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) and Baidu (BIDU), and Alibaba founder Jack Ma has his sights set on making Alibaba an international brand.

1827,MA,"""This is only a beginning,"" Masayoshi Son, CEO of Japan's SoftBank, which owns a 34% stake in Alibaba, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television last month. ""Alibaba continues to grow inside China, but also globally. This IPO in New York makes a good entry to the global expansion.""
"
1828,MA,"This week, Ma said at a conference that he's open to a partner with Apple's (AAPL) Apple Pay mobile payments service.
"
1829,MA,"Alibaba rules the world's fastest-growing and largest e-commerce market, but the company and its mercurial founder, Ma, must gain overseas to keep growing and satisfy investors. The long-term challenge Alibaba faces is similar to ones faced by U.S. counterparts such as Amazon, eBay and Priceline (PCLN), which turned to international markets to maintain high growth rates as U.S. markets matured.
"
1830,MA,"But JG Capital analyst Henry Guo doesn't see international markets, including the U.S., becoming a driver of Alibaba's growth for three to five years. ""(Alibaba's) focus now is on China's domestic market,"" Guo said.

1834,MA,"Two-Thirds Unfamiliar
"
1835,MA,"One of Alibaba's biggest hurdles here is its little-known brand. A recent survey by online retail researcher Bizrate Insights found that 63% of online buyers, skewing toward younger consumers and women, aren't familiar with Alibaba's brand or website. Of the 37% that had heard of Alibaba, only 30% of them (11% overall) said they had browsed the site.
"
1836,MA,"""Alibaba has to raise its brand awareness,"" Bizrate Insights Vice President Hayley Silver told IBD.
"
1837,MA,"With no U.S.-based e-commerce operation, Silver says consumers have to order items from Alibaba's English-language Chinese website. She says shipping from China is slow and she questions how well Chinese customer service reps would handle complaints. Also, Alibaba's site features made-in-China items, a turn-off for shoppers here who prefer American-made goods.
"
1838,MA,"In one of its biggest moves in the U.S., Alibaba has taken a 39% stake in San Mateo, Calif.-based ShopRunner, a smaller, members-only rival of Amazon. Headed by former Yahoo (YHOO) CEO Scott Thompson, ShopRunner offers free shipping for online orders in a program that resembles Amazon Prime.
"
1839,MA,"ShopRunner is preparing a joint service with Alibaba that provides U.S. brands with a direct way to sell to China's consumers. When it's up and running, the 300 million-plus Chinese users of Alibaba's AliPay payments service will be able to order products directly from the U.S. websites of ShopRunner partners like Neiman Marcus (NMG) and Nine West, and have the goods delivered from the U.S. to China in 10 days.
"
1840,MA,"The joint service reportedly will launch by year-end. A ShopRunner spokesperson declined to comment. But when it does launch, the China-centric Alibaba/ShopRunner partnership likely will do little to churn up business for Alibaba with U.S. shoppers.
"
1841,MA,"Alibaba's only direct foray into U.S. e-commerce so far has more of a PR angle than scale. In June, it launched 11 Main, a small online retail website that touts distinctly U.S. goods and crafts from U.S. vendors.
"
1842,MA,"With the motivation and the money, some observes expect Alibaba will make a big acquisition in the U.S. Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said in an Oct. 1 report that eBay's Marketplaces businesses makes it a tempting target for Alibaba. Marketplaces is second only to Amazon in e-commerce sales.
"
1843,MA,"But Carnegie Towers' Tang says Alibaba could get U.S. traction by acting as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, similar to what eBay does now and something it could do without acquiring eBay.
"
1844,MA,"Tang says Alibaba could rely on the in-house inventories of U.S. brands and makers who sell on its site. He says it could rely on the existing facilities of these sellers and shippers like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) without building a fulfillment network like Amazon.
"
1845,MA,"B2B Connection

1847,MA,"Offering B2B transactions for U.S. companies is another hot area for Alibaba, according to Tang. He says Alibaba's connections with suppliers in China and other foreign markets could be useful for U.S. clients.
"
1848,MA,"Still, a big U.S. acquisition wouldn't be a surprise.
"
1849,MA,"""It's possible,"" said JG Capital's Guo, though he says eBay might be a bit large for Alibaba to digest.
"
1850,MA,"Ma isn't shy about buying big U.S. businesses. He said in 2011 that he was interested in acquiring then-troubled Yahoo. But such a high-profile purchase might face scrutiny in Congress and possibly by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. CFIUS is an inter-agency government body that reviews transactions that could give control of U.S. companies to foreigners.

"
1905,MA,"""One mega breach can be worth 50 smaller attacks,"" Haley told IBD.Hackers who've long used malware to slip inside company computer networks are hunting down administrative and other privileged accounts, enabling them to go undetected for months, says a cybersecurity expert in a look ahead to the top threats of 2015.""Two hundred days of unfettered, malicious activity is a lot of time where hackers can really steal vital information, establish back doors, come in and out as they wish,"" said Ehud Mokady, founder and CEO of CyberArk Software (CYBR), a security firm that specializes in defeating cybercriminals who've made their way undetected into networks.Compromised privileged accounts are among the top threats facing enterprises in 2015, say not only Mokady but also experts at Palo Alto Networks, Symantec (SYMC), Intel (INTC), FireEye and other cybersecurity vendors.Most companies are unaware how many privileged accounts they have or that attackers can easily use them to set up additional users to blend into normal network traffic, security executives say.Hackers Eye New TargetsNew threats are popping up as new technologies emerge. Digital payment systems will provide fresh targets. Hackers will go after Internet of Things connected devices, from IP cameras with weak security controls to smart meters with basic encryption flaws.FireEye (FEYE) is investigating hackers who collect information from publicly traded companies. Attackers with extensive knowledge of industry nuances and financial practices are after insider information to get a clear advantage and ""play the stock market,"" said Dan McWhorter, FireEye vice president of threat intelligence.Long-used tactics such as phishing — tricking users into opening email attachments — and ransomware — forcing users to pay ransoms for virus fixes or decryption — will continue.Retailers can expect continued attacks next year, including credit and debit card ""skimmers"" hidden at gas pumps or ATMs to gather card details and PINs. Hackers will go after smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices.Year Of 'Broken Trust'Investigators are learning of new threats after a rapid succession of breaches in 2014, which might be remembered as ""the year of shaken trust,"" said Mike Sentonas, chief technology officer of the McAfee Security Connected unit of Intel Security.But high-profile data thefts against Sony Pictures, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Home Depot (HD), Target (TGT) and other companies have heightened awareness.The number of reported cybersecurity incidents at businesses and other enterprises in 2014 rose 48% from 2013 to 42.8 million, or 117,339 attacks per day, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. The average financial loss from these cybersecurity incidents was $2.7 million, up 34% over 2013, an annual PwC survey found. Big losses were more common in 2014, as the number of financial hits of $20 million or more soared 92%.Sony Hack A Turning Point?What was particularly disturbing about the Sony (SNE) attack was that sensitive, private information was made public to discredit and damage the company and its executives, analysts say.The sophistication and scope of cyberattacks has created a sense of urgency among top executives and inside boardrooms, says Palo Alto Networks (PANW) CEO Mark McLaughlin.""Historically, a lot of companies thought about security the same way they would think about general administrative stuff — like facilities,"" McLaughlin told IBD. ""It was something that was important, that had to happen in the company, but it wasn't rising to the level of being a top-three strategic issue. That's no longer the case.""Real-Time IntelTo ferret out and share information about attackers and their strategies, Palo Alto Networks formed Unit 42, a cybersecurity team to research, analyze and share up-to-the-minute threat intelligence. The team already has found a wide range of malware, with names like Kuluoz and Asprox, that have affected the health care, retail and financial services industries.In December, PA Networks discovered a backdoor in millions of Android-based mobile devices sold by Coolpad, one of the world's largest China-based smartphone makers. The backdoor, dubbed ""CoolReaper,"" exposes users to malicious activity.Corporate executives and IT specialists are focusing on ways to thwart cyberattacks in 2015.Enterprise spending on information security goods and services is expected to increase 8.2% to $76.9 billion in 2015, market tracker Gartner predicts. Businesses and other enterprises spent $71.1 billion on cybersecurity in 2014, up 7.9% over 2013, says the research firm. The data-loss-prevention segment led the way, with spending rising 18.9%.Just where to invest in cybersecurity is a tough challenge. Attackers constantly adapt to cyberdefenses.Chipping Away At HacksIt remains to be seen, for example, if EMV (Europay, MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V) chip-enabled credit and debit cards that are replacing traditional cards will dramatically stem fraud.Payment card issuers are expected to send out more than 575 million chip-enabled cards by the end of 2015, the New York-based Payments Security Task Force says. The task force, which represents companies such as Bank of America (BAC), Capital One (COF), Discover (DISCA) and Wells Fargo (WFC), also predicts 47% of U.S. merchant payment-card terminals will be equipped to handle EMV-chip technology by the end of next year.The EMV rollout may cut down on card counterfeiting, but it won't fix a ""fundamentally flawed system, in which fraudsters exploit insecure rights management and access controls,"" said Kent Schneider, chief operating officer of Denver-based identity validation and security firm SolPass.Mobile InsecurityAs more employees bring their own laptops and other devices to work, companies that focused on outside threats must be ready for insider breaches, including when employees unwittingly compro mise data by losing mobile devices.McAfee cites the ""Flappy Bird"" mobile games as an example of how hackers used popular games and social engineering to wreak havoc.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Visa's year-over-year earnings to rise at least 15% over the next three years.McCrohan initiated Visa with a 12-month price target of 265. Shares of the San Francisco-based company were near 214 in early morning trading in the stock market.Also Tuesday, McCrohan initiated Purchase, N.Y.-based MasterCard with a 12-month price target of 85.

""Visa recently acquired 100% of GP Net, a joint venture between Visa and seven leading Japanese issuers, which we believe is a clear indication of Visa's interest in this region.""Meanwhile, MasterCard is also making a big push into new markets.""MasterCard has introduced non-cash payments to several countries (e.g., South Africa and Nigeria) that previously had no electronic payment infrastructure,"" McCrohan said.

1933,MA,"GoPro had a picture perfect Monday, unveiling three new action cameras while its stock hit a new high for the fifth straight session.The new top-of-the-line Hero4 Black will sell for $499 — $100 more than the existing Hero3 Black. But GoPro (GPRO) also introduced a $129 entry-level camera.GoPro is the leading producer of wearable and durable high-definition video cameras — the GoPro Hero series — used by surfers, bikers, skiers and other outdoor enthusiasts to record their adventures. It launched its first high-definition video camera in 2009. It also sells mountable and wearable accessories.Picture Perfect""GoPro has become a movement, with strong products and limited competition,"" said Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities. ""They don't have competitors that are at their level right now.""San Mateo, Calif.-based GoPro said it had a 45% share of the U.S. camcorder market in 2013, followed by Sony (SNE) at 24% and Canon (CAJ) at 12%. Other rivals include Garmin (GRMN). Polaroid introduced a $99 mini video camera last week. Seyrafi said various sources place GoPro consistently higher than its competitors.Seyrafi raised his price target on GoPro to 90 from 70 on Monday.GoPro spiked 11% to 90.94 on Monday. That's up 33% over the last five sessions and 279% from its late June IPO price of 24.Ambarella (AMBA), which makes chips for GoPro cameras, rose 6% to 44.45, hitting a new high. That stock is up 641% since its October 2013 IPO price at 6.In the second quarter GoPro said it shipped 854,000 cameras, up 31% a year earlier. Revenue rose 38% to $244.6 million, earning 8 cents a share, minus items.Seyrafi estimates GoPro will ship 4.43 million cameras this year, up 15% from 2013, at an average price of $284. He predicts GoPro will sell 5.4 million units in 2015. That translates to revenue of $1.26 billion this year and $1.53 billion in 2015.""We think that the introduction of the low-end device will better cater to the masses, so we raised our unit assumptions accordingly,"" Seyrafi said.The Hero4 Black delivers twice the performance of its best-selling predecessor and captures cine ma-quality 4K video at 30 frames per second. It also captures 1080p videos at 120 frames per second and can shoot photos with its 12-megapixel sensor. It boasts an entirely redesigned audio system that captures high-fidelity sound with twice the dynamic range of prior models, GoPro said.A second new camera, the Hero4 Silver at $399, can shoot 1080p video at 60 frames per second and 720p footage at 120fps. It's the first GoPro camera with touchscreen controls.GoPro's entry-level camera, at $129, is its cheapest yet. Hero captures high-quality 1080p video at 30fps and 720p video at 60fps. All three cameras are slated to be available starting Sunday.Supply Issues?JPMorgan analyst Paul Coster in a Friday research note called GoPro's stock overvalued. Retail checks show that the company has been dealing with sold-out products throughout the quarter, he said, indicating that demand is outstripping supply for its cameras.Seyrafi said he's not concerned about supply issues, believing GoPro has planned for a robust Q4 with contract manufacturers.GoPro sells its products in more than 100 countries and via more than 25,000 retail outlets. Sales outside of the U.S. represented 46% of revenue.GoPro has sponsored channels on YouTube, Twitter (TWTR), Instagram and Facebook (FB).

Apple's ace in the hole — a database of some 600 million worldwide iTunes users with credit card accounts — will immediately make it a formidable player, analysts say.MCX — a group of some 60 merchants led by Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) — hope to do away with the credit card transaction fees they pay to American Express, Visa and MasterCard, analysts say. MCX is expected to use an automated clearinghouse system set up by a coalition of banks to debit bank accounts or credit lines.Apple, expected to release the iPhone 6 this year, may view the credit card networks as potential allies, says Smittipon Srethapramote, a Morgan Stanley analyst. He suggests that the iPhone 6 will feature cloud-based technology to help consumers use existing credit-card accounts.The technology and business blog StarPoint speculates that Apple may use ""token authentication"" in the iPhone 6.Visa and MasterCard have endorsed HCE, or host-card emulation, which stores users' payment information in the cloud rather than in a mobile phone's hardware. Phone companies AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) have pushed a method for storing digital IDs within the SIM (subscriber identity module) card in handsets.Apple's approach may be less threatening to established industry players, Srethapramote says. Recent reports indicate that Apple could use NFC (near-field communications) in the iPhone 6, he explains. NFC is a short-range, wireless communications technology that connects smartphones with payment readers.""Several news sites (including NFC World) have cited sources that Apple was working with China UnionPay to include an NFC payment application from the latter in Passbook,"" Srethapramote said. ""If true, they would suggest Apple is making significant moves to leverage the card networks' reach to create a unique and wide-ranging payment experience within the next iteration of iOS and the next iPhone model.""RELATED: Mobile wallet technology fails to entice U.S. consumers

2027,MA,"Pandora Media (P)could see an upside ahead from political ads, but meanwhile the company is holding its own vs. rivals such as Apple and Google ahead of Q2 earnings, which Pandora will report Thursday after the close.Analysts in general expect Internet radio service Pandora to meet expectations, with increasing ad revenue driving the company's results.Pandora stock was down a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 27.FBR Capital Markets, in a research note Wednesday, maintained a market perform, or hold, rating on Pandora stock, while citing rising competition from Apple's (AAPL) purchase of Beats, Amazon.com's (AMZN) launch of Prime Streaming and Google's (GOOGL) new streaming services.""But we believe Pandora's share can remain strong because of word of mouth and positive user experience,"" wrote FBR analysts Barton Crockett, Howard Ma and Michael Gallagher. With 77 million active listeners in June, Pandora had a 70% share of the Internet radio market, and an estimated 8% of the overall radio market, according to FBR.Total listener hours for Pandora Media rose 30%, to 1.7 billion, in April vs. April 2013, and 28%, to 1.73 billion, in May, according to the company. FBR expects the company had 29% growth in total listener hours for Q2.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Corey Barrett expects Q2 revenue of $213 million to $218 million, just shy of the Wall Street consensus estimate of $218.8 million.Based on better-than-expected user and usage growth trends during the first two months of the quarter, Barrett expects total listening hours in Q2 to exceed 5 billion, above his original estimate of 4.82 billion.Barrett maintained his buy rating on Pandora stock.For the second half of the year, political advertising remains a potential upside for the Oakland, Calif.-based company, since Pandora has more than doubled its sales presence to 37 markets since the 2012 political campaign season, Barrett noted. The company is poised ""to capture a greater piece of the political radio advertising pool, which was estimated to be worth $800 million in 2012 by Borrell Associates,"" Barrett wrote.Cowen and Co. maintained its outperform rating on Pandora stock in a research note Tuesday.RELATED:Google Eyes Music Ad Market Vs.

2028,MA,"GoPro had a picture perfect Monday, unveiling three new action cameras while its stock hit a new high for the fifth straight session.The new top-of-the-line Hero4 Black will sell for $499 — $100 more than the existing Hero3 Black. But GoPro (GPRO) also introduced a $129 entry-level camera.GoPro is the leading producer of wearable and durable high-definition video cameras — the GoPro Hero series — used by surfers, bikers, skiers and other outdoor enthusiasts to record their adventures. It launched its first high-definition video camera in 2009. It also sells mountable and wearable accessories.Picture Perfect""GoPro has become a movement, with strong products and limited competition,"" said Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities. ""They don't have competitors that are at their level right now.""San Mateo, Calif.-based GoPro said it had a 45% share of the U.S. camcorder market in 2013, followed by Sony (SNE) at 24% and Canon (CAJ) at 12%. Other rivals include Garmin (GRMN). Polaroid introduced a $99 mini video camera last week. Seyrafi said various sources place GoPro consistently higher than its competitors.Seyrafi raised his price target on GoPro to 90 from 70 on Monday.GoPro spiked 11% to 90.94 on Monday. That's up 33% over the last five sessions and 279% from its late June IPO price of 24.Ambarella (AMBA), which makes chips for GoPro cameras, rose 6% to 44.45, hitting a new high. That stock is up 641% since its October 2013 IPO price at 6.In the second quarter GoPro said it shipped 854,000 cameras, up 31% a year earlier. Revenue rose 38% to $244.6 million, earning 8 cents a share, minus items.Seyrafi estimates GoPro will ship 4.43 million cameras this year, up 15% from 2013, at an average price of $284. He predicts GoPro will sell 5.4 million units in 2015. That translates to revenue of $1.26 billion this year and $1.53 billion in 2015.""We think that the introduction of the low-end device will better cater to the masses, so we raised our unit assumptions accordingly,"" Seyrafi said.The Hero4 Black delivers twice the performance of its best-selling predecessor and captures cine ma-quality 4K video at 30 frames per second. It also captures 1080p videos at 120 frames per second and can shoot photos with its 12-megapixel sensor. It boasts an entirely redesigned audio system that captures high-fidelity sound with twice the dynamic range of prior models, GoPro said.A second new camera, the Hero4 Silver at $399, can shoot 1080p video at 60 frames per second and 720p footage at 120fps. It's the first GoPro camera with touchscreen controls.GoPro's entry-level camera, at $129, is its cheapest yet. Hero captures high-quality 1080p video at 30fps and 720p video at 60fps. All three cameras are slated to be available starting Sunday.Supply Issues?JPMorgan analyst Paul Coster in a Friday research note called GoPro's stock overvalued. Retail checks show that the company has been dealing with sold-out products throughout the quarter, he said, indicating that demand is outstripping supply for its cameras.Seyrafi said he's not concerned about supply issues, believing GoPro has planned for a robust Q4 with contract manufacturers.GoPro sells its products in more than 100 countries and via more than 25,000 retail outlets. Sales outside of the U.S. represented 46% of revenue.GoPro has sponsored channels on YouTube, Twitter (TWTR), Instagram and Facebook (FB).

2100,MA,"According to conventional wisdom, you must wow customers to keep them coming back. Wrong, says Matthew Dixon. ""The role of customer service is to mitigate disloyalty by reducing customer effort,"" he wrote in ""The Effortless Experience: Conquering the New Battleground for Customer Loyalty."" What firms need to know:
"
2101,MA,"• Hit the bull's-eye. Understand that customers want what you promise. No more, no less. You might know of exceptional customer service: a concierge who goes out of his way to get your child's favorite stuffed toy back to you after it's been forgotten at the hotel; a waitress who offers free appetizers while you wait for your meal. That's all great, Dixon says. But his research shows it's not necessary.
"
2102,MA,"""Companies tend to grossly underestimate the benefit of simply meeting customer expectations,"" he wrote. ""In a world in which customer expectations are significantly inflated and seemingly on the rise all the time, what we find is that customers are in fact quite happy to simply get what was promised them.""
"
2103,MA,"• Make self-service sing. Airline kiosks that let passengers check in and get boarding passes streamline a once-tedious process. The key: Exceptional self-service options — make sure the kiosks are working and easy to use — breed customer loyalty. ""I reward those businesses that let me get back to my life as soon as I can,"" Dixon told IBD.
"
2104,MA,"Websites should be so user-friendly, customers don't have to call you unless they want to.
"
2105,MA,"• Keep the ball rolling. When you do get a phone call, know that more than half of callers have already tried your website. So you must be even faster at finding a solution. Listen to their queries and address them directly. ""The reality is that consumers are ... connected in many ways,"" said Dan Balistierri, vice president of global service at MasterCard (MA). ""Consumers want to get in and out. They've done their research.""
"
2106,MA,"What if you don't have all the answers? Don't leave them hanging. Balistierri says if MasterCard agents can't answer your question immediately, they'll ask for your contact info and set up a time to call you back. He adds that most consumers will go on several travel sites before buying. By the time they call for service, they want the transaction to be quick and simple.
"
2107,MA,"• Neutralize complaints. ""Know common problems and head them off,"" Dixon said. ""Understand how issues cluster for a customer.""
"
2108,MA,"Say a customer is calling for a replacement part for a home appliance. You know from previous calls that one replacement might not be enough, given that the part is often broken in the process. Offer to send two parts right away, says Dixon. The fewer times a customer has to call you back, the better.
"
2109,MA,"• Steer them straight. When customers call to ask about foreign driving laws, MasterCard agents know the answer, says Balistierri. ""The question might be: Do I have rental car insurance if I travel to Germany? The answer is: Yes, but in Germany they may ask you to show proof of insurance, so be prepared to show that document.""
"
2110,MA,"• Feel their pain. Top companies equip their reps to understand the emotional side of their interactions with customers. Dixon suggests using effective language to get customers to consider alternatives they didn't know existed. Rather than say you can't give them what they want, which can set them off, tell them what you can offer.

2139,MA,"Speculation that Apple's (AAPL) highly anticipated mobile payments system will feature NFC (near-field communications) technology in the upcoming iPhone 6 could lift shares of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), a maker of NFC chips.
"
2140,MA,"Morgan Stanley on Tuesday published a report stating that NXP is ""well-positioned to participate in Apple's mobile payments ecosystem"" and could garner $250 million in 2015 sales from Apple's iPhone 6.
"
2141,MA,"NXP stock was up just a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today, but NXP shares are up more than 30% in 2014.
"
2142,MA,"NFC is a short-range, wireless communications technology that connects smartphones with payment readers. Apple has yet to build NFC technology into iPhones, unlike many smartphone makers. But analysts says the upcoming iPhone 6 might include NFC technology.
"
2143,MA,"One question has been what security technologies Apple will use in the mobile payment system in tandem with NFC.
"
2144,MA,"Apple could choose a cloud-based technology that stores consumer digital IDs remotely or a specialized chip, called a ""secure element"" that would be built into the iPhone 6 along with a NFC controller chip. Another option, says Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach, would be storing consumer data in the SIM (subscriber identity module) card in smartphones provided by wireless phone companies.
"
2145,MA,"""In our base case, we assume that Apple utilizes an embedded secure element, providing an opportunity for NXP to win both the NFC controller and secure element sockets in the iPhone,"" Hettenbach wrote in the report. ""In addition, we think Apple introduces its mobile payment system in iPhones with fingerprint detection capability such as the 5S, 5c and 6. Assuming average selling prices of 75 cents each for the controller and secure element, our base-case NFC opportunity is around $250 million in sales and 25 cents in EPS for 2015.""
"
2146,MA,"In a report last week, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said: ""We are buyers of NXP given the increasing likelihood that the upcoming Apple iPhone 6 will adopt NFC. ... it remains unclear whether Apple would deploy an NFC-plus-secure element or an NFC-only solution.""
"

2148,MA,"Apple, meanwhile, could be building closer ties to credit-card companies Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and American Express (AXP) as it readies a move into the mobile payments market.Speculation that Apple's (AAPL) highly anticipated mobile payments system will feature NFC (near-field communications) technology in the upcoming iPhone 6 could lift shares of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), a maker of NFC chips.Morgan Stanley on Tuesday published a report stating that NXP is ""well-positioned to participate in Apple's mobile payments ecosystem"" and could garner $250 million in 2015 sales from Apple's iPhone 6.NXP stock was up just a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today, but NXP shares are up more than 30% in 2014.NFC is a short-range, wireless communications technology that connects smartphones with payment readers. Apple has yet to build NFC technology into iPhones, unlike many smartphone makers. But analysts says the upcoming iPhone 6 might include NFC technology.One question has been what security technologies Apple will use in the mobile payment system in tandem with NFC.Apple could choose a cloud-based technology that stores consumer digital IDs remotely or a specialized chip, called a ""secure element"" that would be built into the iPhone 6 along with a NFC controller chip. Another option, says Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach, would be storing consumer data in the SIM (subscriber identity module) card in smartphones provided by wireless phone companies.""In our base case, we assume that Apple utilizes an embedded secure element, providing an opportunity for NXP to win both the NFC controller and secure element sockets in the iPhone,"" Hettenbach wrote in the report. ""In addition, we think Apple introduces its mobile payment system in iPhones with fingerprint detection capability such as the 5S, 5c and 6. Assuming average selling prices of 75 cents each for the controller and secure element, our base-case NFC opportunity is around $250 million in sales and 25 cents in EPS for 2015.""In a report last week, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said: ""We are buyers of NXP given the increasing likelihood that the upcoming Apple iPhone 6 will adopt NFC. ... it remains unclear whether Apple would deploy an NFC-plus-secure element or an NFC-only solution.""Vinh added that one sign Apple may use NFC is that NFC-capable sales terminals supplied by VeriFone (PAY) have recently been deployed in Apple's own stores.Apple, meanwhile, could be building closer ties to credit-card companies Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and American Express (AXP) as it readies a move into the mobile payments market.

Alibaba's market value is estimated at $168 billion, bigger than 95% of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index — and the most valuable Internet company after Google (GOOGL), according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The company is looking to sell a 12% stake, people familiar with the matter have said, which would make the offering $20 billion based on the estimated value, topping a $19.65 billion offering by Visa (V) in 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show.With Monday's filing, Alibaba begins a process that will take several months before it becomes a publicly traded company and involve revisions to the document and meetings with investors during a formal roadshow, after which a price for the shares will be set.

2221,MA,"IPO Market Sizzles With Alibaba AheadAlibaba is leading a $1.22 billion investment in Chinese Web-video company Youku Tudou (YOKU) that will give China's e-commerce leader and an equity partner an 18.5% stake.Alibaba and Yunfeng Capital, a private equity firm founded in 2010 by Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma, will pay the equivalent of $30.50 per U.S.-traded share for about 707 million newly issued Youku shares, according to a Youku press release.Alibaba's stake will be 16.5% and Yunfeng's 2%.The deal will give Youku an influx of cash to help it monetize the Web TV series and other programs that it creates, says Tian X. Hou, an analyst at T.H. Capital in Beijing.""With Alibaba's investment, we believe YOKU can start to monetize on its traffic instead of competing for content purchase or cash,"" Hou wrote in an email.But Youku stock, which shot up nearly 6% at the open on news of the deal, quickly reversed sharply. Youku stock was down 8% in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, at an eight-month low near 22.TheStreet.com says that the decline stemmed from action taken over the weekend by the China government, which ordered that China websites remove several U.S. shows, including ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""The Good Wife."" Censorship has been an issue for some China Internet companies.Youku's TV dramas are mostly soap-opera-like programs with extended storylines. They had about 25 million average daily views in Q1, according to data from T.H. Capital. Internet users in China watching videos online jumped 83.8% last year to 247 million, according to statistics from the Chinese government.Alibaba, meanwhile, is preparing what likely will be a huge U.S. initial public offering.Alibaba has built an operating system for smart TVs, notes Josh Horwitz, a blogger at techinasia.com. The deal with Youku ""will likely allow the firm to strengthen its smart TV content in new ways,"" Horwitz wrote.Follow Kevin Shalvey on Twitter at @IBD_KShalveyRELATED: Yahoo Posts Slim Q1 Beat, Alibaba Sales Growth UptickIPO Market Sizzles With Alibaba Ahead

2237,MA,"FleetCor Technologies (FLT) emerged as one of this year's biggest winners. This is the story of how that occurred.The issuer of fuel cards to trucking companies and other commercial-vehicle fleets has more than doubled in 2013, far outpacing the S&P 500's rise for the year.As with other market winners, FleetCor's success began with great fundamentals. Profit growth has been robust and steady, ranging from 30% to 50% over the past seven quarters.Revenue growth has been similarly impressive.Pretax profit margin topped 50% the past two years.FleetCor issues fuel cards that allow commercial fleet companies to track spending and cut costs while also reducing fraudulent fuel charges. Its growth has been fueled by acquisitions and expansion into Brazil and other countries.Also, like fellow credit card stocks MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V), FleetCor is benefiting from a global shift away from cash to credit and debit cards. All three stocks are leaders in IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processor industry group, which has been highly ranked for much of the year.FleetCor's outstanding 2013 run actually began in 2012. The stock cleared the 41.40 buy point in a cup-without-handle base Aug. 15 in heavy volume.The stock started this year seeming to be overheating when it surged 10% the week of Feb. 8.Yet, FleetCor continued its advance. The stock formed a three-weeks-tight pattern, which it cleared on March 22 in huge volume (1). Its Earnings Per Share Rating was a best-possible 99 at the time, and its Accumulation/Distribution Rating was A-.On July 28, FleetCor cleared an 89.85 buy point in a flat base (2). Then, about a month later, it climbed above a 100.97 three-weeks-tight entry (3).In early October it briefly erased its gain from the 100.97 entry, piercing its 50-day line in heavy volume. Investors who had big profits on the stock could have taken that as a cue to sell. But the stock soon recovered and was again hitting new highs.That hiccup was about the only difficult period for FleetCor in 2013, making it not just one of the year's winners but also one of the easiest leading stocks to own.Currently, FleetCor is forming an irregular ascending base. The ascending base would be, however, a riskier third-stage base.

"
2353,MA,"Apple's (AAPL) push into mobile payments isn't expected to power earnings growth, analyst say. But Apple's digital wallet will likely re-energize the iOS ecosystem's cool factor, amid rising smartphone competition. That, of course, depends on how many iPhone users tap-to-pay, instead of pulling out cash or swiping credit cards in retail stores.
"
2354,MA,"Apple didn't disclose terms with credit-card companies that will support the payment system. JPMorgan speculates Apple may collect a small transaction fee, perhaps pennies, each time iPhone users wave their device to pay at check-out terminals.

But Apple's digital wallet will likely re-energize the iOS ecosystem's cool factor, amid rising smartphone competition. That, of course, depends on how many iPhone users tap-to-pay, instead of pulling out cash or swiping credit cards in retail stores.Apple didn't disclose terms with credit-card companies that will support the payment system.

Worries over credit-card security have been heightened by data thefts at Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and others.

""Apple doesn't know what you bought, where you bought it or any other details about the transaction. And the cashier doesn't even see your name.""Apple's security measures include ""TouchID"" fingerprint authentication technology to log in and verify users.

2380,MA,"Apple (AAPL) could be building closer ties to credit-card companies Visa (V), MasterCard (MA), and American Express (AXP) as it readies a move into the mobile payments market with the iPhone 6 launch. Apple's move challenges both e-Bay's (EBAY) PayPal and retail consortium MCX, Morgan Stanley says in a report.Banks, credit-card networks, wireless phone companies and Web giants such as Google (GOOGL) aim to win over consumers to ""digital wallet"" payment systems built into mobile phones. Apple's ace in the hole — a database of some 600 million worldwide iTunes users with credit card accounts — will immediately make it a formidable player, analysts say.MCX — a group of some 60 merchants led by Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) — hope to do away with the credit card transaction fees they pay to American Express, Visa and MasterCard, analysts say. MCX is expected to use an automated clearinghouse system set up by a coalition of banks to debit bank accounts or credit lines.Apple, expected to release the iPhone 6 this year, may view the credit card networks as potential allies, says Smittipon Srethapramote, a Morgan Stanley analyst. He suggests that the iPhone 6 will feature cloud-based technology to help consumers use existing credit-card accounts.The technology and business blog StarPoint speculates that Apple may use ""token authentication"" in the iPhone 6.Visa and MasterCard have endorsed HCE, or host-card emulation, which stores users' payment information in the cloud rather than in a mobile phone's hardware. Phone companies AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) have pushed a method for storing digital IDs within the SIM (subscriber identity module) card in handsets.Apple's approach may be less threatening to established industry players, Srethapramote says. Recent reports indicate that Apple could use NFC (near-field communications) in the iPhone 6, he explains. NFC is a short-range, wireless communications technology that connects smartphones with payment readers.""Several news sites (including NFC World) have cited sources that Apple was working with China UnionPay to include an NFC payment application from the latter in Passbook,"" Srethapramote said. ""If true, they would suggest Apple is making significant moves to leverage the card networks' reach to create a unique and wide-ranging payment experience within the next iteration of iOS and the next iPhone model.""RELATED: Mobile wallet technology fails to entice U.S. consumers

Also, for 2019 earnings, the consensus mark has been raised 4% to $7.28.Strong Earnings Growth Prospects: The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.31 for 2018 earnings reflects a year-over-year surge of 37.8%. Moreover, the metric is projected to register 15.4% increase in 2019.Growth Drivers: A series of acquisitions made by the company in recent years should complement its organic growth.The company’s revenues witnessed an impressive CAGR of 11% during the 2012-2017 period. The same was up 31% in the first quarter. We believe that the company should retain its revenue momentum in the coming quarters, riding high on its strong market position and a profitable core business, which continues to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements and an expansion of service offerings.International markets (Asia-Pacific, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East) provide both growth and diversification benefits to Mastercard. These markets have potential to generate growth over the coming years, led by a shift toward card usage and higher consumer spending. Moreover, these markets remain less penetrated than U.S. markets.The company’s strong international business has led to an increase in cross-border volume growth for the past several quarters (21% in the first quarter of 2018, 13% in 2017, 12% in 2016) and we expect this trend to continue in the going ahead .The company’s consistent investment in technology also positions it well in a rapidly shifting payments space. It includes investment in Artificial intelligence, blockchain, tokenization, biometrics and much more.Strong Balance Sheet: Mastercard boasts a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility and a continuous cashflow from operating activities. Its disciplined capital management strategy by way of share buyback and dividend payments remains impressive. We believe the company will continue to generate favorable cash from operations owing to its expandingbusiness volumes. Its robust capital position enables it to pursue acquisitions, which have already ramped up its inorganic growth profile.Strong and Growing ROE: Mastercard’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) of 92% remains significantly higher than the industry’s 39% average. This, is turn, reinforces its growth potential. The figure also reflects the company’s tactical efficiency in using shareholders’ funds. Moreover, the company’s ROE has grown steadily over a period of five years.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther stocks worth considering from the space include WEX Inc. (WEX  -  Free Report), Evertec, Inc. (EVTC  -  Free Report) and Total System Services Inc. (TSS  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2423,MA,"Liquidity of a stock is an important yardstick that investors often ignore. It primarily indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents.These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that a company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Growth Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 11.Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screen:Sunnyvale, CA-based Mellanox Technologies Ltd.

The global acquisition strategy increases Clean Harbors’ customer base by providing a long-term growth profitable platform.Efficiency Initiatives  Clean Harbors continues to focus on improving its efficiency and lowering operating costs through advanced technology, process efficiencies and stringent cost management. In 2017, the company managed internalization of maintenance costs, procurement and supply chain improvements, headcount reductions and branch consolidations to improve efficiency. Additionally, it eyes strategic investment in businesses, which are likely to increase productivity.Shareholder-Friendly MovesWe are impressed with Clean Harbors’ consistent record of returning value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.

2430,MA,"Shares of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $139.45 on Jun 12, the company’s 2018 investor day, before closing a tad lower at $139.30.The company’s shares have charted a solid trajectory in recent times, appreciating over 46.8% year to date, ahead of the industry’s gain of 2.6%. Notably, the company has witnessed a 14.1% rise in share price since it posted strong third-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Let’s find out what’s supporting the rally.Transformation Initiatives ADP boasts a strong business model, high recurring revenues, good margins, robust client retention and low capital expenditure. The company has a strong pipeline of new business bookings. It continues to innovate, improve operations and invest in its ongoing transformation efforts. As a part of its transformation initiative, ADP has recently launched differentiated ""Next Gen"" platforms aimed at strengthening its position in HCM innovation, and improving its U.S. up-market and international product suite.ADP’s other notable and recent transformation-related achievements include accelerated DataCloud penetration, increased investment in inside sales, mid-market migrations, service alignment initiatives and voluntary early retirement program.On its Investor Day, ADP stated its plans to expand its ongoing transformation through several broad-based initiatives. These include Go-To-Market Initiatives like data-enabled market insights and streamlined support, Service Initiatives encompassing automated service enabler tools and optimized service locations, Product & Portfolio Initiatives including ongoing client upgrades and infrastructure optimization, and Operations & Support Initiatives such as procurement and pay-for-performance programs.Transformation initiatives are allowing the company to expand margins and improve innovation abilities.Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

Continuing with its strategy of returning cash to shareholders, the company paid dividend of $995 million and repurchased stocks worth $1.26 billion during fiscal 2017.We believe that the strong balance sheet will not only help the company to continue shareholder friendly activities but also pursue strategic acquisitions and investments on product development in the long run. The dividend hike announced by the company in April 2018 highlights ADP's commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial position.

2432,MA,"The month of July is looking to be a cheerful one for the Wall Street. While the first trading day of July has been largely bullish so far this century, the entire month has also successfully bucked the historical trend of seasonal weakness over the past five years.Stocks are, at the same time, expected to be firmer heading into July after President Trump dropped plans of imposing a hard-hitting policy that would curb Chinese investments in the United States. Beijing also relaxed some foreign investment restrictions, ebbing trade-related concerns at least for the time being. Given such bullishness, investing in sound stocks that can make the most of the upward journey seems prudent.First Trading Day of July: The Most Bullish Day of the Year for StocksHistorically, the first trading day of July is the most bullish for the S&P 500 index since the beginning of the new century. This year, that’s July 2. The ‘win’ rate for the S&P during the first trading day of July so far this century is 83%. The win rate for the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq are 77.77% and 72.22%, respectively. So, the S&P is a clear winner and the broader indexes’ average return for that particular day is 0.35%.This promising seasonality trend has encouraged investors to take long positions ahead of Jul 2. After all, the best trading day comes at a seasonally weak period of the year, better known as the summer stagnation. The summer rally is always the weakest of all seasonal rallies. In fact, in mid-term election years, it gets worse. The S&P doesn’t get going until October. Keep in mind, 2018 is a mid-term election year.July Ranks Among the Best Months of the Year for StocksThe first half of July also, somehow, tends to be mildly bullish, and often hosts a brief summer rally. Lest we forget, July has been the fifth-best month of the year for the S&P. The benchmark index has typically gained 1% on average, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac. Statistics have shown that over the last 67 years, July has been positive 42 times for the S&P.By the way, the historical trends embodied by the phrase “sell in May and go away” or the stretch between the start of May and the end of October have been a seasonally weak period for the market in the long term, but, that trend hasn’t held in the last five years, according to the WSJ Market Data Group.There’s No Sign of a Bear MarketThe S&P, in the meanwhile, has been in the correction territory ever since February. As of Jun 28, the broader gauge has been in correction for 98 trading days, the longest since the financial crisis in 2008. The S&P has failed to hit new record highs, which would have been needed for the index to exit the correction territory.Such a range bound trading for months was mostly due to the inconsistent trade policy and shifting opinions over whether tensions between the United States and its major trading partners are escalating. President Trump has been, for some time, embroiled in a trade conflict with China and is also mired in trade spats with the European Union, Mexico and Canada.But, the biggest challenge is China. More than 800 Chinese exports, worth $34 billion, will be subject to tariffs starting July and another 280 or so will go through a public comment period and take effect later. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on additional $400 billion more of goods imported from China. The Asian nation, in return, vowed to oppose trade protectionism and unilateralism.Trump, however, has recently dropped plans of imposing new restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States. In fact, the Trump administration adopted a less confrontational approach with the world’s second-largest economy and seeks cooperation with the Congress.Trump took the decision after his administration cautioned that the new restrictions would affect the economy. Any escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China could be very disruptive. It could even lead to a full-blown recession and eventually squeeze corporate profits. This has provided the much needed boost to the broader markets ahead of July, with the S&P showing signs of renewed strength.5 Best Stocks to Buy Before Jul 2Banking on such encouraging seasonal trends and positive developments on the geopolitical front, the broader S&P is poised to scale north. We have, thus, selected five stocks that can make the most of this uptrend.

2433,MA,"Outsourcing is the practice of handling over the control of certain operations, services or processes (which were previously done by the company’s internal staff and resources) to external resources or third-party contractors. A company may choose to outsource its operations for several reasons such as to reduce and control operating costs, increase focus on its core business competencies, thereby improving efficiency, strengthening its market share and getting access to better external resources. To avoid government rules and regulations, outsourcing is also adopted.Per a report by statista, the global outsourcing industry generated $88.9 billion in revenues in 2017. The outsourcing trends are expected to be more favorable going ahead in 2018 on a worldwide basis.Despite multiple tailwinds, outsourcing services have certain disadvantages. Companies need to constantly negotiate terms with their third-party contractors to enjoy easy services. At times, third-party vendors need to access the company’s internal data for proper functioning and this is where the security factor comes in. Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Outsourcing Services stock — Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) and Automatic Data Processing Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report). Both the stocks are part of the broader Business Services sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). While Broadridge has a market capitalization of $13.71 billion, Automatic Data Processing’s market cap is $61.36 billion.Zacks Rank & Style ScoreCurrently, both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, with an VGM Score of B, Broadridge enjoys an edge over ADP in terms investment attractiveness. ADP has a VGM Score of C. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Price PerformanceBroadridge clearly scores over ADP, considering its price performance in a year’s time. Shares of Broadridge have gained 54.6%, outperforming the S&P 500’s and industry’s rally of 13.7% and 25.2%, respectively. ADP has gained 37.6%, underperforming both the S&P 500 Composite and the industry. Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.ADP’s current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 38.5% compared with 9.9% for Broadridge.  However, for full-year 2018, the situation is just the opposite with ADP’s expected earnings growth rate of 16.8% being lower than Broadridge’s growth rate of 34.5%.For 2019, ADP’s earnings are expected to register 12% growth compared with 6.9% for Broadridge. Moreover, the long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11.3% for ADP is higher than Broadridge’s growth rate of 10%.While Broadridge’s earnings are expected to grow higher than ADP in 2018, the situation is expected to reverse in 2019 and the long term.Earnings Estimate Revisions The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Based on the earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and full-year 2018 and 2019, in the last 60 days, ADP appears to be more favorably placed.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings improved 9.8% for ADP against a decrease of 2.1% for Broadridge.For 2018, the consensus estimate improved 4.3% for ADP and 4.2% for Broadridge. Estimates for 2019 moved up 3.4% for ADP and 2% for Broadridge.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock’s performance in the previous quarters.Broadridge and ADP have an impressive earning surprise history, with their earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters.However, Broadridge enjoys an edge over ADP as it delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 23.6% as against 5.2% for the latter.Net MarginNet profit margin helps investors evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.With a TTM net margin of 13.6%, ADP not only compares favorably with the industry’s figure of 11.8% but also has a lead over Broadridge’s 9.4% TTM net margin. Broadridge does not compare favorably with the industry in terms of TTM net margin.ValuationThe Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Broadridge and ADP is 28.8 and 34.2, respectively, while that of the industry is 28.3. Although both the companies are overvalued relative to the industry, Broadridge has an edge with a lower P/E ratio. The EV/EBITDA metric is used to compare two stocks within the same industry and offers a clearer picture of a company’s valuation because it includes debt. The ratio is often used in addition to the P/E ratio.We observe that while Broadridge and ADP have EV/EBITDA ratios of 16.3 and 21.0, respectively, the industry’s figure stands at 13.6. Although both the companies compare unfavorably with the industry, Broadridge is better positioned with a lower EV/EBITDA value. Though both the stocks look overvalued relative to the industry, Broadridge is undervalued compared to ADP.ROE and ROCReturn on Equity (ROE) is the measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. The trailing 12-month ROE for Broadridge and ADP is 45.3% and 45.7%, respectively, while that of the industry is 34.7%. Although both the companies clearly score above the industry, ADP is a better choice than Broadridge with a higher ROE. Return on Capital (ROC) for Broadridge and ADP is 21.3% and 30.4%, respectively, while the industry’s ROC stands at 22.9%. This implies that ADP generates a higher return on investment than its industry.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Broadridge is superior than ADP when considering price performance, valuation and earnings history. ADP scores over Broadridge in terms of net margin, long-term expected earnings growth, earnings estimate revisions, return on capital and equity.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report), FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (FLT  -  Free Report) and WEX Inc. (WEX  -  Free Report). While Mastercard sports a Zacks Rank #1, FLEETCOR Technologies and WEX carry a Zacks Rank #2.The long-term expected earnings per share growth rate for Mastercard, FLEETCOR Technologies and WEX is 19%, 16.5% and 14.3%, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

(MA  -  Free Report) has been picked by Diebold Nixdorf, a world leader in driving connected commerce, to enhance consumers’ experience at ATMs.Mastercard will be providing two services — Mastercard Cash Pick-Up and Cardless ATM — to make withdrawal from ATMs easier.These services will do away consumers’ requirement of holding any bank account and carrying any card for that matter.Mastercard Cash Pick-Up allows any authenticated consumer, whether having a bank account or not, to avail cash via ATMs. This service will help unbanked customers to enjoy the benefits of ATMs. At the same time, ATM operators and financial institutions stand to gain from increased transaction which would translate into increased business volumes and consequently revenue growth.Another service by Mastercard — Cardless ATM (as the name implies) — allows banked customers to use ATMs without their cards. Via mobile banking application, accountholders will be able to withdraw cash, by just moving through the authentication process. These transactions hold additional attractiveness given their very secured nature. Since these transactions will be done on banking apps via phone and cloud, customers’ credentials will not be exposed for hacking and fraud. Thus security, transparency and convenience offered by the Cardless ATM are expected to make this service a superhit.These services by Mastercard are the next wave of digital products to the ATM channel aimed at driving innovation. Given the increased usage of mobile phones in our everyday lives from making online purchases, bill payments, online banking and much more, this technology is now being applied to ATMs to make cash transactions easy for consumers. In essence, mobile payment methods hold the centre stage in the redesigning of traditional ATMs to one that can provide innovative services as per changing needs.Mastercard senses huge opportunity in mobile technology and the recent pact is in sync with the company’s goal of making it big in this burgeoning space.In a year’s time the stock has gained 57% outperforming the industry’s growth of 35%.Another company in the same space Visa Inc.

2436,MA,"The thriving U.S. economy should benefit Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report). Favorable factors like record low unemployment rate, strong customer confidence, steady wage growth and financial flexibility in consumer hands from a reduced tax rate bode well for business growth at this payment and network processor company.Most recent data on retail sales for April showed that the value of sales inched up 0.3%, matching the median forecast after a 0.8% rise in March. April retail sales hinted at firm consumer demand as fatter paychecks more than offset the effect of rising fuel costs.The recent positive sales trend is expected to continue as consumer reliance on the company remains sturdy amid a progressing U.S. economy.     These developments  augur well for Visa with fast digital transformation in shopping and an increase in usage of credit and debit cards for making payment for purchases. Revenue growth for Visa is directly proportional to its consumer spending level. The same is reflected in the company’s results for the first half of fiscal 2018, which witnessed an 11% year-over-year rise in net revenues to $9.9 billion. This upside mirrored consistent growth in processed transactions, nominal payments volume as well as nominal cross-border volume.In a year's time, the stock has gained 36% compared with the industry's growth of 33%.Per Visa’s second-quarter fiscal report, its payments volume on a constant dollar basis expanded 11%, driven by a strong global economy. U.S. payments volume grew on the back of strength across retail and every day spend segments as well as continued solid growth in travel categories.Another company in the same space — Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report) — experiences overall growth from low employment, healthy consumer confidence and robust retail spending. Its U.S. Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) in the first quarter (which measures the aggregate amount of purchases made with Mastercard’s branded cards) extended 10%, up 1% from fourth quarter and was made up of Credit and Debit growth of 9% and 12%, respectively.Zacks Rank and Key PicksVisa carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2439,MA,"Headline worthy initial public offerings have been few and far between recently, and a few major tech companies have grabbed much of the IPO spotlight so far this year, including Spotify SPOT and Dropbox DBX. With that said, June could end up being the busiest month for IPOs in a long time, and this week is packed once again.Recent IPOsSpotify stock closed its first day of trading in early April at a price that valued the company at $26.5 billion, which helped it land as the eighth-largest tech IPO after one day of trading, directly behind Google and (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report). Aside from Spotify and Dropbox, Docusign Inc DOCU and Smartsheet SMAR were a few other notable 2018 tech IPOs.Meanwhile, many investors have been looking forward to IPOs from Uber and Airbnb. But those industry-changing tech companies look poised to wait until at least 2019 to go public—although Uber rival Lyft could reportedly go public in late 2018.Since the start of June, 22 companies have gone public, with 12 more expected to IPO this week. In fact, if all the planned initial public offerings are completed this week, it would be the busiest IPO month since June 2015, according to Renaissance Capital. So let’s take a look at a few of the bigger IPOs expected this week and quickly break down what the companies do.BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) - Deal Size: $600 million Exchange: NYSEBJ’s Wholesale is a membership-based grocery chain that operates over 200 stores across the East Coast, competing against the likes of Costco (COST  -  Free Report). The company was taken private by Leonard Green & Partners LP and CVC Capital Partners Ltd in 2011 for roughly $2.8 billion.BJ’s Wholesale reported annual sales of $12.75 billion last year and turned in a profit of $50.3 million. The company is set to go public amid changing times for the grocery industry. Yet, the talk of doom and gloom seems to have calmed down for the time being since Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Kroger KR have all proven their ability to fight back against likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) (also read: Should You Buy Grocery Stocks, WMT, COST, TGT, After Kroger's Strong Quarter?).The company’s IPO is expected to be priced between $15 per share and $17 per share, offering 37.5 million shares. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC  -  Free Report) is one of the lead underwriters.BrightView Holdings (BV) - Deal Size: $501 million Exchange: NYSEBrightView is a Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania-based commercial landscaping design and maintenance services company, which operates mostly in the U.S. BrightView works in an array of fields, including water management, golf, sports turf, snow and ice removal, and many more.Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) is the lead underwriter for the company that plans to list 21.3 million shares at between estimated $22 per share and $25 per share.Domo (DOMO) Deal Size: $189 million Exchange: NasdaqDomo (DOMO) is one of the most highly anticipated IPOs this week, mostly because of its one-time standing as a unicorn company—a private startup valued at over billion dollars. However, its valuation has plummeted 75% from its last funding round. Domo noted that the middle of its IPO pricing is expected to be $20.50 per share.Domo is a company that investors might want to pay close attention to over the first couple of months as its real-time business data analytics software competes against the likes IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report). The Utah-based company’s clients include Mastercard MA and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report). The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2448,MA,"Retail stocks have been the best market performers so far in 2018, handily outpacing the S&P 500.  The industry is up 20% year to date versus 6% for the S&P and some of the best performers, like Amazon (AMZN), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) are up even more.In a blockbuster Q1 earnings season, one retail stock after another reported better-than expected revenues in an environment of low unemployment and Consumer Confidence at an 18-month high.Most of those increased sales have one thing in common – electronic payment. Approximately 67% of in-person sales and virtually 100% of online transactions are made with a credit or debit card. Consumers increasingly prefer the convenience and security of electronic transactions for large purchases all the way down to a cup of coffee.In the shift toward an essentially cashless economy, one big winner is the company who process electronic payments and transfers.Priceless GrowthMastercard (MA  -  Free Report) has been offering credit card processing services for issuing banks since 1966 – way back when credit card transactions happened on those sliding carbon-copy machines.  Originally organized as a cooperative of issuing banks, Mastercard went public in 2006 as an independent transaction processor.Mastercard now has gross sales of $15 billion a year and reported record results in Q1 with gross sales of $3.6B and earnings of $1.50/share, increases of 31% and 49% respectively over the same quarter in 2017. It was the 17th quarter in a row that Mastercard exceeded the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate and 16 subsequent upward revisions now have the consensus for full year 2018 at $6.31/share, an increase of 37% over 2017.  MA is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Payment Solutions for EnterpriseWex Inc (WEX  -  Free Report) provides electronic payment solutions for businesses in three general areas: Fleet Services, Employee Travel and Healthcare. WEX partners with both the customers who utilize the company’s innovative virtual payment solutions and the vendors who provide the goods and services being purchased, using economies of scale to reduce transaction costs.WEX provides detailed information, insights and control over spending, allowing customers to manage costs and reduce paperwork.WEX has also invested in distributed ledger technology especially as it relates to crypto-currencies. Though Bitcoin and other cryptos are not yet widely used for everyday transactions, if they gain favor in the future, WEX will be ready to process payments - and likey one of the leaders in the iindustry.Thanks to steadily growing revenues and earnings, WEX shares have risen 36% in 2018. WEX is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Cash is not DeadAlthough an increasing amount of payments are performed electronically, cash is not dead yet, as many consumers and merchants continue to prefer currency for transactions. Especially when traveling, millions of customers rely on ATM machines for ready cash and operators get paid a fee on every withdrawal.Cardtronics Plc (CATM  -  Free Report) is the world’s largest operator of ATMs, with 230,000 machines in 10 countries processing over 2.6 billion transactions per year. Their customers include large financial institutions like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), TD (TD) and Santander (SOV.C) as well as merchants including Target, Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report).With a history of positive earnings surprises, CATM posted a big earnings beat in Q1, reporting $0.46/share versus estimates of $0.26/share.Cardtronics is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Although new technologies are a lot more interesting to talk about, sometimes the biggest and best company is finding the opportunities for big earnings in the “old” space. Cardtronics certainly has found them in ATMs.  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.

2449,MA,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about Navigant Consulting, Inc. (NCI  -  Free Report), a stock that has rallied 22.3% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 2.9%. We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s strong segmental growth as well as benefits from acquisitions and hiring. The long-term expected earnings per share growth rate for the company is 13.5%.Let’s delve deep to unearth the reasons behind the company’s impressive price performance.Consistent Segmental GrowthNavigant’s investments in acquisition and hiring strengthened its Healthcare and Energy segment over time. Meanwhile, the demand for data analytics in healthcare across all markets has been increasing, given the access to new data as a result of the Affordable Care Act and new technologies.Also, acquisition of Cymetrix and RevenueMed has extended Navigant’s business process management service capabilities to hospitals and physician groups. These buyouts and related hiring complement the company’s traditional consulting services, besides providing it with more recurring revenue streams.Furthermore, the company has broadened its service offerings and expanded operations in important markets and geographies. Navigant has also grown its benchmarking, data and research services to offer a broad range of market research capabilities. In 2016, it acquired Ecofys Investments B.V., which proved conducive to the company. This buyout is helping Navigant to enhance its capacities in energy policy, energy systems and markets, urban energy, climate strategies and sustainability services.Navigant’s Disputes, Forensics and Legal Technology segment has strengthened over time backed by its continuous efforts to enhance services and expand global reach. Additionally, the Financial Services Advisory and Compliance segment has grown through senior hiring.Consistent Investment in TechnologyNavigant’s continuous investments in technology infrastructure and development programs should help in boosting its business organically. Technology investments are augmenting the company’s technology-based service offerings, thus enabling it to efficiently meet the changing demands of its clients.Development programs are aimed toward improving sales effectiveness and collaboration across the organization. Navigant’s other focus areas include employee development, talent management and mentoring programs.Bottom LineConsistent investments in technology, acquisitions and hiring are adding to Navigant’s ability to grow its business organically, thus making us confident about the stock’s performance. Zacks Rank and Key PicksNavigant has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report), Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) andBroadridge Financial Solutions Inc.

Further, Cappuccino has already conducted digital campaigns for several top local and multinational organizations in Brazil, with clients like Ajinomoto, Arcor, Boeringher Ingelheim and Citi.With broader exposure to the Brazilian market, the buyout of Cappuccino should help Weber Shandwick strengthen its foothold across Latin America. Of late, Weber Shandwick has been busy in expanding its operations in Latin America to meet the growing demand from domestic and multinational companies in the region. It already has owned and operated offices in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico and affiliates in Argentina, Chile and Peru. In March 2018, it opened a new office in Bogota, Colombia.Digital EfficacyBased on the strong demand for its digital and marketing services, Weber Shandwick's parent organization - Interpublic is focused on strengthening its position with new business activities as well as opportunities from existing and new clients. Moreover, it continues to look for strategic investments/acquisitions to expand in high-growth regions and key world markets.A digital marketing agency based in the United States and an independent media agency and digital consultancy based in Finland were acquired in 2017. In 2016, a content creation and digital agency with offices in the United States and United Kingdom., a public relations and digital agency based in China and a U.K. based mobile focused digital agency were acquired.We believe the buyout of Cappuccino by its subsidiary is one of Interpublic’s several strategic business opportunities to boost its digital capabilities.Interpublic’s digital capabilities, diversified business model and geographic reach offer a distinctive competitive advantage.

2451,MA,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we focus on Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report), a stock with an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 5.8%. Moreover, its earnings are expected to register 10.8% and 7.4% growth, respectively, in 2018 and 2019.The company has outperformed the S&P 500 in the past six months. Shares of Omnicom have gained 7.4% compared with the S&P 500’s rally of 4.9% in the said time frame. We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s higher organic growth and benefits from strategic investments, acquisitions and expansion efforts.Robust Organic GrowthWe appreciate Omnicom’s continuous focus on its internal development initiatives. To increase efficiency, the company has been making internal investments in its agencies and back office operations. It has also raised its internal investments in data, analytics and precision marketing. Driven by such positives, we expect Omnicom to witness higher revenues on the back of organic growth.Notably, in first-quarter 2018, organic growth resulted in a 2.4% increase in total revenues. It marked an improvement from 1.6% organic growth in fourth-quarter 2017. Further, the company expects organic growth to positively impact revenues by 2-3% in 2018.Growing Digital and Analytical CapabilitiesOmnicom is expanding its suite in the areas of digital and analytical capabilities by investing in agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies in key markets.On Apr 16, 2018, Omnicom’s media services division, Omnicom Media Group announced a partnership with IRI. Per the deal, IRI will serve as a preferred consumer packaged goods (CPG) data provider for Omnicom Media Group’s data and analytics division, Annalect. In Germany, Omnicom media group acquired Brain Group, a digitally-focused agency for media planning, marketing and transformation consulting and content creation.Omnicom’s operations are diversified across technology platforms, thus lowering its dependence on any one product in these dynamic technological markets. The company’s efforts to stay technologically updated to meet varying customer and client demands in areas of digital media, data as well as analytics look impressive. All these initiatives augur well for the long-term growth and stability of the company.Encouraging Balance SheetManagement has executed well in the recent times. This has helped Omnicom build cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance of $3.79 billion in 2017. The company’s cash position has improved considerably in the past few years. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company had $3.02 billion, $2.62 billion and $2.39 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively.The company generated $2.02 billion of cash from operating activities in 2017 compared with $1.95 billion in 2016. The significant amount of cash provides it the flexibility to pursue any growth strategy. The company’s strong cash flow generating abilities make it a value buy for investors.Shareholder-Friendly MovesWe are impressed with Omnicom’s consistent record of returning value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. Omnicom paid dividends of $515.2 million, $505.4 million and $496.7 million to its shareholders, respectively in 2017, 2016 and 2015. The company repurchased shares amounting to $568.4 million, $602.2 million and $727.5 million, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the period from 2008 through Mar 31, 2018, Omnicom distributed 106% of net income to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Such moves indicate the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These shareholder-friendly initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Bottom LineThe aforementioned factors positively impacted Omnicom’s performance in the last reported quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 3.2%. We believe the upbeat performance will continue in the quarters ahead, thus giving investors enough reasons to remain optimistic on the stock. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings is pegged at $1.57, indicating year-over-year growth of 12.1%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Omnicom has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(CAR  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, after market close.The top line is expected to benefitfrom strong volume growth, stringent cost-cutting initiatives coupled with increased efficiency in business.

2454,MA,"There is a big conundrum wrapped up inside this Global Week Ahead.Isn’t it provocative?To hold ‘live ammo’ central bank meetings across the developing world — and in Brexit England — while the world’s major developed country central bank heads enjoy a summer meeting on the coast of Portugal?The former group of countries (Brazil, Mexico, Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand and Hungary) is under major currency stress. This is imposed, in part, by the latter’s (the ECB, the U.S. Fed and Japan’s) changing stance on its extraordinary monetary policy stimulus decisions.Here are Reuters’ five big themes likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders in the coming week.I listed the underlying factors in order of importance to global equity markets.(1) The “Submerging” Developing Markets Hold Central Bank MeetingsBrazil, Mexico, Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand and Hungary all have central bank meetings this week.With the U.S. dollar crashing through emerging market currencies like a wrecking ball right now, what the banks do and what they say will be important.Reuters’ polls show they are all expected to hold their fire for now, although there is an outside chance that Mexico and the Philippines could pull surprise hikes. That means it will mostly be about the rhetoric and who might be preparing to move.Brazil's markets are pricing 2.5 percentage points worth of hikes between now and this time next year. Mexico sees around 75 basis points. Thailand and Taiwan may point to one or two hikes later in the year, and even Hungary's central bank is expected to ditch its dovish tones in the wake of a sharp fall in the forint.(2) A Big Developed Country Central Bank Confab Happens in PortugalOn Monday, a three-day ECB forum on central banking kicks off in Sintra, Portugal, but under a very different backdrop to last year's summit.The ECB has warned markets it will end its bond-buying program by the end of the year, but it has also pledged to keep rates low possibly until after summer 2019. That has cheered bond and stock markets no end, but less so the euro.Rewind to a year ago when ECB chief Mario Draghi told the folks gathered at Sintra that deflationary forces had been replaced by inflationary ones, putting markets on alert for tweaks in the ultra-loose policy.Yet with the end of ECB QE now in sight, a taper tantrum along the lines of last year's appears to have been avoided. Italian bonds have just enjoyed their best week since September 2012. But Sintra speakers will still be listened to because any signs of a European growth setback could complicate the QE exit path. Next Friday's ""flash"" Eurozone PMI data for June may also provide some insight on this front.More generally, Sintra is a big central banking shindig: alongside Draghi will be the Bank of Japan's Kuroda and the U.S. Federal Reserve's Jerome Powell. All three have had their moment in the spotlight in the past week at their central bank meetings.But another big-name governor — the Bank of England's Mark Carney — is not scheduled to speak. His bank holds a policy meeting next Thursday, though it is not expected to change interest rates.(3) On Thursday, U.S. Fed Bank Stress Tests Come OutIn June 2017, when U.S. banks cleared the Federal Reserve's annual stress test, their shares surged as the results unleashed a massive round of stock buybacks and dividend increases.Don't look for the same outcome this week when the 2018 vintage is released.The largest U.S. banks have notably underperformed their smaller, regional rivals so far in 2018, and even if some do get more cushion to increase their capital return programs, few analysts believe that will be enough to put them back in the lead.A flattening yield curve and underwhelming loan growth are among the big culprits weighing on the performance of large banks, and that doesn't look like it's changing anytime soon.The latest Fed data on commercial and industrial loan growth shows smaller banks holding a greater-than-4-percentage-point lead over large banks in that key lending category. Small bank C&I loan growth is up 6.7 percent year over year, while for the biggest banks it is just 2.4 percent.And the Treasury yield curve — a key indicator of bank net interest margins — has flattened further since the Fed's latest rate hike. The spread between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields is below 40 basis points and the narrowest in nearly 11 years.(4) An OPEC Meeting Happens. They Review Their Production AgreementOPEC and its oil allies meet in Vienna on Friday and Saturday this week, to review their production agreement.U.S. President Donald Trump has again been blaming the group for rising oil prices — they are up almost 60 percent over the last year — so the political pressure is on to pump more.The big producers are divided, though. While Russia is pushing for a significant output hike, Saudi Arabia favors a modest one. Others, like Iran, Iraq and Venezuela, want no change at all.Most oil watchers do expect an increase, however, before the end of the year. Negotiations should therefore center on the scale, timing and phasing of any output boost. Also key will be whether it is agreed by the entire group or implemented by Saudi Arabia and Russia without wider backing.(5) Turkey Has June 24th ElectionsSeveral things are complicating life for Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan before the June 24th elections.Hoping to use a beefed-up presidency to tighten his grip on the economy and monetary policy, Erdogan is finding he may not win in the first round after all. What's more, the AK party could even lose its parliamentary majority.Second, the lira is heading rapidly back to record lows despite 425 bps in interest rate rises. With the Fed propelling the dollar higher, the lira's woes might continue. Its weakness will certainly exacerbate double-digit inflation. On economic growth — which Erdogan touts as one of the triumphs of his 15-year tenure — there are warnings.Data shows Turkish growth running at 7.4 percent, making it one of the world's fastest-growing economies. But borrowing costs have soared, with the government paying almost 16 percent for 10-year cash in local bond markets, up 500 bps since the end of 2017.That could hint at a sharp slowdown because the growth bonanza hinges largely on credit, which is expanding around 20 percent year-on-year. Indeed, Turkey's highly indebted companies and banks may already have run into trouble. For Erdogan, a self-declared ""enemy of interest rates,” it could mean accepting more rate rises and slower growth. First though, he needs to win the election — at least in the second round.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—(1) Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report): It’s an $832B stock now.

2455,MA,"Retail sales increased in April, driven by wage growth, increased financial flexibility owing to the recent tax reform and a record-low unemployment rate.Details from Commerce Department revealed that retail sales improved 4.7% in April. This was driven by an increase in receipts at gasoline stations as well as sales at clothing & clothing accessories, furniture and home furnishing, food and beverage stores, and building material. This was the second straight month of increase in sales after muted  performance in January and February, which was basically driven by the halt in spending by consumers due to a delay in tax refunds.Nevertheless, the recent positive sales trend is expected to continue as consumer confidence stays strong, amid a thriving U.S. economy.     These developments bode well for the payment and network processors, with digital transformation in shopping and increase in usage of cards for making payments for purchases. Revenue growth for companies in this industry is directly proportional to the level of consumer spending. Therefore it makes good sense to invest in stocks from this space.Let us look at some of the factors which would act as catalysts to for the industry’s growth:Strong Consumer ConfidenceThe Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, which measures consumers’ attitude to current and short-term economic conditions (next six months), rose in April, following a decline in March. The index now stands at 128.7, up from 127.0 in March.What underlies the surge in the index is consumers’ belief that the cadence of growth witnessed recently will continue. This has led consumers to use their savings to make purchases. This surely is a welcome sign for payment and network, which are the end beneficiaries of rising consumer spending and confidence.Higher Gasoline Prices to Increase Spending on CardsProduction cuts by OPEC, elevated demand and geo political tensions fueled an increase in the price of oil. Gasoline prices are expected to remain at elevated levels now that President Trump has withdrawn the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and imposed tougher sanctions on Theran.Payment processors and card companies like Visa, Mastercard, American Express gain on an increase in gasoline prices because of the higher transaction amount spent each time the card is swiped. Moreover Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report), Mastercard, American Express branded cards provides rewards in the form of rebates to the card holders on gas purchases, thus defraying a part of their oil bill. Owing to the lucrative rebates these cards are greatly used at pumping stations, which in turn increases the business volume for card companies, processers and payment networks.Since oil price is set to move northward, we expect the trend to continue to favor the stocks in this space.Upside From Tax ReformThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act should be a positive for the financial services industry. A reduction in the tax rate has provided businesses with an increased capacity to invest, and consumers will have more disposable income to splurge on purchases.Corporations are making several focused investments that build on their long-standing commitment to strengthen their business, support its people, while continuing to provide strong capital returns to its shareholders.One of the industry leaders Mastercard Inc. has on its agenda additional investments in its center for inclusive growth, which it launched back in 2014 as a way to focus its data, expertise, technology and philosophic investments to support inclusive growth. Visa has plans to make strategic investments in the areas of digital products, technology operations and merchant solutions.Network and Payment Processors Set to GainA thriving economy is favoring the payment and the network processors Visa in its fiscal second quarter disclosed that its payments volume on a constant dollar basis grew 11%, driven by a strong global economy. U.S. payments volume grew led by strength across retail and every day spend segments as well as continued strong growth in travel categories.Another major company, Mastercard, said that it is witnessing overall growth from low employment, healthy consumer confidence and strong retail spending. Its U.S. Gross Dollar Volume (GDV), (which measures the aggregate amount of purchases made with Mastercard’s branded cards) grew 10%, up 1% from last quarter, and was made up of Credit and Debit growth of 9% and 12%, respectively.The financial transaction services industry has indeed put up a good show rising 38% in a year’s time more than double the S&P 500 index growth of 17%.Some Attractive Stocks in This SpaceGiven the strong macro backdrop, investing in this space should yield attractive returns.  Based on certain parameters, we have zeroed in on three stocks with a Zacks Rank#1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). These stocks have seen an upward revision in earnings estimates and have also outperformed the industry’s growth of 38% in a year’s time.  Our PicksMastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is  a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings and 2019 has moved up 1.1% and 1%, respectively, over the last 30 days.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

The company also noted discrepancies in the audited and unaudited financial statements of Fuji Xerox.Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. (“Fuji Xerox”) is a joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm, wherein Fujifilm holds a 75% interest and Xerox holds the remaining 25% stake.Additionally, Xerox inked a new deal with its two investors – Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason – who together hold a 15% ownership stake in Xerox. The new settlement is expected to resolve the pending issue related to its 2018 annual shareholders’ meeting, along with the legal disputes against its directors in connection with the proposed combination with Fuji Xerox.Terms of the New DealFive new members namely Jonathan Christodoro, Keith Cozza, Nicholas Graziano, Scott Letier and John Visentin will be replacing Robert J. Keegan, Charles Prince, Ann N. Reese, William Curt Hunter and Stephen H.

2457,MA,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about Genpact (G  -  Free Report), a stock that has rallied 19.6% over the past year. The company has expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10%. The company’s strong prospects in the artificial intelligence (AI) space and benefits from strategic acquisitions are impressive.Let’s delve deeper in to Genpact’s key growth drivers.Acquisition a Key Growth StrategyGenpact is very active on the acquisition front. We believe that the buyouts of TandemSeven, BrightClaim and Rage Frameworks in 2017 are helping the company to expand product portfolio and gain new domain expertise.In fact, the addition of TandemSeven’s core design thinking process to Genpact’s AI platform is likely to help the latter become more customer-oriented company. Acquisition of BrightClaim and their associated company, National Vendor, should also strengthen Genpact’s insurance claims management expertise.Meanwhile, Rage Frameworks buyout expanded Genpact’s capability to provide AI offerings across industries, such as consumer packaged goods, industrial engineering, life-sciences and high-tech.Genpact’s other notable acquisitions include LeaseDimensions, Endeavour Software, Strategic Sourcing Excellence (SSE), PNMSoft Limited, Hitachi Management and Pharmalink Consulting. These buyouts have helped the company in expanding its presence in mobile technology, dynamic workflow solution, life sciences and banking operations. These, in turn, have driven customer base and top-line growth.Genpact Limited Revenue (TTM) Genpact Limited Revenue (TTM) | Genpact Limited QuoteArtificial Intelligence: Big OpportunityArtificial Intelligence presents significant growth opportunity for Genpact. Of late, the  company launched artificial intelligence (AI) platform — Genpact Cora — an automation to AI-based platform that combines its proprietary automation, analytics, and AI technologies into a single common platform.  This latest platform has a modular, interconnected network of technologies that enables clients to better tackle specific operational business challenges.Genpact Cora is also helping the company to provide related offerings to industries like consumer-packaged goods, industrial engineering, life sciences and high tech. Acquisitions of Rage Framework and design thinking based companies, like Tandem Seven have also expanded the company’s AI product portfolio.Per an IDC report, worldwide spending on cognitive systems and AI is estimated to touch $52.2 billion in 2021 at a CAGR of 46.2%. We believe that Genpact is well positioned to take advantage of the projected improvement in the AI space.Strong Clientele a BoonGenpact has a strong clientele across the world. The company serves almost one fifth of the Global Fortune 500, including Boeing, Citigroup, GlaxoSmithKline, Wells Fargo, Ironshore, Mondelez, PayPal and Abbott. We note that the Global Client base has improved rapidly over the last five years (2012-2017). Revenues from this group have increased at a healthy CAGR of 12% in this time frame to reach $2.47 billion in 2017.Moreover, Global Clients (as a percentage of total revenues) increased from approximately 75% in 2012 to approximately 90% in 2017. We believe that Genpact’s expertise in providing BPO services might continue to expand customer base in the long run.Bottom LineDespite riding on significant growth prospects, Genpact is not free from overhangs. High indebtedness resulting from frequent acquisitions and significant client concentration in terms of geographic location (North America) are threats. However, we believe that acquisitions, strong clientele and growth in AI space bode well for the company in long term.Genpacthas a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sectorinclude Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report), Mastercard Inc.

2460,MA,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 4. Last quarter, the Chinese e-commerce giant delivered a negative earnings surprise of 1.21%.The surprise history has been decent in Alibaba’s case. The company surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average four-quarter positive surprise of 11.39%.Coming to price performance, on a 12-month basis, the company’s shares have rallied 53% compared with the industry’s gain of 44.6%.Strength in Alibaba’s Core E-Commerce BusinessThis segment comprises marketplaces operating in retail and wholesale commerce in China, and international commerce. Revenues in the last reported fiscal third quarter were RMB73.2 billion (US$11.3 billion), increasing 57% year over year. Revenues are expected to further increase, driven by innovation in data technology, widespread application of big data, and increasing validation for Taobao and Tmall portals.Strong Mobile Growth In the fiscal third quarter, Mobile Monthly Active Users (MAU) were 580 million, reflecting an increase of 18% from the prior-year quarter and 6% sequentially. The number is expected to expand further, driving revenues for the company. This is because of the increased adoption of mobile devices by consumers as the primary method of accessing Alibaba’s platforms. Additionally, over the past few quarters, Alibaba has been witnessing an increase in monetization rates. The company is building its online marketing inventory on both mobile and PC, and likely to continue witnessing higher monetization rates, thereby increasing profits of the company.Growing Cloud MomentumIn the last reported fiscal third quarter, revenues were RMB3.6 billion (US$553 million), increasing 104% year over year. Additionally, Alibaba Cloud launched 396 new products and features to enable small and large enterprises, for achieving higher computing performance and storage capability.The figure is expected to further increase in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by an increase in the number of paying customers and higher-than-usual spending by them, reflecting increased usage of services.Overhangs Remain Concerns remain in the form of rising expenses associated with new business initiatives, increasing logistics and order-fulfillment costs. Also, the company is willing to spend plenty of cash on its entertainment and media units, which management has identified as key growth drivers outside of its core e-commerce business.Also, increasing competition from companies like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Jd.com (JD) among others, and deceleration of growth in the e-commerce market both domestically and internationally could impact results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

2462,MA,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about Waste Connections, Inc. (WCN  -  Free Report), a stock with a Growth Score of B and an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 13.3%.In the past six months, shares of the company have gained 9.3% compared with the 1.5% increase of the industry it belongs to. We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s benefits from acquisitions and strong hold in secondary and rural markets.Let’s discuss them in detail.Early Mover AdvantageWaste Connections typically targets secondary and rural markets to garner a higher local market share, which would be difficult to attain in more competitive urban markets. This, in turn, decreases the company’s exposure to customer churn and helps improve financial returns. In fact, earlymover advantage in certain rural basins play a key role in improving market positioning and generating higher financial returns, given the limited availability of existing third-party-owned waste disposal alternatives.The company focuses on increasing market penetration and offering additional services to capitalize on future drilling opportunities in those areas. Waste Connections also aims to leverage its franchise-based platforms for expanding customer base beyond the exclusive market territories.Prime Location AdvantageWith prime location of disposal sites within competitive markets, Waste Connections has optimal asset positioning to generate higher profitability. Given significant costs associated with the transportation of waste to treatment and disposal sites, having disposal capacity proximate to the waste stream offer a competitive advantage and serve as a barrier to entry. An experienced management team, decentralized operating strategy and financial strength are additional tailwinds.Acquisitions Driving GrowthWaste Connections continues to grow with the help of acquisitions in both new and existing markets. It follows a strategic combination of financial, market and management criteria to evaluate opportunities from acquisitions. In new markets, the company uses its initial buyout as an operating base and seeks to strengthen the acquired operation's presence by providing additional services, adding customers and making “tuck-in” acquisitions of other waste companies in that market or adjacent markets.Waste Connections remains highly optimistic about “tuck-in” acquisition opportunities within its current and targeted market areas as these can help increase market share. In 2017, the company completed 14 acquisitions for a net fair value of $562.2 million.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderWaste Connections currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report), FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (FLT  -  Free Report) and WEX Inc. (WEX  -  Free Report).

2464,MA,"Fitbit Inc. (FIT  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2. Notably, Fitbit's results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters. It has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 43.3%.The company's shares have lost 6.9% in the past 12 months, underperforming the industry’s gain of 32%.  The company’s growth has been hampered by increasing competition in the fitness wearable category, lack of upgrades among existing users and lackluster growth in the Asia Pacific region.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Increasing Competition From Other PlayersFitbit, which became a prominent name for its simple fitness wearables, has been hurt by massive competition in the market. It faces competition in both the high and low-end product range. On the high-end front, it competes with Apple Watch. Although Fitbit expected Ionic to help the company take on Apple, it is hardly an easy task to compete with one of the biggest companies in the world. Also, many big manufacturers are developing connected devices on Google's Android operating system.On the lower end, fitness-tracking devices from Jawbone, Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) and Xiaomi also pose tough competition. Even the launch of its flasgship Ionic and addition of innovative features have not helped it stay ahead of its competitors.Fitbit’s Initiatives to Drive growthThe company has been introducing new products to increase its revenue base. Yet,these products are unable to drive enough revenues for the company. However, its efforts to further diversify business, and focus on health and wellness could help the company drive revenues in the first quarter.Also, Fitbit is taking other initiatives that are expected to pull out the company from slow growth. These steps include offering a streamlined set of products, improving software and services to offer more personalization to customers, and achieving greater integration into the healthcare ecosystem. In this regard, the company recently announced its plans to acquire Twine Health, a health coaching platform. This will further expand its share in the healthcare business, thereby increasing its subscription-based revenues.For the first quarter of 2018, Fitbit expects revenues to remain in the range of $240-$255 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $246.1 million. Fitbit, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Fitbit, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Fitbit, Inc.

2465,MA,"Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, before the opening bell. We expect earnings to see an upside from a strong U.S economy, solid consumer confidence and low unemployment which must have led to higher spending via cards, thereby boosting gross dollar volumes.Among regions, business growth will be seen in Asia, Australia, ASEAN countries, led by improvement in consumer and business sentiment. The Latin American region which is recovering from economic recession should also lead to business growth, while Europe should see mild growth. The company’s global business should drive its worldwide gross dollar volume, which is expected to be $1.34 trillion, up 13% year over year.A number of acquisitions made by the company should contribute to its inorganic growth.We expect an increase in revenues from the company’s Service Business led by its efforts in expanding this business, which has been posting strong earnings for the past many years. Higher utilization of the company's service offerings led to revenue acceleration in the previous quarter, and the same is expected in the quarter to be reported.A decline in tax rate as a result of the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will aid the company’s margins.The weakening of dollar in the first quarter will provide a tailwind to earnings.  On the expense front, the company continues to invest in key long-term growth areas such as digital, security solutions and geographic expansion in addition to incremental employee and technology investment. The company expects operating expense increase in the first quarter of 2018 to be $250 million higher than the company’s annual estimated increase rate of low double digit, due to the timing of the market development programs, (due to new revenue recognition rules), the impact of the acquisitions, which occurred after first-quarter 2017 and the $100-million charge for the center for inclusive growth, which will be absorbed in the to-be reported quarter.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.99%. This is depicted in the chart below:Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Mastercard Incorporated QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Mastercard beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.

2466,MA,"Western Union Co. (WU  -  Free Report) first-quarter earnings, to be reported on May 1, 2018, should see an upside from higher contribution in its consumer-to-consumer segment, which represents 80% of the company’s revenues, driven by growing worldwide immigration which induces demand for money remittance. We expect further improvement in margins as technology investment and other cost-reduction initiatives pay off. Improvement in cross-border remittance and strong growth in digital platform will lead to higher demand for money transfer services and will accrue to the segment’s top line.Region wise, revenue growth in the C2C segment should be seen from the Middle East Africa and South Asia region, benefiting from improved results at oil producing countries including Saudi Arabia. The Latin America and Caribbean region continue to deliver strong revenue growth, driven by Argentina and several other South American markets. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue growth was led by France.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues in the C2C segment is $1.05 billion, up 2.9% year over year.Results should be to some extent offset by a subdued performance from the Business Solutions segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues from this segment is $94 million, flat year over year.Other revenues, which consist primarily of the company’s bill payments businesses, should have increased in the first quarter, led by Speedpay, electronic bill payments in the United States, and the Pago Facil walk-in business in Argentina.The bottom line might suffer from elevated compliance spending. Share repurchases made by the company, from its strong cash flow generation, will aid earnings.Earnings SurpriseThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.05%. This is depicted in the chart below:The Western Union Company Price and EPS Surprise The Western Union Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Western Union Company QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that Western Union is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

Results benefited from lower expenses and expansion of net interest margin. However, decline in revenues was a headwind.Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. QuoteFactors to Influence Q1 ResultsFidelity’s revenue growth story for the first quarter is not expected to be impressive due to the stiff competition in the industry.

Also, the overall revenues of $2.04 billion are projected to decline 9.6% from the prior-year quarter.The Florida-based financial service provider’s bottom line might benefit slightly from the lower tax rates and rising interest rate environment.The company’s focus on introducing new and innovative products in order to meet the growing demand of customers will likely increase expenses, as witnessed in the past.Earnings WhisperAccording to our proven model, Fidelity does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Fidelity is -0.56%.Zacks Rank: Fidelity carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

2468,MA,"Visa Inc.’s (V  -  Free Report) solid second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, upward revision of guidance and other recent business developments seem to have favored its stock, pushing it to a 52-week high of $131.00 on May 9. The stock, however, closed the trading day at $130.84.What Buoyed Up the Stock?A strong global economy, deal wins, agreements and acquisitions and digital enhancement favored the company and led to a rally in its shares. Since the release of the company’s results on Apr 25, 2018, shares have gained 8% outperforming the industry’s growth of 7%. In a year’s time, shares of the company have returned 43%, higher than the industry’s growth of 38%.  Let’s look at the catalysts causing this bull run.Solid Q2 ResultsVisa fired on all cylinders in its second-quarter release. A robust global economy drove double-digit constant dollar payment volume growth. Cross-border growth accelerated, helped by a weaker dollar. Inbound commerce into the United States grew at double-digits for the first time since the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Outbound commerce from Europe was also up double digits, as the euro and pound strengthened.The strength in results was reflected by 11% payments volume growth on a constant dollar basis. U.S. payments volume growth of over 10% was 50 basis point higher than last quarter. U.S. consumer debit accelerated 2% with strength across retail and every day spend segments. U.S. consumer credit growth remained robust at 11%, with continued strong growth in travel categories.International payments volume growth in constant dollars was 11%, up 1% from the last quarter. Growth was strong across Asia, driven by China and Japan. Growth stepped up in Latin America, helped by Brazil. Growth in Europe remained strong and stable. Cross-border volume growth accelerated 2.5% on a constant dollar basis to over 11%.Guidance RaiseBased on strong second-quarter results, the company now expects low double-digit net revenue growth, compared with high single digits as expected earlier. It expects earnings per share (EPS) growth of low-60s (versus mid-50s earlier) on a GAAP nominal dollar basis and high 20s (high end of mid-20s) on an adjusted, non-GAAP basis (EPS includes approximately 1.5% of positive foreign currency impact and 9-10% of benefit from tax reform).Upside from Tax ReformVisa has been a beneficiary of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. As a result of the tax reform, the company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal second quarter was 19%. This included a 6% reduction related to the U.S. tax reform and the benefit from the successful resolution of a state tax initiative. For 2018, the company expects a tax rate between 21% and 22%. The company expects a 9% to 10% benefit from the impact of the U.S. tax reform to 2018 EPS.Recent Acquisitions, Deals and PartnershipsA number of partnerships and acquisitions have ratcheted the company’s inorganic growth profile while enhancing its digital capabilities. One of the most notable acquisitions made in March 2018 by the company was that of Fraedom, a SaaS technology company providing payments and transaction management solutions for financial institutions. This deal would strengthen the company’s position in growing its B2B (business to business) solutions.In January, the company partnered with NovoPayment, a leading enabler of digital financial and transactional services, to facilitate the implementation of payment solutions for B2B transactions in Latin America and the Caribbean.A day ago, the company the company extended its partnership with PayPal to accelerate the adoption of digital and mobile payments in Canada.

The partnership with PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) will drive the company’s payments volumes.The company also signed a number of new deals in the second quarter in the United States and across the globe.

2480,MA,"Launched on 06/17/2011, the PowerShares Russell Top 200 Pure Growth Portfolio (PXLG  -  Free Report) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Large Cap ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.Non-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is managed by Invesco Powershares, and has been able to amass over $212.28 M, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Large Cap ETFs. Before fees and expenses, PXLG seeks to match the performance of the Russell Top 200 Pure Growth Index.The Russell Top 200 Pure Growth Index is composed of securities with strong growth characteristics selected from the Russell Top 200 Index.Cost & Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for PXLG are 0.39%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.PXLG's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 0.65%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 35.40% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector; Consumer Discretionary and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Netflix Inc (NFLX  -  Free Report) accounts for about 4.71% of total assets, followed by Amazon.com Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Mastercard Inc (MA  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 33.06% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe fund's year-to-date return has gained about 7.51%, and was up about 26.99% in the last one year (as of 05/09/2018). PXLG has traded between $38.33 and $50.13 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 1.03 and standard deviation of 15.02% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium choice in the space. With about 68 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesPowerShares Russell Top 200 Pure Growth Portfolio is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Large Cap ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF  -  Free Report) tracks Russell 1000 Growth Index and the PowerShares QQQ (QQQ  -  Free Report) tracks NASDAQ-100 Index. IShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF has $40.91 B in assets, PowerShares QQQ has $61.65 B. IWF has an expense ratio of 0.20% and QQQ charges 0.20%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Large Cap ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

2484,MA,"Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, after market close.We expect expanding data and machine learning-based analytics solutions, increased penetration in the identity and fraud prevention market and continuous expansion of its verification business to drive its top line in the to-be reported quarter. The bottom line is likely to decline due to buyout-related amortization expenses and costs associated with the cybersecurity incident.We observe that shares of Equifax have rallied 11.2% over the past six months, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 4.7%. Top Line to Improve Year Over YearEquifax operates through four segments — U.S. Information Solutions (USIS), International, Workforce Solutions and Global Consumer Solutions. While we expect strong performance of International and Workforce Solutions segments in the to-be-reported quarter on a year-over-year basis, the company’s business from USIS and Global Consumer Solutions are likely to decline.Revenues from the International division (including Europe, the Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America) are expected to increase on the back of its expanding data and machine learning-based analytics solutions in Europe, Canada and Latin America, increased coverage in Australian and Latin American fraud prevention market and growing potential in debt management across the world. Revenues from product launches is another key growth catalyst. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $243 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 12.5%.In fourth-quarter 2017, segment revenues advanced 15% year over year to $244.8 million.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment are likely to improve driven by continuous expansion of its verification business with progressive work culture and increasing associations, coupled with global expansion into Canadian and Australian markets.

In fourth-quarter 2017, segment revenues amounted to $97.3 million, down 2% year over year.Strength across International and Workforce Solutions segments will contribute toward year-over-year growth of Equifax’s total revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for which is currently pegged at $854.02 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 2.6%.Notably, the consensus estimate falls within the company guided range of $850-$860 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of 2-3%. The guidance also includes a 1% benefit from foreign currency movements. In fourth-quarter 2017, revenues rose 4.7% from the year-ago quarter to $838.5 million. It included a 3% negative impact of the cybersecurity incident.Equifax, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Equifax, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Equifax, Inc. QuoteBottom Line to Decline Year Over YearThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.37, indicating year-over-year decline of 4.9%.The decline is expected on the back of buyout-related amortization expenses and costs associated with the investigation, rectification, legal and professional services and improved security services in relation to the cybersecurity incident. Reduced benefits from foreign tax items are likely to act as another negative catalyst. Notably, these headwinds are expected to offset the tax benefits from the new tax (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) law.Notably, the consensus estimate is in line with the midpoint of the previous guidance range. Equifax anticipates EPS for first-quarter 2018 to be in the range of $1.34-$1.39 (inclusive of a benefit of 1 cent from foreign currency movements).

2485,MA,"Visa Inc.’s (V  -  Free Report) fiscal second-quarter results should reflect payment transaction growth led by higher consumer spending fuelled by a strong economy. Continued growth of checks and digital methods of payments supported the increase in payment transaction.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total payment transaction is 37.51 billion, up 10.6% year over year. This should be driven by payments transaction growth from Asia Pacific, Canada, Cemea, Lac, U.S.A., the Zacks Consensus Estimate for which is pegged at 6.13 billion, 809 million, 3.62 billion, 3.07 billion and 15.7 billion, respectively, reflecting year-over-year increase of 11.2%, 12.4%, 25.1%, 1.9% and 8%.High gas prices and increased spending in retail should have buoyed Visa’s total payments volumes which is expected to grow by 11.4% to $1.93 billion in the fiscal second quarter as per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Visa should report increase in revenues from growth of key business drivers such as payments volume, cross border volume and process transactions. Visa revenues have grown consistently over the past several years. We strongly believe that the company should retain its revenue momentum in the to-be quarters on the back of its strong market position and attractive core business that continues to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions, increasing spending via cards, shift to digital form of payments and expansion of service offerings.Results should also see an upside from the Visa Europe acquisition. The deal has been accretive to the company, having contributed to its top line by bolstering payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. The deal contributed to fiscal 2017 EPS by mid single digits and management expects an addition of high single digits to fiscal 2018 EPS. Part of it should be accrued in the to-be reported quarter.The company’s share buyback activity should provide an extra cushion to its bottom line.

2487,MA,"The Fearless Girl facing the Manhattan financial district's famous Charging Bull near Wall Street will get a new permanent home by the end of this year in front of the New York Stock Exchange. Despite several criticism, the statue has become a tourist destination and a global symbol of female business prowess since its installation more than a year ago.About The Fearless GirlShe is a ponytailed, young, four-foot-tall bronze monument with fists on hips and chin held high as a symbol of empowerment. State Street Global Advisors at Bowling Green Park on Broadway Street originally installed the sculpture on the eve of International Women’s Day 2017. The Fearless Girl is a growing symbol for gender equality and the power of women in leadership. It spreads a message to encourage companies to recruit women to their board. The plaque at the statue’s feet reads “Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference.”The ‘Fearless Girl’ is part of a campaign by State Street to encourage companies to add more women to their boards and to advertise SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE  -  Free Report), which comprises gender-diverse companies that have a relatively high percentage of women among their senior leadership.Inside SHEThis ETF offers exposure to U.S. companies that demonstrate greater gender diversity within senior leadership than other firms in their sector by tracking the SSGA Gender Diversity Index. Holding 168 stocks, it is moderately concentrated on the top firms as each account for less than 5.8% of assets. Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) are top three holdings. From a sector look, information technology takes the largest share at 22.2%, followed by healthcare (16.4%), consumer staples (13.1%) and consumer discretionary (12.0%). SHE has returned 10.2% over the past year versus the gain of 15.45% for the broad market fund (SPY  -  Free Report).Impact On Women-LeadershipOut of 700 companies in the United States, Britain and Australia that had no women serving on their boards, more than 150 companies have added a female director to their boards since the placement of the bronze girl statue, with another 34 pledging to do so. Currently, women make up 5% of CEOs in the Fortune 500 companies and 17% of the corporate board members among Fortune 500 companies.Today, a record number of women are in power this year. In the United States, 32 Fortune 500 CEOs are women, three women are in the Supreme Court, and three of the last eight U.S. Secretaries of State were women. Last year, 15 of 146 world leaders were women, eight of whom served as their country’s first female leaders. Some of the famous women leaders include Angela Merkel and Dilma Rousseff.In the corporate world, Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report); Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report); Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors (GM  -  Free Report); Angela Ahrendts, Senior Vice-President of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report); Denise Morrison, CEO of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report); and Michele Buck, CEO of Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report) are leaders in their own right. Per several researches, companies led by women have a long history of outperformance.Bottom LinePlacing the Fearless Girl right next to the NYSE is the perfect metaphor to promote more companies to hire women to their boards, according to the State Street Global Advisors. With the move, the Fearless Girl will be more powerful standing alone outside NYSE than the her current home turf, which she shares with the Charging Bull. Hopefully, she will continue to stimulate the power of having women in leadership.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2489,MA,"A strong U.S. economy, low unemployment and wage gains  have fueled a rise in retail spending and in turn placed Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) in a bright spot. A strong macroeconomic backdrop coupled with the company’s strong fundamentals and a rapid shift in the usage of cards for payments have greatly benefited the stock of this company.Year to date, the stock has gained 29.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 16%. This performance looks all the more attractive compared with the gains of 15% for Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) and a decline of 1.5% in American Express Inc. (AXP  -  Free Report). Both these players share the same space as Mastercard.We can get an insight into Mastercard’s superior performance from its earnings surprise history of a beat in 25 out of 27 quarters. For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 per share implies 40% year-over-year growth.What’s the Catalyst Behind This GrowthIncreasing Revenues: The company’s net revenues grew 27% on a constant currency basis, upholding the top-line growth of the past many years. The company has witnessed a revenue CAGR of 11% from 2012-2017. This growth has been achieved on the back of new deals, renewed agreements, technological investments, acquisitions and widening of geographic footprint. An increase in the number of transactions processed from an increase in spending due to high consumer confidence amid a strong economy has also aided top-line growth.Growth of its Value Added Services: Continuous diversification of its business beyond core payments has fared well for the company. Its services business now represents 25% of total revenues, which differentiates it from the market. These services are in the areas of Analytics, Fraud and Loyalty, and B2B offerings, which can help it maintain above-average long-term organic revenue growth.  Moreover, it has a diversified customer profile that includes merchants, governments, telecommunications companies and digital players.Digital Innovations: Numerous trends in the digital market, such as demand for faster payments and the application of emerging technology, present opportunities for growth. To this end, the company has launched and extended products and platforms that take advantage of the growing digital economy. Some of recent developments in 2017 are expansion of the use of Masterpass, Mastercard Send and Quick Response codes. The company’s digital innovations keep it ahead in the race in a fast-changing payments’ industry.Expansion in the Business-to-Business (B2B) Market: The company’s market share in commercial products is growing globally, as its offers solutions with travel and entertainment, procurement, fleet and virtual cards. The company estimates that there is $120 trillion in addressable payment flows in B2B globally, of which approximately $100 trillion is related to cash and checks, giving the company immense opportunity.To address this opportunity, the company is expanding its capabilities to capture non-carded payment flows with new solutions, such as the Mastercard B2B Hub, Mastercard Send for cross-border payments, and real-time account-based payment systems for ACH transactions. The company launched the innovative Mastercard B2B Hub platform in 2017 to enable small and midsized businesses to optimize their invoice and payment processes with automation tools that improve the speed, ease and security of their commercial payments. The company’s B2B offering should lead to long-term growth.Enhanced Safety and Security: The company has also been making huge investments in enhancing the safety and security of the transactions made on its network from cyber crime. To this end, in 2017, it acquired Brighterion and NuData Security, launched Early Detection System, expanded Safety Net, expanded AI across its network with Decision Intelligence.These fundamental strengths of the company have favored the stock and there seems to be no end here since investments in different platforms, acquisitions and deals would lead to business growth.Mastercard carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another stock worth considering is WEX Inc. (WEX  -  Free Report), which carries the same Zacks Rank as Mastercard. It beat earnings estimates in each of the four reported quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.6%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2491,MA,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 27, before the opening bell.While we expect the company to witness solid sales on the back of higher organic growth, favorable foreign currency movements and extensive global presence, seasonality in business is likely to hurt the bottom line.We observe that shares of Interpublic have rallied 19.7% over the past six months, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 4.6%. The industry to which it belongs, declined 1.6% in the same time frame. Organic Growth & Favorable Currency to Drive RevenuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $1,815 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3.5%. The top line is expected to benefit from higher organic growth and favorable foreign currency movements.Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (The) Revenue (TTM)  Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (The) Revenue (TTM) | Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.

The company’s earnings are likely to be negatively impacted by seasonality in business that results from clients’ fluctuating annual media spending budgets and changing media spending patterns.

2493,MA,"U.S. bond yields scaled record highs after inflation expectations hit the highest level in three and a half years. Such a spike in yields led to a steep decline in equity markets, while a disappointing revenue forecast by a major Asian chipmaker weighed on the sought-after technology sector. Amid all these, the working and middle class criticized the new tax law and that doesn’t sound good for the nine-year old bull market.  In the view of this, investing in big-brand stocks seems prudent. After all, they have established business models and tend to draw consumers and investor attention even when the equity market is choppy. We shouldn’t forget that such stocks are financially stable enough to cash in on a market rebound.Bond Yields Spike, Equities WobbleOil hitting a three-and-a-half-year high and business houses saying that the cost of steel and several other raw materials are increasing in the United States have induced inflation fears.Treasuries sold off as higher commodity prices diminish the value of a bond’s fixed interest payments. As treasuries came under pressure, the 10-year yield and the 30-year yield moved north. Bond yields always tend to move inversely to prices.The benchmark 10-year Treasury note increased 4.6 basis points to 2.914% on Apr 19, its highest level since Feb 23, per Tradeweb data. The 30-year bond yield advanced 5.8 basis points to 3.106%, the maximum since Mar 21.Rise in bond yields affected the buying appetite for stocks. Uptick in bond yields increased the opportunity cost of investing in equities and therefore equities became less alluring. All the major bourses ended in the red on Apr 19, with the blue-chip average retracing into the negative territory for the year.Investors Cut Exposure to the Crowded TechThe technology sector, which has hogged the limelight during the nine years of bull run, took a beating on Apr 19. And it’s all because of a disappointing forecast by an Asian chipmaker. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing projected second-quarter revenues of $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion, lower than the analysts’ estimate of $8.8 billion.The Asian chipmaker cited soft demand for high-end smartphone and being conservative on the cryptocurrency mining market for its weak guidance. The chipmaker’s partners, Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), saw their shares drop 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively. Shares of other chipmakers including Micron Technology, Inc.  and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.  slipped 4.8% and 2.4%, individually.Tax Cuts Don’t Favor Working ClassTrump has lowered the personal tax rate, aligning it with rates in other nations. Still, a significant number of Americans feel that the tax cuts were too generous to the wealthy compared to the middle and working class. As per the latest Gallup poll, 48% of respondents condemned the tax cuts, while only 39% were in favor of it.Middle class constitutes the bulk of the population and with less money in their hands, they find it difficult to spend and that doesn’t bode well for economic growth. In fact, they suspect that the tax cuts for business may be permanent but for individuals, it is temporary. Republicans, in the meantime, are so demoralized by the tax overhaul policy’s unpopularity that they’re considering another round of tax cuts.5 Hot American Brands Worth Buying NowWith the U.S. stock market going through a choppy phase, investing in big-brand companies seems judicious. These stocks will offer some respite as they boast stable cash flows. Needless to say, the value of brands is that they instantly convey information on quality, durability and consistency to consumers. These traits help such stocks counter market gyrations. And if the market pulls itself up in the near term, such companies will make the most of the positive trend as their products and services are widely accepted.We have thus selected five of the best big-brand American stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Caterpillar Inc.

It is unclear exactly how much these official FIFA partners pay, but the federation reportedly grabbed $1.58 billion in marketing dollars alone for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. According to The Telegraph, it costs between $25 million and $50 million annually to be a FIFA partner and $10 million to $25 million to be a major World Cup sponsor.There are currently seven FIFA partners for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup cycle. This list includes Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), Hyundai/ Kia, Chinese conglomerate Wanda, Russian giant Gazprom, and Qatar Airways. Meanwhile, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), along with a few others, are official 2018 World Cup sponsors.FIFA’s pitch is simple: “The World Cup is the most effective international marketing platform, reaching millions of people in over 200 countries throughout the world.” So, with all that said, let’s take a look at how some of FIFA’s biggest publicly traded marketing and advertising sponsors are doing.Coca-ColaCoca-Cola has been associated with FIFA since 1974. The company signed a 16-year extension with FIFA in 2005, which takes it through the 2022 World Cup—a deal the beverage giant made before it even knew where the 2018 and 2022 tournaments would be held. Investors will note that Coca-Cola has underperformed the S&P 500 since it signed its latest extension. More recently, KO stock has done dramatically worse than the index, up just 5.5% over the last five years against the index’s nearly 73% climb. Over the last year, Coca-Cola stock is down 3.7% as consumers’ drinking habits shift.VisaMoving on, Visa landed a deal with FIFA in 2007 that gave it the rights to become an official sponsor starting in 2010, replacing Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report). The credit card giant is now a partner and has signed on through 2022.Unlike Coca-Cola, Visa stock has soared since it became a FIFA sponsor. Clearly, there are many other factors involved, but it is interesting all the same, and also highlights why many question the real value of sports sponsorships.Adidas The German sportswear powerhouse has been a FIFA partner since 1970. In November 2013, Adidas signed an extension to become the official partner, supplier, and licensee for the FIFA World Cup and all FIFA events until 2030. Adidas stock has performed rather well since the 2014 World Cup. It is also worth noting that the company’s surge outpaces rival Nike’s (NKE  -  Free Report) roughly 95% climb. Fox & TelemundoLastly, let’s look at two of the integral parts of the tournament, Fox and Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report). The two giants won the rights to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in the United States, paying roughly $1 billion combined. Fox reportedly agreed to pay more than $400 million, with Telemundo dropping $600 million. Clearly, both Fox and Telemundo’s parent company Comcast have performed rather well since the two companies signed their massive World Cup deals back in 2011. It will also certainly be fun to see how Fox’s World Cup coverage performs, especially since the U.S. men’s team didn’t qualify for the first time since 1986.Make sure to come back to Zacks for more 2018 World Cup business updates. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

2498,MA,"S&P Global Inc. (SPGI  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the bell.We expect S&P Global's results to be driven by strength across all segments, margin improvement and positive impacts of U.S. tax reforms.We observe that shares of S&P Global have gained 43.4% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 16.1% rally.Here are the expectations in detail.Top Line to be Driven by Strength Across all SegmentsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.54 billion, reflecting an increase of 6% when compared with the year-ago quarter’s actual figure. The improvement is expected to be driven by strength across all the segments — S&P Global Ratings, S&P Global Market and Commodities and S&P Dow Jones Indices.S&P Global Ratings’ revenues are expected to be driven by an increase in both transaction and non-transaction revenues. Revenues at the S&P Global Market and Commodities Intelligence are likely to improve backed by increase in organic revenues. Surge in exchange-traded products and increased derivatives trading should drive S&P Dow Jones Indices revenues.In the fourth quarter, S&P Global’s total revenues of $1.59 billion were up 13.6% year over year.S&P Global Inc. Revenue (TTM) S&P Global Inc. Revenue (TTM) | S&P Global Inc. QuoteBottom Line to be Driven by Revenue Growth & Tax Cuts The consensus estimate for adjusted EPS is pegged at $1.98, mirroring year-over-year growth of 22.2%. This significant increase in the metric is likely to be driven by robust revenue growth and margin improvement backed by productivity initiatives, divestitures and synergies realization.Also, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that reduced corporate tax rates significantly from 35% to 21%, is expected to benefit S&P Global’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.In the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS was $1.85, which improved 44.5% year over year.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

2499,MA,"Shares of Visa (V  -  Free Report) have climbed 3.3% over the last month in a sign that investors might be anticipating a strong quarter from the credit card giant. Now, let’s take a look to see what they should really expect from Visa’s quarterly earnings results.Visa, and rival credit card power Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report) just recently announced their plans to join forces via one single online payment function. The two card networks plan to drop their respective online payment options to try to become more attractive in the fight for e-commerce spends. This move helps illuminate just how competitive the online shopping world has become with PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), other fintech firms, and even tech giants like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), all fighting for online shoppers.Clearly, Visa’s latest plan to grab more online payment business won’t show up on it upcoming earnings report, but it is worth noting how the company hopes to evolve in order to present shareholders more value going forward. With that said, Visa is coming off a strong quarter that saw the company’s earnings beat expectations and surge 25% from the year-ago period.The question is: what’s in store for Visa when it reports its quarterly earnings results after market close on Wednesday, April 25.Quarterly OutlookVisa’s quarterly revenues are projected to climb by 6.8% to reach $4.78 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Investors should be more impressed by the credit card firm’s quarterly earnings, which are expected to expand by 18.6% to hit $1.02 per share. Still, these estimates don’t give investors any idea is Visa is expected to top its current earnings estimate, which is important because earnings beats can lead to positive stock price movement immediately following the release of quarterly financial results. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, either way.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Visa is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 1.38%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $1.03 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. This means that investors should consider Visa a stock that could beat quarterly earnings estimates. Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

2501,MA,"Total System Services, Inc.’s (TSS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, 2018 after the closing bell. Its quarterly revenues and earnings are expected to improve year over year.The company is expected to benefit from a healthy sales pipeline, sharp focus on expense control and a robust roster of issuing clients with long-term agreements.Last quarter, Total System’s earnings surpassed estimates by 5.1% led by strong contribution from each of its operating segments.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 6.63%. This is depicted in the chart below:Total System Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Total System Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Total System Services, Inc. QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Total System beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Total System is +0.51%.Zacks Rank: Total System has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsThe company’s NetSpend segment should deliver revenue growth from an increase in gross dollar volume and higher debit active cards. Contract extensions for several significant partnership agreements signed in the fourth quarter should drive the top line.  Some of these contracts were a one-year extension with Intuit for QuickBooks which offers NetSpend accounts to users of their accounting software, a two-year extension with Liberty Tax as well as a three and four-year, respective, contract extension with Advance America and Check `n Go. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenue from the segment is $202 million, up 2.5% year over year.The company’s Issuer Solutions segment should see top-line growth from an increase in Total Accounts on File (AoF), led by new business and internal growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AoF is 812 million, reflecting an increase of 6.6% year over year. Focus on new product initiatives, technology modernization and integration activities will further aid revenues in the segment.On Jan 11, 2018, the company completed its acquisition of Cayan Holdings LLC. which became part of the Merchant Solutions segment. This deal will allow Total System to serve about 730,000 merchant sites with an annual processing volume of more than $138 billion, and will be only slightly accretive to the segment’s first-quarter earnings. This segment should report revenue growth from the acquisition of TransFirst (made in April 2016). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment stands at $338 million, which translates into year-over-year growth of 29.5%.The company should incur a higher interest cost in the first quarter on account of debt taken to close the Cayan acquisition. Investments made to enhance the company’s infrastructure, longer-term product offerings and technological capabilities, should push up expenses and weigh on margins to some extent.Nevertheless, a decline in tax rate to the 21% to 23% range, down from the 32% to 33%, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will aid the company’s margins.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report), is expected to report first-quarter 2018 earnings results on May 2.

While we expect strong performance of Northern Europe, Southern Europe and APME segments in the to-be-reported quarter on a year-over-year basis, the company’s business from Americas and Right Management are likely to decline.Southern Europe is likely to witness improved revenues driven by growth in permanent recruitment and strong businesses across France and Italy.

Revenues from this segment increased 25.5% year over year to $2,399 million in fourth-quarter 2017. With France, Italy and Other Southern Europe in its coverage, the segment contributes around 41-42% of total revenues.Revenues from Northern Europe are expected to increase on the back of strong growth in both Poland and Russia.

Revenues from this segment increased 10.4% year over year to $695.2 million in fourth-quarter 2017. It contributes 12% of total revenues.Revenues generated from Americas are expected to decrease year over year due to lower revenues from its Experis business.

The segment accounts for almost 19-20% of total revenues.Revenues from the Right Management business are anticipated to decline to $51 million in first-quarter 2018 due to the persistent declines in career placement activities. Revenues had declined 8.9% year over year infourth-quarter 2017.

2507,MA,"The markets have been extremely volatile lately owing to a multitude of factors including rate hikes fears and risks of a potential trade war. One particular segment of the market, which has been attracting investor attention over the last few years, is the socially responsible investing segment. These ETFs allow you to invest in line with your principles and contribute to making the world a better place in your own small way (read: ETFs to be Impacted by Potential Trade War With China).Investing in separate stocks that you feel are commensurate with your principles can be difficult, while also maintaining a diversified portfolio. Here, ETFs come to the rescue, as they offer a diversified portfolio of stocks focusing on particular screens for environmental, social or governance (ESG) related issues.Gender equality has been the top trend in 2017 and 2018 so far. With increased focus on disparities in the pay of men and women, investing in companies that have a better standing with regards to gender equity has been gaining popularity. For instance, HSBC revealed a 59% gender pay gap, even though HSBC’s UK workforce comprises 54% women. Moreover, a mere 23% occupy senior roles at the bank.Another area attracting investor attention is clean energy. After President Donald Trump decided to leave the Paris Climate Accord last year, multiple critics have argued the need to shift toward cleaner energy and reduce fossil fuel consumption. There are multiple ways to gain exposure to this principle, either by investing directly in funds having a portfolio of stocks involved in clean energy, or by investing in funds having a portfolio of stocks trying to save energy and reduce carbon emissions in their day-to- day operations.The latest trend among sustainable investing enthusiasts is the need to steer clear of weapons companies. After the school shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in February and the incident in Las Vegas music festival in 2017, arguments for gun laws and imposing stricter rules regarding gun sales have panned up. Therefore, funds that refrain from investing in companies involved in weapons have caught investor attention.   In the current scenario, we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that focus on providing exposure to sustainable investing themes.  iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF (DSI  -  Free Report)This ETF offers exposure to stocks that exhibit positive ESG characteristics, refraining from investing in companies involved in weapons, tobacco or alcohol.

2514,MA,"Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) is riding high on technological innovations. This need, necessitated by economic and technological progress, rising middle-class population, contactless technology and mobile computing, is shaping commerce globally and accelerating the migration from cash to digital payments.The shift in form of payments is corroborated by the fact that last year global digital payment volume exceeded cash for the first time in history. Visa, by virtue of its vast and ongoing investments in technological innovations, is well-positioned to continue leading this digital transformation.This leading network provider and payment processor has come a long way with its technological transformation initiatives, undertaken in 2015.  Most noteworthy was the launch of Visa’s Developer Platform (VDP) in fiscal 2016. The VDP was developed based on demands of consumers and merchants, who increasingly rely on connected devices to shop, pay and get paid.Visa’s digital products include Visa Checkout, Visa Direct and Visa Token Service.Visa Checkout offers consumers an expedited and secure payment experience for online and mobile transactions. Visa Direct is its real-time “push” payments platform that allows businesses, governments and consumers to use the network to transfer funds from an originating account to another via a debit, prepaid or credit card number, where Visa Token Service allows transactions using a token. Tokenization helps to protect consumer financial information and lessen the risk of stolen card credentials, particularly when information regarding a financial instrument is stored on a mobile phone or wearable device or is stored on an e-commerce platform.The company is also partnering with Fintech companies with exciting capabilities, which is expected to add value to the payment system. In this vein, the company has partnered with Klarna, which offers online acceptance and consumer lending in Europe. It also collaborated with Marqeta, a card issuing, processing and program management service that allows businesses to authorize transactions and fund payment cards. The company also signed a pact with PayPal that allows cardholders to choose Visa as a preferred payment method.Visa is accelerating into Internet-of-Things (IoT) payments. The company is also in the process of using blockchain technology to provide a new way to consumers, businesses and banks to transact. It is the key strategy to provide payment solutions that will meet every need of financial institutions and their end-customers.Visa’s technological investments have borne fruits by increasing payment volumes led by higher processed transactions. This has driven revenues that witnessed a CAGR of 15% between 2015 and 2017. The company expects annual net revenue growth of high single-digit on a nominal-dollar basis for fiscal 2018.In a year, the stock gained 39% on par with the industry’s growth.  Other players in the industry, Total System Services, Inc.

2515,MA,"The Financial Transaction Services industry is undergoing a dynamic change. Technology and innovations are leading to changing consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce, mobile payments, block chain technology and digital currencies.As  payments style shifts from cash and checks to plastic and electronic mode, demand for debit and credit cards and online payments continues to rise. An improving economy has also set a positive trend in consumer spending by increasing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards and devices.Moreover, the relaxation of tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is likely to increase consumers’ propensity to spend more.Strong Economy Bodes WellThe U.S economy recently witnessed strong developments like a decline in jobless claims, low unemployment, etc, which reflect that the economy holds immense growth potential. Solid growth in wage has boosted overall consumer spending resulting from increased disposable income.These favorable macroeconomic factors further boosted The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index, which measures consumers’ attitude toward current and short-term economic conditions. This optimism encourages consumers to use their savings to make purchases, which is a positive sign for payment and network companies, which are the end-beneficiaries of rising consumer spending.A Top-Ranked IndustryThe Financial Transaction Services industry looks attractive from an investment perspective. The industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank #124 (top 47% out of more than 250 Zacks industries). Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.Here we focus on two payment processors, Global Payments, Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) and Total System Services, Inc. (TSS  -  Free Report).Global Payments is a leading worldwide provider of payment technology services that delivers innovative solutions globally with market capitalization of $15.84 billion. On the other hand, Total System, with market capitalization of $14.09 billion, is one of the world's largest companies for outsourced payment services, offering a broad range of issuer and acquirer-processing technologies that support consumer-finance, credit, debit, healthcare, loyalty and prepaid services for financial institutions and retail companies. Both of the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to note which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals.Some other top-ranked stocks in the industry are MasterCard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) and Visa, Inc. (V  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank of 2.Price PerformanceBoth the companies have outperformed the industry in a year’s time. While shares of Total System have rallied 65.7%, Global Payments has surged 49%. Here also, Total System performs better than Global Payments.ValuationThe price-to-earnings (P/E) value metric is the best multiple used for valuing payment processors. Compared with the industry’s trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 30.3, both Total System and Global Payments are undervalued. Yet, with a trailing 12-month P/E multiple of 27.8, Total System is relatively cheaper than Global Payments’ trailing 12-month P/E multiple of 30.1. This round clearly goes to Total System.Dividend YieldBoth the companies have been deploying capital in terms of dividend payments to enhance shareholders’ value. They also maintain a record of raising dividends at regular intervals.Total System has a current dividend yield of 0.58% while Global Payments has a dividend yield of 0.03%.Although both the stocks’ dividend yield is lower than the industry’s average of 0.62%, Total System has an edge over Global Payments here.Leverage Ratio Both Total System and Global Payments have higher debt-to-equity ratio compared with the industry average of 61.6. However, Global Payments with a leverage ratio of 117.5, has an edge over Total System with the same of 140.6.Earnings Surprise HistoryConsidering a comprehensive earnings history, both the companies have delivered positive surprises in each of the prior four quarters. While Global Payments has an average earnings surprise of 4%, Total System stands out with 6.6%.Hence, Total System scores over Global Payments in this context.Earnings Estimate Revisions & Growth ProjectionsGlobal Payments has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being revised upward by 7%, over the last 60 days. On the other hand, the same for Total System has moved upward for 2018 by 14.6%, over the same time frame.For Global Payments, the consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $5.05 for 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 26%. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 15.8%.For Total System, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $4.17 for 2018, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 24%. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 14.6%.This round is slightly biased toward Global Payments.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Total System is poised better than Global Payments when considering valuation, price performance, dividend yield and earnings surprise history. Global Payments wins on leverage ratio and earnings estimate revisions & growth projections.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

2516,MA,"Shares of VeriFone Systems, Inc. (PAY  -  Free Report) tumbled to a 52-week low of $14.93 during the trading session on Apr 2. However, the figure recovered marginally to close at $15.14, down 1.5%.In fact, the stock has not performed well in the past three months. Shares of Verifone have lost 14.1% against the industry’s gain of 3.0% in the said timeframe. Reasons for the UnderperformanceMacro Headwinds and CompetitionVeriFone’s business continues to be affected by macroeconomic headwinds in emerging markets such as China and India. Further, VeriFone faces significant competition from a number of local providers in the domestic as well as international markets. Notably, non-GAAP revenues from North America and Asia Pacific declined drastically by 21.7% and 30.7%, respectively, in first-quarter fiscal 2018, on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, Verifone reported mixed financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2018. Earnings per share met the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved fr om the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP revenues, despite beating estimates, declined 4.3% year over year. The company’s System Solutions revenues declined 7% year over year to $243.1 million, owing to the headwinds arising from the U.S. petro business and Indian markets.Verifone Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Verifone Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Verifone Systems, Inc. QuoteApart from this, the Electronic payment system and services market is highly competitive and fragmented. New market entrants such as non-card payment methods (using Internet and cloud instead of using physical cards) are expected to gain significant traction in the long run. Increased pricing pressure is another headwind. We believe the market is getting more competitive with the introduction of new market entrants and latest technologies.Divestures and Buyout-related WoesThe divestitures of China business, Petroleum Media business and Taxi Solutions business during 2017 are anticipated to hurt top-line growth in the near term. Multiple acquisitions, despite improving revenue opportunities, increase the company’s exposure to integration risks. Further, the company’s leveraged balance sheet may limit future expansion and worsen its risk profile. Higher interest rate on debt is expected to negatively impact profitability.Recent launches like Carbon Mobile 5 device and Verifone e280 mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) solutionwill take some time to contribute to growth.Downward Estimate RevisionsThe direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings declined 12.1% to 29 cents per share. Full-year 2018 earnings estimates however remained unchanged at $1.48 per share in the last 60 days.Further, current quarter and full-year 2018 sales are estimated to decline 8.1% and 4.2%, respectively.The downward estimate revisions reflect pessimism over the prospects of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other Bearish ReadingsROC and ROEReturn on Capital (ROC) of Verifone is 7.1% compared with 19.9% for the industry. This implies that the company generates a lower return on investment than its industry.Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. Verifone’s trailing 12-month ROE undercuts its growth potential. The stock’s current ROE stands at 18.9% compared with the industry’s ROE of 37.2%.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company. To this end, Verifone seems to be a highly leveraged stock with a reading of 93.5% compared with 61.7% for the industry.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Fiserv (FISV  -  Free Report), Global Payments (GPN  -  Free Report) and Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report). All the stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #2.The projected earnings growth rate (3-5 years) for Fiserv, Global Payments and Mastercard is 11.5%, 15.8% and 18.3%, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2517,MA,"Mastercard Incorported (MA  -  Free Report), essentially a technology company, is fast incorporating the blockchain technology into its operations. The company is going a step further by trying this novel technology after having made massive investments in its digital platform  over past many years. The need for the same is driven by changing trends in the digital economy, which calls for faster payments via electronic means.The company was the front runner in the adoption of this technology by announcing its blockchain API in 2016. Blockchain is the technology underlying the cryprocurrencies. As the name implies, it is a chain of blocks which gets built step by step. As each transaction takes place, it is put into a block, which is then connected to the previous block, the transactions are blocked together to form an irreversible chain.Though this technology is still in its nascent stage and its full potential remains yet to be harnessed, it is widely believed to be a game changer. The benefits of blockchain cannot be undermined in the payments space given the speed, flexibility, security and cost effectiveness it provides to the transactions.Last year, Mastercard launched its own blockchain network to implement the technology in the business-to-business (B2B) space to address challenges of speed, transparency and costs in cross-border payments. Mastercard intends to take advantage of the blockchain technology and the Mastercard Settlement Network to transfer funds between bank accounts. The Mastercard Settlement Network reads the blockchain and will transfer the funds between two banks. It then writes a confirmation of transfer to the Mastercard blockchain.The Mastercard blockchain technology will complement the company’s existing capabilities including virtual cards, Mastercard Send and Vocalink to support all types of cross-border, B2B payment flows — account-based, blockchain-based and card-based. The company is, however, not using the digital currency but keeping its transaction base in fiat currency.The company recently joined Enterprise Etherum Alliance, an open source block-chain consortium, to explore the potential of the etherum technology across a gamut of uses among which some are outside the scope of Mastercard’s traditional payments environment.  Year to date, Mastercard’s stock has gained 65% significantly, outperforming the industry’s growth of 38%.Another company in the same space, Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report), is working on the blockchain technology. American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) last November, joined blockchain network RippleNet to explore the use of this technology for faster, more efficient B2B payments. Recently, The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office released the patent application filed by American Express Travel Related Services Company, the payment technology firm’s travel unit, which outlines the use of blockchain technology to accelerate payments between two parties. Its application emphasizes the potential for blockchain to enhance existing card networks.Mastercard carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another player worth considering from in the same space is Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report), which carries the same Zacks Rank as Mastercard and surpassed earnings expectation in each of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 4%.

2518,MA,"The players in the Financial Transaction Services industry have performed decently so far this year driven by improvement in U.S. economy, low unemployment, reduced inflation, and healthy consumer confidence that resulted in increased business volumes.The industry is also witnessing a shift from cash payments to online transactions, thanks to increased proliferation of information technology. Other forms of payments via plastic cards — credit, debit, charge and other cards — have also rapidly overtaken cash payments. Ease of carrying, safety against theft, payment flexibility, attractive rewards and a number of other features of plastic cards continue to boost transaction volume growth.Changing Industry TrendsThe economic growth in the United States has resulted in higher disposable income, eventually leading to greater customer spending. Plastic is now preferred over paper and borrowings are chosen over savings.  This has significantly propelled the companies’ transaction sales volume. Continuing the trend, the last reported quarter also saw solid revenue growth.Alternative payment modes such as e-wallets, mobile and digital currencies are gaining fast acceptance among customers. Cutting-edge technology that provides greater transaction security, flexibility, accessibility, touch-points and speed, all at a lower cost, has made digital transactions more attractive. Inspired by this, players in this space are making huge investments to support the development of new and emerging technologies in order to drive consumer spending.Inorganic growth has been a major attribute of the industry. The players have been consolidating through mergers and acquisitions, and indulging in strategic alliances and partnerships in order to expand their operations. Recent acquisitions of NuData Security by Mastercard Inc (MA  -  Free Report) and Heartland Payments by Global Payments, Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report), investment by Visa Inc (V  -  Free Report) in Swedish company Klarna and many more such deals indicate rise in consolidation activity in the space, which is expected to aid top-line growth. However, inorganic expansion has resulted in vast international operations for the Financial Transaction Services players, exposing them to foreign exchange volatility.One major threat faced by the industry is growing incidents of cyber-attacks and data leakage. Organizations are regularly updating their software and fraud detection systems in order to address this issue. They are also educating their consumers on basic security features.Moreover, the companies have been suffering from a persistent rise in operating costs led by higher marketing expenses by players in order to attract more customers amid stiff rivalry. Another major expense is massive investments in digitization that would hurt margins before reaping benefits in the long term.Industry Rank and Price PerformanceThe industry is thriving and its superior performance is evident from its rally of 32% in a year compared with 17.6% gain registered by the S&P 500. Therefore, investing in stocks in this industry is expected to generate decent returns over time.Stocks to ConsiderWe zeroed in on three stocks from the industry that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have also seen upward estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Moreover, these stocks have maintained their stellar performance in a year’s time.Green Dot Corporation (GDOT  -  Free Report) is an issuer of prepaid MasterCard and Visa cards in the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2017 earnings has being revised 3.4% upward while the same for 2018 increased 4.2% over the last 60 days. The company’s shares have rallied 140.1%, outperforming the both the industry and the S&P 500. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2.

2519,MA,"Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 17, before the opening bell.While we expect the company to witness top-line growth on the back of strategic business initiatives, higher organic growth and change in currency rates, lower U.S tax rates are likely to  have a positive impact on Omnicom’s earnings.We observe that shares of Omnicom have depreciated 15.1% over the past year against the S&P 500 Index’s gain of 13.8%. Organic Growth & Favorable Currency Likely to Drive Top LineThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $3.61 billion, reflecting year-over-year increase of 0.7%. We expect the company to witness top-line growth on the back of higher organic growth and positive currency impacts.The company expects foreign currency to have a positive impact of around 3-4% on first-quarter 2018 revenues. The guidance calls for more improvement than the 2.4% impact in fourth-quarter 2017.In the fourth quarter, the company’s revenues had declined 1.5%. Organic growth was 1.6% in the quarter.Omnicom Group Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Omnicom Group Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Omnicom Group Inc. Quote Strategic investments, organizational changes and important acquisitions as well as partnerships and expansion efforts coupled with business opportunities are other factors which will drive the company’s top-line growth. The company’s strong competitive position across advertising and marketing business is a positive. Increasing global presence acts as another key growth catalyst. The company’s efforts to stay technologically updated to meet varying customer and client demands in areas of digital media, data as well as analytics look impressive.Tax Cut to Positively Impact Bottom LineThe new tax (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, effective from December 2017), which reduced corporate tax rates significantly from 35% to 21%, will benefit Omnicom’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. The company projects 2018 effective tax rates to reduce 350-450 basis points (bps). Notably, the consensus estimate for current quarter earnings is pegged at $1.05 per share, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 8.3%.In fourth quarter 2017, earnings fell 25.9% from the year-ago quarter.Our Model Doesn’t Suggest a BeatPlease note that according to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) are best avoided, especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Omnicom has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, a combination that makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the broader Business Services sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in first-quarter 2018:Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.39% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is slated to report quarterly numbers on May 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.CoreLogic, Inc.

(FLT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to report quarterly numbers on May 7.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

2520,MA,"If you are an avid investor, you must also be a diehard fan of the Oracle of Omaha. Warren Buffet has consistently beaten the markets for decades by accumulating positions in some of the world’s sought-after companies. These companies have reliable business models that have stood the test of time, while they also generate plenty of cash and provide dividends, which are indicators of a strong and sustainable business.Thus, let us focus on Buffet’s favorite companies that are likely to make the most of the first-quarter earnings season. Such companies are positioned to report upbeat earnings results, which could eventually lead to an uptick in share price. But before we do so, let us look at his top stock holdings from his darling sectors:Financials Scoops Up Top SpotBuffett has huge stakes in several financial stocks. He has, particularly, liked American Express since the 1960s. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) holds around 151.6 million shares of the credit card giant, valued at $15 billion. When it comes to banks, Berkshire has a sizeable position in Bank of America, which is nearly $20.4 billion. Buffett’s second-largest holding is America’s second most profitable bank, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report). Berkshire holds 452.8 million shares of Wells Fargo, which indicates that Buffett is quite optimistic about the current financial environment.A recent move by the Fed to raise rates bodes well for banks. Needless to say, ultra-low interest rates have weighed on their margins in the last decade. But, this time around, higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities (read more: Banks Set for Blockbuster Q1 Earnings: 5 Top Picks).Consumer Goods Comes SecondBuffett has a sizeable position in consumer stocks like The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and Kraft Heinz. Coca-Cola is much trusted as Buffet has assured that he will never sell shares in the renowned beverage company. Berkshire held around 400 million shares of Coca-Cola, making it the company’s fourth-largest holding. Kraft Heinz is another consumer staples firm where Buffett and his company has 325.6 million shares, worth $25.3 billion.Consumer staples seems to be the safest option at a time when markets are plagued with widespread uncertainty. Trump talk of Syria bombing, unabated trade tensions, high profile departures in the Trump administration and midterm election year spell a rough phase for stocks. Staples, on the other hand, is generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the state of the larger market.Tech Takes Third SpotThe Trump administration’s initiative to cut tax rates, in the meantime, has already provided the much-needed windfall to computer and software makers. Any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%, per the latest tax law.The lowering of the tax rate will encourage big tech companies to bring back funds held overseas. This in turn will let these companies carry out share buybacks, pay dividends, and engage in M&A activities. Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) will make the most of the positive tax overhaul initiative by repatriating hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. It is also the most valuable holding in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.Industrials & Airlines in FocusBuffett has the fourth-largest stake in the Industrials sector. And why not? Improving global economies and firm business investment helped factories expand at a record pace. Manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs, reflecting sustained strength in the sector.But, Buffet has started to show keen interest in airlines which he earlier used to steer clear of. He believes that planes being more efficient and relationships between unions being better will certainly help airlines fly high. Buffett holds several airlines, but, Southwest Airlines is the most valuable.3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Consider in Q1 EarningsAs mentioned above, American business magnate Warren Buffet’s preferred sectors are poised to gain in the near term. But, not all of his choices from the aforesaid sectors will report a significant uptick in Q1 earnings.We have, thus, figured out three of his top stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP. This is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of credit ratings, research, and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets.Buffett particularly likes Moody’s as the company continues to post strong numbers, so there’s some real money-making potential there. The company, in the most recent quarter, declared an operating income of $462.8 million.The company is expected to report earnings results for the quarter ending in March on Apr 27. Moody's has an Earnings ESP of +0.85%. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26.9%, better than the industry’s estimated growth of 21.4%.Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of credit ratings, research, and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets.Buffett favors Mastercard as an increasing number of customers are switching to cashless payments, as it is preferred by most businessmen.The company is likely to report earnings results for the quarter ending in March on May 2. Mastercard has an Earnings ESP of +2.39%. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 29.7%, well ahead of the industry’s projected growth of 15%.Visa Inc (V  -  Free Report) is a payments technology company that connects consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities to electronic payments.Buffett likes Visa as the company has the same competitive advantages and business qualities that Mastercard possesses.Visa is expected to report earnings results for the March quarter on Apr 25. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.25%. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26.2%, above the industry’s projected growth of 15%.

But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

2521,MA,"A leading international provider of payment technology services, Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) recently introduced a simpler option called Apple Pay through a joint venture with CaixaBank, the leader in retail banking in Spain.The venture named Comercia Global Payments EP, S.L will provide Apple Pay service via CaixaBank Pay app to its users, who can add their CaixaBank cards to Apple Wallet and effortlessly use the facility for purchases at any contactless enabled retail location.Notably, Apple Pay is a mobile payment and digital wallet service provided by Apple Inc.Apple Pay is Apple’s popular contactless payment system for mobile phones and the platform has grown significantly since its launch in 2014. This service provides an easier, secure mode of payment that is also time efficient.The cashless service enables transactions generating a unique identification code rather than saving actual card numbers on the devices or Apple servers. This provision nullifies the incidence of theft, thereby making dealings very safe and protected.Expanding the Apple Pay service in Spain and across Europe will help Global Payments increase its customer base as well as enhance its reputation as a renowned payment solution company. Global Payments already offers Apple Pay service in the United States, U.K., Canada, Singapore and China.Other players supporting Android Pay are Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report), Mastercard Inc.

(AXP  -  Free Report) et al.Year to date, the company’s shares have returned 43%, outpacing the 37% growth of the industry it belongs to.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) player also offers Samsung Pay and Android Pay services to various parts of the world. It remains focused on improved security measures and strategic alliances with various financial institutions to extend the reach of mobile payment applications in eCommerce and mobile transactions (mCommerce).

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2522,MA,"First Data Corporation (FDC  -  Free Report), the commerce-enabling technology company, entered into a partnership with AccorHotels to enable hassle free and smooth global and cross-channel payments.AccorHotels Group is the world’s leading hotel operator in travel and lifestyle. It offers services in more than 4,200 hotels, resorts, residences and in more than 10,000 private residences worldwide.We observe that First Data has outperformed the industry it belongs to on a year-to-date basis.

2524,MA,"In the Global Week Ahead, USA large-cap stock markets look quieter, with so many earnings results already priced in. Third quarter earnings season has 81% of S&P500 companies completed.To date, the market has been rewarding upside earnings surprises less than average and is punishing downside earnings surprises more than average.Why? Trump tax ebullience got this market ahead of itself on valuation. The forward P/E ratio is at 18.0. That’s high, folks.Yet, other than for insurance companies, results have been good. The earnings growth rate for the third quarter is at +5.9%.48 S&P500 companies report results in the week ahead. Interesting names to watch include:Monday: Knight Swift Transportation (KNX  -  Free Report), Manitowoc (MTW  -  Free Report)Tuesday: Hecla Mining (HL  -  Free Report), Royal Caribbean (RCL  -  Free Report)Wednesday: MGM Resorts (MGM  -  Free Report), Regeneron Pharma (REGN  -  Free Report)Thursday: Brookfield Asset Management , Macy’s (M  -  Free Report)Friday: Arcelor Mittal (MT  -  Free Report)For the rest of the world, Reuter’s bureau in London identified five World Market Themes.(1) President Trump Tours AsiaU.S. President Donald Trump is on his first trip to Asia. He has stopped in Japan already, and will go on to South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.Security concerns in the Korean peninsula and the South China Sea will grab a lot of attention.But investors will also look at trade talks, with Trump particularly keen to address his country’s vast trade deficit with China that Beijing calls unintentional, but which he calls “horrible.”(2) Bitcoin Talk Bubbles OverInvestors’ appetite for bitcoin appears to have no bounds.The digital currency climbed above $7,000 on Thursday for the first time ever, after an astronomical increase of more than 900 percent over the past 12 months. News that the world’s biggest derivatives exchange operator, CME Group, was set to launch bitcoin futures was seen as a significant step in bitcoin’s road to mainstream adoption, driving the latest surge in price.But with high-profile investors such as Warren Buffett and the head of Credit Suisse saying in recent days that the bitcoin market represents a bubble, could that be set to burst in spectacular fashion?What is to stop a rival cryptocurrency — of which there is a potentially unlimited quantity — from becoming investors’ digital currency of choice?With bitcoin now worth more than $120 billion, more than Citi or Goldman Sachs, the consequences of a sudden crash could be severe.(3) The JOLTS Labor Market Survey Is Out for the USAThe Nov. 7th release of the September Job Opening and Labor Turnover (JOLT) survey will show whether demand for labor has held up or is in need of an — ahem — jolt.At the moment, the ratio of job openings versus quit jobs is close to 2 to 1, hovering in a range close to the all-time peak of 2.12 hit in July 2015.(4) Italian Bank Earnings Are OutItaly’s biggest banks, including UniCredit, Intesa and Banco BPM, report their latest earnings and they could make encouraging reading following the euro zone-wide pick-up in growth and a strong rally in Italian debt over the last month.It certainly seems a long time since last year’s bail out of problem child Monte dei Paschi di Siena. It is now back in the market, and the main Italian banks are comfortably outperforming their euro zone peers in share performance, so the results round should be telling.(5) Ah Yes, VENEZUELA!After what feels like years of speculation, OPEC member Venezuela’s socialist leader Nicolas Maduro wants to restructure the ailing country’s foreign debt.Maduro has invited Venezuelan bondholders to a Nov. 13th meeting in Caracas to discuss the matter, although getting clearance from the compliance department could be interesting for the bankers involved.Vice President Tareck El Aissami, who is on a U.S. blacklist for alleged drug trafficking, said the country remained committed to paying all its debt but wanted to reformulate terms with creditors, which is likely to mean some lively bouts of price discovery.Top Zacks Rank Stocks(1) Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report): This is the $352 billion market cap oil giant.

And after a stellar quarterly earnings report, it is back to a #1 Rank. This stock’s long-term Zacks VGM score is B. I see more room to run here.(3) Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report): What would the world be (barring a move to Bitcoin) without credit cards? This is a $159 billion market cap stock now. That tells us the vast, vast majority of us use credit cards to make online and in store purchases.  The Zacks Rank is a #1 and the long-term Zacks score is a D. With an F for Zacks Value, this bull story is well and truly overbought.Key Global Macro—A wave of 5 central bank decisions happens across Asia. Think of Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Don’t expect any  change here.On Thursday, the central bank’s of Mexico (Banxico) and Peru (Banco Central de Reserva del Peru) issue policy decisions.Expect Banxico to hold its policy rate at 7.0% for the third straight.Meeting: The last hike happened in June. Peru should hold fast at 3.5%.Mexico’s central bankers should look through a transitory soft patch in Mexico’s economy during Q3 that was influenced by hurricanes and earthquakes.On Friday, Brazil’s inflation rate will be a focus.On Monday, Indonesia’s GDP growth rate came in at +5.0% y/y.The final composite Eurozone Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) came out. The reading was 56, better than the prior 55.9.The Markit PMI for Brazil was 49.5, down from 51.1.  50 marks expansion, so this is important data.On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) should keeps its overnight rate at 1.5%.Industrial production in Germany comes out. The prior was 4.7% y/y.Russia’s CPI comes out. The prior was +3.0% y/y, and the forecast is +2.8% y/y.On Wednesday, the National Bank of Poland issues its new base rate. The rate has been 1.5% and is not expected to change.Portugal’s unemployment rate is 8.8%. We get a new reading here. Remember the PIiGs? That seems long gone now. Time moves on fast and worries do change.The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) should keep its policy rate at 1.75%. It’s similar to the RBA in Australia.On Thursday, Malaysia’s central bank (BNM) issues its overnight policy rate. The 3.0% rate is not expected to change.The central bank of the Philippines (BSP) should also stay pat at 3.0%.Greece’s unemployment rate is 21%.U.S. initial claims should remain low at 229K.On Friday, Singapore’s GDP growth rate comes out. 4.6% y/y was the prior.Brazil’s IBGE inflation rate (their CPI) comes out. The look is for 2.73% y/y from 2.54%.University of Michigan consumer sentiment gets tested again, in the USA. The prior was 100.7.

2526,MA,"Yesterday before the opening bell, the first indictments and first conviction in the Russia collusion scandal in the 2016 U.S. presidential election helped pump the brakes on the extended bull-market rally. Trump’s former campaign manager and a long-time aide face 12 grand jury charges, while a low-level Trump campaign operative has already pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Stock market indexes closed lower Monday, following seven straight up weeks.Whether or not this becomes an albatross on the stock market depends greatly on one’s perspective: Zacks Exec VP Kevin Matras, in his latest Profit from the Pros column this morning, sees the Paul Manafort indictments as little more than a temporary distraction. Those who believe Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller is likely to end his investigation soon and has already exhausted his findings will likely feel the same way: nothing more than a blip, a market breather. Though there does seem to be a greater risk hovering that the Mueller investigation is not wrapping up but just beginning to unfold. If such is the case, market participants may be more trepidatious moving forward.Not today, though: futures for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 are all up in Halloween Tuesday’s pre-market. Far from being spooked, or fear of a “trick,” traders and investors are apparently looking for plenty of “treats.”With good reason, as well: while the Case-Shiller August home sales report is expected to bring 6% growth in U.S. home sales (this is a trailing indicator, but is considered to be the most sound housing data economists see regularly), the Paychex small-business report this morning demonstrates the most stable quarter in the history of the small business index. Though jobs growth has begun to slow, wage increases look to be keeping pace with economic growth. Minneapolis, Denver and Seattle were among the cities seeing the strongest small business growth.And jobs data is expected to be strong, both tomorrow with the private-sector ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) payroll report and Friday’s all-encompassing non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Even with a hurricane-affected quarter, jobs growth is expected to remain robust, with unemployment remaining around a low-to-mid 4% range, indicative of a very strong domestic labor market.Q3 Earnings RoundupAfter the bell we expect to hear from U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), but ahead of the opening bell we see plenty of strength in Q3 performance:Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report) outperformed earnings and revenue estimates, posting $1.34 per share on revenues of $3.4 billion topping the $1.23 per share and $3.3 billion expected. Quarterly sales rose 18% year over year, with higher switched transactions in the quarter and cross-border volumes up 15%. Shares are up 1.7% at this hour in the pre-market.BP (BP  -  Free Report) also trounced expectations, reporting 57 cents per share on $60.81 billion in quarterly sales, which easily beat the $8.04 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Oil production year over year was up 16.4%, and shares of BP rose 2.5% initially upon the quarterly news.Other earnings beats this morning include pharma giant Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and consumer staples major Kellogg (K), which both beat earnings expectations. Pfizer was in-line on its top-line, while Kellogg outperformed our consensus. Both stocks are trading up in today’s pre-market.Under Armour , however, is a much different story: although earnings of 22 cents per share beat estimates by 4 cents, quarterly sales posted a miss.

2528,MA,"Verifone Systems, Inc. (PAY  -  Free Report) announced on Apr 9, 2018 that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an investor group led by San Francisco-based Francisco Partners and Canada-based British Columbia Investment Management Corporation.Deal DetailsThe investor group will buy Verifone for $23.04 per share in cash. The value represents a total consideration of approximately $3.4 billion, inclusive of Verifone’s net debt.Verifone’s shareholders will receive $23.04 per share in cash, which is about 54% higher than the stock’s closing price of $15.00 on Apr 9, 2018.The deal also includes a ‘go shop’ period till May 24, 2018. In the interim, VeriFone’s board of directors and advisers can seek bids from other companies for alternative buyout proposals.Subject to customary regulatory and shareholder approvals, the deal is expected to close in third-quarter 2018. Post completion of the deal, Verifone will become a privately-held company.Share Price SkyrocketsFollowing the announcement of the deal, shares of Verifone gained 51.9% to close the trading session on Apr 10 at $22.78.Moreover, the stock has performed pretty well in the past six months. Shares have returned 11.8%, outperforming the S&P 500 Index’s and industry’s rise of 4.3% and 10.9%, respectively. Verifone Fails to Withstand Mounting CompetitionRapid adoption of new payment methods like contactless, NFC as well as mobile cloud-based payments, robust product portfolio, optimistic acquisitions and growth opportunities in under-penetrated countries are some of the strategic business initiatives undertaken by Verifone to strengthen foothold in the industry.Despite such strategies,mounting competition from lower-cost, mobile alternatives likes Square (SQ  -  Free Report), entry of new market entrants and latest technologies, declining revenues, divestures as well as buyout-related woes continued to bother VeriFone. A leveraged balance sheet is another headwind.Notably, for the past two fiscal years, the company reported declining revenues. Net revenues decreased 0.4% year over year in 2016 and 6.1% in 2017. We believe that the divestment decision was triggered by this continuous decline. Annual revenues are expected to decrease further in the upcoming days.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderVerifone is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

2529,MA,"Blockchain is the new buzzword for innovation in the payments industry. Often taken as a synonym for bitcoin, players in the industry are aiming for the blockchain technology given its obvious benefits with regard to speed, accuracy, cost effectiveness, security, and much more.The terms blockchain and bitcoin are widely used interchangeably, but the misconception that blockchain is the technology  underlying the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is changing fast. Though there still remains ambiguity regarding the investment value of the digital currencies which have not yet received broad-based adoption and are often steered clear of, the technology underlying these digital currencies, the blockchain have received a thumbs up in the business world.The Rise of BlockchainAs the name implies, blockchain is a chain of blocks building step by step. As each transaction takes place, it is put into a block, which is then connected to the previous block. The transactions are blocked together to form an irreversible chain.The secured storage and transmission of data through a decentralized database is the most attractive feature of the blockchain technology. Originally used for cryptocurrency transactions, the system is transparent and incorruptible and meant to provide unaltered information.Driven by multi-industrial adoption, the technology has rapidly gained traction over the last few years. The solutions offered by other key players in this domain like International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT) have been adopted by the insurance, banking, food supply and automobile industries among others.There is a huge amount of activity around blockchain technology, and payments is definitely one of the key spaces to watch.Blockchain in Payments IndustryThe attraction of the blockchain technology is hidden in the benefits it provides in three necessary areas of payments   —   speed, cost and security.Highly Secured: One of the main purviews of a payments company is to provide highly secure payments service, and block chain perfectly fits the bill here. Data for transactions taking place via blockchain can be stored with all details such as the transaction amount, a guarantee of payment, confirmation of the payment and account profiles for the parties involved. Data theft on a blockchain becomes highly impossible because if data is changed on one node, every other node would have to reflect that change for it to take effect. Since blockchain uses a distributed consensus, tampering with its records without being noticed by an entire network is difficult. This makes the system extremely safe.With minimum chances of double counting and hacking, the possibility of monetary losses is low via cybercrime. With increasing instances of cybercrime, which per a recent report by Cybersecurity Ventures is expected to cost global businesses over $6 trillion by 2021, this secured ledger-based technology is bound to gain further importance.Cost Effective: Players are looking forward to blockchain for a solution to address high cost associated with the payments process under the present scenario, which involves costly, time-consuming, paper-based manual process. At present, fees have to be paid to various parties involved in payment processing and at times there are other fees at various other stages of the transaction. All these costs get elimination under blockchain since it nullifies the involvement of a third party in transaction processing, which pulls down overall costs.Speed Enhancement: At present cross border payments are carried out through correspondent banks and not via a central clearing house, which lengthens the whole process, along with making it inefficient. Demand for speedier and efficient service makes blockchain technology the perfect fit here. On a blockchain-based payment, gateway payments can be sent anywhere around the world in 15 to 20 seconds by eliminating intermediaries and using algorithms to verify and authorize payments instantly. This can shorten the whole process which under traditional model takes up to three days, thereby reducing the overall wait time for transaction processing.In Kenya, BitPesa is using the blockchain method to enable companies to make faster, cheaper payments between African countries without having to rely on slow and inefficient local banking infrastructure, according to a Citi Research report.Adoption by CarriersThe blockchain technology is being adopted by industry players with arms wide open.It was recently reported that Ripple, the U.S. digital payments company, is working with 61 Japanese banks to apply blockchain technology for efficient cash transfers.Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report) launched its own blockchain network last year to implement the technology in the business-to-business (B2B) space to address challenges of speed, transparency and costs in cross-border payments. The Mastercard blockchain technology will complement the company’s existing capabilities including virtual cards, Mastercard Send and Vocalink to support all types of cross-border, B2B payment flows – account-based, blockchain-based and card-based.The company recently joined Enterprise Etherum Alliance to explore the potential of the etherum technolohy across a gamut of uses among which some are outside the scope of Mastercard’s traditional payments environment.  Another major company Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) has recently launched Visa B2B Connect, a payment platform powered by the blockchain technology. Via this platform, Visa will offer its services using 23 fiat currencies and 4 partner banks including Commerce Bank in the US, Shinhan Bank in South Korea, Sberbank in Russia and United Overseas Bank in Singapore.Last year, American Express Inc. (AXP  -  Free Report) inked a deal to use the blockchain technology to pay U.K. customers who bank with Santander. Recently, CoinDesk reported that the company has filed a patent related to blockchain. Reports noted that the company’s filing emphasized the potential for blockchain to enhance existing card networks.Still a Long Way to GoGiven the fact that the technology is still in its nascent stages, there remains difficulty in understanding its functionality and applicability. It may thus take a few years before it becomes widely accepted. It is nonetheless a fact that blockchain is the forthcoming reality which would be transformational for the payments industry. We therefore expect to see increased activity on this front, going forward.Among the companies mentioned (in the payments industry) above, Visa carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Mastercard and American Express each sport a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2530,MA,"Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) has witnessed immense growth in its business with the help of vast amount of investments in technology, made over years. The need for the same is driven by changing trends in the digital economy, which call for faster payments via electronic means. Last year, global digital payment volume exceeded cash for the first time in history.This technology company in the global payments industry connects its consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide via its digital platforms -- Masterpass, Mastercard Send and Masterpass QR.One of the most notable achievements of the company is Masterpass, which is a global digital payment service that allows consumers to make fast, simple and secure transactions using any device and across any channel.Mastercard Send connects more people, businesses and governments to facilitate the transfer of funds quickly and securely, both domestically and cross-border, in over 100 markets.Masterpass QR allows mobile phone users to make safe, in-person purchases without any card and it also helps to avoid any expensive point of sale equipment.To speed up its technological capabilities, the company also opted for related acquisitions. In the same vein, last year, the company snapped up Vocalink, which operates systems for Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments and ATM processing platforms in the United Kingdom and other countries.ACH payments constitute a significant amount of all payments made by consumers, businesses and governments.  The addition of ACH payments to the company’s core card-based business will expand its ability to offer more electronic payment options to consumers, businesses and governments, and will also help it capture more payment flows.Mastercard’s technological investments bore fruits by increasing payment flows, led by transaction growth. This has driven revenues, which witnessed a CAGR of 11% between 2012 and 2017. The company projects revenue growth in the ""high end of low double-digits"" for 2018. In 2017 revenues grew by 15%.In a year’s time, the company’s shares have gained 63%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 37.5%. The company is also in the process of using blockchain technology to provide a new way for consumers, businesses and banks to transact. It is the key strategy of the company to provide payment solutions that will meet every need of financial institutions and their end-customers.Other players in the industry, including Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report), Total System Services, Inc. (TSS  -  Free Report) and American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report), are constantly investing money in technological innovations. Visa’s digital platforms -- VisaNet, Visa Direct, Visa Checkout -- have enabled it to garner increased transaction volumes.Mastercard carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Its continued investments in physical-digital convergence will keep it ahead in an industry witnessing rapid technology usage and accrue to its top line. Also, several new deals, extension of partnerships and agreements, new product launches, upgrades and alliances will be accruing to Mastercard's top line.Expanding Service Business: The company's efforts in expanding its services business, which has been posting strong earnings, are its differentiators in the market. Higher utilization of the company's service offerings led to revenue acceleration in the previous quarter, and the same is expected in the quarter to be reported.Other FactorsMasterCard’s top line in the third quarter would gain traction from its massive international business.The company's disciplined cost management will add to its bottom line.Earnings will, however, be offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to the impact of new and renewed agreements. Also, accelerated advertising and marketing spend is likely to hamper the company's bottom line.We expect to see a lower tax rate led by higher earnings from lower tax-rate international markets (accounting for more than 60% of the company’s revenues) than in the prior year.MasterCard’s use of capital in buying back shares will provide an extra cushion to its bottom line.Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Mastercard Incorporated QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that Mastercard is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

2540,MA,"Gender diversity is en vogue with the number of female corporate leaders going up. More female employees are taking the top positions in a number of companies. After dropping to 21 in 2016, the number of women CEOs on Fortune 500 increased more than 50% to a record 32 at the start of 2017.However, the number declined to 27 as of Jan 2018 and will drop further down to 24 by April. Despite this, women hold 21% of board seats at S&P 500 companies per Catalyst, a group researching women and work.Several researches show that the companies led by women have constantly outperformed the market. According to the analysis by the bank Nordea, companies with a woman in the chief executive or chairman role have performed far better than a major global index over the past eight years. The annualized returns for female-led firms, based on an equal weighting, was 25% since 2009, compared with just 11% for the broader market — the MSCI World Index (read: Top-Ranked Sector ETFs & Stocks From Top Industries).Given the long history of outperformance, many investors are seeking to add female-centric companies to their portfolio although the list is still small. While betting on an individual company is certainly a good option, investors can also play this space with lower risk and higher diversification benefits in a basket form.Currently, there are a couple of products offering broad exposure to women-led companies. We have highlighted them in detail below.SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE  -  Free Report)This ETF offers exposure to U.S. companies that demonstrate greater gender diversity within senior leadership than other firms in their sector by tracking the SSGA Gender Diversity Index. Holding 169 stocks, it is moderately concentrated on the top firms as each account for less than 5.7% of assets. Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) are top three holdings. From a sector look, information technology takes the largest share at 22.6%, followed by healthcare (16.9%), consumer staples (13.3%) and consumer discretionary (12.1%). The product has amassed $318.8 million in its asset base while trades in light volume of about 11,000 shares. It charges 20 bps in annual fees and has gained 10.3% over the past year (read: Tech ETFs & Stocks Surviving the Market Rout in February).Barclays Women in Leadership ETN (WIL  -  Free Report)This product is linked to the performance of the Barclays Women in Leadership Total Return USD Index, which provides exposure to U.S.-based companies that satisfy one or both of the gender diversity criteria of having a female chief executive officer or having at least 25% female members on the board of directors. The ETN has amassed $36.7 million in its asset base and trades in a paltry volume of around 200 shares. Expense ratio comes in at 0.45%. The note is up 7.2% over the past year (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2541,MA,"The Business Services sector (one of the Zacks 16 sectors) covers an array of services including marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. Thus, the outlook of the business services sector is firmly tied to the broader economy.The Trump administration’s business friendly approach, a strong U.S. economy, reduced tax rates, robust manufacturing activity and improvements in the labor market are currently major positives for the sector.What’s Going in Favor of Business Services Sector?Tax Cuts, Trump Administration’s Efforts to Boost SectorThe Trump administration remains focused on improving the ease of doing business as evident from the recent tax cuts. The historic overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax liabilities from 35% to 21% has boosted corporate earnings, increased investments and in some instances also reflected in employee rewards. In addition, Trump’s pledge to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years and regulatory rollbacks remain tailwinds.Employment and Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing ActivityThe employment index registered a growth of 57.3% in March which indicates employment growth in March for the 18th consecutive month. Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 12 reported employment growth. The increase came as companies are gearing up to hire more skilled workers and indirect personnel.Economic activity in the manufacturing sector expanded in March and the overall economy grew for the 107th consecutive month. U.S. manufacturing activity continued its robust performance in March as the PMI measured by ISM touched 59.3%. This indicates strong growth in manufacturing for the 19th consecutive month, led by continued expansion in new orders, production activity, employment and inventories, with suppliers continuing to struggle delivering to demand. Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 17 reported growth in March.As far as the non-manufacturing sector is concerned, NMI stood at 58.8% in March, recording the 98th consecutive month of expansion. The Prices Index and the Employment Index gained 0.5% and 1.6% to hit 61.5% and 56.6%, respectively. As many as 15 non-manufacturing industries reported growth.Consecutive upsurge in the PMI, NMI as well as greater number of jobs offered by manufacturing giants buoys further optimism.Price PerformanceThe sector has performed well in the past year when compared with the benchmark. The sector has gained 15.7%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 12.5% in the said time frame.What’s in Store for the Sector This Earnings Season?We are approaching the first earnings season of the year. Per the latest Earnings Outlook report, total earnings for the sector are expected to be up 10.7% on 4.8% higher revenues.The primary growth drivers in this highly fragmented industry are a healthy economy with decent prospects of job growth, higher disposable income and new business initiatives. An ideal mix of services, effective marketing strategies and ability to retain and attract new customers make the perfect recipe for profitability for most of these companies.Given the forecast, it might be a good idea to zero in on a handful of business services stocks that are poised to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

2542,MA,"Shares of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) climbed premarket after the Wall Street Journal reported that the e-commerce giant hopes to enter the ever-growing person-to-person payment business. The move would put Amazon in direct competition with PayPal’s (PYPL  -  Free Report) Venmo as well as some big banks.Amazon is in the early stages of developing peer-to-peer payment technology for its widely popular Alexa voice assistant, according to the Journal’s report.In theory, this move would allow users to pay their friends, family, and possibly bills—similar to banking apps—by simply saying “Hey Alexa, pay John $50 for concert tickets.” This news helped send shares of PayPal and Square (SQ  -  Free Report) down premarket.The person-to-person payment business has grown hugely over the last few years, driven by Venmo and others. This has forced big banks, like JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), to invest heavily in mobile payments technology.Amazon’s entry into the peer-to-peer payment business would also encroach on credit cards firms such as Visa (V  -  Free Report) and MasterCard (MA  -  Free Report), which have invested in various fintech ventures for some time.For this payment initiative to work, Amazon might need even more access to consumer’s personal information, but this doesn’t seem to have been an issue for many customers, up to this point. It is also part of a larger move by Amazon to enter the financial sector, which includes possibly creating a checking account-like service.Amazon currently offers an online and digital payment service called Amazon Pay that is similar to PayPal.If Amazon does eventually offer peer-to-peer payment through Alexa, or even Prime, the company could easily grab a large portion of this quickly expanding economic sector. Nearly half of U.S. households are Amazon Prime members, according to a Consumer Intelligence Research Partners report.Venmo’s payment volume did expand by 97% last year, with the app processing roughly $35 billion worth of total payments. The company does not publish total user data, though some of the most recent estimates put its monthly users at around 7 million. Meanwhile, the more established, PayPal, currently boasts 227 million active customer accounts around the world.There is no official timetable or even confirmation that Amazon will offer peer-to-peer payment options. But if history is any guide, Jeff Bezos’ company will eagerly enter into another sector of the economy without hesitation. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2547,MA,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is picking pace, with 26% of the S&P 500 members have reported results already, and another 24% slated to report this week. More specifically, the latest Earnings Preview shows approximately 400 companies, including 121 S&P 500 members, reporting their financial results this week.For Business Services, Q4 earnings are expected to be up 6.8% from the same period last year on 5.0% higher revenues. This would follow 11.5% earnings growth in Q3 on 5.5% growth in revenues.Let’s take a look at two important stocks, Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) and Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report), which will release results on Feb 1. Notably, both companies are grouped under the Financial Transaction Services subsector which falls under the Business Services sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).While, Mastercard will report fourth-quarter 2017 results, Visa is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 numbers.A Glance at the IndustryThe global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change. Technology and innovation is shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce, mobile payments, block chain technology and digital currencies.Industry insiders expect demand for debit and credit cards and online payments to continue to surge in the years ahead, as the style of payments shift from cash and checks to plastic and electronic mode. An improving jobs market and low unemployment have set a positive trend in consumer spending by increasing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards and devices. These shifts in macroeconomic factors bode well for the industry’s growth.Despite the increased adoption of digital payments, cash continues to be the mainstream and makes up for nearly 85% of global transaction. This proves that the industry remains underpenetrated and provides ample scope for long-term growth.Here, we discuss the price performance and fundamentals (financial and non-financial) of the two companies mentioned above to gain an idea about how they will fare this earnings season.We rely on our Zacks methodology to help investors choose the better stock. Our quantitative model states that a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better to deliver earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Price PerformanceWe have compared the price performances of Visa and Mastercard with the broader sector for the October-December 2017 period.Shares of Visa returned 3.7% outperforming the broader sector’s growth of 3.4%. However, Mastercard’s shares gained only 1.7%, underperforming the industry.Visa 4Q Factors at PlayVisa operates the world's largest retail electronic payments network, with more than 2.3 billion Visa-branded credit and debit cards in circulation globally.Visa witnessed a revenue CAGR of 12.7% from 2008-2017. We strongly believe that the company will retain its revenue momentum in the fiscal first quarter on the back of its strong market position and attractive core business that continues to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions, increasing spending via cards, shift to digital form of payments and expansion of service offerings.The company expects annual net revenue growth of high single digits on a nominal dollar basis for fiscal 2018. We expect a year-over-year increase in revenues from each of its business lines — Data Processing, International Transaction and Service — the Zacks Consensus Estimate for each being $2.1 billion, $1.67 billion and $2.1 billion, up 13.3%, 12.4% and 11.2%, respectively.  The company resolved approximately 75% of contract conversions by the end of fiscal 2017, and the remainder will be done primarily in the first half of fiscal 2018. As a result, client incentives in the first half of 2018 will be significantly higher than fiscal 2017. Thus the quarter should enclose higher client incentives.Payment volumes should grow in the fiscal first quarter from the Costco and USAA deal wins. These deals drove U.S. payment volume growth up to the double-digit range in fiscal 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 trillion payment volumes is up 9.3% year over year.Visa boasts an attractive earnings surprise history. It beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters at an average of 8.13%. It is depicetd in the chart below:Visa Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Visa Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Visa Inc. QuoteVisa has an Earnings ESP of +0.15%. This positive ESP coupled with the company’s favorable Zacks Rank #3, reinforces our confidence in an earnings beat this quarter. (Read more: Will Revenues, Payment Volumes Drive Visa Q1 Earnings?).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Mastercard 4Q Factors to ConsiderMastercard is one of the world's largest payment solutions companies, processing transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies. It commands a well-established brand name and extensive merchant-acceptance network.We expect higher net revenues primarily driven by increases across its revenue categories, the accretive impact of acquisitions, higher switched transactions and improved gross dollar volumes. The revenue growth, however, will be offset to a large extent by higher operating and personnel expenses, reflecting continued investment in strategic initiatives.The company's efforts in expanding its services business, which has been posting strong earnings, are its differentiators in the market. Higher utilization of the company's service offerings led to revenue acceleration in the previous quarter, and the same is expected in the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gross Dollar volume which measures all Mastercard Credit Charge and Debit programs, and includes purchase volume plus cash volume, one of the main revenue drivers, is expected to be $1.36 trillion, up almost 11% year over year.The company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the four reported quarters at an average of 5.84%. This is depicted in the chart below:Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Mastercard Incorporated QuoteMastercard has an Earnings ESP of +0.33%. A positive ESP coupled with the company’s favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) makes the case for an earnings beat very strong.(Read more: Mastercard Gears Up for Q4 Earnings, What's in Store?).Our TakePer our proprietary model, Visa and Mastercard are both likely to deliver an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter. Investors should rather focus on the fundamentals of these stalwarts to take any decision.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2548,MA,"Banking on three solid quarters of 2017, the board of Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) announced incremental capital deployment plans, thereby augmenting shareholder returns.In an attempt to boost capital efficiencies, the company hiked its regular quarterly dividend by 14% to 25 cents per share from the prior payout of 22 cents. The raised dividend will be paid on Feb 9, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Jan 9.The increased payout takes the annual dividend to $1.00 from 88 cents paid in 2017. At the current price, the raised yearly dividend yields 0.7%, up from the prior yield of 0.6%.Alongside this hike, the board of Mastercard sanctioned a new share repurchase program worth $4 billion. Including $1.5 billion from the last approval, the company currently has $5.5 billion worth of shares available for buybacksSolid Capital DeploymentMastercard boasts a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility and continued cash generated (that has been increasing save in 2014) from operating activities since 2009. It generated $4.5 billion of operating cash flow in 2016, up 11% year over year. The same was up 8.5% year over year as of Sep 30, 2017.The company’s disciplined capital management strategy by way of share buyback and dividend payments remains impressive. Last December, the company announced a new share buyback program of $4 billion and increased its quarterly dividend by 16%.  Factors at PlayArmed with strong liquidity and cash flows, we believe Mastercard is well positioned to implement the latest capital plans. The improved outlook for card spending, cross-border volumes, gross dollar value and payment volume generation given the recent strategic alliances, improving global economies and rapidly growing digital payments are likely to improve financials, going forward.Notably, global spending through credit and debit cards has grown consistently, boosting cross-border volumes, which drives revenues for card giants. Given the onset of the holiday season, we also expect improved transaction volumes and digital payments as shopping and traveling will be in the cards for most global citizens.Moreover, numerous acquisitions made in recent years have further strengthened the company’s long-term inorganic growth profile, without risking its capital. These factors will likely lead to lucrative shareholder returns and retain market confidence.Share Price PerformanceSo far this year, the stock has returned 42.8%, significantly outperforming the 25.3% gain logged by the industry.Peer TakeOther players in the same space like Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report), Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) and American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) raised their dividend payments this year by 18%,16.7% and 9%, respectively. These companies have been generously returning excess capital through share buybacks as well.Zacks RankCurrently, Mastercard carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2549,MA,"Shares of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) surged more than 1.2% in late-morning trading Monday after new reports linked the company to the financial industry, suggesting that the e-commerce behemoth’s plans to launch new account services might include a major partnership.Amazon has been in talks with JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) and Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) about its proposal to launch a product similar to traditional checking accounts, The Wall Street Journal said Monday. Citing people familiar with the matter, the report indicated that Amazon’s target is younger consumers and people without existing bank accounts.A dive into the financial sector would be another addition to Amazon’s growing list of attempts to influence its customers’ everyday lives. The move would also help the company avoid some of the fees it currently pays financial firms and learn more about people’s income and spending trends.But in talking to JPMorgan and Capital One, Amazon has shown that it does not intend to entirely disrupt the existing structure of the financial business.“Why put up all the capital that’s required to run a bank and why pick up all the extra expense and headache of running a bank when you can go to a Chase and any number of smaller banks and have them license their bank?,” Ali Raza, managing principal at the payments consultancy Blue Leviathan, said to Bloomberg.Amazon already has a few services that might help illustrate its financial vision. For one, the company offers Amazon Cash, a platform that lets users add cash to an Amazon wallet by displaying a barcode in person. This enables customers without a credit card to shop online.Amazon also recently launched Prime Reload, which rewards users with a 2% bonus is they use their debit card to transfer money from a bank account to an Amazon balance. By handling the transaction themselves, Amazon can avoid paying fees to Visa (V  -  Free Report) and Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report).Want more market analysis from this author?

2550,MA,"Optimism of U.S. consumers is at levels not seen in more than a decade and a half. Record low unemployment levels, better-than-expected job addition, strong wage growth and growing GDP have pumped up the spending power of consumers with increased disposable income for discretionary purchases.Moreover, the relaxation of tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act should increase consumers’ propensity to spend more.These trends bode well for the payment and network processors whose revenue growth is directly proportional to the level of consumer spending.Buoyant U.S. EconomyRecent strong developments on various fronts like a decline in jobless claims, growth in consumer spending low unemployment and GDP  growth show that the U.S economy is on a strong footing.Per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 200,000 in January, and the unemployment rate was at a very low level of 4.1%. Employment continued to trend up in construction, food services and drinking places, health care and manufacturing.The strength of the U.S. labor market is evident from the most-recent Labor Department figures which showed that U.S. filings for unemployment benefits decreased by 10,000 to 210,000, the lowest since December 1969 (better than the estimation of 225,000).Strong Consumer Confidence Index ReadingThese positives further buoyed up The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index, which measures consumers attitude toward current and short-term economic conditions (next six months). The index rose to 130.80 in February, from 124.30 in January. Incidentally, this was the index's highest level since November 2000, when confidence hit 132.60.What underlines the surge in the index is consumers’ belief that the cadence of growth will continue. This optimism has led consumers to use their savings to make purchases. This surely is a welcome sign for payment and network companies, which are the end-beneficiaries of rising consumer spending.It is to be noted that growth in consumer spending was  3.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was the quickest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014 and followed a 2.2% rise in the third quarter of 2017. Market participants believe that this strength in consumer spending is sustainable going forward.Network and Payment Processors Set to GainThe thriving economy should thus benefit payment and network processors as the increase in consumers spending boosts retail sales as payments are increasingly being made by card, online and contactless methods. This marks a departure from the traditional cash and checks, thanks to the rapid percolation of technology in everyday lives.  Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) one of the major payment processors and network providers,disclosed that in its fiscal first quarter (October-December 2017), the payments volume from United States grew 10% driven by increases in consumer credit and holiday spending. Growth was driven by better performance in retail and entertainment (sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels) which include movies, gaming, fitness, sporting goods and recreational activities. Both offline and online volume had higher growth rates than the prior year with online growing approximately four times faster than offline.On its most-recent conference call, Visa disclosed that the 2017 holiday season was stronger than the prior year as both consumer credit and debit grew at higher levels. Also, ecommerce continued to gain share, jumping to over 30% of consumer U.S. holiday volume. Ecommerce growth was strong across a number of categories but was more significantly strengthened by retail performance.Another major company in the same space Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) said that U.S. consumer confidence was healthy, unemployment low and holiday retail sales solid in the fourth quarter of 2017. Its U.S. Gross Dollar Volume (GDV), (which measures the aggregate amount of purchases made with Mastercard’s branded cards) grew 9%, up 3% from last quarter, and comprised Credit and Debit growth of 10% and 8%, respectively.Some Attractive Stocks in This SpaceGiven the strong macro backdrop, investing in this space should yield attractive returns for your investment portfolio.  Based on certain parameters, we have zeroed in on four stocks with a Zacks Rank#1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). These stocks have seen an upward revision in earnings estimates and have outperformed the industry’s growth of 35% in a year’s time.  Mastercard is perfectly poised to grow from higher switched transactions, increase in cross-border volume and gross dollar volume as well as gains from acquisitions. Following strong performance in 2017, the company upped its long-term EPS guidance. It now expects 2016-2018 earnings per share CAGR to be approximately mid-20% from 20% earlier.

2555,MA,"Payment processors have performed quite well so far this year, thanks to an improving U.S economy, low unemployment, a drop in inflation, and healthy consumer confidence that resulted in increased business volumes.The revolutionary shift from cash payments to online transactions continues to further propel transaction volume growth.Card Sales Aided by Economic GrowthThe economic growth in the United States has led to higher disposable income, resulting in greater customer spending. In the environment where plastic is preferred over paper and borrowings are chosen over savings, economic growth has resulted in a steep rise in the companies’ card sales volume. This is expected to drive the industry’s top line in third-quarter 2017.Mergers and Acquisitions to Aid Revenue GrowthThe players in the space are gearing up for growth through mergers and acquisitions, alliances, deals and pacts. Recent acquisition of NuData Security by Mastercard Inc (MA  -  Free Report), Heartland Payments by Global Payments, Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report), investment by Visa Inc (V  -  Free Report) in Swedish company Klarna and many more indicate rise in consolidation activity in the space, which is expected to aid top-line growth.Forex Impact on EarningsPlayers in this industry have vast international operations which have grown over the years through tuck-in acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures. This exposes them to foreign exchange volatility. Moreover, the dollar index fell 2.66% in the third quarter, which will weigh on the margins.   Increased ExpensesWe also expect to see an increase in operating expenses led by higher marketing spend by players in order to woo more customers in a competitive industry. Also increased investments in digitalization and geographic expansion will hurt the bottom line, before bringing results.Industry Rank and Price PerformanceThe industry’s superior performance is evident from its rally of 28.7% in the last year compared with 18.5% gain registered by the S&P 500. Therefore, investing in stocks in this space would generate smart returns over time.Stocks to ConsiderWe zeroed in on three stocks that are poised for an earnings beat this quarter.

2557,MA,"On Feb 20, 2018, the stock of Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $115.24 before closing a tad lower at $14.73.This rally is believed to have been driven by strong fourth-quarter results, a favorable 2018 guidance, increase in share buyback authorization and announcement of joint venture with HSBC.In a year's time, shares of the company have outperformed both the industry as well as the S&P 500 index. The stock has surged 46% compared with the industry’s rise of 37.4% and the S&P 500's 36% growth. Positives Driving the StockStrong results of the company raised investors’ optimism. The figures encompassed net revenue growth of 24% (4.5% in 2016), a 26% bottom line improvement and a double-digit revenue rise in business segments across all geographies namely North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.Global Payments is not a simple payments company but a payments technology set-up offering distinctive, defensible and comprehensive vertical specific software solutions that help merchants run their businesses more efficiently. Investors favorably view the company’s consistent investments in technology solutions, which equip it well to remain ahead of its competitors in the industry race.Global Payments further plans to make incremental investments in artificial intelligence and data analytics and expects that its technology-enabled channels will represent an increasingly larger proportion of its business going forward.Global Payments has also entered into an agreement with its longstanding partner, HSBC, to establish a joint venture in Mexico.

2558,MA,"Tuesday, October 31, 2017Yesterday before the opening bell, the first indictments and first conviction in the Russia collusion scandal in the 2016 U.S. presidential election helped pump the brakes on the extended bull-market rally. Trump’s former campaign manager and a long-time aide face 12 grand jury charges, while a low-level Trump campaign operative has already pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Stock market indexes closed lower Monday, following seven straight up weeks.Whether or not this becomes an albatross on the stock market depends greatly on one’s perspective: Zacks Exec VP Kevin Matras, in his latest Profit from the Pros column this morning, sees the Paul Manafort indictments as little more than a temporary distraction. Those who believe Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller is likely to end his investigation soon and has already exhausted his findings will likely feel the same way: nothing more than a blip, a market breather. Though there does seem to be a greater risk hovering that the Mueller investigation is not wrapping up but just beginning to unfold. If such is the case, market participants may be more trepidatious moving forward.Not today, though: futures for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 are all up in Halloween Tuesday’s pre-market. Far from being spooked, or fear of a “trick,” traders and investors are apparently looking for plenty of “treats.”With good reason, as well: while the Case-Shiller August home sales report is expected to bring 6% growth in U.S. home sales (this is a trailing indicator, but is considered to be the most sound housing data economists see regularly), the Paychex small-business report this morning demonstrates the most stable quarter in the history of the small business index. Though jobs growth has begun to slow, wage increases look to be keeping pace with economic growth. Minneapolis, Denver and Seattle were among the cities seeing the strongest small business growth.And jobs data is expected to be strong, both tomorrow with the private-sector ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) payroll report and Friday’s all-encompassing non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Even with a hurricane-affected quarter, jobs growth is expected to remain robust, with unemployment remaining around a low-to-mid 4% range, indicative of a very strong domestic labor market.Q3 Earnings RoundupAfter the bell we expect to hear from U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), but ahead of the opening bell we see plenty of strength in Q3 performance:Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report) outperformed earnings and revenue estimates, posting $1.34 per share on revenues of $3.4 billion topping the $1.23 per share and $3.3 billion expected. Quarterly sales rose 18% year over year, with higher switched transactions in the quarter and cross-border volumes up 15%. Shares are up 1.7% at this hour in the pre-market.BP (BP  -  Free Report) also trounced expectations, reporting 57 cents per share on $60.81 billion in quarterly sales, which easily beat the $8.04 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Oil production year over year was up 16.4%, and shares of BP rose 2.5% initially upon the quarterly news.Other earnings beats this morning include pharma giant Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and consumer staples major Kellogg (K), which both beat earnings expectations. Pfizer was in-line on its top-line, while Kellogg outperformed our consensus. Both stocks are trading up in today’s pre-market.Under Armour , however, is a much different story: although earnings of 22 cents per share beat estimates by 4 cents, quarterly sales posted a miss. More importantly, revenue and sales guidance were both pointed lower on lower North American demand and other operational challenges. UA stock, which had already fallen more than 40% year to date, are another 14.5% lower ahead of the opening bell.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

2559,MA,"Shares of PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) surged over 2.50% to reach a new all-time high on Thursday, and now many investors might be wondering if they should get in on the digital payment company, despite it breaking through a brand new threshold.People use cash less and less these days, especially in the developed world where mobile, online, and contactless payment options have become normal.Fintech and mobile payments platforms are tangible, usable, and practical for the average person. This makes companies that operate in this sector potentially very valuable, both today and in the future.PayPal is one of the original online and digital payment companies, and since spinning off from eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) a few years ago, the firm has gone on quite the run and now boasts over 210 million active accounts.The companysaw its stock price pop to hit $65.63 per share on Thursday, a new all-time intraday trading high. Let’s take a look at some of what the company has done recently, as well as some key fundamental metrics, to see if investors might want to invest in the digital payment firm.Recent Moves PayPal owns mobile peer-to-peer payment giant Venmo, which is widely popular with millennials and has experienced massive year-over-year growth, and the company now partners with credit card giants Visa (V  -  Free Report) and Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report)—where previously they were at odds.In August, Mastercard introduced a new PayPal Cashback credit card. On Thursday, PayPal and Mastercard announced that they expanded their partnership to include more services on a larger global scale in Canada, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Africa.“Together we expect to accelerate digital payment adoption across the world, improve the payment experience online, in-app and in store, and empower millions of consumers to seamlessly manage and move their money,” PayPal Chief Commercial Officer Gary Marino said in a statement.These new relationships have helped PayPal grow more quickly. On top of that, PayPal has struck deals with over 20 new partners,including Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), all within the last year and a half.Fundamentals PayPal’s second quarter saw the company’s revenues pop 18% to hit $3.14 billion, while the company’s earnings jumped 27%. PayPal is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with an overall VGM grade of “C.”PayPal might not be the most attractive investment for value-minded investors, as it is currently trading at almost 35x earnings. This, however, does mark a massive discount to the industry, which is trading at 62x earnings—its younger competitor, Square (SQ  -  Free Report), has a P/E ratio of 160.39.The company’s P/B ratio of 5.15 is not great either, but again, it is comparable to the “Internet – Software” industry average.The digital payment solution firm’s 13.91% cash flow growth helps demonstrates that the company is healthy compared to many of its peers that have more cash going out than coming in.PayPal’s revenues are projected to gain 18.99% this quarter and gain 18.62% on the year to hit as high as $12.94 billion, based on our current consensus estimates. The “Internet – Software” industry is set to experience 9.73% year-over-year sales growth. PayPal’s quarterly earnings are expected to pop 24.60% this quarter and 22.45% for the year.These substantial gains are projected even though, within the last 60 days, PayPal has received eight downward earnings estimate revisions against only one positive change. However, since spinning off in 2015, PayPal has beat quarterly expectations every time.Bottom LineIn a mobile-centered and digital world, fintech and online payment companies will be positioned to cash in on the future of transactions. PayPal is a pioneer in the industry and might just be a company investors consider now—and down the road.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

2560,MA,"Visa Inc.'s (V  -  Free Report) fiscal first-quarter earnings should see an upside from increased payment transactions. Transactions processed on Visa cards have been on a rise from past many years, which is directly proportional to the company’s revenue growth. Visa makes money in two ways. First, they get a fixed amount on all money that is spent using their co-branded cards. Their second stream of revenues is from Data Processing, which means facilitating the transaction and settlement of transactions.A strong economy fuelled consumer spending which should have aided payment transaction growth. Also, continued growth of checks and digital payment methods supported increase in payment transactions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total payment transaction is 39.25 billion, up 11.2% year over year. This should be driven by payments transaction growth from Asia Pacific, Canada, Cemea, Lac and United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Asia Pacific, Canada, Cemea, Lac and United States are pegged at 6.4 billion, 850 million, 3.58 billion, 3.32 billion and 16.55 billion, respectively, reflecting year-over-year increase of 13.9%, 10%, 26.8%, 5.3% and 8.2%.Overall Visa’s earnings are likely to reflect solid revenue growth led by factors such as increased spending as the economy continues to grow and shift toward spending on cards and increased pricing.Growth in processed transaction is likely to push up Data Processing fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $2 billion, up 20% year over year.Also, lower-than-expected incentives must have aided margins, as Visa has slightly delayed moving some European clients to an incentive structure. A moderation in the exchange drag will also aid margins.  The company has accelerated share buyback activity to offset the equity dilution from the Visa Europe transaction. Increased share buyback will provide an added shield to its bottom line.

2562,MA,"Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1, before the opening bell.We expect an increase in net revenues primarily driven by increases across its revenue categories, accretive impact of acquisitions, higher switched transactions and increase in gross dollar volumes. The revenue growth, however, will be offset to a large extent by higher operating and personnel expenses reflecting continued investment in strategic initiatives.Factors Likely to Impact Fourth-Quarter Earnings:Increase in Rebates and Incentives: Rebates and incentives (recorded as contra-revenues) increase in the first nine months of  2017 and the same trend is expected to be seen in the fourth quarter primarily due to the impact of new and renewed agreements, and increased volumes.Expanding Service Business: The company's efforts in expanding its services business, which has been posting strong earnings, are its differentiators in the market. Higher utilization of the company's service offerings led to revenue acceleration in the previous quarter, and the same is expected in the quarter to be reported.Higher Gross Dollar Volume: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gross Dollar volume which measures all Mastercard Credit Charge and Debit programs, and includes purchase volume plus cash volume, one of the main revenue drivers, is expected to be $1.36 trillion, up almost 11% year over year.Growth in Different Areas, Product Launch, Deals and Partnerships:  Fourth-quarter results would manifest the company’s targeted growth from its card offerings in different verticals — consumer credit, debit and commercial prepaid. Its continued investments in physical-digital convergence will keep it ahead in an industry witnessing rapid technology usage and accrue to its top line. Also, several new deals, extension of partnerships and agreements, new product launches, upgrades and alliances will be accruing to Mastercard's top line.Other FactorsMasterCard’s top line in the fourth quarter would gain traction from its massive international business.The company's disciplined cost management will add to its bottom line.Earnings will, however, be offset by an increase in rebates and incentives, primarily due to the impact of new and renewed agreements. Also, accelerated advertising and marketing spend is likely to hamper the company's bottom line.We expect to see a lower tax rate led by higher earnings from lower tax-rate international markets (accounting for more than 60% of the company’s revenues) than in the prior year.MasterCard’s use of capital in buying back shares will provide an extra cushion to its bottom line.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 5.84%. This is depicted in the chart below:Mastercard Inc.

2563,MA,"On Feb 1, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS  -  Free Report) hiked its quarterly common stock dividend by 10% from the previous payout to 32 cents per share. The new dividend will be paid on Mar 30 to shareholders on record as of Mar16, 2018.Prior to this hike, the company had raised its dividend by 12% to 29 cents per share in January 2017.The company also has a share repurchase program in action. It includes a $4 billion share repurchase authorization, which expires on Dec 31, 2020. Supported by a solid balance sheet position, it continues to enhance shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.However, the news failed to cheer investors. In fact, shares of Fidelity declined 1.3% in the last trading session, perhaps reflecting investors’ concerns over its weak revenue growth prospects.ConcernsThough the company’srevenues have witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 12.4% over the last five years (ended 2016), it is projected to increase only marginally in 2017 compared with the industry’s 8.9% growth. Revenues from Global Financial Solutions segment are likely to have contributed less due to softness in trading volume on account of lower volatility.Further, Fidelity’s return on equity indicates that it utilizes shareholders’ funds less efficiently than the industry. The company’s ROE of 14.05% compares unfavorably with 24.45% for the industry.Growth DriversThe company’s earnings per share (EPS) have increased 11.15% over the last three to five years. The trend is expected to continue in the near term as well. Fidelity’s projected EPS growth is 15.5% and 10.2% for 2017 and 2018, respectively.Its strong capital position keeps it well poised to undertake opportunistic growth strategies. Its past acquisitions have been accretive to earnings. Further, it continues to drive synergies from the SunGard acquisition completed in 2015.  Moreover, the company’s leverage picture looks encouraging. Its debt/equity ratio of 0.87 compares positively with 0.97 for the broader industry.Additionally, the stock looks undervalued based on its price-to-book and price-to-cash flow ratios, which are below the respective industry averages.Our ViewpointFidelity’s growth prospects look encouraging based on its inorganic growth strategies and lower debt burden. Further, the projected increase in EPS is also encouraging. Also, the company has been able to gain analysts’ confidence, as indicated by a slight upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings over the last 30 days.However, poor revenue growth prospects continue to remain a drag.Shares of Fidelity have gained 11.3% over the past six months, underperforming the 20.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderThe stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Visa (V  -  Free Report) has increased 5.2% for the current year, in the last 30 days.

Also, the bottom line improved 25.6% year over year.Results were driven by continued growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions.Visa Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Visa Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Visa Inc. Quote Strong PerformanceNet operating revenues of $4.86 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.82 billion. Also, revenues climbed 9% year over year. This upside was primarily driven by consistent growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions.On a constant dollar basis, payments volume growth (for the quarter ended Sep 30, 2017) was up 10% year over year to $1.93 trillion. Cross-border volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, was up 9% in the quarter. Visa's processed transactions increased 12% over the prior year to 30.5 billion.Service revenues increased 12% year over year to $2.15 billion on higher nominal payments volume. Notably, other revenue components are based on the reported quarter’s activity. Data processing revenues were up 13% on a year-over-year basis to $2.15 billion, while international transaction revenues grew 12% to $1.67 billion. Other revenues increased 13% year over year to $229 million.Client incentives of $1.33 billion increased 27% from the prior-year quarter and represented 21.4% of gross revenues in the reported quarter. Growth in client incentives was due to incentives recognized on long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed after the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and overall growth in global payments volume.Operating expenses increased 13% year over year to $1.54 billion, led primarily by increases in personnel expenses, general and administrative expenses, network and processing expenses, and professional fees as the company continues to invest to support growth.Interest expense increased by 10% year over year to $154 million, primarily due to the issuance of $2.5 billion fixed-rate senior notes in September 2017.Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year positively impacted earnings per share growth by approximately 1 percentage point.Balance Sheet StrengthensCash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities were $8.14 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, down 17.6% from fiscal 2017 ended Sep 30, 2017.Total assets were $67.2 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, down 1.2% from 2017 fiscal year ended Sep 30, 2017.In the first quarter, the company generated adjusted free cash flow of $2.57 billion, up 11.2% year over year.Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateDuring the reported quarter, the company returned $2.2 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.The board of directors authorized a new $7.5-billion share repurchase program and increased the company’s quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents per share.2018 GuidanceVisa kept unchanged part of its 2018 guidance provided earlier, and gave an improved outlook on tax rate and earnings per share growth led by U.S tax reform impact.Guidance kept unchanged: The company continues to expect annual net revenue growth of high single digits on a nominal dollar basis, with approximately 0.5-1% of positive foreign currency impact; client incentives as a percentage of gross revenues from 21.5-22.5%; annual operating margin of high 60s.It, however, expects annual operating expense growth in high end of mid-single digits (versus mid-single digits) adjusted for special items in fiscal 2017.Improved Guidance: Effective tax rate of 23% from 29% as projected earlier, due to U.S tax reform. Earnings per share (EPS) growth of mid-50s (versus mid-40s earlier) on a GAAP nominal dollar basis and high end of mid-20s (high end of mid-teens) on an adjusted, non-GAAP basis (EPS includes approximately 1% to 1.5% of positive foreign currency impact and 9% to 10% of benefit from tax reform).Our TakeVisa’s results reflect robust performance. The company remains well positioned for growth on the back of a solid market position, increase in payment volumes, accretive acquisitions and significant opportunities from its secular shift toward electronic payments.Zacks Rank & Other StocksVisa carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  Among the other players in the same space, American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report), Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) and Mastercard Inc.

2565,MA,"Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.14, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12. Also, the bottom line grew 33% year over year.Mastercard Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Mastercard Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Mastercard Incorporated Quote Better-than-expected results were primarily on higher switched transactions, increase in cross-border volume and gross dollar volume as well as gains from acquisitions. An increase in rebates and incentives year over year was a partial dampener.Shares gained 3.07% in the pre-market trading session reflecting the outperformance.Strong Operational PerformanceMastercard's revenues of $3.31 billion exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.26 billion. The figure was also up 20% year over year. This upside was primarily driven by a 17% rise in the number of switched transactions to 16.7 billion along with a 17% increase in cross-border volumes, 13% growth in gross dollar volume and 3% from acquisitions. These were however, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives, mainly due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.About 2.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards were issued as of Dec 31, 2017.Mastercard witnessed 17% year-over-year increase in total adjusted operating expenses to $1.6 billion due to higher cost components like general and administrative expenses plus advertising and marketing costs.Investment income rose 9% while interest expenses increased 36.7% year over year to $41 million.Adjusted operating margin expanded 120 basis points year over year to 51%.Full-Year HighlightsOperating earnings of $4.59 per share for 2017 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.56.

Long-term debt increased 4.7% to $5.4 billion from the mark at 2016-end.Share Repurchase and Dividend PaymentDuring the reported quarter, Mastercard repurchased shares worth $1 billion and returned $233 million in dividends. This brings the full-year tally to share repurchase of worth $3.8 billion and $942 million of dividend paid.The company bought back shares worth $287 million in January 2018 and has $5 billion remaining under its buyback authorization.Our TakeMastecard’s results reflect its strong operating performance, driven by its continued efforts to cater superior service to its customers. Its acquisitions, investments in technology, a number of deals and partnerships signed with clients across the globe are expected to consistently aid its transaction volume growth, thus driving up the top line.Moreover, increasing use of plastic money replacing cash provides ample room for the company’s growth.

2566,MA,"Traditionally, October is the most volatile month for the broader market. The daily percentage change in the month is 1.44% compared with 1.08% for the other months. Historically, the period between the end of April and the end of October, had been the worst “six months” for the Dow and the S&P 500, while the period between June-end and October-end is considered the worst for the Nasdaq.This bearish trend, however, hasn’t played out so far this year. All the major indices continued to scale record highs on improved corporate earnings, the chugging along of the U.S. economy and the rise in oil prices after the decline in the first half of the year. Oil prices moved north after major producers said that the global market was on its way toward tallying international demand-and-supply levels.Hopes that President Trump is making strides with his new tax plans also overshadowed a slew of negative developments including catastrophic hurricanes, threats of war from North Korea and cyber breach at credit bureau Equifax.Given such positives, the month of October is not likely to put an end to the bull market. Equities, moreover, have a reputation of maintaining gains as the fourth quarter is usually the strongest. This calls for investing in some rock-solid stocks this month for better gains.Corporate Earnings EncourageTotal Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are up 11.1% from the same period last year on 5.5% higher revenues. This marked the second straight quarter of double-digit growth. Earnings growth is also expected to turn positive in Q3. Total Q3 earnings are poised to be up 3.2% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues.For the full year, total earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to be up 7.4% on 4.6% higher revenues, which would follow 0.7% earnings growth on 2.1% higher revenues in 2016 (read more: Start of the Q3 Earnings Season).Economic Recovery SolidMeanwhile, the U.S. GDP expanded 3.1% in the second quarter, the fastest in more than two years. It is also up slightly from a previously reported 3%. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment drove the upside.Increased spending on goods and services pushed consumer expenditure up 3.3% in the said quarter. Consumer spending – the biggest driver of the economy – picked up on higher income for consumers and low inflation.Trump’s Tax Policy ProposalsTrump has urged Congress to move fast with the lowering of corporate taxes and had recently held a bipartisan group of House members at the White House to discuss a tax deal. He has been working on a major tax overhaul in more than three decades. Ever since 1986, the tax code hasn’t been restructured, when President Ronald Reagan along with a divided Congress broadened the tax base and slashed marginal tax rates.Trump proposed a multi-trillion-dollar tax cut that would boost the U.S. economy and drive corporate profits. Such a tax cut included trimming of the business tax rate to 20% from 35%. Low corporate tax will benefit businesses of all sizes, as most of them will see the improvement in their bottom lines.5 Top-Performing Stocks for OctoberOctober may be a rocky month for the stock market. But, as mentioned above, there are positives that may propel the broader markets. We have, thus, selected five stocks that have not only gained, traditionally during the rough trading month of October but also flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2569,MA,"Shares of Square, Inc. (SQ  -  Free Report) climbed on Thursday after the mobile payment company announced its plan to open a bank. But can Square and other fintech startups really shake up the banking industry?  Jack Dorsey’s San Francisco-based mobile payment company is scheduled to submit an application to form a bank in Utah. The bank will be called Square Financial Services Inc. and is set to offer loans and deposit accounts to small businesses.It seems clear that Dorsey, who is also Twitter’s (TWTR) CEO, has his sights set extremely high for the fintech company. Square stock jumped nearly 2% on Thursday to hover around $26.50 a share.Mobile Payment Revolution Square became popular for point of sale services geared towards small business. The company then invested in food ordering companies and began to offer small business loans through Square Capital, which allows merchants the opportunity to pay loans back gradually through automatic payments via a portion of their point of sale transactions.Proud we’ve lent out over $1.8 billion to over 140,000 small businesses throughout the US. Average loan size: $6,000 https://t.co/zCkG6bwwAM— jack (@jack) September 7, 2017But now it seems that Dorsey and Square are ready to venture into new, old school brick-and-mortar banking waters. Square’s banking move follows two other online tech-based financial startups.Social Finance, Inc., which specializes in student loan refinancing and personal loans, applied for a bank charter in June. Mobile-banking startup Varo Money Inc. then applied for a banking charter in August. All three companies applied for these charters in Utah.Salt Lake City has become the unofficial hub of industrial banks—institutions that make business loans and act like traditional banks in other manners, while still being a part of a company that also conducts other business operations.Fintech and mobile payment companies are geared heavily towards Millennials, who do basically everything on their phones. However, this mobile generation still has to use traditional banks in order to have checking accounts and credit cards.Square is taking the first step towards becoming a full-scale, legitimate FDIC insured bank. Dorsey’s company already boasts a market cap of $10.2 billion, and big banks might start to consider the possibility of a tech-based disruption to their industry in the somewhat near future.Other Fintech Companies GainSquare’s move helped send shares of mobile payment giant PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), which also owns youthful peer-to-peer payment powerhouse Venmo, up over 1% on Thursday.

2574,MA,"Shares of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway BRKA recently hit $300,000 per share, a major milestone in the company’s storied history. Buffett and the firm have come a long way, and many now point to ‘the Oracle of Omaha’ as the gold standard of long-term investing.Buffett’s company holds a massive amount shares in some of the biggest and most historic companies in the U.S., including Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and IBM (IBM  -  Free Report). The holding company’s long-term success is also underscored by its Class B shares BRKB, which also rest near their all-time highs.Attempting to mimic Berkshire Hathaway’s success would be tough, but what investors can do in order to try to invest like Buffett is to look at the company’s holdings and find stocks that fit their own strategies.Now, let’s take a look at three stocks with high Zacks Ranks that could help investors act more like Buffett:1.      Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report)Shares of the credit card giant have surged 45.54% in 2017, which more than doubles the S&P 500’s movement. Visa is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has received 16 upward earnings estimate revisions for its current full fiscal year against no downgrades—all within the last 60 days.Based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates, Visa’s EPS is expected to jump 12.95% in its current quarter. Looking further ahead, Visa’s full-year fiscal 2018 earnings are projected to pop by 16.45%. On top of this bottom line growth, the credit card firm’s fiscal 2018 sales are expected to hit $20.09 billion, marking a 9.45% climb—which would be strong for a company of its size and age.Visa also boasts a cash flow growth rate of 20.74%, which doubles the “Financial Transaction Services” average and looks even better compared to rival Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report). This growing cash position should help the company invest more in up-and-coming payment methods, including the quickly growing mobile payment sector where Visa already operates.2.       Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report)Walmart is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an overall “B” VGM score. Shares of the retail powerhouse have climbed 41% in 2017 and 23.69% in the last 12-weeks. Walmart has also recently proved that it is prepared to take on Amazon  after posting strong e-commerce and grocery sales.Walmart’s P/S ratio is currently 0.59, helping demonstrate that the retail powerhouse presents investors with a solid bang for their respective buck. On top of that, the company is trading at 22.11x earnings, which is comparable to the “Retail – Supermarkets” industry average.Within the last 60 days, Walmart has experienced nine upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter and 14 for its full-year. These earnings revisions are highly important and often prove to be a strong indicator of future performance. Walmart has beat or matched earnings estimates in 13 of the last 14 quarters, including each of the trailing nine periods.3.       American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report)Shares of American Express currently sit close to their 52-week high, after climbing 13% in the last 12 weeks to help the company’s current year gains reach 34.56%. But American Express could easily break into a new range if the company matches its bottom line growth projections.American Express is projected to see its fourth quarter 2017 earnings skyrocketed by 69.56% to hit $1.54 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company’s sales are also expected to gain nearly 9% to hit $8.73 billion in Q4.American Express is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that is trading at 17.02 earnings, which marks a discount against its industry’s average. The credit card company has also matched or topped earnings estimates in each of the trailing three quarters, as well as seven of the last eight.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

Can Fitbit’s sleek tech-filled wristwatch help the company fight its way back as it tries to take on Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report)?IonicFitbit officially announced the new Ionic smartwatch, which is supposed to be the company’s answer to the Apple Watch, on Monday. However, the Ionic is currently only available for pre-sale on Fitbit’s website, with retailers set to sell the smartwatch starting in October.All new. All for you. Say hello to your ultimate health & fitness companions. See what’s #NewFromFitbit: https://t.co/5ut3le9AEm pic.twitter.com/OwnW9eydT7— Fitbit (@fitbit) August 28, 2017The company’s inaugural smartwatch will feature Fitbit’s signature fitness tracking capabilities, as well as new contactless payment and music pairing options. Ionic users will also be able to pair their smartphones with the watch in order to receive notifications for calls, texts, and other basic alerts, as well as alerts from apps such as Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Instagram, Snapchat (SNAP  -  Free Report), and many more.The Ionic will also feature improved heart rate tracking, which includes tracking user’s heart rate zones and resting heart rate in real-time, around the clock. Additionally, the new watch has revamped GPS capabilities and an average battery life of more than four days.The smartwatch also offers users access to personalized and adaptable workouts, and it is water resistant up to 50 meters, which will give the wearer the ability to track their swims.Fitbit’s Ionic will also use a relative SpO2 sensor in order to estimate blood oxygen levels. The SpO2 sensor could allow the smartwatch to track more complex health indicators, such as sleep apnea.Fitbit’s first foray into the smartwatch market has a $299.95 price tag and hopes to help the company become profitable again. The San Francisco-based wearable company has posted a loss in the last three quarters. The company also launched its new Aria 2 smart scale and Flyer wireless headphones on Monday.Can Ionic Compete?Fitbit, which became well known for its simple fitness wearables, has been hurt by massive competition in the market.

It is hardly an easy task to compete with one of the biggest companies in the world, but the goal is made even more difficult considering that the Apple Watch has a huge head start and starts at just $269.“With Ionic, we will deliver what consumers have not yet seen in a smartwatch – a health and fitness first platform that combines the power of personalization and deeper insights with our most advanced technology to date, unlocking opportunities for unprecedented health tracking capabilities in the future,” Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park said in a statement.Fitbit also announced it partnered with Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) to introduce a special edition watch and training programs in 2018.

The company is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2578,MA,"Visa Inc.’s (V  -  Free Report) fiscal first-quarter results scheduled for Feb 1, should see an upside from increased revenues.Visa has witnessed a revenue CAGR of 12.7% from 2008-2017. We strongly believe that the company will retain its revenue momentum in the fiscal first quarter on the back of its strong market position and attractive core business that continues to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions, increasing spending via cards, shift to digital form of payments and expansion of service offerings.The company expects annual net revenue growth of high single digits on a nominal dollar basis for fiscal 2018. We expect increase in revenues from each of its business lines — Data Processing, International Transaction and Service. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for each of these segments is pegged at $2.1 billion, $1.67 billion and $2.1 billion, up 13.3%, 12.4% and 11.2% year over year, respectively.  The company resolved approximately 75% of contract conversions by the end of fiscal 2017, and the remainder will be done primarily in the first half of fiscal 2018. As a result, client incentives in the first half of 2018 will be significantly higher than fiscal 2017. Thus the quarter should enclose higher client incentives.Payment volumes should grow in the fiscal first quarter from the Costco and USAA deal wins. These deals drove U.S. payment volume growth up to the double-digit range in fiscal 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 trillion payment volumes is up 9.3% year over year.The company’s cross-border business and cross-border volumes are dependent on global economic conditions and the relative strength of key currencies, in particular the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the pound. In the fourth quarter, these trends started to change as the dollar weakened, especially versus the euro and the pound. Assuming these trends will continue, the company anticipates a slowdown in U.S. outbound commerce, with a step up in commerce coming into the U.S. and vice-versa for Europe and the UK.    The adjusted expense growth rate is expected to be highest in the first quarter led by numerous investment initiatives.The company has accelerated share buyback activity to offset the equity dilution from the Visa Europe transaction. Increased share buyback will provide an added shield to its bottom line.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history. It beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8.13%.Visa Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Visa Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Visa Inc.

2581,MA,"The global payments industry continues to undergo a dynamic change. Technology and innovation is shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce, mobile payments, block chain technology and digital currencies.Industry insiders expect demand for debit and credit cards and online payments to continue to surge in the years ahead, as the style of payments shift from cash and checks to plastic and electronic mode. An improving jobs market and low unemployment have set a positive trend in consumer spending by increasing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards and devices. These shifts in macroeconomic factors bode well for the industry’s growth.Despite the increased adoption of digital payments, cash continues to be in the mainstream and still make up for nearly 85% of global transaction. This proves that the industry still remains underpenetrated and provides ample scope for long-term growth.Stocks Under ConsiderationThe two leading companies in this thriving industry are MasterCard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) and Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report).MasterCard is one of the world's largest payment solutions companies, processing transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies. It commands a well-established brand name and extensive merchant-acceptance network.Visa on the other hand operates the world's largest retail electronic payments network, with more than 2.3 billion Visa-branded credit and debit cards in circulation globally. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).It will be interesting to note which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals.Some better-ranked players in the same space are Total System Services Inc. (TSS  -  Free Report) and Vantiv, Inc. . Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1Rank stocks here.Price PerformanceBoth MasterCard and Visa have surged 29.6% and 33.4%, respectively, year to date, significantly outpacing the industry’’s growth of 24.31%. Here, Visa remains an outperformer.ValuationCompared with the industry’s trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 8.5, Visa is underpriced with a reading of 8.2. Meanwhile, MasterCard seems too expensive with a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 24.3. On this basis too, Visa seems worth buying.Dividend YieldMasterCard has a current dividend yield of 0.7% and a five-year growth rate of 66.2%, while Visa has a dividend yield of 0.6% and a five-year growth rate of 30.1%.Though both stocks have a dividend yield that is below the industry’s average of 0.9%, they are good at increasing their dividend. Comparatively, MasterCard has an edge over Visa here.Earnings Surprise HistoryConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, both Visa and MasterCard have delivered earnings surprises over each of the prior four quarters. While MasterCard has an average earnings surprise of 6.2%, Visa stands out with an average earnings surprise of 8.4%.Earnings Estimate Revisions and Growth ProjectionsMasterCard has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 earnings being revised upward by 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively, over the last 60 days.On the other hand, the same for Visa has moved upward for 2017 and 2018 by 1.8% and 1.3%, respectively, over the same time frame.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MasterCard’s earnings per share is $4.37 and $5.06 for 2017 and 2018, respectively, reflecting year-over-year growth of 16% and 15.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Visa’s earnings per share is $3.42 and $3.98 for 2017 and 2018, respectively, reflecting year-over-year growth of 20.3% and 16.4%.Return on Equity (ROE)The ROE ratio reflects a company’s profitability. MasterCard’s return on equity of 74.9% has significantly outpaced the industry average of 34.5%. However, Visa’s return on equity of 31% underperformed the industry. This reflects MasterCard’s tactical efficiency in using shareholders’ funds.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Visa is poised better than MasterCard when considering valuation, price performance, earnings surprise history, earnings estimate revisions and growth projections. MasterCard wins on return on equity and dividend yield.The winner here would have to be Visa, which has better growth figures compared to MasterCard.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

2582,MA,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report). During the most recently reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.47 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7%, but witnessed a sharp 30% year-over-year decline.Better-than-expected results were mainly backed by a lower tax rate and the effect of share buyback. However, when comparing year over year, the bottom line suffered as the year-ago earnings reflected the $1.1 billion gain recorded from the sale of the Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST  -  Free Report).Overall results reflected solid progress against the company’s current priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting the cost base.American Express is set to benefit from continued secular growth of electronic payments globally. Convenience, security, and enhanced services and rewards for consumers continue to fuel growth in electronic payments.The company remains focused on several initiatives to strengthen operations. These include renewed focus on its Platinum Card portfolios in the U.S., Small Business Saturday to leverage on the ongoing expansion of its merchant network in the U.S. through the OptBlue program. Through OptBlue the company has set an aggressive goal – to achieve merchant coverage on a par with Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) and MasterCard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) in the U.S. by the end of 2019.  Apart from taking measures to grow its top line, the company has also launched cost initiatives designed to remove $1 billion from its overall cost base by the end of 2017. Adjusted operating expenses decreased in the first half of 2016, reflecting progress against cost reduction initiatives. The company is on track to reduce $1 billion from cost based on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017.American Express enjoys a strong capital position and is committed to enhance shareholders’ value. The company’s 2017 capital plan received the Federal Reserve’s approval, following which it announced a 9.4% hike in its quarterly dividend. The capital plan includes repurchase of up to $4.4 billion of common shares through the second quarter of 2018.    Nevertheless, the company continues to face an increase in provision for loan loss. Also, increased rewards and marketing costs in order to fold more business will hurt margins.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

2584,MA,"The financial transaction service providers have reported a decent performance in the first nine months of 2017 backed by a thriving U.S. economy, lower unemployment, reduced inflation, healthy consumer confidence, which resulted in improved business volumes. Increased investment in information technology and growing demand for online payments significantly spurred transaction volume growth.Moreover, the recent tax reform policy that lowered corporate tax to 21% from 35%, although might result in one-time charge for some companies, is expected to benefit the players in the long term.The new European rules on online payments and banking, allowing retailers and consumers to bypass banks by authorizing payments directly from personal accounts, might result in reduced costs and enhanced scope of offering for the payment processors.  Factors Affecting Q4 ResultsEconomic growth in the United States has resulted in higher disposable income, leading to greater customer spending. This is expected to propel the companies’ transaction sales volume in the fourth quarter.The payment processors have also gained from alternative payment modes like e-wallets, electronic payments as well as cryptocurrencies that provide customers with greater transaction security, flexibility, accessibility, touch-points and speed, all at a lower cost. Huge investments in technology to meet the changing demand of customers have resulted in the development of new and emerging cutting-edge technologies.Another major attribute of the industry is inorganic growth.The payment processors have been consolidating through mergers and acquisitions, strategic alliances and partnerships to expand their operations globally.  However, international operations have exposed the players to foreign exchange volatility. The recent tax cut is also likely to result in one-time tax on the companies’ unrepatriated overseas earnings.Increased investment in technology, marketing and promotional activities as well as consolidation-related expenses have led to a continuous rise in operating costs. This is likely to put pressure on the bottom line in the fourth quarter.Industry Rank and Price PerformanceThe industry is booming, which is evident from its rally of 38.4% in a year compared with 21.4% gain registered by the S&P 500. Therefore, stocks in this industry are likely to generate fair returns over time.Stocks to ConsiderWe have zeroed in on four stocks from the industry that are poised for an earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017. Our proven model shows that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) and 3 (Hold), when combined with a positive Earnings ESP, has the potential to beat earnings expectations.

2585,MA,"With a holiday-shortened week on both ends — both no trading yesterday, Christmas Day, as well as an early closing bell on Friday afternoon ahead of New Year’s holiday — we look at the final trading week of 2017 not so much as a big potential mover as a closer-outer of a tremendously successful year for the stock market indexes. Look at the one-year charts for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 and witness things of beauty.The Dow 30, if you recall, was sub-20K at this time last year, and now rests just a couple hundred points below 25K. The S&P 500 has raced up more than 400 points from roughly 2260 to 2680 from a year ago. And the Nasdaq, with its relative volatility in an historically non-volatile market, came out of Christmas season last year under 5500 and now looks to tip the 7000 mark. Even without other “get rich quick” schemes like bitcoin investing, this has been a remarkable year for investors.And the news just keeps getting better from here: ahead of today’s opening bell, MasterCard’s (MA  -  Free Report) Spending Pulse read on holiday sales demonstrates notable gains for retailers and in consumer confidence: +4.9% year over year (+18.1% in e-commerce sales), consisting of holiday shopping season designated from November through Christmas Eve. This is the biggest year-over-year gain in holiday spending since 2011.All in all, we can expect slower trading volume as many investors take a well-earned vacation ahead of what looks to be another big year in the stock market for 2018. Perhaps we’ll see a bit of profit-taking, but so far there’s not much evidence of an appetite to take money out of the market.Apple Estimates for iPhone X DownIf we’re looking at anything this week with a little extra trepidation, it is the lower estimates for iPhone sales. Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone X does not appear to be seeing the same demand as it had a few years back with the iPhone 6. Increased competition — not only from competitors but from Apple’s own iPhone 8 and 8+, which hit the market right around the same time as the $999 iPhone X did — and weaker demand in key economic regions like China have helped ratchet down estimates for Apple’s top line.This, however, comes just as Barron’s made its latest cover story that Apple Inc. is looking in 2018 to become the first-ever $1 trillion dollar company by market cap. Currently, Apple is worth roughly $884 billion, still the largest single company in the world.

2587,MA,"Each Thursday morning we see new results from Initial Jobless Claims, and today is no exception. A total of 244K claims were made in the past week — 10K more than the previous (revised) week of 234K claims — on 1.964 continuing claims, both on the high side of what we’ve seen over the past quarter year or so, but both within psychologically comfortable ranges: initial claims between 225-250K and continuing claims sub-2 million.June Durable Goods numbers also hit the tape ahead of Thursday’s market open, and the 6.5% headline number was twice what was expected by analysts. But the interesting thing about this data happens below the headline: strip out Transportation costs and this number drops to 0.2%. Simply say ex-Defense, however, and we see a 6.7% figure.What does this mean? Well, take a look at Boeing’s (BA  -  Free Report) blockbuster Q2 earnings report yesterday — the airplane maker saw huge new orders on the books, and this alone was enough to shift today’s Durable Goods number to well ahead of expectations. Further, we’re not seeing military aircraft being ordered but commercial aircraft. Don’t expect these types of numbers to be consistent, however; once planes orders are sated, they tend to lag in future Durable Goods reads.When we look at this data, implicitly what we’re doing is gauging whether the Fed will pump the brakes on its intended actions in the near future. As we saw yesterday, the Fed sees inflation rising at sub-2%, which was their target, and in its latest statement its balance sheet policy remains unchanged.The Fed also has signaled that it will begin unwinding its bloated $4.5 trillion balance sheet, and when it does we will see interest rates rise. This will pull up bank stocks, in turn, but may create some headwinds in re “cheap money” that the U.S. has been enjoying throughout the recovery from the Great Recession more than 8 and a half years ago.Q2 Earnings RoundupZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-rated Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) well outpaced estimates on its bottom line, posting earnings of 12 cents per share, tripling the 4 cents expected in the Zacks consensus estimate. The 574 million in revenues also outperformed the $537 million expected, but flat user growth has pushed TWTR stock into negative territory. Especially considering Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) dominant Q2 earnings report after the bell yesterday, user growth is key in the social media market. Twitter shares are currently down roughly 10%.Cable multi-service operating giant Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by 34 cents per share when it posted 52 cents prior to today’s opening bell. Its $21.2 billion in revenues for the quarter topped the $20.8 billion expected. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company with a Zacks Style Score of A reported high-speed Internet costs up 5.5% year over year.Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) just met the 96 cents per share in the Zacks consensus estimate. Revenues, however, beat expectations: $30.55 billion versus $29.91 billion. Retail post-paid churn was flat year over year, and retail connections were up 1.2%. The company was a Zacks Rank #3 stock before its Q2 earnings report was released.MasterCard (MA  -  Free Report) beat estimated by 6 cents to $1.10 per share, and sales of $3.05 billion topped the $2.97 billion expected. Shares are up 1.5% in the pre-market. Dr. Pepper Snapple  missed bottom line estimates of $1.28 per share by 3 cents. Revenues, however, topped the $1.77 billion expected and posted $1.80 billion.This is the busiest day of Q2 earnings season today. We’re climbing the mountaintop, folks.

2590,MA,"The earnings season is in full swing with about 183 S&P 500 companies reporting this week. About 97 S&P 500 companies have already released their results till Jul 21, reconfirming broad-based expectations of better-than expected earnings. Total earnings for these 97 companies (accounting for 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 8.4% year over year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating earnings estimates and 72.2% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the Apr–Jun 2017 quarter is anticipated to register high single-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis.  Per the Earnings Preview, overall earnings for all the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 8.6% on 4.7% growth in revenues. Although it represents a slightly tempered growth projection compared with the double-digit growth rate of the previous quarter, the dollar amount of the total earnings is likely to be on par or even better than the all-time high achieved in fourth-quarter 2016. The relative improvement in the quarterly performance is largely due to a turnaround in the economy, better job market scenario and rising oil prices. Experts widely believe that earnings growth is likely to be in double digits in 2018 and beyond.For the April–June quarter as a whole, about five of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline, with Autos, Conglomerates and Utilities being the biggest drag.The Business Services sector appears reasonably healthy. For the sector, earnings are expected to improve 9.4% year over year while sales are touted to rise 4.4% due to higher disposable income and new business initiatives.Let’s take a sneak peek at five major Business Services stocks scheduled to report earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Republic Services, Inc. (RSG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell.

2591,MA,"Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, Mastercard surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.45%. The company exceeded earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 6.38%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackWe expect the company’s top line in the second quarter to gain traction from its strong international business. This will likely be offset to some extent from softness in its U.S. credit card business, given the loss of one of its client, USAA, to Visa Inc.The company’s disciplined cost management will add to its bottom line.We expect increased purchase volume and processed transaction, which will increase its business volume in the quarter led by higher spending by members as the economy continues to improve.Also, substantial investment in technology, new product launches, upgrades and alliances will be accruing to Mastercard’s top-line growth.The company’s effort in expanding its services business, which has been posting strong earnings, is a differentiator for the company in the market. Higher utilization of the company’s service offerings led to revenue acceleration in the previous quarter, and the same is expected to be seen in the quarter to be reported.Earnings will, however, be offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to impact from new and renewed agreements. Also, accelerated advertising and marketing spend is likely to hamper the company’s bottom line.We expect to see a lower tax rate led by higher earnings from lower tax-rate international market than in the prior year.The company’s use of capital in buying back shares, with the effect of reducing the share count, will help the company’s bottom line.Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Mastercard Incorporated QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Mastercard is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

Cross-border volume growth was 147% for the quarter. Cross-border volume growth, on a constant dollar basis when normalized for Europe, was 11% year over year.

2594,MA,"Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) have entered into a mutual agreement pursuant to which the latter will be able to issue PayPal-branded Visa debit cards in Europe.PayPal already had a banking license in Europe and this deal will help it foray into the region’s debit card market.Consumers and merchants will be benefited by this alliance as the joint service should make their digital and mobile payments options secure, reliable and convenient digital.This partnership will make it easier for financial institutions to offer their Visa account holders the ability to checkout anywhere PayPal is accepted online. The agreement should result in ""more spending volume"" on Visa cards.The partnership also includes the participation of Visa Digital Enablement Program (VDEP) in Europe. Visa’s VDEP service makes use of tokenization that simplifies and secures transactions.PayPal will also be able to leverage on the Visa Direct service, which is quick, safe, affordable and the easiest way to send and receive money. This service will enable PayPal users to move funds to their Visa accounts in real time across multiple markets.Visa has been busy forming numerous pacts and alliances that have beefed up its business volumes. The company’s strong performance is also reflected in its share price which has added 24%, compared with the 22% gain for the Zacks categorized Financial Transaction Services industry, since it first joined forces with PayPal last July.Visa and PayPal are treading along quite well since their first partnership to jointly provide payment services in the U.S. The strategic deal put an end to their decade-old friction over online transactions. The deal was a positive development for Visa, as PayPal agreed to stop steering business away from the former.PayPal has also formed similar alliances with other payment services companies Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) and Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report).In April, PayPal and Visa entered into another partnership to jointly serve customers in Asia-Pacific. The agreement is an extension of their strategic partnership in the United States and Asia-Pacific.The deals forged this year don’t come to us as a surprise since the companies already hinted (at the time of first partnership) that they “hope to work out a deal for international transactions as well.” We expect to hear similar deals in the future.Visa carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(V  -  Free Report) are scheduled to report earnings within a day of each other, Mastercard Inc.’s (MA  -  Free Report) earnings are due for release next week.Visa has profited considerably from American Express’ loss of its lucrative partnership with Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report), which it has now added to its bag of tie-ups.

Meanwhile, Mastercard is making significant progress in its digital strategy and continuously investing in technology.With Visa and Mastercard scheduled to report within a week of each other, on Jul 20 and Jul 27, respectively this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceShares of both Mastercard and Visa have notched up gains in the year to date period. Visa is marginally ahead with a gain of 24.1%. However, Mastercard is not far behind with an increase of 23.4%, ahead of both the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry and the S&P 500 which have gained 20.2% and 10%, respectively during this period.ValuationThe average one year trailing 12-month P/B ratio is the best multiple for valuing the card processing business because of large variations in earnings results from one quarter to the next.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 24.23, Mastercard is overvalued compared to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry. On the other hand, Visa has a P/B ratio of 8.10, which is why it is undervalued compared to both the broader industry as well as Mastercard. Dividend YieldComing to dividend yield, while the Financial Transaction Services industry offers a dividend yield of 0.7%, Mastercard offers a marginally lower return of 0.69%. Visa is not far behind, with a dividend yield of 0.68%, which means that this round is too close to call.Earnings History ESP, Estimate Revisions and EPS GrowthRiding on higher revenues, Visa posted second-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Mar 31, 2017) earnings of 86 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents. Also, the bottom line improved 27% year over year. Net operating revenue of $4.5 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.2 billion.

Also, earnings improved 17.4% year over year. MasterCard posted revenues of $2.73 billion for the reported quarter, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.64 billion. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 11.8%.Considering a more comprehensive earnings history, both Mastercard and Visa have delivered positive earnings surprises over the last two quarters. However, Visa holds a slight edge with an average earnings surprise of 7.2% versus Mastercard’s figure of 6.4%. Visa also has a higher expected earnings growth rate of 18.4% for the current year, compared to Mastercard’s expected rate of 13.9%.However, when considering Earnings ESP, there is nothing to choose from between the two stocks, with both having readings of 0. Estimate revisions for both stocks have increased by 0.1% over the last 30 days.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that there is nothing to choose between Mastercard and Visa when considering Earnings ESP and estimate revisions. Additionally, both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2. While Mastercard offers a marginally higher dividend yield, Visa holds a clear edge when considering earnings history, price performance, expected EPS growth and valuations. This is why it may be better to bet on Visa over Mastercard.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.
