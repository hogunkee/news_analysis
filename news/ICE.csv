4,ICE,"New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo is threatening to sue the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency for its ongoing raids to detain illegal immigrants wanted for serious crimes like assault and rape.A staggering 80% of those apprehended in recent ICE raids in New York were either convicted criminals or charged with crimes. But Cuomo's siding with criminals over crime victims.He's playing politics. Faced with a challenge on his left flank from ""Sex and the City"" star and gubernatorial hopeful Cynthia Nixon, he's desperate to prove his liberal bona fides. Public safety be damned.The ambitious New York Governor is parroting Democrats across the nation who claim ICE should be abolished because it's breaking apart families and peaceful communities. The facts prove otherwise. Eighty-eight percent of the illegal immigrants arrested in recent Los Angeles ICE raids and 81% arrested throughout California, according to the latest ICE data, had criminal convictions.These are bad guys.So when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., claims that ""unjust and cruel"" ICE raids ""terrorize innocent immigrant families,"" don't buy it.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCuomo's making the same bogus claim. Last Thursday, Cuomo denounced an ICE raid on an upstate farm looking for Marcial DeLeon-Aguilar, a three-time prior deportee convicted of felony aggravated assault. The governor complained that Aguilar's children had to watch their father being pinned by officers to block his escape.Nice try, governor. What about families victimized by violent illegal immigrants?Since January 2016, at least 25 Long Island youths have been executed by the MS-13 gang of Central American illegal immigrants. Some of the victims are left so mutilated they can hardly be identified. MS-13 beats the youngsters with baseball bats, puts plastic bags over their heads to suffocate them, and then slices off their noses, ears and lips with machetes. No one read these victims their constitutional rights.ICE's Operation Matador targets MS-13 gang members. Yet Cuomo seems angrier at the ICE agents than at the MS-13 butchers.Laughably, Cuomo issued a ""cease and desist"" letter to ICE last week, ordering federal agents to touch base with local police before taking enforcement action. Cuomo doesn't have a constitutional leg to stand on. Check the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Uncle Sam doesn't need Andrew Cuomo's permission to enforce federal laws.Why the surge in visible, violent sweeps? ICE is forced to conduct sweeps out in the community because New York's sanctuary laws are preventing the agency from taking custody of criminal aliens before they're released from jail, like the agency used to do. As ICE's Deputy Director Thomas Homan points out, these sanctuary policies are needlessly exposing New Yorkers to violence.Cuomo's mimicking California Democrats, who are in open rebellion against federal law enforcement. In February, Oakland California Mayor Libby Schaaf issued a public alert about a planned ICE raid in her city before it took place, tipping off hundreds of wanted criminals to scatter. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said to Shaaf, ""How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of law enforcement just to promote your radical open borders agenda?""Political pandering is driving this agenda. An amazing 27% of California's population are immigrants. Immigrants disproportionately favor big government. California hasn't elected a statewide Republican since 2006. New York is moving in the same direction, with 23% of its population foreign-born and Democrats gaining increasing control of state government.Cuomo and other Democrats resist the federal crackdown on immigrant-related crime, and call for increased spending on after-school music and sports programs to provide an ""alternative"" to gang activity in immigrant communities. That's nonsense. Brutes willing to torture and mutilate a human being with a machete will not be dissuaded by learning to play the flute.President Trump calls them ""animals"" who have turned peaceful neighborhoods ""into bloodstained killing fields."" He's got the right plan: ""We will find you. We will arrest you. We will jail you. And we will deport you.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:By Handing Out Driver's Licenses, Far-Left California Invites Illegals To Stay — And Taxpayers To PayCalifornia's Loopy 'Sanctuary State' Law — Is It Trying To Secede?Census Citizenship Question: 5 Arguments Against It All Bogus

6,ICE,"The China trade war may be about to get better, not worse. Despite Wednesday's sell-off as the Trump administration identified $200 billion worth of potential targets for future Trump tariffs, the key moment is about to arrive that could see the ice break in the brewing technological cold war between the U.S. and China.Chinese communications equipment firm ZTE saw shares soar on Thursday as the U.S. agreed to let the company resume doing business with American suppliers, pending the receipt of a $400 million escrow payment.Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported that both the U.S. and China are prepared to resume stalled trade negotiations.The confluence of events is likely no coincidence. President Trump's commitment to lift sanctions that amounted to a death sentence for ZTE seemed to break a logjam in U.S.-China trade negotiations back in May. Soon after, Trump touted a prospective trade deal with Beijing, tweeting that  ""China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products"" and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the China trade war had been put ""on hold"" amid progress in negotiations.Those negotiations stalled as Congress complicated Trump's pledge via tweet to get ZTE ""back into business, fast."" The Senate preserved the ban on doing business with ZTE in the national defense authorization bill, but those harsh terms may not be included in the final version expected to pass in late July.The stock market reaction on Wednesday came as the threat of escalating Trump tariffs became more tangible, though the likelihood of tariffs hadn't changed. In June, President Trump directed the Office of the Trade Representative to come up with a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that could face 10% tariffs, and trade officials produced that list late Tuesday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, the market downdraft on Wednesday was fairly modest. Wall Street still seems to be betting that this round of Trump tariffs will never take flight and that China won't escalate its retaliation against U.S. multinationals. We'll probably know whether Wall Street is right within the next several weeks, as the White House prepares to impose the new tariffs by Aug. 30.As long as Congress hews to Trump's wishes and drops the Senate provision mandating a ban on U.S. firms doing business with the Chinese communications equipment firm, U.S.-China trade negotiations could quickly resume and begin to demonstrate progress.Beijing refuses to negotiate under duress, so there is still a risk the China trade war will escalate with more rounds of Trump tariffs. But a U.S. reprieve for ZTE and its 75,000 global employees may allow Xi to resume negotiations without losing face, despite the Trump tariffs already in place.Yet if ZTE gets a new lease on life and there isn't a nearly immediate thaw in the China trade war and threats of more Trump tariffs continue to fly, look out.This may be the last off-ramp before a full-scale trade war that threatens to seriously damage business prospects for U.S. multinationals in China and severely disrupt technology supply chains.The U.S. imported $506 billion in Chinese goods last year, meaning about half of Chinese imports would be affected by Trump's latest tariff threat.As Trump threatens a full-scale China trade war, Beijing vows to meet the U.S, blow for blow.While Chinese targets are somewhat limited by its $130 billion in American imports, Beijing has other ways to retaliate, and that's one of Wall Street's big fears.Beyond tariffs, U.S. multinationals could face other significant hurdles in China. Beijing could make life difficult for Dow Jones stocks like Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL) via regulations.China's government also could hit Boeing sales, and likely Caterpillar, through its state-owned enterprises that can sway the market. Meanwhile, Beijing has been holding up the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).The way things are going, there's little reason to expect China to blink in the face of Trump threats. BMW said this week that it will shift some SUV production from South Carolina to China in the face of Trump tariffs. Meanwhile, China's currency is losing ground vs. the dollar, counteracting the impact of Trump's threatened 10% tariffs on a wide range of consumer goods.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Stock Market Falls As Trump Threatens New Tariffs; Netflix Holds UpChip Equipment Stocks Get Price-Target Cuts On Market SlowdownThe Big Picture: Stocks Now Test These Critical LevelsStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

9,ICE,"Sugar stockpiles are poised for a record as slowing demand growth and surging production creates the worst-performing commodity of 2018.Consumers have become increasingly wary of the health impact of their sweet tooth, and companies from canned-fruit maker Del Monte Foods Inc. to snack-food seller Mondelez International Inc. are touting products made with less sugar. While global consumption is still rising, the pace of growth has slowed to an average 1.4% in recent seasons, down from 1.7% over the past decade, according to researcher Green Pool Commodity Specialists.That's coming at a time when production is booming, especially in India, the world's No. 2 producer. Farmers in Thailand are also collecting massive crops. World stockpiles are set to swell to the highest ever this season and stay near the record next year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Sugar futures in New York have already slumped 25% in 2018. That's the biggest loss on the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which tracks returns for 22 components.""Unless there's a weather issue, it doesn't look that the bulls have any hope for a sustained rally,"" said Donald Selkin, a New York-based chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities Corp., which oversees about $2 billion. ""Everybody is trying to do away with sugar and sugary products. You see that in supermarkets and grocery stores. Demand is going to remain less than what's been in recent years. The price is doomed to stay low for a while.""On Monday, raw sugar for October delivery fell 1% to 11.4 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.Investors are setting up for more declines.In the week ended July 3, money managers more than tripled their net-short position, or the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a decline, to 54,736 futures and options, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released Monday. The move came as short holdings increased 15%, while long bets fell almost 7%.Global production will top demand by 19.6 million metric tons in the 12 months that end Sept. 30, the biggest overhang ever, Brisbane, Australia-based Green Pool said in a report last month. The excess would be more than enough to meet annual demand in China, the world's top importer.After farmers collected a mammoth crop, the Indian Sugar Mills Association said July 3 that processors are seeking to increase export quotas to a record 6 million tons. The group estimates the country's output at as much as 32 million tons, a gain of 58% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, in Brazil surging ethanol stockpiles and tumbling prices for the biofuel mean cane millers could process more of the crop into sugar.Of course, crops can still fail, especially if the weather turns worse than expected. Dry conditions have hurt plants in Brazil's central southern region, the world's biggest-producing locale. The potential for an El Nino weather pattern later this year could also mean some damage to Asian crops.But in a market where demand slowing, small supply shocks can often be absorbed. While health concerns and taxes on sugary drinks that erode consumption have been more pronounced in developing economies, Green Pool said that these factors are now being ""replicated"" in emerging markets.""All the bearish elements that had sugar pinned down initially are still in place, and some are even worse,"" said Frank Jenkins, the president of JSG Commodities in South Norwalk, Conn. ""We are looking for a long period of time with a very substantial surplus. We are in the fourth or fifth inning of this bear market.""

10,ICE,"Maybe you've seen the video of the hero the French have dubbed ""Spider-Man."" When he saw a toddler dangling off a fourth-story balcony, he scaled the exterior of the Paris building in about 30 seconds to save the child. Turns out Mamoudou Gassama was a newly arrived illegal immigrant from Mali. A grateful President Emmanuel Macron made him a French citizen a day later.Or consider the story of Jesus Manuel Cordova. He illegally crossed the border from Mexico into Arizona and came upon a damaged car. Inside was a dead mother and an injured 9-year-old boy. Cordova stayed with the child for hours until help arrived.So, does that mean all illegal immigrants are heroes? Obviously not, no more than the crimes of MS-13 or the murder of Kate Steinle prove that all illegal immigrants are criminals.Both parties are resorting to stereotypes and incitement. The Democrats, intent upon portraying the utter depravity of the Trump administration's approach to immigration, seized upon a story that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency had ""lost"" 1,475 illegal immigrant minors who were separated from their parents. A widely cited story alleged that federal officials could not find these kids. Several pointed to a Frontline account alleging that at least some of the kids had been released to human traffickers.But within a couple of days, the corrections flowed in. It wasn't, The New York Times and others advised, that the kids were lost. Rather, these were among the ""unaccompanied minors"" who crossed the border in 2014. They were placed with adults. The Times quoted Ephrat Livni of Quartz, who explained: ""It certainly sounds bad,"" but ""many of those missing kids may well be with their parents or families, and they may have gone off the grid deliberately to avoid Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities."" As for the Frontline story, it referenced a government report from 2016, i.e., before the current administration could be held accountable.But here's the irony: The Trump administration's position amounts to saying, ""We weren't responsible for separating children from their parents, but going forward, we will be."" Attorney General Jeff Sessions has announced that separating even very young children from their parents will now be policy -- as deterrence. ""If you are smuggling a child then we will prosecute you, and that child will be separated from you as required by law,"" he said. ""If you don't like that, then don't smuggle children over our border.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWell, if deterrence of illegal immigration justifies visiting the sins (if that's what they are) of the parents upon the children, why stop there? Why not confine the children in cages, feed them only bread and water and confiscate their teddy bears? After all, the current policy is indifferent to the suffering the children will experience in the name of punishing the parents, so why not ramp it up? Surely that would be an even better deterrent.The president and his advisers routinely recommend harsh immigration measures on the grounds of national security and crime, as if our borders are being overrun by terrorists and rapists. A Republican National Committee campaign spot shows Nancy Pelosi criticizing President Trump's use of the term ""animals"" regarding gang members. Her comments are juxtaposed against a gruesome story of a Satanic murder committed by a ""Guatemalan native,"" and other stories of crimes committed by MS-13. The tagline: ""Democrats' midterm message: MS-13 killers ... they aren't so bad."" At his Tennessee rally, President Trump, with characteristic judiciousness, told the crowd that Pelosi ""loves MS-13.""But it's flatly false to say that immigrants are disproportionately represented among offenders. The Cato Institute has published several studies showing that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native born, and illegal immigrants are the most law-abiding of all. Overall crime rates in the United States, despite an uptick in murders in certain cities since 2014, have declined by 64% since 1990, while immigration rates spiked (immigration rates have declined since 2005). A study by four universities found that the 10 regions that had the largest increases in immigrants all had lower levels of crime in 2016 than in 1980.Of course there are awful cases. But the plural of anecdote is not data, and the appeal to fear is contemptible. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen expressed alarm that 300,000 would-be border crossers are apprehended yearly. But this is a stark drop from just 18 years ago, when more than 1.6 million were stopped. At the same time, more people are now leaving the U.S. to return to Mexico than arriving from Mexico.The dueling anecdote game can be played endlessly. ICE has arrested an illegal alien adult with Down syndrome, whose three siblings and father live in the U.S. An armed ICE agent was videotaped using a crowbar to enter a home. When the occupants demanded a warrant, he said, ""You're watching too many movies.""Most ICE agents doubtless follow the law and shouldn't be tarred by the bad acts of a few. The same can be said of immigrants.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market? Start with IBD University.

Higher market volatility has resulted in more trading activity — and commissions — for brokers.But financials are lagging several other sectors this year, including software, apparel, health care and semiconductors.To its credit, iShares Brokers-Dealers and Exchanges has a number of solid stocks. Charles Schwab is up about 25% from a breakout to new highs in November. Nasdaq shares are up about 20% from a November buy point. E-Trade has risen some 45% from a Nov. 27 breakout.Among losers, Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) plunged in early February after trading was halted on several inverted volatility products, potentially lowering trading volume at its Chicago Board Options Exchange. The stock has yet to recover. Lazard (LAZ) has been basing most of the year.The ETF itself is forming a cup-with-handle base with a 69.49 buy point. But the pattern is shallow and also could be interpreted as a flat base with a 70.68 entry.RELATED:Growth Of Cloud Computing Is Encapsulated In This FundActive Asset Allocation Made Easy With IBD ETF Leaders IndexHere's A Way To Invest In FANG Stocks With An ETF

13,ICE,"Oil dropped as rising U.S. output overshadowed a surprise decline in crude stockpiles, with traders also focused on whether Saudi Arabia and Russia will boost production.Futures in New York dropped 1.7% after briefly easing losses following an Energy Information Administration report showing a 3.62 million-barrel decline in U.S. crude inventories. That compared with a 450,000-barrel increase forecast in a Bloomberg survey.U.S. crude output, meanwhile, jumped to a record, pushing prices lower. At the same time, the market remains anxious on what a weekend meeting between international producers might lead to.""The draw is obviously constructive relative to market estimates, but what continues to drive prices here is really commentary from OPEC and Russia,"" said Nick Holmes, an analyst at Tortoise Capital Advisers in Leawood, Kansas, which manages $16 billion in energy-related assets. Weighing on the U.S. bench mark is rising crude production.Oil in New York has dropped about 5% since Saudi Arabia and Russia announced late last week that the two producers are discussing easing output curbs, with Brent gaining only slightly. Traders are looking for signs that the announcement will bear fruit and whether other producers will join in to ramp up output.West Texas Intermediate for July delivery fell $1.17 to settle at $67.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract posted a 2.2% drop this month.Brent futures for July settlement, which expires Thursday, added 9 cents to end the session at $77.59 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The more active August contract fell 16 cents to settle at $77.56.The global bench mark traded at a $10.55 premium to WTI for July.The widening of the spread is ""telling you that the U.S. is growing too fast and they don't have the capabilities to send it out and that's impacting local pricing,"" said Michael Loewen, a commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.The pipeline shortages now hammering Permian shale producers are likely to be a recurring theme in the coming years, Apache Corp.'s chief executive officer is warning. As oil remains trapped in the U.S., it's likely to further weigh on crude prices.At the same time, ConocoPhillips, the world's biggest independent oil explorer, may shift some spending away from the prolific shale play in West Texas and New Mexico, at least until its transport issues get sorted out, Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance told an investor conference Thursday.Meanwhile, the EIA reported refinery utilization rose and crude imports dropped 528,000 barrels a day last week, contributing to the overall crude draw. Yet, nationwide output rose for a 14th straight week to 10.8 million barrels a day.

The positive price-and-volume action points to institutional accumulation, a critical element of all confirmed uptrends.The solid earnings outlook, huge corporate buyback plan, and Apple's success in becoming a giant in digital services revenue (think its music service and Apple Pay) appear to stand as positive factors for further upside.The Street has trimmed its profit estimates recently, but still sees the bottom line growing 25% in the current fiscal year ending in September to $11.49 a share and up 15% to $13.25 in FY 2019.Grubhub, the leading company in the fast-growing market of online and mobile food ordering, fell more than 1% but is still acting fine.

15,ICE,"Trump Derangement Syndrome: Over the long weekend, President Trump's critics were in a sputtering rage over his supposedly losing 1,500 illegal immigrant children, sticking them in cages, and putting others on specially equipped prison buses. Turns out, it was all 100% bogus.On Sunday, photos of children laying inside a chain-link fence cage starting flying around the internet. New York Times Magazine editor-in-chief Jake Silverstein forwarded it to his followers, saying that ""all of these photos are disturbing, but the first two are especially awful.""CNN's Hadas Gold described the pictures as ""First Photos of separated migrant children at holding facility.""Outrage quickly followed.""This is happening right now,"" said former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau. ""Speechless. This is not who we are as a nation,"" said Antonio Villaraigosa, who is running for California governor. Actress Rosanna Arquette called it a ""sick crime against Humanity""Turns out the photos were taken in 2014 — when, ahem, President Obama was in the White House, a fact that nobody bothered to check before blowing a gasket. Once word of that fact got out, many of these same people deleted their tweets, rather than admit that the ""sick crime"" happened under their beloved Obama.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNext, there was a picture showing a bus outfitted with child safety seats being used at an ICE family detention center in Karnes County, Texas. ABC Houston reporter Antonio Arellano tweeted the picture on Sunday, describing it as ""a prison bus just for babies.""Again, outrage ensued.""Unconscionable and inhumane, ""said Texas Sen. Sylvia Garcia. ""This is what we've come to under Donald Trump,"" said Stephen King. Others tweeted: ""your new gestapo at work,"" ""this is what fascism looks like,"" ""we live in a dark period of American history,"" ""moral abomination."" Etc., etc.Oops. Turns out this picture, too, was taken when Obama was president. And, the bus was actually used to take the children on field trips to places like the San Antonio Zoo, a nearby park, the movies, as well as for medical treatment and court appointments.So much for the Trump-era inhumane prison bus for babies.Finally, there was the story flying around over the weekend about how the Trump administration had ""lost"" almost 1,500 illegal immigrant children who'd been ""ripped"" from their parents after crossing the border.That sparked yet out another round of hair-pulling outrage.""What is more shameful than forcibly separating, in America, parents from infant children at the border? And then, losing track of those children?"" Preet Bhara, former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, tweeted.Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro said that ""when I think about the 1500 lost children … I come back to the same thought: If we can't stop this in America we can't stop it anywhere.""Turns out the children hadn't been ""forcibly"" taken away from their parents, and they weren't lost, either.As the New York Times explained on Monday, these children didn't come across the southwest border with their parents, they came across illegally on their own. As the Times explains, the children in question are part of the government's long-standing relocation program for ""unaccompanied alien children,"" in which the children get released to sponsor families.Back in 2008, the inspector general for the Health and Human Services department noted that HHS and Homeland Security weren't regularly checking in on these children to make sure they were doing OK with their sponsor families. So, HHS started following up with the sponsors 30 days after the children's release.But, as the IG noted in a follow-up July 2017 report, HHS doesn't always succeed in its attempts to reach the sponsors. It reported that in the first half of 2016, HHS couldn't reach 16% of the 25,975 children placed with sponsors during those months.In other words, under President Obama, the government ""lost"" 4,156 illegal immigrant children in just the first six months of 2016!Anyone recall anyone complaining about the inhumanity of this when it was happening under Obama? Of course not.Trump's critics are increasingly behaving like reckless, irresponsible, childish, hate-filled, divisive, uninformed scaremongers who will believe anything that makes Trump look bad.

18,ICE,"U.S. oil prices fell back below $70 a barrel after President Trump tweeted that he would announce a decision on the Iran nuclear deal Tuesday afternoon.The benchmark crude price fell more than $1 a barrel immediately after the tweet, dropping below the $70 mark for the first time all day. The decline claimed most of West Texas intermediate's gains for Monday, with oil trading up 11 cents at $69.83 at 3:38 p.m.The surprise announcement of a decision Tuesday at 2 p.m. in Washington comes ahead of a May 12 deadline for the U.S. to either waive or reimpose sanctions as part of a nuclear deal with Iran and world powers. The Trump administration heard arguments in favor of the accord last week from French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. U.K. Foreign Minister Boris Johnson is in Washington this week to make a last-ditch argument to persuade Trump to remain in the accord.The fact that Trump announced the decision time without once again slamming the deal could have given the market some confidence that it may not be entirely scrapped, said Josh Graves, senior market strategist at RJO Futures. ""The market is probably considering from his comments that we stay in this deal. That we would tweak it and not totally leave the deal,"" he said. Keeping the deal would mean ""oil could trade back down to mid-$60s,"" said Graves.The 2015 Iran accord eases sanctions on the third-largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.U.S. consumers have felt the pain of rising crude prices since the start of the year.

19,ICE,"Oil dropped the most in almost three weeks Thursday after a surprise increase in American stockpiles and moves by Saudi Arabia to cool a rally that's drawn the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump.XFutures fell 1.6% in New York following a government report showing U.S. crude inventories climbed 1.25 million barrels last week as imports rose and exports fell. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had been expecting a median 5 million-barrel decrease as supplies typically decline this time of year amid strong demand from refiners.At the same time, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. lowered August pricing for most crude grades in Asia and Europe and cut them all in the U.S. a day after Trump called on OPEC to ""REDUCE PRICING NOW!"" in a tweet Wednesday. The kingdom was also said to have increased daily output by about half a million barrels in June.The market was expecting ""higher exports and lower imports, but we got the reverse,"" said Rob Thummel, managing director at Tortoise, which manages $16 billion in energy-related assets.Crude hit a three-year high of $75.27 on Tuesday as the outlook for less supply from Iran, Libya and Venezuela overshadows a pledge by OPEC and its allies to boost output by 1 million barrels a day. Inventories at the key U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, have declined for the seventh straight week.West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery fell $1.20 to settle at $72.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest close in a week. There was no settlement Wednesday due to the U.S. holiday.Brent for September settlement slid 85 cents to end the session at $77.39 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a $6.76 premium to WTI for the same month.In the U.S., crude imports rose to the highest level since February 2017, with crude coming from Canada at the highest on record. Meanwhile, crude exports fell by the most since mid-May. The EIA also reported refinery utilization ticked lower for the first time since early May. Gasoline supplies declined, while distillate stockpiles rose.In addition to cutting prices, Saudi Arabia told OPEC it pumped about 10.5 million barrels of crude a day last month as the kingdom sought to cap rallying prices by ramping up output, according to people familiar with the matter. The June figure would represent an increase of about 500,000 barrels a day from May.As OPEC and its allies implement their new agreement, the market will have to see how much oil Saudi Arabia will send onto the marketplace, said James Williams, president of London, Arkansas-based energy researcher WTRG Economics. ""But, there is clearly going to be a supply excess by mid-to-late September.""

20,ICE,"Crude oil declined Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on Saudi Arabia to ramp up oil output, with traders worrying about how it could affect spare capacity ahead.Following last week's rally, futures fell today in both London and New York after Trump tweeted over the weekend that Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz had agreed to boost production to the kingdom's maximum capacity in a push designed to overcome supply losses from Canada to Libya.""The commodity has gotten incredibly politicized now, beyond the supply-demand dynamic,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at New York-based hedge fund Again Capital LLC. Trump's pressure on Saudi Arabia ""is making the market nervous that it won't have any spare capacity, and/or the Saudis will do some harm potentially to their fields and rate of production,"" he said.The U.S. benchmark crude rallied more than 10% in June amid tightening inventory levels and global supply outages that increased the demand for domestic production. That's despite OPEC's pledge to boost supply levels, with Saudi Arabia's crude exports already surging to a 15-month high in June.West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery slid 21 cents to settle at $73.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.The premium at which front-month WTI futures traded to the September contract widened to $2.32 on Monday, the biggest premium for the front-month spread since 2014.Brent for September dropped $1.93 to end the session at $77.30 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a $5.68 premium to WTI for September.Following Trump's tweet, the White House said Saturday in a statement that King Salman bin Abdulaziz affirmed that Saudi Arabia has 2 million barrels-a-day of spare production capacity ""which it will prudently use if and when necessary to ensure market balance and stability, and in coordination with its producer partners, to respond to any eventuality.""The White House statement aligned with one by the state-run Saudi Press Agency saying that the king and Trump, in a phone call Saturday, discussed efforts by the oil-producing countries to compensate potential shortages in oil supply.Iran Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said any production increase above the limits agreed to by OPEC would ""breach"" the deal, according to a letter he sent to OPEC President Suhail Al Mazrouei and distributed by the Iran Oil Ministry's news service Shana.Brent fell more than WTI as OPEC production increases generally affect the international benchmark more, according to Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst for Price Futures Group Inc.""There was a lot of concern about his tweet,"" Flynn said. But, there are ""lingering doubts"" about Saudi Arabia's ability to increase production by that level.

21,ICE,"Crude oil rose to the highest price in a month Tuesday as U.S. pressure on allies to stop importing from Iran overshadowed a surge in Saudi Arabia's production.XFutures rose as much as 3.8% in New York amid growing supply concerns. The U.S. pushed allies to cut Iran oil imports to zero by November, a militia leader in Libya handed over control of some of the country's biggest crude-exporting terminals to an unrecognized authority, and an oil-sands upgrader in Canada may be shut for a month. Earlier, prices retreated briefly after Saudi Arabia was said planning to pump a record amount of crude in July.""Even if Saudi Arabia is ramping up, there's enough concern in the market about production shutdowns, whether it's Canada, Libya, to hold these prices up,"" said Rob Haworth, who helps oversee $151 billion at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. ""It's a market that still has a bullish bias to it.""In Libya, forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar, a commander in the politically divided nation's eastern region, turned over ports with a combined export capacity of 800,000 barrels a day to the National Oil Corp. in Benghazi, a city in the east.In Libya, some of the ports are going to be ""administered by the wrong person at this point,"" said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York.

Brent traded at a $5.90 premium to WTI.State oil company Saudi Aramco is aiming to boost production next month to about 10.8 million barrels a day, according to people briefed on the country's output policy, who asked not to be named discussing confidential information. That would surpass the previous high of 10.72 million barrels a day in November 2016.""They always increase crude production at this time of year because they burn crude directly to utilities"" to meet summer air conditioning, said Thomas Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group LLC in Wellington, Florida. ""Pending that, 800,000 barrels a day, even with the increase in cooling needs, feels like a pretty substantial increase.""Meanwhile, U.S. crude stockpiles probably fell 3 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey ahead of the release of Energy Information Administration data on Wednesday. Inventories at the biggest U.S. storage complex, in Cushing, Oklahoma, decreased 1.3 million barrels last week, according to a forecast compiled by Bloomberg.The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly tally of inventories later on Tuesday.

""His use of the militia as auxiliaries to the Continental Army regulars was inventive. … His surprising conclusion that self-interest more than patriotism was the prime factor in persuading men to remain loyal as the years of war accumulated was a profound insight crucial to recruiting a strong officer corps. But his strategy of victory came breathtakingly close to running out of time.""Washington (1732-1799) was born into a moderately prosperous plantation-owning family in Westmoreland County, Va. At 17, his brother's influential father-in-law decided to include him in a county surveying party. This enabled him three years later to buy 1,500 acres of his own.""Although Washington received what today we would consider only an elementary school education, he read widely, including works of history, philosophy, politics, and etiquette,"" Jeanne Abrams, a history professor at the University of Denver and author of ""First Ladies of the Republic,"" told IBD. ""He was also ambitious, hardworking, determined and a man of great integrity. He made it a point to listen to divergent opinions before making a final decision and he accomplished this in such an affable manner that people did not always realize the steely strength of his will.""At 21, Washington obtained a commission in the Virginia militia, with a dangerous mission to carry a message 250 miles through wilderness in the middle of winter to French forces in the Ohio Valley. He was to inform them that they were encroaching on British territory. The journey took four months. His party of seven was ambushed on the way back. Washington escaped by improvising a raft and swimming in a freezing river. The following April, he led 150 men to protect a fort being built at Pittsburgh. Washington displayed bravery in two battles, which helped trigger the global Seven Years War (known in North America as the French and Indian War).In 1755, despite suffering from malaria, Washington was the senior American aide to Gen. Edward Braddock on an expedition to expel the French from the Ohio Valley. At the Battle of Monongahela, the French and their Indian allies ambushed the British-American troops. They killed a third of the 976, including Braddock. Washington's courage in leading the survivors to safety won him the leadership of America's first full-time regiment. This role taught him the importance of training and discipline.As America's most famous soldier, Washington was the logical choice as commander in chief for the colonists after heavy-handed British tax legislation provoked the rebellion starting in April 1775 at Lexington and Concord. But the initial success of militias caused the rebels to become overconfident about their ability to defeat battle-hardened British veterans and Hessian mercenaries. The amateurs fled fierce bayonet charges. Recruiting became harder after defeats. Yet members of Congress feared that a professional army might empower a dictator. So when Washington asked for 60,000 troops, only 20,000 were approved and barely supplied.The rest of the year brought losses to both sides. The British occupied Philadelphia, the headquarters of the Continental Congress. The Americans won the Battle of Saratoga, N.Y. Washington, unlike most military commanders in history, wintered with his troops at Valley Forge, Pa., starting in December 1777, where 2,000 died from disease or exposure. For the next three years, the patriots suffered for lack of everything from food to ammo. They lost the South. They were only occasionally paid in nearly worthless dollars, and witnessed mutiny, treason and attempted coups against Washington.The turning point for independence came in 1781. Washington appointed his best general, Nathanael Greene, as the southern commander. He led a campaign of attack-and-retreat, like his mentor, against superior forces under Lord Charles Cornwallis, who finally marched to the coast at Yorktown, Va., to get reinforcements. But long-promised French warships arrived to keep the British navy away. The Franco-American army of 18,000 beat the 8,000 Redcoats into surrendering on Oct. 19. The war was effectively over because the British public was tired of the loss of treasure and lives.Washington learned other lessons along the path to victory that have wider leadership application:After the peace treaty was signed in 1783, Washington retired. However, the inadequacy of the Articles of Confederation to enable Congress to pay war debts led to the Constitutional Convention in 1787. Washington was elected the first president two years later.""Washington's highest priority was preserving the independence of a young and fragile country,"" said Alvin Felzenberg, author of ""A Man and His Presidents: The Political Odyssey of William F. Buckley Jr."" ""That meant maintaining a friendly distance from three powers that remained a presence in North America and in the Caribbean: France, Great Britain and Spain. War with any of them might result in the recolonization, so he fought hard for the Jay Treaty with Britain in 1795 because he felt it would take at least two more decades before the U.S. was strong enough to win another war with United Kingdom. That it nearly lost the war that commenced in 1812 underscored the soundness of his policy.""Washington stepped down from his second term in March 1797, dying less than three years later. He was the only major Founding Father to arrange in his will for the freeing of all his slaves following his death and the death of his wife.Led the British colonies in America to independence and became the first president of the United States.Overcame: Few resources to sustain a professional army to fight Britain's battle-hardened veterans.Lesson: Success often depends on the ability to be resilient in the face of repeated setbacks.""To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.""

24,ICE,"Taxes: Whatever you think about the issue of taxing internet sales, the simple fact is that the Supreme Court has just guaranteed that people across the country will now be paying more in state taxes. It's hard for us to see how this is good news.In its 5-4 decision on South Dakota v. Wayfair, the court overturned two previous rulings that prevented states from taxing sales of out-of-state companies. That meant a catalog company based in Maine didn't have to navigate 45 state sales-tax laws to figure out how much each customer owed, and then remit that money to the right states.Brick-and-mortar stores have been trying to lift this ban for decades, because, they say, it unfairly tilts the playing field in favor of catalog and online retailers. According to the Government Accountability Office, this break cost states up to $13.4 billion in lost revenue last year alone. And, retailers say it cost jobs and hurt local economies.Not surprisingly, Amazon.com  (AMZN), Shopify (SHOP), Etsy (ETSY), Wayfair (W) and other e-commerce stocks dropped on Thursday.The Supreme Court ruling was notable not just because it did something it rarely does — namely, overturn previous decisions. (The most recent, Quill v North Dakota, was in 1992.) The court also split in a highly unusual way.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the majority side were rock-ribbed conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, who sided with Justice Anthony Kennedy's opinion. But so did stalwart liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Kennedy argued that the explosive growth of online retail rendered the court's previous rulings outdated.Three of the other liberals on the court, Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, sided with Chief Justice Roberts' dissent. Roberts argued that it should be up to Congress to make a change like this.Whatever the merits of the decision, the Court's ruling means not only higher taxes for consumers, but higher prices.Keep in mind that despite online retail's explosive growth, the internet still accounts for less than 10% of all retail sales in the U.S., according to the Census Bureau. Plus, at least some of that growth represents entirely new sales that never would have occurred in an offline world.At the same time, the ruling means that online retailers — large and small — will soon have to comply with nearly 10,000 different tax jurisdictions across the country in the 45 states that impose sales taxes. That means different rates, varying definitions of products, and a variety of exemptions. The resulting complexity is mind-boggling.In New York, for example, clothing and footwear costing less than $110 is exempt from state sales tax, but not in some local jurisdictions. New York taxes shower caps and walking boots, but not swimming caps or hiking boots, says Avalara (AVLR), which makes automated tax software.Some states treat diapers as a health care item exempt from taxation, and others treat them as clothing. A few years ago, Wisconsin issued a 1,437-word bulletin explaining how the state taxed different forms of ice cream cakes. Then there are the various state tax ""holidays"" meant to goose sales.It is true that some states have tried to simplify their sales taxes to reduce compliance costs. And there are consulting firms that can help companies navigate this minefield.But there can be no doubt that this ruling means a higher cost of doing business. In fact, Avalara stock shot up 13.5% after the court's ruling. Tax complexity is always good news for tax consultants.In addition, smaller online firms will now be at a disadvantage, not only with local brick-and-mortar businesses that only have to comply with one state's sales-tax laws, but against online giants that can easily absorb the extra compliance costs.Worse still, the court may have opened the door to letting states impose other taxes on out-of-state firms.Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform argues that states could use this ruling to impose corporate taxes and even income taxes across state lines.""If physical nexus is no longer required for sales taxes ,then it is no longer required for personal or corporate income taxes,"" he said. ""Now, California (or any state or city that loses population through exit) can tax people and businesses who do their best to avoid that state or city.""If you think that's a fanciful prediction, you haven't been paying attention. State governments will take every opportunity they can to raise taxes — especially if their own residents aren't the ones paying them.In the end, it makes Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts' dissent look all the wiser.As he noted, the online retail industry has thrived up until now based on the existing rules regarding sales taxes.""Any alteration to those rules with the potential to disrupt the development of such a critical segment of the economy,"" he wrote, ""should be undertaken by Congress.""Anyone Notice That Trump Is Now Tied With 'Popular' Obama On Job Approval?The Economy Is Not An Engine — So Stop Describing It Like OneTrump Didn't Sign G-7's Leftist Agenda — Smart MoveMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

25,ICE,"Crude rose to the highest in more than a week Monday as cracks in a key pipeline threatened Nigerian oil exports and a schism deepened within OPEC over whether to allow more oil to flow onto global markets.Futures advanced 0.6% in New York. New leaks have been discovered in a Nigerian pipeline that's been shut since late last week and the operator provided no estimate for when deliveries will resume. Meanwhile, Iraq joined Iran and Venezuela in panning Saudi Arabian suggestions that it's time to unwind output caps.The Nigerian outage involves ""a big pipe, big delivery point,"" said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. At the same time, any signals that major producers like the Saudis are boosting output are ""going to tend to weigh on the market.""The self-discipline of the OPEC-led coalition that adopted historic supply restraints in early 2017 may already be slipping. Russia lifted crude output 140,000 barrels a day above its cap in the first week of June, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Saudi Arabia raised production last month to the highest since October, according to a person familiar with the kingdom's disclosures to the cartel.Russia and the Saudi kingdom have signaled they may formally propose a gradual production increase when OPEC and allies gather in Vienna on June 22-23.Yet, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaibi said OPEC and allied producers haven't reached their objectives and shouldn't be influenced by calls to pump more oil.West Texas intermediate crude for July delivery climbed 36 cents to settle at $66.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 24% below the 100-day average.Brent futures for August settlement ended the session unchanged at $76.46 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, and traded at a $10.43 premium to WTI for the same month.In the U.S., stockpiles stored at the pipeline complex in Cushing, Okla., fell by an estimated 900,000 barrels last week, according to a forecast compiled by Bloomberg.

26,ICE,"Illegal Immigration: The latest outrage by the Trump administration is its policy of ""ripping"" children away from parents who've crossed the border illegally. As with so many other things involving Trump, there's plenty of emotion but precious little in the way of facts.The furor reached critical mass after the Department of Homeland Security said on Friday that 1,995 children had been separated from their illegal border crossing parents from mid-April through May. That number included, DHS said, cases where the adults were arrested for illegal entry, immigration violations, or possible criminal conduct.The practice has generated a rising storm of protests, including from Republicans, ever since Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the administration's ""zero tolerance"" for illegal border crossers. Laura Bush took to the Washington Post's op-ed page to decry it as ""cruel"" and ""immoral."" Trump supporter Franklin Graham called it ""disgraceful.""Trump himself says he doesn't want to see families separated while the legal process works its way out, and then went on to blame Democrats for the problem.So what's going on here?First, it's important to note that many of the ""separations"" don't last long at all.As Rich Lowry explains in a detailed article in National Review, ""when a migrant is prosecuted for illegal entry, he or she is taken into custody by the U.S. Marshals,"" in which case, as when other adults are incarcerated in the U.S., they are separated from their children.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLowry notes that ""The criminal proceedings are exceptionally short, assuming there is no aggravating factor such as a prior illegal entry or another crime. Migrants generally plead guilty, and then are sentenced to time served, typically all in the same day.""The Los Angeles Times reports that Rio Grande Valley border agents prosecuted 568 adults and separated 1,174 children since the administration announced its ""zero tolerance"" policy in early April. However, it only took a matter of hours to reunite more than a third of these children with their parents.That hardly constitutes an inhumane policy of ""ripping"" children away from their parents.Most of the concern about family separations centers on the administration's handling of asylum seekers who've crossed the border illegally.In the past, the practice has been to simply detain these families for a short time in an ICE facility. But rather than return for their asylum hearing, many just disappeared into the country.Under the ""zero tolerance"" policy, Trump has tried to put an end to this ""catch and release"" policy, by arresting every adult caught illegally crossing the border.If parents choose to seek asylum, they can end up separated from their children for months while the asylum process plays out.The administration is right to point out, however, that there is a legal process for seeking asylum that won't involve facing such a choice — just show up at a port of entry to make the asylum claim.""As I have said many times before, if you are seeking asylum for your family, there is no reason to break the law and illegally cross between ports of entry,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tweeted over the weekend.Critics complain that the legal process just takes too long, as a way to justify illegal border crossings. But illegal border crossers are not only jumping the line. Under the old system they could vastly increase their chances of staying in the country — with or without gaining asylum status.Is it wrong for Trump to try to close this unfair and potentially dangerous loophole?Another fact conveniently overlooked amid all the hysteria is that just because a group claims to be a family, doesn't mean it's true. The Department of Homeland Security says that from October 2017 to February 2018 it saw ""a 315% increase in the number of cases with minors fraudulently posing as 'family units' to gain entry.""Presumably that's because they think posing as a family will improve their chances of avoiding deportation. Whatever the reason, those children's separation from their parents occurred long before the border patrol showed up.To be sure, the administration's bungling response to the outcry over its policies has made it harder to understand, much less defend, what's going on.But those protesting family separations should at least acknowledge that there are reforms available that don't involve returning to the days of ""catch and release,"" while still keeping families together — which is the ideal solution — such as letting children stay in detention centers for more than 20 days, and boosting funds for family shelters at the border.Getting such reforms done in today's massively polarized environment, however, is unlikely. The question is, who's to blame for that?Lost Children?

Despite their proposal, President Trump on Wednesday criticized OPEC for inflating prices. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency said Iran and Venezuela could lose almost 30% of their output by the end of next year due to U.S. sanctions and economic upheaval, requiring extra supplies from OPEC's Gulf members.Saudi Arabia is mulling various different scenarios to raise supplies. One proposal envisages a single hike of just 500,000 barrels a day. Another would see an immediate increase of 500,000 barrels followed by a similar addition in the fourth quarter. The kingdom has also shared ideas that float an increase of about 600,000 to 700,000 barrels a day.In the U.S., government data showed crude stockpiles declined by 4.14 million barrels last week, steeper than estimated by analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The drop also ran counter to an industry report a day earlier showing an increase. Gasoline and distillates also slid last week, the Energy Information Administration said. Meanwhile, crude production rose to 10.9 million barrels a day, topping 10 million every week since early February.

Cities across the country passed ordinances announcing that, to one degree or another, they wouldn't cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, even when it involved illegal immigrants who had committed crimes.According to the Center for Immigration Studies, more than 150 cities and counties have declared themselves sanctuaries for illegal immigrants.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The law, which went into effect at the start of this year, bans state and local law enforcement from holding illegal aliens on the basis of federal immigration detainers, and bans law enforcement from asking anyone about their immigration status. It also in many cases prohibits them from sharing information with ICE — including the release of inmates from a county jail — that isn't available to the general public.That prompted the Justice Dept. to sue the state in March, claiming the state law obstructed enforcement of federal immigration laws. More than a dozen cities and counties in California have either joined the Justice suit or are passing ordinances exempting them from the state ""sanctuary"" law.The Trump administration has attempted to withhold federal law enforcement grants from ""sanctuary cities,"" but a federal judge on Wednesday ruled in favor of the city of Philadelphia.

33,ICE,"Less than two weeks after Germany refused to participate in U.S.-led airstrikes intended to punish Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons, Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives in Washington tomorrow to ask President Trump to keep waiving sanctions against Iran — Assad's financial underwriter. Trump should respond by inviting Merkel to join a transatlantic coalition to impose maximum pressure on both Iran and Syria, whose aggression and atrocities represent grave violations of the principles Germany has embraced since 1945.The persuasion of Merkel may be a tall order for Trump, given recent trends. In 2017, Germany led the European Union with some 3.5 billion euros (roughly $4.2 billion) in exports to Iran — a spike of more than a third from the prior year. According to recent reports, parts sold by a German company were even found in the wreckage of an Iranian-made rocket that the Assad regime used to deliver chemical weapons in Syria.Given the trajectory of German-Iranian commerce, Merkel's determination to keep Trump in the Iran nuclear deal might make sense in a vacuum. After all, if the U.S. reimposes sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran, German banks will be forced to halt all Iran-related transactions and dramatically reduce bilateral trade.But we don't live in a vacuum. Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, is anything but a normal trading partner — and Germany has a unique responsibility to oppose atrocities, even if there is a financial cost to pay.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

34,ICE,"Get premium stock lists, pass or fail stock ratings and more. Start HereThe painful memories evoked by footage of children choking to death on poison gas should drive Merkel to assume a leadership role in the effort to hold Assad accountable. Likewise, Iranian threats to wipe out the Jewish state should be a call to action. That means applying maximum pressure on both Assad and his Iranian underwriters, including the Central Bank of Iran.Right now, Germany's position on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the Iranian nuclear deal is formally known, amounts to an abdication of historic responsibilities. If Merkel wants to persuade Trump to stay in the deal, she must accept two basic truths: First, Europe's fear of undermining the JCPOA has deterred them from holding Iran and Syria accountable in any way. Second, the nuclear deal's visible flaws, such as a failure to address ballistic missiles, provide Iran with a patient path to building the weapons that could wipe Israel off the map.Despite reported progress this week between Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron toward reaching a transatlantic agreement to (correct) the deal's flaws, concerns about both missiles and non-nuclear sanctions may yet lead Trump to exit the deal.Under the framework being negotiated, Europe reportedly wants to apply minor sanctions on Iran's existing short and medium range ballistic missile arsenal while reserving the toughest sanctions for nonexistent longer-range missiles. The problem for Trump? This would be a departure from past United Nations Security Council resolutions calling on Iran to cease work on all nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, regardless of range.Additionally, it could give Tehran an implicit green light to perfect missiles targeting Israel — something no American president can or should allow. Nor should a German chancellor, for that matter.Merkel could increase the odds of keeping Trump in the JCPOA if she agreed to a full ""snapback"" of pre-JCPOA sanctions in response to Iranian development of any nuclear-capable missile. If Iran wants to keep its sanctions relief — and with its currency in free fall the mullahs most certainly do — the regime should have to put its missile program on ice.The second issue, non-nuclear sanctions, is critical for any Syria strategy to be successful. In 2015, the Obama administration promised that nothing in the JCPOA would preclude the West from imposing tough sanctions on Iran for illicit activities unrelated to its nuclear program, including terrorism, weapons proliferation and human rights.Regardless, no sanctions have been imposed for non-nuclear reasons on any entity for which sanctions were suspended under the JCPOA. Why? International fear that doing so, even if technically allowed, would trigger an Iranian exit from the deal.In the case of Syria, that status quo is untenable. The Central Bank of Iran and the Export Development Bank of Iran, for example, are key pillars in Iran's financial sponsorship of the Assad regime. A strategy to exert maximum pressure on Assad that grants blanket immunity to his Iranian underwriters is doomed to fail.To ensure that this fatal flaw of the JCPOA does not carry over to a transatlantic ""fix,"" Merkel should offer to publicly recognize the legitimacy of reimposing sanctions for non-nuclear reasons on any entity for which sanctions were initially suspended under the deal. That includes Iran's central bank for its support of the Assad regime.If Merkel wants to mend her relationship with Trump and keep him in the nuclear deal, there's a path for success in front of her. Otherwise, she'd better tell her businesses back home to prepare for an American exit.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

35,ICE,"Finally, some good news for the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement. CNBC is reporting that a framework for a renewed and improved NAFTA may be coming in the weeks ahead.It may be now or never for modernizing and extending this trade treaty. Although NAFTA needs repair, this freer-trade agreement has been positive for all three of its nations: the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Trade across borders of our three countries is up almost 60 percent over the last two decades. More importantly, NAFTA is vital to ensuring that North America remains the economically supreme continent over Asia and Europe. North America, for example, can easily become the Middle East of oil and gas production in the first half of the 21st century.The revised agreement must be finished by the end of May for two reasons. One is that the deal needs to be voted on before the end of the year because Republicans may lose the House or Senate in November, and we know that Democrats will (figuratively) burn the place down if they take Congress -- meaning they will stymie any legislation President Trump wants.Second, Mexico has elections this summer, which could elevate a leftist government that would impede a deal on NAFTA.Trump may be willing to be flexible on some of his stands on helping U.S. automakers -- which would break the ice at the negotiating table. But he should also be firm on other issues. The White House is right to insist on better U.S. access to the Canadian and Mexican markets for manufacturing goods.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHe also must insist on securing intellectual property protections in NAFTA for American innovators. IP-intensive industries (music, entertainment, software and biotechnology among them) support 45 million jobs -- nearly a third of U.S. employment -- and produce more than $7 trillion of value-added output, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.We know that the U.S. loses about half a trillion dollars of income a year due to theft of our IP products abroad. Most of that is in China, but it's a problem with Mexico and Canada, too.Technology is improving at near light speed, and governmental protections struggle mightily to keep pace. The reason we need to renegotiate NAFTA in the first place is because in just a few short decades, the pace of technology has eclipsed the standard of law.Just look at the life sciences industry, where the pace of innovation is incredibly exciting for combating life-threatening diseases.The future of personalized medicine rests largely on biologics: personally tailored drugs that work with an individual's unique biology to treat, cure and prevent disease. The work in this field is spectacularly promising and could revolutionize modern medicine with respect to cancer, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, heart disease and Parkinson's, just to name a few.Our patents need to be honored and secured not only for economic reasons but also to encourage and accelerate the very innovation that makes this disease-free future possible. Medical innovation benefits everyone on the planet.Many of our biological patents and data collection are protected for 12 years under U.S. law.Today, Canada provides eight years of protection for biologics; Mexico in some cases provides none without costly judicial intervention. This is unfair, harmful to American companies and bad for medical progress.This is where White House Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer should be insistent in the final rounds of negotiations. Every year of protection that we cede in NAFTA sacrifices billions of dollars -- vital revenues that could be invested in research and development for new medicines and jobs in America. It is in America's economic interests to hold our NAFTA partners to the same high standard that is law in the U.S.Steve Forbes, my colleague at the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, states it well: ""The U.S. should now make fair pricing of American drugs overseas a top trade priority."" Amen to that.Trump once called NAFTA the ""worst trade deal ever,"" but if he succeeds in getting a better deal for American producers and workers, he should take it.In this and other trade deals, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, we need safeguards against theft and price controls of American technology and intellectual property -- which is now a multitrillion-dollar industry. Trump should use the model that worked well in the promising revamped trade deal with South Korea, which adds new and solid IP protections.What a wonderful irony it will be if Donald Trump winds up as the president who continues to promote trade deals with South Korea, China and our North American neighbors that secure freer and fairer trade to the benefit of American workers and the global economy.Other columns by Stephen Moore

DoorDash recently announced plans to nearly triple that to 1,600 cities, thanks to a SoftBank-led $535 million round of funding. Food courier rivals include Grubhub (GRUB)-Seamless, Postmates and Eat24, which Grubhub bought from Yelp (YELP) last year. UberEats, another player, is the main delivery partner for McDonald's (MCD).But whether DoorDash and its peers find success beyond hot food delivery is a question mark.

The online sales giant partnered with food delivery firm Olo in September, offering the Olo's restaurant database on Amazon Restaurants, including Chipotle (CMG), Shake Shack (SHAK) and Wingstop (WING). (The announcement pinched Grubhub stock for a session.)And Facebook (FB) rolled out a new food ordering feature in October, with DoorDash as one of its third-party couriers.""One of the hardest things about restaurant delivery is knowing where all the offline assets are,"" said Xu. ""Where are the parking spaces? Which line should we enter to pick up the food? Do we enter through the front door or the back door? All of these things are things we first must digitize, then study, then build into the product itself.""As it looks to expand to 1,000 more cities, maintaining quality is tough, he said. But Xu intends for DoorDash to become a ""last-mile logistics layer"" in which ""you'll be able to see us deliver any type of good.""Still, McKinsey analysts asserted in July that profitability will be ""out of reach"" for startups trying to expand beyond hot food.

46,ICE,"Oil traded above $66 a barrel Tuesday morning as global trade tensions showed signs of easing, countering concerns that U.S. crude stockpiles may have resumed their expansion last week.A resurgence in risk appetite has helped lift markets from equities to commodities after a report that the Trump administration is urging China to lower tariffs on cars during talks to calm trade tensions. Yet a small estimated increase in U.S. inventories is keeping a lid on oil-price gains.Crude oil has recovered near January highs after President Trump last week appointed John Bolton as his national security advisor, signaling the U.S. may pursue a more hard-line approach against Iran and disrupt outflows from the OPEC member. While global stockpiles are tightening in a sign that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' production cuts are working, fears still remain that surging U.S. production could thwart those efforts.""Oil prices gained and now they're testing this key resistance level"" of the January high, said Hans Van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro. ""We're waiting for the inventory data to see if it can push prices higher. Markets expect them to remain little changed, so any surprise drop could do the trick.""West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery traded at $66.26 a barrel Tuesday morning on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Sports Illustrated named what's become known as the ""Miracle On Ice"" as the greatest sports moment of the 20th century.Johnson went on to have a successful professional playing career and has continued to make his mark as a four-time championship collegiate women's hockey coach.He's the son of Hall of Fame hockey coach Bob Johnson, and his father left Mark a piece of advice the keeps him going today.""My father was upbeat and positive all the time,"" Johnson, 60, told IBD. ""He saw the light at the end of the tunnel no matter what situation he or his team was in. His slogan was: `It's a great day for hockey.'""And it's that mentality that Mark Johnson lives every day.Carla MacLeod, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who played for Johnson on the University of Wisconsin-Madison's women's hockey team, emailed him for advice when she coached Japan's women's hockey team at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.""Mark gave me some technical stuff and details, things like that, but what he told me to do was go for a walk every day and appreciate the fact that through hard work I was enjoying these Olympics, too,"" MacLeod said. ""Mark is incredibly grounded and incredibly humble.""As a player Johnson represented the United States in 13 international tournaments. At only 5'9"" and 160 pounds, he had an 11-year NHL career where he scored 203 goals, assisted on 305 others and amassed 508 points. He was chosen to play in the 1984 NHL All Star Game.Johnson was inducted into the Wisconsin Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 and the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2004.""The big thing is the commitment that it takes individually to try to become the best player you can be,"" Johnson said. ""The hard part is doing it on a daily basis and creating those habits that are going to make you successful. You know along the way there is going to be some hurdles and obstacles but it's that you're willing to stay committed and form really good habits that will make you successful.""Mike Eruzione, the 1980 Team USA captain, said to the New York Daily News that Johnson was ""the best player and most important player on our team. … We don't win without Mark. … When we needed big goals, Mark scored them.""Johnson followed in his father's footsteps and began his coaching career with the Madison Monsters, a minor league hockey team, in 1995-96. From there he became an assistant coach for the University of Wisconsin-Madison men's ice hockey team from 1996 until 2002.Johnson served as an assistant coach for the American national men's hockey team in 2000 and 2002.Since 2002, Johnson has been the head coach of the University of Wisconsin-Madison women's ice hockey team. He led the team to its first NCAA national championship in 2006. They repeated as national champions in 2007, 2009 and 2011.Coming into this season, Johnson's career record is 428-78-39, good for a .819 winning percentage. He ranks third in NCAA history in career wins in women's hockey.In 2010, Johnson coached the United States women's national ice hockey team to a silver medal at the Vancouver Winter Olympics.""I see myself as a coach who serves the people in front of him,"" Johnson said. ""It's my job to try to serve to their needs and try to create a culture that's positive and gives the opportunity for each one of them to grow and reach their potential.""I try to set an example on how I conduct myself on a daily basis, whether things are going well or not going well, being consistent in that approach.""""Mark is always positive,"" said Wisconsin women's hockey associated head coach Dan Koch, who has coached under Johnson for 14 years. ""Mark makes it enjoyable to come to the rink every day. The players know they are going to be held accountable, they know they have to work hard but they know they are going to enjoy themselves.""Johnson makes the effort to understand his players as people, and treats them as he would want to be treated in the various situations that arise. ""I think developing those relationships is crucial and by doing so I have a better chance to understand them.""Born in Minneapolis, Johnson was raised in Wisconsin. With hockey in his blood and guidance from his father, he made his international hockey debut with the United States national team in 1976 at age 18. He played in 11 training games for the 1976 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team coached by his father.He went to play hockey for his father at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 1977, with father coaching and son playing, the Badgers won the NCAA national championship in ice hockey. Johnson was the first Badger to win the Western Collegiate Hockey Association's Rookie of the Year award.He went on to become a two-time All-American, the school's leading goal scorer and its second all-time scorer.Team USA in 1980 was composed of amateur collegiate players and fielded its youngest team ever, with an average age of 21. By contrast, the Soviet team was composed of full-time athletes battle-tested in international play. They were essentially professionals before that was allowed in the Olympics. The Soviet team had spent the previous 10 to 12 years together and had taken home the Gold Medal in hockey the previous four Winter Olympics and five of the previous six.Many of their players were in the Red Army. Their training regimen consisted of living in army barracks and training together four to five times a day. They had beaten an NHL all-star team 6-0 just the year before. The Soviet team was considered on par with NHL teams and had some of the best hockey players in the world.There was also a political backdrop to the games. The Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan two months earlier and the Cold War was in full force. Talk from the Carter Administration of boycotting the upcoming Moscow Summer Olympic Games was already happening due to that invasion.Johnson recalls the team being shown thousands of telegrams encouraging them to beat the communist Russians.But just 13 days previously, the Soviets had routed Team USA 10-3 in a pre-Olympic exhibition game.Now at the Olympics, both Team USA and the Soviets were undefeated going into their medal match. The game was played on Friday, Feb. 22, 1980, starting a 5 p.m. in the East, not even prime time.With the Russians leading 2-1 with just five seconds to go in the first period, Johnson raced between two defensemen and slapped in the puck on a rebound with one second left.""I look up at the clock and see five seconds,"" Eruzione said. ""I'm starting to skate toward the bench and all of a sudden Mark flies by me and I'm thinking, 'Where the hell is he going?'""""You're trained to play until you hear whistles or horns and so you keep going,"" Johnson said.The Soviets dominated the second period but scored only once, taking a 3-2 lead into the third and final period. Nearing the end of a power-play man advantage, Russian defenseman Sergei Starikov mishandled the puck right in front of his own net. Johnson was on the spot and slapped the puck in to tie the game with around 10 minutes to play.On the heels of that, Eruzione scored to put Team USA in front 4-3. Despite a furious finish by the Soviets, the Americans hung on to win.After Team USA's victory over the Soviet Union, ABC announcer Al Michaels famously asked: ""Do you believe in miracles?""The answer was ""yes,"" and in the gold medal game vs. Finland, Johnson assisted on the game-winning goal and scored an insurance goal with less than four minutes remaining in the game to cap off Team USA's improbable run.The preparation that coach Herb Brooks put the team through was challenging and confusing to the players, Johnson said, but ""when the moment was presented to us, it was like oh that's why we had to be in this type of condition, that's why we had to be ready mentally to withstand some of the things that were being thrown at us. We were fortunate enough to have the preparation needed to create a situation where we had an opportunity and we seized it.""Star player on the 1980 ""Miracle on Ice"" USA Olympic Hockey Team, United States Hockey Hall of Fame inductee (2004), four-time NCAA championship coach of the University of Wisconsin-Madison women's ice hockey team.Overcame: The Soviet hockey machine that had dominated the Olympics.Lesson: Believe you can do it and then put in the work to make miracles happen.""You've got to be passionate about what you do.""

Long, tight curls spill out from under his baseball cap as he throws his head back and howls delightedly in selfies with nut-butter enthusiasts who approach him in a steady stream. One woman stops to tell Justin that her mother is a big fan.At food trade show Natural Products Expo West, where alternative meats and other health-conscious products reign supreme, everyone wants to say hi to the creator of Justin's Nut Butter. You probably can't say the same about the makers of Skippy.Such is the marketplace for natural foods now. Once the hippy-dippy niche of places like Whole Foods, the arena in 2018 is stacked with players hawking Greek yogurt and kale chips and high-protein everything on shelves at Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR).""It's a lot more competitive, but now there's more (shelf) space that's available,"" said Gold of the changes to the industry over the years. Larger retailers like Kroger, Target (TGT) and Walmart are looking to put more organic products on their shelves, he said.The interest means that Big Food heavyweights — such as General Mills (GIS), Nestle and PepsiCo (PEP) — have been snapping up natural and organic food startups, a trend that NPD's food and beverage industry analyst, Darren Seifer, does not see stopping.Acquisitions give legacy packaged-food companies entry to the natural and organics market with a brand that has ""believability,"" said Seifer.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportJustin's Nut Butter, for its part, was acquired by Hormel (HRL) in 2016. That brought the almond- and cashew-butter company under the same umbrella as Spam, Hormel Chili and peanut butter stalwart Skippy.The added resources of a food titan like Hormel gave Justin's the fuel to ensure that all of its products' secondary ingredients could also be organic, something that Justin's could ""probably not"" have accomplished by itself, said Gold.But that doesn't mean every new food company out there is looking to ultimately be acquired.The idea of being acquired ""would worry me, at this stage,"" said Snow Monkey co-founder Rachel Geicke. Snow Monkey, a plant-based, nut-free, vegan ""superfood ice treat,"" lists banana puree as its first ingredient. It is sold in about 300 stores across a dozen states and comes in flavors such as passion fruit, goji berry and cacao.""We've technically only been on the market for about 14 months, so it's still very new, and I think what's really important for a young company is ensuring we're shaping culture and as we grow we never forget why we started,"" she said.Better-for-you ice creams were popular at this year's Expo West. Not surprising, given that indie brand and Expo alum Halo Top managed to outsell freezer staples Ben & Jerry's (owned by Unilever (UN)) and Haagen-Dazs (owned by Nestle) in the supermarket pint category last year.""Companies like Halo Top are sort of what the industry needed,"" Snow Monkey co-founder Mariana Ferreira told Investor's Business Daily at the expo. ""It needed a little bit of a shake, to show the big guys you can't be comfortable. You can't put out the same thing all the time.""Smaller brands are the ones bringing the innovation, she added, something that ""isn't fast enough with these big companies.""Nevertheless, they aren't ruling out the possibility of M&A down the road. An acquisition could provide strategic advantages, and ""there could be some really great big partner for us to do that with,"" said Geicke.Either way, the current eating trends are good for business.""What's really promising for us to see is that health has never been so mainstream, and it continues to be,"" said Geicke. ""When you walk into Costco and you're seeing products that you would usually only find at Whole Foods, that's amazing to see the industry shift.""

The glut that had weighed on prices for the past three years has finally been eliminated, thanks to strong demand and output cuts by other producers in OPEC, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday.Oil's advance to $80 brings it to the level that OPEC's biggest member, Saudi Arabia, is reportedly seeking to cover the cost of weighty domestic spending commitments. However the IEA has warned that prices are high enough to hurt consumption, and trimmed its forecasts for demand growth.""Supply concerns are top of mind after the U.S. left the Iran nuclear deal,"" said Norbert Ruecker, head of macro and commodity research at Julius Baer Group Ltd. in Zurich.

While the bill provided for $165 billion in much needed defense spending increases over the next two years, to get Democrat votes to overcome the filibuster, it also included additional spending for Planned Parenthood, the National Endowment for the Arts, Legal Services and hundreds of other special (liberal) interest programs that have come to typify the ""swamp"" of Washington spending.The Filibuster Rule, which requires 60 votes to pass any appropriation in the Senate, offers Senate Minority Democrats power the voters did not give them.  And Democrats are very good at using that rule to get results the majority of voters do not support, like the recent Omnibus spending bill.After years of the budget Sequester rules and war in the Middle East draining the military to dangerously low levels, Democrats understood that a defense spending increase was essential to Republicans. The Omnibus also included $90 billion in disaster relief for humanitarian assistance and rebuilding after hurricanes in Texas, Florida, and other key Republican states.  Democrats know Republicans do not want to disappoint their own voters in these large states.So Democrats also leveraged those Republican preferences and national priorities into restrictions on border and immigration enforcement, limitations on hiring more ICE border enforcement agents, and on deportations of illegal aliens who have committed violent crimes within the U.S., as well as continued funding for Obamacare.The resulting supposedly nearly $1 trillion in deficits is inflated by phony official estimates of $1.5 trillion in revenue losses over 10 years attributed to the tax reform/tax cuts. Rapid economic growth from tax reform will surprise the untutored who fail to account for the glorious history of tax revenue increases from prior tax cuts. Those additional revenues plus the spending cuts identified below can actually balance the budget, as resulted in four consecutive years from 1998 to 2001 following the 1990s Gingrich budget cuts.The Omnibus spending increases can be offset through the 1974 Impoundment Act, which empowers the President to rescind appropriated federal spending if Congress approves within 45 days by simple majority vote, with no Filibuster, as Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel pointed out recently.The President can name specific spending cuts under that Impoundment Act which simple Republican majorities can approve offsetting ultimately the entire $300 billion Omnibus spending increase over two years. That would thrill the Republican conservative base and redeem Republican Congressional majorities.Strassel identifies for specific cuts ""everything from carbon-capture technology to pecan producers to the Gateway Tunnel Project to the Environmental Protection Agency."" She also suggests adopting the cuts proposed in President Trump's budget, including ""wholesale cuts in domestic agencies—like the EPA or the Education Department [state and local government responsibility].""Cutting the Education Department would be especially supportive of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who had proposed $9 billion in Department cuts in Trump's budget, only to have education unions reverse that in the Omnibus for $2.6 billion in spending increases, with the additional funding focused on Obama Administration education initiatives.To that we can add some cuts to Obamacare, and corporate welfare in Commerce, Agriculture and Energy. Spending cuts remember were a third element in Reagan's economic growth plan, right after tax cuts and deregulation.The Filibuster Rule is what empowers Democrats to threaten government shutdowns, as Democrats know their party-controlled media will make sure Republicans are blamed.  Republicans forget that they have won every election after shutdowns resulting in reduced spending, all the way back to the Reagan years.The Filibuster does not date back to the Founding Fathers, or the Constitution.  It arose out of 19th century Senate rules limiting debate, formalized in its modern form only about 100 years ago.Decades ago, the Filibuster Rule was reduced from 67 votes to 60.  More recently, confirmation of presidential appointments, judges and now even Supreme Court Justices now only require a simple majority.  That has worked out well, enabling Trump to appoint a more consistently conservative Cabinet even than Reagan's, and top-notch judges without nasty judicial confirmation battles.Now it is time for the Filibuster to be eliminated, at least for every fiscal vote.  Democrats can enjoy power over taxes and spending they earn at the ballot box, not as granted to them by outdated Senate rules.But think of the federal fiscal liberation of voting as in reconciliation with no filibuster rule on everything: repeal of Obamacare, tax cuts, deregulation, privatization, and most fundamentally entitlement reform.  This is what Washington and democracy can look like.

58,ICE,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowDemocrats — California is essentially a one-party state — recently passed three laws that they knew seriously conflicted with federal laws, but were nonetheless favored by the extreme open borders advocates among the Democrats.The laws, together, make it a crime for businesses to voluntarily aid federal agents in nabbing undocumented workers; keep California law enforcement officers from telling federal agents when illegal immigrant detainees are released from jail, prison or other custody; and create special state inspections for federal immigration detention facilities.Let's be clear: Whatever your views on immigration, California's actions are plainly illegal. The Constitution gives the federal government control over our borders and immigration, part of its duty to defend the U.S. The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, meanwhile, establishes federal law as ""the supreme law of the land.""This is a federal-state crisis, and deserves to be treated as such. Unfortunately, California's top politicians treat their law-breaking as a joke.""At a time of unprecedented political turmoil, Jeff Sessions has come to California to further divide and polarize America,"" said California Gov. Jerry Brown. ""Jeff, these political stunts may be the norm in Washington, but they don't work here. SAD!!!""California's State Attorney General Xavier Becerra, though somewhat more serious, bizarrely claimed that ""public safety"" enabled him to defy federal law. And he put forth the entirely erroneous legal theory that state law trumps federal law.""No matter what happens in Washington, California will stay the course and enforce all our laws and protect our people,"" he said. ""That's how we keep our communities safe.""This is more than just another joke about loony, screw-loose California politicians. Laugh if you will, but California has 38 million people, about 12% of the nation's total. It has at least 2.5 million illegal immigrants, or about 21% of the official U.S. total (some believe the number is far larger). It also has about a third of the nation's welfare recipients. As such, California's policies have an enormous impact on other states.One need only look at the tragic example of the murderous Salvadorean MS-13 gang, which began in Los Angeles but now has spread mayhem, murder and drug addiction across the U.S. This isn't an argument between California and the federal government; it's really an argument between California and the other 49 states.Just last weekend, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf warned illegal immigrant criminals in her city of an impending ICE operation. About half of those that ICE picked up had criminal records, including a variety of violent crimes. But hundreds of criminal illegals escaped, free to rob, rape and assault again, thanks to Schaaf. Oakland's mayor may think herself a heroine, but she's now guilty of a felony.It's ironic that impeccably progressive, far-left California seems to be following the Confederacy down the road to asserting a state's right of ""nullification"" of federal laws. Recall that it was this very same nonexistent ""right"" that southern states asserted in the 1800s to defy the federal government on tariffs and slavery, and again in the 1950s to ignore desegregation laws passed by the federal government. Those did not end well for the states involved.Indeed, progressives, since the founding of their movement in the late 19th century and early 20th century, have ardently advocated and argued for the idea that the federal government should have supreme power. Suddenly, now, they're neo-Confederates. When laws don't suit them, the descendants of those early progressives simply reverse the argument. Don't like a law? Ignore it and write your own.""There is no nullification. There is no secession. Federal law is the supreme law of the land. I would invite any doubters to go to Gettysburg, to the tombstones of John C. Calhoun and Abraham Lincoln. This matter has been settled,"" said Sessions in his speech Wednesday.The federal government can't look away. Those who flout the law must be punished with fines, federal aid penalties and, if need be, prison terms. This is not a game. Letting the once-Golden State slide would be an invitation to other states to ignore the Constitution and our nation's laws. It would be an invitation to chaos and, eventually, the dissolution of the U.S.For now, this will make its way through the courts, a tortuous process that can take years. In the interim, we would hope that those who are knowingly breaking the law would be arrested and tried for it.

62,ICE,"California: There may be hope in California yet. Despite the state's political descent into madness by illegally declaring itself a ""sanctuary state,"" the resistance it growing. California has a political and legal fight on its hands, one it can't win.The state's Sanctuary State Law has been challenged by the Justice Department. Why? In effect, California's morally preening far-left government says its law matters more than U.S. law. The once-Golden State has made it legal to interfere with the federal government's duty to enforce U.S. immigration laws. That includes arresting, trying and deporting those who come here illegally and commit crimes.Attorney General Jeff Sessions has declared California's effort illegal and unconstitutional. And it's almost certain that the state's sanctuary laws will be overturned in higher courts, if not the U.S. Supreme Court. The state literally seems to be trying to secede from the rest of the country.But some aren't waiting for a genteel legal end to the dispute. The sheriff's department in sprawling Orange County said that, in response to the state's actions, it will begin listing the names and release dates of inmates to aid federal law enforcement efforts. The idea is to tell both the public and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, whose job it is to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""This is in response to ... (the so-called ""California Values Act"") limiting our ability to communicate with federal authorities and our concern that criminals are being released to the street when there's another avenue to safeguard the community by handing them over (to ICE authorities),"" Don Barnes, an Orange County undersheriff, told the Orange County Register.While Orange County voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, it's now ""the epicenter of a small but growing movement opposing the state's resistance to President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement policies in recent month."" In other words, the ""resistance"" now meets its own resistance.The Orange County board of supervisors, likewise, is mulling how to oppose the state's new sanctuary laws, including possibly suing the state government. Earlier this month, Los Alamitos, a small Orange County town, voted to reject the California Values Act inside the city. A handful of other cities — including Buena Park, Mission Viejo, Huntington Beach and Yorba Linda — are likewise objecting to the new law.As we noted, the federal government sides with the denizens of Orange County, with Sessions putting California's refusal to obey federal immigration law on a par with the debate over secession in 1860. It's that bad.This is a big reason why the Justice Department is trying to halt California's craziness. It's also why more than a dozen states, including Texas, have now joined to support the federal government.Why? In a word, they don't want chaos. California is essentially trying to secede from the U.S., at least from a government headed by Republicans that the ultraprogressive state doesn't support.There's one big problem with this, as we've discussed before: It's called the Supremacy Clause. It's the part of the Constitution that gives federal law supremacy over state law in all those things that the federal government is supposed to do. It's what keeps us from dissolving into chaos or, worse, civil war.California deserves to lose this battle and to go down hard. The irresponsibility of its leftist one-party state is a major reason why the state's citizens are fleeing by the thousands. The ruling class — led by Gov. Jerry Brown, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and State Attorney General Xavier Becerra — has done more to damage the state's long-term prospects than any trio in state history.California's voters need to wake up. They've allowed their state to be taken over by people who, quite frankly, no longer believe in America, its Constitution or the rule of law.

63,ICE,"Big Spenders: Some Republicans were complaining that they didn't know what was in the massive $1.3 trillion ""omnibus"" spending bill they voted on this week. But it's what's not in the bill that's the most troubling.Republicans used to love to trot around copies of ObamaCare, pointing out how its massive size — around 2,300 pages — was a sign of runaway government.The spending bill Congress just approved is nearly as big, weighing in at 2,232 pages. And, like ObamaCare, no one who voted on it had read the bill before casting their ballots.Then there's the amount of money we're talking about. That $1.3 trillion is what will be spent in just the next six months. And that represents just a fraction of what the government will spend, since it doesn't include Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, ObamaCare or welfare.For perspective, until 1991, the entire budget of the federal government for the whole year was less than $1.3 trillion.There's no doubt that spending sleuths will find all sorts of gems tucked away in that mountain of cash.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, that's not the worst of it.The real problem with this bill is what it doesn't contain.First on this list is any semblance of spending discipline.It is, rather, an orgy of new spending, which hikes outlays in the next six months by almost $77 billion. Over the next two years, it will increase defense spending by $160 billion and domestic spending by $128 billion.Everyone gets a piece of the action. The National Institutes of Health gets $3 billion more, Census, $1.34 billion. The bill nearly doubles funding for Community Development Block Grants. An Obama stimulus-created grant program will see its budget triple. It throws $3.6 billion at the fight against opioid abuse.This doesn't just represent a spending problem for this year and next. These added funds will go into the ""baseline,"" from which all future spending decisions will be measured. Republicans, working with Democrats, will have set spending on a permanently higher track.As Heritage Foundation budget expert Justin Bogie put it, the bill ""is unshackling the Washington swamp to spend without constraints.""We should have said that everyone gets a piece of the action except for border security — the second glaring omission in this bill.The bill includes $1.6 billion in funds to build a border ""wall."" But — incredibly — it specifies that only a portion of it can be used to extend existing barriers, and specifically bars the money from being used to build anything other than what ""is currently deployed."" In other words, none of the money can be used to build any of the prototypes Trump just visited.Nor does the bill cut funding for lawbreaking sanctuary cities, or hire more ICE agents.And while the bill thankfully doesn't include additional bailout money for ObamaCare, it also does nothing to move the country away from ObamaCare, or help those millions of people who've been priced out of the market because of the ""Affordable Care Act.""Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan said that ""this may be the worst bill I have seen in my time in Congress, the worst bill our leadership has ever allowed to come to the floor.""Jordan is part of the House Freedom Caucus, which sent a letter to Trump urging him to veto this fiscal monstrosity.""The funding proposal drafted by House and Senate leadership not only forgets the promises we made to the voters — it outright rejects them,"" they wrote.Well said. Unfortunately, there weren't enough members of the Freedom Caucus to prevent this from getting to President Trump's desk.In a tweet Friday morning, Trump said he might veto the bill.""I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.""But, then he signed it later in the day.The era of big government, once declared over by Bill Clinton, has now returned under Republican leadership.Note: This editorial was updated to reflect the passage of the spending bill, which occurred after the editorial originally posed.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:ObamaCare Bailout: Why Were Any Republicans Pushing This?Half-A-Loaf Of Dodd-Frank Reform Is Better Than NoneA Chance To Really End Welfare As We Know It

Analysts and traders are bearish on WTI crude futures, according to a Bloomberg survey. Rising shale output is working against the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' efforts to trim a global glut.Goldman Sachs Group said the latest sell-off has been largely driven by trend-following commodity trading houses that base decisions on technical chart signals rather than the fundamentals of supply and demand.West Texas Intermediate for April delivery slipped 65 cents to settle at $60.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Larger gasoline inventories ""will put pressure"" on the profitability of making the fuel.Meanwhile, American refiners toggled back processing rates for a third week during seasonal maintenance work that takes key units offline, reducing demand for crude.The U.S. crude benchmark posted its first monthly decline since August. Crude output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries rose by 130,000 barrels a day in February amid higher production from Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela, according to JBC Energy.

68,ICE,"Crude dropped the most in more than two weeks as the International Energy Agency warned about seemingly unstoppable U.S. shale production.Futures in New York fell 1.4% on Tuesday after IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said ""explosive growth"" in U.S. output may extend beyond this year. Investors were also bracing for a government tally on Wednesday that's expected to show American crude inventories rose to the highest since 2017. A strengthening greenback further eroded the appeal of dollar-priced commodities.""The comments from the IEA head about the pace of U.S. shale growth might have taken the wind out of the bull's sails,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund. Heftier stockpiles and a slide in refiner demand ""should end up being a bearish factor for the market as well.""As the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries works to trim output, producers are committed to bringing supply and demand into balance, United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei said Tuesday in Abu Dhabi. Strong U.S. shale growth could delay those efforts, Birol said the same day in a Bloomberg Television interview.American explorers have expanded the fleet of rigs searching for domestic crude to the highest since 2015 as the OPEC-led supply curbs resurrected oil markets.""You've had the rig count grind higher,"" Rob Haworth, who helps oversee $151 billion in assets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle, said by telephone. ""It seems like shale producers are really getting a lot of efficiency for their capital investment and seem to be making money at these levels.""West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery fell 90 cents to settle at $63.01 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

The global benchmark crude traded at a $3.62 premium to WTI.As expiration nears, the front-month Brent futures' premium over its second-month contract is at 11 cents, the smallest since November.Strength in the dollar weighed on crude prices as a rising greenback diminished the appeal of commodities priced in the U.S. currency.

Conversely, stockpiles at the Cushing, Okla., pipeline hub probably dropped by 1.2 million barrels, according to a forecast compiled by Bloomberg. That would make for a 10th straight week of declines.The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly inventories data later on Tuesday.

70,ICE,"Oil surged to the highest in two weeks Thursday as American supplies unexpectedly shrank and exports surged, dispelling fears that a new shale boom will leave the country awash in crude.Futures advanced 1.8% in New York after a government report showed U.S. crude stockpiles slid 1.62 million barrels last week, the largest draw in five weeks. That contrasted with a 2.9 million increase estimated in a Bloomberg survey ahead of the release.At the same time, crude moving from storage facilities in Cushing, Okla., to tankers on the Gulf Coast helped exports jump 55% to 2 million barrels a day, the most since October.""The inventory numbers were better than expected,"" Craig Bethune, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management, said by telephone. ""The market's been concerned about U.S. production ramping, so as long as you still have these healthy inventory reports, it helps ease some of the fears.""Meanwhile, output cuts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are helping drain a global glut. Shipments from the group will fall by 300,000 barrels a day in the four weeks to March 10, according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements. The worry is oil undersupply, not oversupply, United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei said at the International Petroleum Week conference in London.West Texas Intermediate for April delivery rose $1.09 to settle at $62.77 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 6% below the 100-day average.Brent for April settlement climbed by 97 cents to end the session at $66.39 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a $3.62 premium to WTI for the same month.The Energy Information Administration report on Thursday also showed that crude production ticked lower for the first time since early January, while supplies at the nation's biggest hub of pipelines and storage tanks in Cushing fell for a ninth straight week to the lowest level since 2014.""It's a constructive report,"" said Nick Holmes, an analyst at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC in Leawood, Kan., which manages $16 billion in energy-related assets. Declining storage in Cushing boosted prices, and ""we will continue to see that as crude is directed to the Gulf Coast"" for export, he said.

72,ICE,"Crude closed at a three-week high as booming stock markets stoked optimism about economic growth that drives energy demand.Crude futures rose 0.6% in New York on Monday. Blue-chip stocks reached a level not seen since the start of this month and the dollar retreated from earlier gains, boosting oil's appeal as a store of value. Prices flirted with the $64-a-barrel mark against the backdrop of Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih's weekend remarks about phasing out production caps that have been in effect since late 2016.""Equities ripping a bit is the most important element there is — the relative correlation to equities today, the correlation to risk assets,"" Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by phone.Oil in New York has advanced about 8% in the past two weeks as production curbs by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia drained a global glut. Front-month futures contracts will trade at a premium to later-dated ones, a condition known as backwardation, for two to three years, Francisco Blanch, head of commodities research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a Bloomberg Television interview.West Texas intermediate crude for April delivery rose 36 cents to settle at $63.91 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier dipping to $63.06. Total volume traded was about 31% below the 100-day average.Brent for April settlement added 19 cents to end the session at $67.50 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a $3.59 premium to WTI.After climbing as much as 0.2%, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index retreated to a 0.05% gain.With bloated inventories shrinking, the next step for major producers will be phasing out the caps, Al-Falih said in New Delhi on Saturday. The production curbs may be eased ""sometime in 2019, but we don't know when and we don't know how,"" he said.

73,ICE,"Even the best stocks don't advance in a straight line. They rise, pause and dip as they trend higher.XOn a weekly chart, some of those dips are normal pullbacks, testing support at the stock's 10-week moving average. These present important buying opportunities.The 10-week moving average is the sum of a stock's weekly closing prices over the 10 previous weeks, divided by 10. Calculated on a running basis, these lines are found on many charting programs. On Investors.com and MarketSmith charts, they appear as a red line.The average marks a level commonly used by institutions to add shares to their holdings. Buying on such pullbacks helps minimize the average cost of shares as the funds increase their positions.Stocks generally break out from positions above their 10-week moving averages. This was the case when Riverbed Technology, a leader in new-generation data networking, broke out of a 12-week cup-type base with a 16.45 buy point on July 23, 2010.The stock pulled back below its buy point to touch its 10-week line. This was the first pullback (1).You generally want to buy only on the first and second pullbacks. Beyond that, there's a greater chance the stock will correct and leave you with a loss. It's best to wait for better buy points to emerge.Pullbacks to the 50-day moving average, using a daily chart, can also be used to spot buy areas.Riverbed's second pullback to the line, in October, was not picture-perfect. You'd like to see a stock settle toward its 10-week line in light volume, then rebound in heavy trading. Riverbed pulled back amid heavy selling (2). It waited a full two weeks, then rallied again in strong trade.When buying on a pullback, a stock is in buying range the minute it comes off the line. Weak-volume rebounds are not buying opportunities. Wait until volume kicks in.You also want to buy before the stock is extended. Ideally, you'd like to pull the trigger before the stock climbs back to the high just prior to the pullback. In extreme cases, you can add a dime to that number, plus 5%, but often this is chasing the rebound onto thin ice.A third pullback for Riverbed, in January, cut the line in heavy trade (3). Too deep for a pullback, too short for a base, the pattern signaled investors to wait and see what comes next. Less than two months later, the stock peaked at 44.70 and created a base that was far too wide and loose. A breakout attempt in early July 2011 fell flat.Riverbed barreled lower as the general market corrected sharply.By October 2011, Riverbed slumped to as low as 18.33, 59% off its 52-week high.(A version of this column was originally published in the March 28, 2011, edition of IBD.

Crude inventories fell by 1.86 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Prices briefly dipped after the report as the draw came in smaller than the 6.36 million decline posted by the American Petroleum Institute. Meanwhile, an outage on TransCanada Corp.'s Keystone pipeline has led inventories to contract in the Cushing, Okla., distribution hub.""For better or for worse, Keystone being down is bullish for U.S. prices,"" Matt Sallee, who helps manage $16 billion in oil-related assets at Tortoise Capital Advisors, said by phone.

The line shut last week after a leak in South Dakota. The closure has led to a tightening of crude in the U.S.Brent for January settlement climbed 35 cents to $62.92 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $5.25 to WTI.Prices have been trending upward ""based on the growing recognition in the marketplace that global inventories are coming down, and by a substantial amount,"" Molchanov said.

75,ICE,"Oil held near $56 a barrel as markets digested political uncertainty in Germany and anticipation about OPEC's next move.Futures slipped as much as 1.7% in New York after rising 2.6% Friday. In Germany, the breakdown of talks to form a new government coalition raised questions about the future of Europe's biggest economy. That led the U.S. dollar to rally, reducing the appeal of commodities. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meanwhile, will be briefed this week by oil-service provider Schlumberger Ltd. as well as Citigroup as the cartel debates whether to extend output cuts at a summit in Vienna Nov. 30.The political turmoil in Germany helped strengthen the U.S. dollar, which depresses oil prices, said Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. Data released Friday showed wagers on lower Brent prices rose by the most in five months through the week ended Nov. 14 as doubts persist about whether the Saudi Arabia-led cuts will be extended.""Politically, around the world, there are just a lot of plates spinning,"" O'Grady said in a telephone interview Monday. ""There's potentially a lot of supply out there and the only thing keeping it off the market right now is OPEC discipline.""Traders may also be closing out some bullish bets on crude ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., when light volumes could make it harder to adjust to any bearish news, O'Grady said.

76,ICE,"Oil climbed more than 2% midday Friday, paring losses earlier this week, as Saudi Arabia moved to dispel doubts over Russia's readiness to extend output curbs.Futures rose as much as 2.5% in New York after Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid Al-Falih, said OPEC should announce an extension of output curbs when it meets on Nov. 30. Russia is said to be hesitant to commit to a decision so soon, suggesting the group wait until closer to the deal's expiration at the end of March. U.S. crude output gained this week to the highest in more than three decades, according to government data.Oil rose to the highest in more than two years last week amid near certainty that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies would prolong the output deal and heightened geopolitical tension in the Middle East. Prices retreated in the last few days after the International Energy Agency said milder-than-normal winter weather is putting a brake on demand growth. While Russia's reluctance is causing concern, Saudi Arabia's Al-Falih is trying to reassure the market the deal will be extended.""Ahead of the OPEC meeting, we're going to see a little bit of volatility,"" Gene McGillian, a market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn., said by phone.

The gasoline draw would be the largest since early September if an Energy Information Administration tally confirms it on Wednesday.""Those are big numbers,"" Kyle Cooper, director of research at IAF Advisors in Houston, said by telephone. ""Of course, what the EIA shows tomorrow could be significantly different, but if it's anywhere close to this, that continues a very bullish inventory trend.""The global benchmark Brent crude this month topped $60 a barrel for the first time since July 2015 while the dominant U.S. grade, West Texas Intermediate, touched an eight-month high as Saudi Arabia and Russia signaled support for extending production caps well into 2018.The market was also buoyed by conflict between the Iraqi central government and semi-autonomous Kurds that threatened crude supplies from northern fields. The wild card remains North American shale's potential to upend any coordinated moves to keep a lid on global production.The output restraints by OPEC and allies such as Russia are ""tightening the market supply-demand fundamentals,"" Gene McGillian, a market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn., said by telephone. ""I don't think we have any indications that the rebalance has completely been priced into the market.""West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery traded at $54.59 at 4:36 p.m. after settling at $54.38 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

89,ICE,"Crude rose after the worst weekly decline in two years as OPEC shrugged off the threat that U.S. shale drillers will swamp the market with excess supplies.Futures in New York advanced as much as 2.8%, the biggest intraday jump in more than a month. Strong demand for crude coupled with restrained output from OPEC and allied suppliers will erase any remaining glut, United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei, who's also president of the cartel, said Monday. Global demand is robust enough to absorb growing output from shale fields, according to Kuwait's oil minister.Oil prices are rising in response to ""statements from OPEC telling us they believe compliance to the cuts is going to be at historic highs,""  Bart Melek, head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said by phone. ""Ultimately, the market is well-supported around $60. We do see the market rebalance. Inventories will continue to drop.""The U.S. benchmark crude contract lost almost 10% of its value last week amid concerns about the broader economy. Kuwait Oil Minister Bakheet Al-Rashidi characterized the sell-off as a ""correction only.""""It will come back,"" Al-Rashidi said on Monday in remarks to reporters in Kuwait City, adding that he expects world oil demand to increase by about 1.6 million barrels a day this year.Meanwhile, OPEC compliance with crude output cuts rose to a record 136% in January, according to Bloomberg calculations from the group's secondary-source estimates in a monthly market report published Monday.""The global economy still looks pretty good, and oil just got caught up in the selling across other markets,"" Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, said by phone. ""(We will) probably see a pretty decent recovery in oil and eventually WTI gets to $70 sometime before the year ends.""West Texas intermediate crude for March delivery advanced 62 cents to $59.82 a barrel at 1 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 16% above the 100-day average.Brent for April settlement rose 43 cents to $63.22 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, and traded at a $3.60 premium to WTI for the same month.Shale drillers in places like West Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota may imperil the carefully laid plans of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and fellow travelers like Russia and Mexico. The number of rigs searching for U.S. oil jumped 34% in the past year, spurred on as prices recovered from the deepest market rout in a generation.As a result, U.S. oil production is expected to exceed 11 million barrels a day before the end of this year. OPEC's own analysts on Monday upped their estimate for how much oil non-cartel suppliers will pump this year by 250,000 barrels a day to 1.4 million a day.""Shale is coming and the expectation is that it will come stronger than in 2017, and this is something that we have to watch,"" Al Mazrouei said Monday in an interview in Dubai.

90,ICE,"Oil spiraled to the lowest point in five weeks Thursday as surging U.S. crude supply coupled with technical indicators, signaling the potential for further price declines.Futures fell for a fifth day in New York, posting the longest streak of losses since April 2017. The U.S. benchmark flirted with its 50-day moving average, a key technical level, while other indicators of market momentum showed the decline may not be over. The negative chart formations follow reports this week that U.S. oil production is surging even faster than previously forecast.""The market narrative is clearly uncomfortable with the lift we are seeing in U.S. production,"" Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, said by telephone. ""There is no doubt that production is recovering and that's a negative.""Analysts and traders are bearish on WTI crude futures, according to a survey by Bloomberg. U.S. crude production jumped to an all-time weekly high of 10.25 million barrels a day last week, according to Energy Information Administration data released Wednesday.That followed a government forecast that American daily output will breach 11 million in November, a year earlier than previously expected. The weekly U.S. output figure is now higher than the 10 million barrels Saudi Arabia produced on a daily basis last month.""That enormously steep rebound in Lower 48 production is what's weighing on the market,"" Michael Loewen, a commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said by telephone. ""The market is not entirely sure how to digest this information.""West Texas Intermediate for March delivery fell 64 cents to settle at $61.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 52% above the 100-day average.Brent for April settlement declined 70 cents to end the session at $64.81 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, the lowest level since December. The global benchmark traded at a $3.87 premium to WTI for the same month.U.S. oil output increased for a fourth week, up by 332,000 barrels a day last week, the EIA data showed. Crude in the nation's storage tanks and terminals increased by 1.9 million barrels, while gasoline and distillate stockpiles also expanded, the data showed.
"
91,ICE,"Oil posted the biggest loss in two months Wednesday as record crude production from U.S. fields reignited worries that supplies will swamp demand.Futures slid 2.5% in New York. Crude output from American wells jumped to 10.25 million barrels a day last week, vaulting the U.S. into the elite of world producers alongside Saudi Arabia and Russia. With production set to climb even higher later this year, the Saudi- and Russia-led alliance of other major suppliers will come under renewed pressure to reconsider self-imposed output caps aimed at eroding a glut.""Production was up fairly strong,"" Nick Holmes, an analyst at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC in Leawood, Kansas, which manages $16 billion in energy-related assets, said by telephone. ""There's still some trepidation on the supply side and will U.S. shale growth overwhelm the strong demand that we expect this year?""The U.S. Energy Information Administration's weekly tally of domestic output shows the country is probably already on par with Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer and de facto leader, and closing fast on Russia. Saudi output probably averaged 10 million barrel equivalents a day last month and Russia pumped an estimated 10.98 million a day in 2017. To be sure, the numbers aren't directly comparable because they involve differing time periods.U.S. production has jumped 78% in the past six years as drilling techniques perfected to release natural gas from shale were adopted by oil explorers. With oil still trading above $60 a barrel, shale drillers may be inclined to boost production because they can buy hedges that lock in profits and shield them from any subsequent price declines.The bombshell production report on Wednesday came a day after the government made a surprise revision to its supply outlook that forecast domestic daily output will hit 11 million barrels in November, a year sooner than previously expected.West Texas Intermediate for March delivery dipped $1.60 to settle at $61.79 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest level in four weeks. Total volume traded was about 68% above the 100-day average.Brent for April settlement declined $1.35 to end the session at $65.51 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, the lowest level since late December. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $3.96 to WTI for the same month and closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since July.Oil market volatility, as measured by the CBOE/Nymex Oil Volatility Index, jumped to the highest level since November after touching September highs during the day.Further weighing on crude prices was a strengthening U.S. currency, which reduced the appeal of dollar-denominated raw materials as investments. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the currency against 10 major peers, rose as much as 0.6%.""The real story is investors remain cautious with continued U.S. supply growth,"" Matthew Beck, managing director of an $8 billion oil and natural gas portfolio at John Hancock Financial Services Inc. in Boston, said by telephone. At the same time, ""you've seen a general strengthening in the U.S. dollar. That's a bit of a drag on oil prices as well.""The EIA also said on Wednesday that American crude in storage tanks and terminals increased by 1.9 million barrels last week as refiners shut or limited operations to conduct seasonal maintenance. Gasoline and diesel stockpiles expanded as well.

93,ICE,"Brent crude traded near a two-year high as OPEC and Russia signaled they'll extend supply cuts, while instability in Iraq's Kurdish region persists.The global benchmark rose to as high as $61 a barrel and West Texas intermediate held above $54, though both crudes pulled back from Monday's highs as they moved closer to levels that signal they might be overbought. Supporting the rally is Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who last week backed an extension of production cuts by OPEC beyond March, following similar signals from Russian President Vladimir Putin.""When you're in a range-bound market without a lot of really clear and definitive fundamental information, people tend to start trading off of technicals,"" Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, said by phone. ""Momentum in oil has been pretty strong, so unless you've got something out there that tells you we are on a clear path to $60, you're going to want to see how the data plays out.""Oil has rallied this month as investors wait to see whether OPEC will formally agree to an extension of its cuts at a meeting in November. Both Brent and WTI's 14-day relative strength index moved toward 70, indicating the commodity may be overbought. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase raised both its Brent and WTI 2018 forecasts.Brent for December settlement, which expires Tuesday, rose 19 cents to $60.63 a barrel at 1:15 p.m. on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, after touching $61, the highest intraday level since July 2015. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $6.53 to WTI.WTI for December delivery rose 16 cents to $54.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 14% below the 100-day average.Oil exports resumed from Iraq's Kurdish region after halting earlier Monday, a port agent said, highlighting uncertainty about pipeline shipments from OPEC's second-biggest producer.The halt came days after Iraqi troops captured oilfields from Kurdish fighters in northern Iraq's disputed Kirkuk province. Shipments by pipeline averaged 264,000 barrels a day before the stoppage, less than half their normal daily level of 600,000 barrels. Exports from Kirkuk, which had been flowing through the same pipeline network to Ceyhan, remained halted as of Monday, the port agent said.""OPEC is doing a good job of talking up their position. That put a bid in the market coming into today,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York, said by phone. The issues in Kurdistan have ""not ended yet. There's still some potential bid from that.""
"
94,ICE,"Oil held above $52 after a government report signaled record overseas demand for U.S. crude and fuels, even as domestic drillers boosted output by the most in half a decade.Oil futures seesawed in a 54-cent range in New York. Daily exports of crude, diesel and other petroleum products climbed to 7.66 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Bullish aspects of the report such as falling gasoline and distillate stockpiles were tempered by the rise in oil production as well as a bump up in crude inventories.""The exports are ripping higher,"" Michael Loewen, a commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said by telephone. ""That's very good for the market. At the end of the day, crude oil demand is only one part of the equation. If you have strong products demand, that means refineries are going to buy more crude oil to create those products. Demand looks great.""Oil has held above $50 a barrel for the past two weeks in New York amid increasing confidence that supply cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia will be extended beyond March. OPEC is said to be working on an exit strategy in an effort to reassure investors that the group will manage a controlled release of supplies to avoid a new glut when the curbs eventually expire.West Texas Intermediate for December delivery fell 24 cents to $52.23 a barrel at 10:56 a.m. ET on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 19% below the 100-day average.Brent for December settlement rose 4 cents to $58.37 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $6.16 to WTI.Gasoline futures rose as much as 1.6% to $1.7429 a gallon, the highest intraday level since late September. The gasoline crack spread, a rough measure of the profit from refining crude into gasoline, jumped as much as 5.7%.U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 856,000 barrels last week, the EIA said. Oil supplies at the key Cushing, Okla., pipeline hub decreased for the first time since August. At the same time, gasoline supplies fell by 5.47 million barrels and distillate supplies dropped by 5.25 million barrels.RELATED:How Long Should You Wait For A Recent Buy To Work?

95,ICE,"Oil declined to the lowest level in a week after a closely watched tally of U.S. fuel inventories revealed a rise in gasoline and diesel supplies.Futures slid 1.4% in New York. Gasoline stockpiles in the world's biggest economy increased for a fourth straight week while supplies of distillates — the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil — tipped upward for the first time since August, according to Energy Information Administration data released Wednesday.""We're following through on the bearish influence that we had from product builds in the U.S.,"" Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas in London, said by telephone. ""There is a lot of speculative length that has built up in the market and it's probably a good time to be selling into the recent rallies and securing those profits.""The U.S. benchmark has closed above $51 a barrel for five straight sessions as conflict between Iraq's central government and the semi-autonomous Kurds cut crude flows through a pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan. Still, the supply reductions may be short-lived because of government plans to boost investment in the Kurdish region's oilfields.The market is ""unwinding some of the reaction to Kurdistan,"" James Williams, president of London, Ark.-based energy researcher WTRG Economics, said by telephone. ""There's no reports of damage to anything. Both the Kurds and the Iraqis want production to be flowing.""Meanwhile, OPEC sent its strongest signal yet that the group and allied producers will extend output cuts set to expire in March by as much as nine months. A balanced market is now ""in sight,"" Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said.West Texas Intermediate for November delivery, which expires Friday, dropped 75 cents to settle at $51.29 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The more-active December contract edged lower by 75 cents to settle at $51.51.Brent for December settlement fell 92 cents to end the session at $57.23 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude was at a premium of $5.72 to WTI for the same month.In the U.S., gasoline inventories expanded by 908,000 barrels last week, while distillate supplies climbed by 528,000 barrels to 134.5 million barrels, according to the EIA.

96,ICE,"Unilever (UN) shares tumbled early Thursday as the consumer goods giant reported sales in the third quarter were weaker than expected, while rival Nestle (NSRGY) warned restructuring costs would weigh on profit margins.Unilever, the owner of iconic brands such as Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream, said sales grew 2.6% in Q3 from a year ago. Analysts had projected a sales gains of 3.9%. The Anglo-Dutch company cited competition from smaller and more nimble players, as well as natural disasters in global markets, for weakening sales.Shares dived 6.1% to close at 57.65 on the stock market today, tumbling through their 50-day moving average. Unilever technically is back in buy range from a July breakout of 57.83, but the high-volume move through the 50-day should make investors wary.While Swiss rival Nestle grew sales in Q3, it cautioned Thursday that restructuring charges of 400 million to 500 million Swiss francs ($410 million to $512 million) would eat into profit margins in 2017, reports said.Unilever rejected a $143 billion bid by packaged foods giant Kraft Heinz (KHC) earlier this year, and an analyst told Reuters that lower ad and promotional spending since then may have hurt its sales.Meanwhile, U.S. consumer giant Procter & Gamble (PG) reports Friday and investors are bracing for tepid results.The analyst consensus view is for EPS of $1.07, up 4% vs a year ago, on revenue of $16.64 billion, up less than 1%, according to Zacks Investment Research.P&G narrowly won a proxy fight last week vs. Nelson Peltz, who is challenging the results. Peltz, who runs Trian Fund Management, wanted the Dow component to focus more on innovative brands and less on legacy, core products.Nestle shares dipped 0.3% to 86.03 within a flat base with an 89.50 buy point Thursday. Procter & Gamble shed 0.5% to 91.59, undercutting a 92.10 buy point. Kraft Heinz lost 0.8%, hitting its lowest levels since early 2016.The consumer goods sector has cooled this year as tastes swing away from the largest players and toward niche and alternative brands. Grocery stores are adopting more-upscale private-label goods, putting a squeeze on branded food and consumer products.RELATED:Honeywell To Spin Off 2 Units; Pfizer Mulls Consumer Sale; P&G-Peltz Proxy FightRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To Watch

97,ICE,"Oil was little changed after an industry report was said to show U.S. crude stockpiles fell, while supplies of products gained.Prices traded near $52 in after-market trading in New York following the release of data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday. The data was said to show crude stockpiles dropped by 7.13 million barrels last week, while gasoline and distillate inventories increased. A crude draw of that magnitude would be the largest since mid-August, if it's confirmed by Energy Information Administration data to be released on Wednesday.""If you're an objective bull, you really have to be kind of disheartened,"" Kyle Cooper, director of research at IAF Advisors in Houston, said by telephone. Inventory trends have been bullish, yet prices aren't reacting strongly, he said.Earlier Tuesday, futures prices ended the session little changed after declining amid a report that the Kurdish Peshmerga agreed to return to 2003 Iraq borders. The report came from Sky News Arabia, without saying how it obtained the information.Iraq had called for cooperation to keep exports in the northern part of the country flowing after the government regained control of oil fields and energy facilities in Kirkuk, which will allow for more investment and will enhance exports, according to an Oil Ministry statement.""This is a pretty strong indicator that the conflict is not going to continue, that some of the temporary loss of production is going to come back,"" James Williams, president of London, Ark.-based energy researcher WTRG Economics, said by telephone. ""It's certainly in Iraq's interest to keep the Kirkuk-area oil fields going and with the retreat to the border, they really don't have much more argument against it.""West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery traded at $51.99 a barrel at 4:42 p.m. after settling at $51.88 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level in more than two weeks. Total volume traded was about 5% below the 100-day average.Brent for December settlement added 6 cents to end the session at $57.88 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $5.77 to WTI for the same month.The API report also showed gasoline supplies climbed by 1.94 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles rose by 1.64 million barrels, according to people familiar with the data, who asked not to be named because the information isn't public. A build in distillates of that size would be the largest since early July, if EIA data confirms it.A Bloomberg survey showing oil inventories probably fell by 3.25 million barrels last week.  Oil stored at the key Cushing, Okla., storage hub probably rose by 1 million barrels, according to a forecast compiled by Bloomberg.
"
98,ICE,"Oil advanced to a two-week high Monday as Iraqi troops clashed with Kurdish forces, disrupting supplies from a region that produces more than half a million barrels a day.Futures climbed 0.8% in New York. Iraqi forces said they had seized the headquarters of Kirkuk's provincial administration in the north of the country on Monday. Kurdish KAR Group stopped pumping crude at the Avana and Bai Hassan deposits, an official at the central government-run North Oil said. About 600,000 barrels a day was being exported through a Kurd-controlled pipeline to Turkey, a different person familiar with the matter said earlier.""The reports out of Iraq are the driving force,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass., said by telephone. The potential for a loss of supply from the region is on investors' minds and ""it is undoubted that the market psychology is affected,"" he said.Iraqi forces said they've captured a refinery, a gas plant and other facilities, state-run Iraqiya television reported. Kurds stopped pumping oil at the two fields in Kirkuk as technicians failed to report for work and some security guards left amid the military conflict, according to the NOC official. The halt could affect 275,000 barrels a day in output, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Tanker-tracker analysis company Kpler said it didn't see any significant change on shipments from the region for now. Oil was still flowing through the export pipeline, the Kurdistan Regional Government's Ministry of Natural Resources said later on Twitter.""The Iraqis are flexing their muscle,"" Thomas Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group in Wellington, Fla., said by telephone. ""It's unlikely that it escalates to anything serious. I'm not too concerned about a flash point at all.""WTI for November delivery added 42 cents to settle at $51.87 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier rising to as high as $52.37 a barrel during the session.Brent for December settlement increased 65 cents to end the session at $57.82 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $5.68 to WTI for the same month.Iraq is the second-largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and pumps most of its 4.47 million barrels a day from fields in the south, shipping it from the Persian Gulf port of Basrah. The country's Kurdish region in the north, meanwhile, relies on a pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan to get most of its crude to market. The conduit also transports some 100,000 barrels a day from federally run fields in Kirkuk.
"
99,ICE,"Oil declined as the International Energy Agency cast doubts on the prospect of reducing a price-killing global glut, even as a report showed a bigger-than-expected drop in U.S. crude inventories.Futures fell 1.4% in New York, erasing some losses during the session. The IEA said crude inventories may remain bloated next year, capping prices. Even if OPEC and other major oil suppliers prolong production cuts, surging output from U.S. shale fields and elsewhere will frustrate those efforts, the Paris-based agency said. The Energy Information Administration's weekly tally showed domestic stockpiles slid for a third straight week.The IEA pronouncement ""spooked the market a bit,"" Joseph Bozoyan, a portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston, said by telephone. ""Investors will kind of look to see evidence of continued crude drawdowns before they get really bullish.""Oil climbed the first three days of this week on speculation that output curbs by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other suppliers were helping to erode elevated inventories that triggered the worst market collapse in a generation. OPEC expects its efforts to clear the surplus to succeed by the end of the third quarter of next year, said people familiar with the group's internal forecasts.Yet, the IEA forecast indicates that if the producers prolong the same level of supply cuts, they won't deplete inventories. Global oil demand will increase next year, yet most of this growth can be satisfied by rising production from the U.S., set to grow by 1.1 million barrels a day, the agency said.""In terms of the glut, it's a factor of how fast shale can ramp up,"" Brent Belote, founder of Cayler Capital, said by telephone. Investors are looking at the amount of drilled-but-uncompleted wells and ""it's a big worry. I think you can rally, but rallies will be capped for the next nine months to a year.""West Texas Intermediate for November delivery dropped 70 cents to settle at $50.60 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 7% below the 100-day average.Brent for December settlement declined 69 cents to end the session at $56.25 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $5.32 to December WTI.U.S. crude stockpiles decreased by 2.75 million barrels last week, the EIA said on Thursday, exceeding the 2.4-million median estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg survey forecast. Oil supplies at the key Cushing, Okla., pipeline hub increased by 1.32 million barrels to 63.8 million, the highest level since May. Gasoline supplies rose by 2.49 million barrels, the largest build since early August, the data showed.
"
100,ICE,"Oil pared gains after an industry report was said to show a surprise increase in U.S. crude inventories.Prices pulled back in aftermarket trading following the release of data from the American Petroleum Institute Wednesday, which was said to show crude stockpiles increased by 3.1 million barrels last week. A Bloomberg survey estimated that U.S crude stockpiles slid by 2.4 million barrels last week.Crude supplies in Cushing, Okla., the biggest U.S. oil-storage hub, climbed by 1.22 million barrels, the API data showed. That would be a seventh straight increase, if Energy Information Administration data released on Thursday confirms it.""It was a little bit of a surprise. The last two weeks of exports — I don't think will be maintained. I think this is a reflection of that to a certain extent,"" Kyle Cooper, director of research at IAF Advisors in Houston, said by telephone. The recent builds at Cushing and the potential for another ""is certainly a bearish factor for WTI.""On Wednesday, OPEC said in its monthly report that 2018 demand will be about 200,000 barrels higher than previously predicted, and that output caps adopted by most producers are trimming a global glut. Yet at the same time, the EIA raised its forecast for U.S. crude production in 2018.Oil has advanced more than 4% this week on speculation that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other parties to the historic 2016 production accord may extend the deal beyond its March expiration. Saudi Arabia warned that it will cut the amount of crude available for sale next month, while OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo signaled that the group is looking to expand the number of nations participating in the deal.""Oil is having a hard time finding its course,"" said Rob Thummel, managing director at Tortoise Capital Advisors, which handles $16 billion in energy-related assets. ""There are a lot of potential near-term positive catalysts out there for the oil market, but none of them have 100% certainty.""West Texas Intermediate for November delivery traded at $51.03 a barrel at 4:39 p.m. after settling at $51.30 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level in more than a week.

Delta Air Lines' (DAL) refinery in Pennsylvania was said to be shutting some units down after a fire on Wednesday, according to a person familiar with operations. The fire occurred on a platformer and the refinery is operating, the company said.
"
101,ICE,"Oil lingered near $51 a barrel as OPEC's optimistic outlook for crude demand was overshadowed by the specter of booming output from Texas to Tripoli.Futures meandered within a narrow 66-cent range after jumping the most in two weeks on Tuesday. Daily demand for OPEC crude next year will be about 200,000 barrels higher than the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries predicted just a month ago. In addition, output caps adopted by most OPEC nations and allied producers are trimming a worldwide glut, the group said on Wednesday. Some investors remain skeptical that the surfeit of oil is shrinking as much as OPEC claims.""There's still a lot of questions around what 2018 is shaping up to be like in terms of demand and supply,"" John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund, said by telephone. OPEC continues to ""keep working this market over with their rhetoric, even though the supply dynamic doesn't seem to be supporting their positions.""Oil has advanced more than 3% this week on speculation OPEC, Russia and other parties to the historic 2016 production accord may extend the deal beyond its March expiration.

Suncor Energy (SU) expects its Fort Hills oil-sands mine to begin producing by year end. The startup will roughly coincide with the completion of planned maintenance at the Kearl mine owned by Exxon Mobil's (XOM) Imperial Oil subsidiary.
"
102,ICE,"Oil's decline accelerated as the deepening slump in equity and debt markets undermined the outlook for energy demand against the backdrop of swelling U.S. crude production.Futures fell 2% in New York on Monday. Stock markets tumbled around the world, and confidence crumbled in emerging markets and the riskiest forms of debt. The S&P 500 energy index fell 4.4% Monday, led by Chesapeake Energy (CHK)and Hess (HES), which slid 7.2% and 6.9%, respectively.Meanwhile, the number of rigs searching for crude in American shale fields jumped to the highest in more than five months last week, a harbinger of ever-greater oil output.""This is contagious from the financial markets and the equity market, especially,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass., said by phone. ""People worry that the demand may not be as robust over the next couple of quarters as people have been anticipating.""West Texas intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, topped $66 a barrel this year for the first time since 2014, extending a rally driven by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision to extend production cuts among its members and allies. While crude's strong start to the year was also helped by dwindling American inventories and a weakening dollar, analysts have raised concerns that a potential surge in U.S. shale output could hurt prices.""There is more supply coming to this market, and we are entering the period of the refineries' maintenance,"" John Kilduff, founding partner at Again Capital LLC, said in a phone interview. ""We are going to see a hit to demand globally that is lowering global prices today.""WTI for March delivery dropped $1.30 and settled at $64.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 69% above the 100-day average.Brent for April settlement lost 96 cents to close at $67.62 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $3.79 to April WTI.U.S. drillers last week added six rigs to raise the number of machines drilling for crude to 765, the highest since Aug. 11, Baker Hughes data showed Friday. That may lead to a further increase in U.S. crude production, which breached 10 million barrels a day in November to the highest level in more than four decades.

104,ICE,"Crude dropped the most in more than a week as the dollar strengthened and traders braced for an end to a record run of U.S. inventory declines.Futures in New York dipped 0.9% on Monday as the rising value of the U.S. currency crimped demand for dollar-denominated assets. At the same time, crude held in U.S. storage tanks and terminals probably increased last week for the first time since early November, halting an unprecedented run of withdrawals.""That's the biggest reason why you are seeing pressure on crude — it's a function of the reverse correlation to the dollar,"" Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by phone. ""There is the expectation among a sizable amount of the energy space that there will be a storage build for the first time in eleven weeks.""A contributing factor to Monday's price drop was anxiety that hedge fund managers may begin unwinding wagers on higher oil prices after those bets spiraled to an all-time high. ""Some of this all-time-record speculative position is starting to get out a little bit,"" Yawger said.Oil lingers near the highest levels in three years amid supply caps by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers including Russia. The majority of OPEC members agree that cuts should be maintained until the end of the year, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabbar Al-Luaibi said.Yet with the U.S. benchmark around $65 a barrel, the number of rigs drilling for crude in American fields is on the upswing. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh warned that crude at $60 will encourage output from shale fields, pushing prices down again. U.S. crude production currently sits at 9.88 million barrels a day.""It's still the dollar trade,"" John Macaluso, a trader at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York, said by phone. ""The rig count was another significant number, and production is getting closer and closer to 10 million barrels a day.""U.S. crude stockpiles probably rose by 669,000 barrels last week, according to the median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Meanwhile, in the latest ICE Futures Europe and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data, money managers reported record wagers on continued price increases for both U.S. and global oil benchmarks, along with gasoline and diesel.West Texas intermediate for March delivery fell 58 cents to settle at $65.56 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 3% above the 100-day average.Brent for March settlement dropped $1.06 to end the session at $69.46 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.

105,ICE,"Oil crept toward the $50-a-barrel mark after OPEC's chief dangled the possibility of prolonging supply curbs well into next year.Oil producers led by Saudi Arabia and Russia are succeeding in shrinking a worldwide glut of crude, yet may need to take further steps to sustain the effort, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said. The Saudi's state-owned oil company announced the ""deepest customer allocation cuts in its history,"" a reference to how much oil it intends to ship next month. Futures fluctuated in a 66-cent range amid light volume on the U.S. Columbus Day holiday.""It's kind of a day of indecision,"" Michael Hiley, head of over-the-counter energy trading at New York-based LPS Partners, said by telephone. Until producers formally agree to extend the cuts, the market is likely going to ignore OPEC headlines, he said.Oil on Friday capped the steepest weekly decline since May as Hurricane Nate turned out to pose little threat to Gulf Coast crude and refining assets. The Saudi kingdom and Russia were leading consultations between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major suppliers about the future of their supply caps, Barkindo said Sunday in New Delhi. Bullish developments during the last few months have been largely offset by surging supply additions from U.S. shale drillers.U.S. explorers raised crude production to 9.56 million barrels a day in the week ended Sept. 29, the fourth straight increase since Hurricane Harvey slammed south Texas and forced some wells to shut down. Output has risen 9% this year, on track for the largest annual increase since 2014, when crude averaged more than $92.""With rising production levels and no definitive word from OPEC and the Russians that they are going to extend the cut or deepen it, the rally seems to have lost its momentum,"" Gene McGillian, a market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn., said by telephone. Brent at $55 and WTI at $50 is an inflection point and the market is ""waiting to see what the next shoe to drop is now.""West Texas Intermediate for November delivery added 29 cents to settle at $49.58 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 36% below the 100-day average. Prices slid $1.50 to $49.29 on Friday, capping a 4.6% drop for the week.Brent for December settlement rose 17 cents to end the session at $55.79 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, and traded at a $5.86 premium to WTI for the same month.Waterways, pipeline terminals and offshore platforms that were shut during Nate's passage over the Gulf Coast during the weekend began reopening. About 85% of oil production in the Gulf remained shut as of Monday, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

106,ICE,"Oil rose the most in a week as the world's biggest oil exporters — Saudi Arabia and Russia — signaled continued cooperation on efforts to erode a global crude glut.Futures rose as much as 2.5% in New York as Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz made a historic trip to see Russian President Vladimir Putin. The king expressed a desire to maintain output caps agreed to with Russia and other producers 10 months ago. Meanwhile, drillers in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico began evacuating platforms as a storm approached, just a day after a the government disclosed record-high overseas demand for American crude.""What we are seeing is Saudi Arabia and Russia singing from the same song sheet, both countries praising the producer-supply restraint,"" Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA in London, said by phone.Though a September rally pushed the benchmark U.S. crude grade into a bull market, some of those gains have been surrendered despite adherence to production limits by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied suppliers. A possible extension of the deal ""should be at least until the end of 2018,"" Putin said on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Nate swirled off the coast of Nicaragua and prompted oil explorers to shut platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Hess Corp. limited offshore travel in the area, while BP PLC evacuated workers from two platforms. The Gulf accounts for about 17% of U.S. crude output.West Texas intermediate crude for November delivery climbed 88 cents to $50.86 a barrel at 12:24 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 17% below the 100-day average.Brent for December settlement gained $1.19 to $56.99 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $5.82 to December WTI.Cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Russia has ""breathed life back into OPEC"" and made the kingdom more optimistic about the outlook for oil than it has been for several years, Saudi Minister of Energy and Industry Khalid Al-Falih said at the start of Salman's visit to Russia.""You've got rumors that OPEC's going to extend production cuts and Russia seems to be OK with that, so that can easily put a bid under the market,"" Rob Haworth, who helps oversee $142 billion in assets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle, said by phone. ""This is a market where the bias is still to the upside from a sentiment perspective among speculators, and they are going to continue to test that thesis.""
"
107,ICE,"Oil slid below $50 a barrel for the first time in two weeks as a flood of U.S. crude reignited concerns over a global glut.Futures fell 0.9% in New York after a government report showed record U.S. exports at a time when autumn refinery maintenance typically lowers demand. The decline is also likely being spurred by producers rushing to lock in revenue near $50 a barrel with hedging contracts.""There was a need for light, sweet crude. Guess what: U.S. exports are meeting that need, and on top of that, crude demand is going down seasonally,"" Michael Wittner, the head of commodities research at Societe Generale in New York, said by phone. The market will see ""some typical autumn weakness in the coming few weeks.""While a rally in September helped propel oil into a bull market, prices have slipped back after recent data showed OPEC output increased last month. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in Moscow that a possible extension of the deal with OPEC to reduce production, due to expire in March, ""should be at least until the end of 2018.""The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' plan to monitor oil exports is a work in progress, Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said in a Bloomberg Television interview.West Texas intermediate for November delivery dropped 44 cents to settle at $49.98 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 13% below the 100-day average.Brent for December settlement declined 20 cents to end the session at $55.80 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $5.48 to December WTI.""Producers are using any opportunity to hedge going forward. As it relates to 2018, they're under-hedged relative to where they would prefer to be,"" Brian Kessens, who helps manage $16 billion in energy assets at Tortoise Capital Advisors, said by phone.U.S. crude stockpiles fell 6.02 million barrels to about 465 million barrels last week, the biggest drop since mid-August, Energy Information Administration data showed Wednesday. Crude exports jumped to 1.98 million barrels a day and  production rose for a fourth week.Gasoline inventories increased by the most since early August, while distillate supplies slid to the lowest level since June 2015. Meanwhile, the refinery utilization rate dropped in the midst of seasonal maintenance at plants.
"
108,ICE,"Rich Frank was the newly appointed head of television at Paramount Studios when he attended one of his first table reads. That's where the writers, actors, directors and producers sit around a large table — hence the name — and for the first time collectively read the new script out loud.In this case it was for an episode of ""Laverne & Shirley,"" and when it was over, producer/writer/creator Garry Marshall announced: ""The big boss is here."" He turned to Frank, and asked if he had ""any comments.""Frank said he liked the script, but ""on page eight, I think there's a joke that doesn't work.""No one said anything until Marshall broke the ice: ""Then we're going to sit here until Rich gets a better joke.""It was, Frank recalls, ""an awkward moment.""""Then Garry came up to me privately and said, 'You're welcome here. But don't just criticize.'""That was a great lesson.""It was, in fact, a lesson he continued to use at Paramount Television, where he helped shepherd such hit shows as ""Cheers,"" ""Taxi"" and ""Family Ties"" to success and then a decadelong career at Walt Disney (DIS), where he served as president of Walt Disney Studios and oversaw the development of the Disney Channel.He then went on to a second career as a vintner, building what became known as the Frank Family Vineyards from a 200-case-a-year operation to one that currently sells 100,000 cases annually.All of which is not bad for a guy from Brooklyn who really didn't know what he wanted to do when he grew up. He attended the University of Illinois, starting out in the school of architecture and moving to the school of engineering before, in 1965, getting his B.A. in marketing with a minor in journalism.""I finally found something I could do that everybody else wasn't better at,"" Frank said in one of two telephone interviews with IBD.When he graduated in 1965, he went to work at an ad agency in the media department, planning where to place and buy ads. Then he ""switched sides,"" selling ads for a couple of rep firms (who sell ads for media that don't have their own sales force in a particular area). He became sales manager for a Los Angeles television station and ultimately was hired by Chris-Craft Industries to run its television division.The company — better known for its mahogany-hulled boats — owned several TV stations — and placed Frank in charge. The television landscape was much different then — with no cable and only three major networks. The independent stations that existed were mostly limited to repeating shows that had already run on one of the Big Three networks.Frank contacted Michael Eisner, then president of Paramount Studios, to see if he'd be interested in creating original content for Chris-Craft and presumably other independent outlets.Eisner ""called me and invited me to lunch,"" Frank remembered. ""He said, 'I really don't like your idea, but I want you to come here and help us start a fourth network.' ""Frank joined Paramount, and while the launch of the new network did not work out, he was named president of television at the company, where he was responsible for launching numerous successful shows.After a shake-up at Paramount parent Gulf + Western Industries, Frank followed Eisner to Disney, where he was named head of Walt Disney Studios. There his winning streak continued.Asked what he attributes his success to, and one word pops up regularly in his reply: learn.""I think I understood the television business, having first started buying time at (ad agency) BBDO and then selling time at multiple stations around the country. You learn what works in different markets. And then when I went to be a sales manager at an independent station, I learned how that worked — and again at Paramount. I never stopped learning.""His management philosophy is equally simple: ""I'm responsible for overall strategy; (the people I hire) are responsible for how to get it done. I believe in hiring the right people and allowing them to do their job.""I also believe that they should have the right to make mistakes. The people I protect the most are those who've tried something that didn't work, rather than those that just sit there and are complacent.""Certainly complacent is not an adjective ever applied to Frank, who often took sizable risks in his career. He OK'd ""The Golden Girls"" TV series when the conventional wisdom — and the advice of almost everyone around him — said America wasn't interested in a show about four, uh, mature women living in a Florida retirement community.Similarly, he had an idea for a daily syndicated entertainment news program that everyone said was unfeasible. Remember, that was 37 years ago, when computers had less power than an early iPhone and many if not most television stations didn't have the satellite equipment necessary to receive a daily feed.Undeterred, Frank explained, ""We financed stations to install satellites."" One seemed a bit reluctant, ""so we had a kid every day after we shot the show drive the tape to Bakersfield.""The concept of the show was so new and foreign to the TV playing field that Frank had to negotiate new union rules — so that movie industry regulations concerning the number of lighting and sound people that went out on shoots could be modified.That show, of course, was ""Entertainment Tonight,"" which, he said, ""changed the industry and changed the entire world of TV now.""His willingness to push the boundaries of technology doesn't surprise Bob Gazzale, the president and CEO of the American Film Institute. Frank joined the AFI board in 1991 and serves as its vice chair even today, a volunteer position. Frank was also the longest-serving president of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, the organization responsible for the Emmy Awards.Gazzale said that despite Frank's ""extraordinarily busy schedule, if and when I need Rich he's always there.""""Perhaps his greatest contribution,"" Gazzale added, ""aside from the generosity of time, spirit and resources — is his visionary take on the art form that AFI celebrates. ... From movies to television to streaming to gaming to VR ... Rich has always carried the flag for what's next.""Ironically, a portion of his success also can be attributed to Frank's past — that he never strayed far from his Brooklyn Everyman roots.""I think I have the same taste as most Americans,"" he said. ""I think I know what people want to see, who they want to see and what they want to see them in. I'm good at picking talent and have a crazy sense of humor. In a nutshell, I have commercial tastes.""Perhaps the best example of that occurred when he spotted an unknown comedian named Tim Allen at a comedy club doing his grunting male routine. Although Frank concedes that there are ""so many people involved in so many projects,"" it was that sighting that led Disney to produce the show ""Home Improvement,"" starring Allen, which ran eight seasons on ABC.Even shows as successful as that one have shelf lives, and so do jobs. Following the untimely death of Disney corporate president Frank Wells in a 1994 helicopter crash, the vibe at the company changed.So Rich Frank left, content to do some consulting work and spend more time at his weekend vacation property in California's Napa Valley. That home started as a respite from work and included eight acres of grapes, which he allowed a neighbor to harvest in return for a few cases of wine that Frank could share with friends.But Frank got a call from a buddy — winemaker Koerner Rombauer (nephew of ""The Joy of Cooking"" author, Irma Rombauer) — that a nearby vineyard was for sale. Frank and Koerner decided to partner on what was initially known as Frank-Rombauer. (Around 2000, for a number of reasons including estate planning, Rich bought out Rombauer's interest and renamed the winery Frank Family Vineyards.)As Frank recalls, the winery he purchased, Kornell Champagne Cellars, was producing 100,000 cases and losing $3 a bottle. You didn't have to be a genius to realize that was an unsustainable business model. So he and Rombauer, who spent much of his time at his own winery, immediately cut production to 200 barrels a year.Frank understood the old wine industry axiom that the quickest way to make a small fortune in the business is to start with a large one. He quickly — and here's that word again — learned the major ins and outs of the business and realized that he had to use the same principles in the wine business that he used in the entertainment industry that made him sufficiently wealthy to buy a Napa Valley winery in the first place.So he made a point to hire a quality GM and winemaker, Todd Graff, to guide him through the morass. He understood the difficulty of distribution, with 50 states each having its own liquor laws. So he expanded territories very slowly, always keeping the bottom line in mind. And he understood the importance of a good and popular tasting room, the only place he received full value for his wines.Ultimately, though, he understood that more than anything, the bottom line depended on the quality of grapes in the wine. ""I compare a bottle of wine to a movie script: If you don't have a good script, you don't have a chance of success.""So he decided to go beyond the law. According to state regulations, you have to lay a bottle of sparkling wine down a year before it can be sold. He laid his down for three years to enhance the flavor. And his new Lady Edythe brand (named after his mom), he lays down for five years.It delays his return on investment, but ultimately he virtually assures one.After a successful career as a top Hollywood executive, he chucked the limos and private jets to become a vintner.Overcame: The need to apply what he learned in corporate life to life on the farm.Lesson: Sometimes the answer is simple.Quote: ""I wasn't sure we ever would make money, but I was pretty sure I knew how to make money. In its simplest form it was make good wine and sell it for more than it cost you.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:Jane 'Dr. Quinn' Seymour Nurtures Her Lifestyle BrandThe Larger-Than-Life Career Of 'King Kong' Producer Merian CooperMichael Landon's Largest Role Was In Fostering Family Values On TVNina Tassler Used Her Outsider's Insight To Succeed At CBSBob Wright Took NBC From Broadcasting To The Modern Media Universe

109,ICE,"Crude's taking a downward turn as investors worry U.S. stockpiles started expanding again.X Oil futures in New York fell as much as 2.2%, while gasoline also traded lower in the wake of a Bloomberg survey suggesting stockpiles of both may have risen last week. As the spread tightens between West Texas Intermediate and Brent, crude exports from the U.S. may become less attractive, leading to storage buildups. Energy stocks fell amid a broader rout in U.S. markets.Nationwide crude inventories probably rose by 900,000 barrels last week, according to the median estimate of analysts. At the same time, U.S. crude output could top 10 million barrels a day at any time.""Exports are being hurt a bit by the reduction in the Brent-WTI spread, which should also help inventories replenish. This is the slack demand period,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund. It's also ""registering with folks that crude oil output is just soaring.""While the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries works to reduce output, concern that U.S. crude production will hit new records remains on investors' minds. Yet, OPEC and Russia will let oil prices climb as high as the market can bear, according to Gary Ross, global head of oil analytics at S&P Global Platts, which acquired PIRA Energy in 2016.American crude production reached 9.88 million barrels a day last week, the highest in weekly government data going back to 1983.While crude stockpiles have dropped for 10 straight weeks, gasoline supplies have been on the rise since early November, and analysts estimate they rose by another 2 million barrels last week. Inventory figures will be released by the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday, while tallies from the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will be released late Tuesday.WTI crude for March delivery fell $1.09 to $64.47 a barrel at 12:20 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after dropping by the most since early December. Total volume traded was about 13% above the 100-day average.Brent for March settlement slid 58 cents to $68.88 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $4.40 to WTI, after reaching the smallest premium since August on Monday.The S&P 500 Energy Index fell as much as 2%, with Noble Energy falling 5.1%. Newfield Exploration, Apache and Chesapeake Energy all tumbled more than 4%.The broader S&P 500 was on pace for the biggest two-day decline since August.""The crude market is looking at the weakness in stock market. That's making the oil traders a little nervous,"" Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, said by telephone. At the same time, ""there is an expectation that we will see the first increase in supply in a long time.""

110,ICE,"Crude popped above $65 a barrel for the first time in more than three years after U.S. crude stockpiles fell for a 10th week in the longest stretch of declines on record.Futures advanced 1.8% in New York. Crude in American tanks and terminals slipped last week to the lowest since February 2015 while inventories at the nation's biggest storage hub also swung lower, according to government data. Demand for stored supplies in the world's biggest economy has been robust at a time of year when it's usually weak because of refinery repairs, all against the backdrop of OPEC production curbs.""Demand is outpacing supply,"" Brian Kessens, who helps manage $16 billion in energy assets at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC, said by telephone. ""The OPEC curtailments are helping and their compliance has been relatively strong.""Oil hit the highest levels since 2014 in New York amid shrinking supplies in the U.S. and a united front by major oil producers including the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. Meanwhile, Russia's second-biggest crude producer expects worldwide supply and demand to balance out by April, Lukoil PJSC billionaire CEO Vagit Alekperov said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.West Texas Intermediate for March delivery jumped $1.14 to settle at $65.61 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level since December 2014. Total volume traded was about 52% above the 100-day average.Brent for March settlement rose 57 cents to end the session at $70.53 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $4.92 to WTI.Some traders had been bracing for inventories to move in the opposite direction and show an increase after the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute was said to have suggested such an outcome in its Tuesday evening report. The API typically discloses its weekly estimates a day before the U.S. Energy Information Administration releases its tally.This is ""somewhat of a relief rally in a way because it was another draw, as opposed to a big build,"" said Joseph Bozoyan, a portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management LLC in Boston.The Energy Information Administration on Wednesday said U.S. crude production rose for a second consecutive week to 9.88 million barrels a day. Oil inventories at the key Cushing, Oklahoma, pipeline hub fell to the lowest level since January 2015, while gasoline stockpiles climbed for an 11th week and distillate stockpiles also increased, according to the government.""What the U.S. refinery complex is seeing is really high demand for gasoline and diesel worldwide,"" Kessens, said. The arbitrage ""gives the U.S. an incentive to export refined products.""

111,ICE,"It's pop quiz time. Which of these three investing benchmarks produced the biggest returns since the summer of 1999 through the start of 2018: the S&P 500 average of large-cap stocks, China's Shanghai Stock Exchange composite index, or gold?XThe correct answer? That shiny metal used a lot in jewelry, traded heavily by short-term speculators in the futures markets, and stored for long-term safekeeping in bank vaults around the globe.From a bottom near $250 a troy ounce in August 1999 through Wednesday, gold has delivered compound annual growth of 9.6%. Thanks to solid gains over the past year, the S&P has improved its annually compound gain to 4.5% in that nearly 18-1/2 year span, excluding dividends. And the Shanghai composite has gained a compounded 4.6%.If you guessed wrong, it might be because a tough 5-1/2 years took some shine off gold. The price today is still off 29% from its all-time high of $1,895 an ounce in 2011.But in recent months, gold is regaining its mojo.On the Comex exchange, near-term futures are currently at $1,363 an ounce, rising 9.7% since its mid-December near-term low and up 4% since Jan. 1. That year-to-date advance still trails a 5.8% gain for the S&P 500 and a stunning 7.6% rise for the Shanghai composite.Yet even as Bitcoin fever seems to be catching on, gold futures appear to be breaking through a key downtrend line that stretches back to September 2011.A sharp upward bust of that trend line could signal a change in direction again and another long-term buying opportunity. For the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), that inflection point would be a thrust above 123.The highly liquid ETF on Wednesday gapped up to a 1.4% gain to 129.07 in heavy turnover. SPDR Gold is also clearing a 128.42 buy point in a nearly five-month saucer base.The ETF trades on average 7.1 million shares a day; in other words, as much as $896 million worth of the popular trading vehicle changes hands each day. SPDR Gold Shares is now up 10.8% since Jan. 1, still ahead of the S&P 500's 6% advance.Not that gold is an easy game to play, especially for short-term speculators. Gold prices continue to show tremendous volatility in the short term, vacillating with the latest political, economic and international tides. Since October of 2016, the London P.M. fixing price of gold has risen or fallen 2% or more for the week at least 14 times. And since July of last year, it moved up or down 1% for the week at least 18 times.No wonder many golden hairs on commodities traders' heads quickly turn silver.""Gold has no true fundamentals, no intrinsic value, only limited industrial and practical use and doesn't generate cash flow,"" said Sandra Navidi, CEO of the macroeconomic consulting firm Beyond Global LLC.""Its value is primarily driven by fickle psychology and by what the next investor is willing to pay,"" said Navidi, the author of ""$uperHubs: How the Financial Elite & Their Networks Rule Our World.""So, if you don't want to trade in the short term, how do you win in gold?One key, says veteran portfolio manager Joe Wickwire, is to fully comprehend the difference between being a speculator and an investor. An investor thinks long-term (at least three to five years) and understands the beauty of gold as a hedge against the weakening purchase power of other financial assets.Wickwire's job as an investment professional is to exploit the disconnect between the price of gold when it is driven by short-term speculative money and to know when it makes good sense as a long-term play amid changing financial, monetary and economic conditions.""Gold is a financial asset insurance policy,"" said Wickwire, who has managed the Fidelity Select Gold Portfolio (FSAGX) mutual fund since August 2007 as well as the Fidelity Global Commodity Stock Fund (FFGCX). Wickwire keeps a chart on the wall of his office in Boston listing 17 factors that influence gold prices, adding ""I could add another 17 factors.""The Fidelity Select Gold Portfolio fund is up 2.7% since Jan. 1 and up 8.6% over the past year.Over the long haul, the four chief factors influencing gold prices are macroeconomic imbalances, geopolitical shocks, the laws of supply and demand, and the overall state of the gold mining industry, he says.Wickwire shares a simple yet brilliant rule of thumb that can help an individual investor get a sense of the long-term picture for gold: Look at real interest rates. When rates are less than 2%, the price of gold tends to go up.Right now, the fed funds rate on overnight bank loans is in a target range of 1.25%-1.5%. Many economists expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by a quarter point three times this year, repeating what it did in 2017. Currently, the U.S. prime rate is 4.5%.Compare those figures with the 1970s, when the U.S. economy suffered from double-digit unemployment and torrid inflation. By 1980, the yield on the 3-month U.S. Treasury bill climbed toward 14%, but the real rate after inflation was low. Gold and other precious metals were hot.When Federal Reserve chief Paul Volcker set on a course to kill inflation by sharply raising short-term interest rates during the early years of Ronald Reagan's presidency, the market turned upside down. Inflation fell, economic growth came back, entrepreneurs started new companies as tax rates fell, and U.S. equities had their longest stretch of gains (1982 to 2000) of the century.""Real rates came down and assets were priced properly. Gold was boring,"" Wickwire said.Not so, lately.
"
112,ICE,"Oil declined for a second day to the lowest level in almost two weeks as investors awaited reports on U.S. inventories that could open a window on end-of-year demand.Futures switched between gains and losses before closing 0.3% down in New York following last week's rally above $52 a barrel. The indecision comes ahead of weekly inventory data that are expected to show U.S. crude stockpiles fell last week. Meanwhile, traders reckoned with data showing OPEC output rose last month amid news that production in Libya is set to recover.""Our strong rally of the last couple of months seems to be catching its breath,"" Gene McGillian, a market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn., said by phone. ""Looking forward, we're going to be watching the inventory reports to see if demand levels start to drop off as we go into the last quarter of the year.""End-of-year demand for oil typically weakens as refiners shut units for repairs and maintenance, shunting more supplies into storage tanks. However, in the advent of Hurricane Harvey, some refiners have decided to delay maintenance projects to take advantage of strong demand for fuel and fatter profits.West Texas intermediate for November delivery fell 16 cents to settle at $50.42 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest close in more than a week. Total volume traded was about 44% below the 100-day average.Brent for December settlement dropped 12 cents to end the session at $56 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $5.26 to December WTI.U.S. crude stockpiles probably fell by 500,000 barrels last week, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. At the same time, gasoline supplies probably rose by 1 million barrels and distillate inventories likely slid by 1.5 million barrels. Oil stored at the key Cushing, Okla., storage hub probably swelled by 1.8 million barrels, according to a forecast compiled by Bloomberg.
"
113,ICE,"Oil closed higher after Saudi Arabia and Russia signaled production cuts may be extended into 2019, initially worrying traders that their efforts aren't working.Futures rose 0.2% on Monday after toggling between gains and losses. Producers should keep limits on output through this year as it may be 2019 before supplies sync with demand, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said in a Bloomberg television interview with Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak. Russia is prepared to prolong its alliance with OPEC even after their accord expires at the end of 2018, Novak said.The comments came after crude futures registered their first weekly decline in a month on concern higher prices may spur more U.S. shale drilling.Saudi Arabia and Russia ""are re-affirming what we already know,"" Michael Loewen, a commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said by telephone. Still, with ""OPEC continuing to manage supply and balance the markets long-term, that's positive for the barrel.""West Texas Intermediate for February delivery, which expires Monday, rose 12 cents to settle at $63.49 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 13% below the 100-day average. The more-active March contract added 26 cents to end the session at $63.57.Brent for March settlement climbed 42 cents to settle at $69.03 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It traded at a premium of $5.46 to March WTI.Al-Falih's comment on when the market might rebalance led some to believe the cuts may not be tightening inventories fast enough.The production limits ""are obviously not working all that well if you need that much more time to achieve your objective,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund, by telephone. The televised remarks were ""an attempt to try and talk up the market but I'm not sure that it didn't backfire to a degree.""Meanwhile, in the U.S., crude stockpiles are estimated to have shrunk by 2.5 million barrels last week, according to the median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be a 10th straight week of declines in the midst of refinery maintenance that typically lasts through March.""Seasonally, you usually don't see inventories fall,"" Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, said by telephone. ""This is your big build season for crude. If you continue to see falling refinery activity and falling inventories, that's pretty important.""

116,ICE,"In 1790, the finest mind in the First Congress, and of his generation, addressed in the House of Representatives the immigration issue: ""It is no doubt very desirable that we should hold out as many inducements as possible for the worthy part of mankind to come and settle amongst us."" Perhaps today's 115th Congress will resume the Sisyphean task of continuing one of America's oldest debates, in which James Madison was an early participant: By what criteria should we decide who is worthy to come amongst us?XThe antecedents of the pronouns ""we"" and ""us"" include the almost 80 million who are either immigrants — not excluding the more than 11 million undocumented ones — or their children. They might be amused to learn that in the only full-length book Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Notes on the State of Virginia,"" he worried that too many immigrants might be coming from Europe with monarchical principles ""imbibed in their early youth,"" ideas that might turn America into ""a heterogeneous, incoherent, distracted mass.""A century later, Theodore Roosevelt, who detested ""milk-and-water cosmopolitanism,"" saw virtue emerging from struggles between the ""Anglo-Saxon"" race and what Roosevelt's friend and soulmate Rudyard Kipling called ""lesser breeds without the law."" TR, who worried that the United States was becoming a ""polyglot boarding house,"" supported America's first significant legislation restricting immigration, passed to exclude Chinese, because he thought Chinese laborers would depress American wages, and because he believed they would be ""ruinous to the white race.""In 1902, in the final volume of professor Woodrow Wilson's widely-read book ""A History of the American People,"" he contrasted ""the sturdy stocks of the north of Europe"" — e.g., Norwegians — with southern and eastern Europeans who had ""neither skill nor energy nor any initiative of quick intelligence."" U.S. Army data gathered during World War I mobilization demonstrated, according to a Princeton psychologist, ""the intellectual superiority of our Nordic group over the Mediterranean, Alpine and Negro groups."" Richard T. Ely, a leading progressive economist, spent most of his academic career at the University of Wisconsin, but first taught at Johns Hopkins, where one of his students was Woodrow Wilson. Ely celebrated the Army data for enabling the nation to inventory its human stock just as it does its livestock. In 1924, Congress legislated severe immigration restrictions, which excluded immigrants from an ""Asiatic Barred Zone.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveFor more on this unsavory subject, read ""Illiberal Reformers: Race, Eugenics and American Economics in the Progressive Era,"" by Princeton economist Thomas C. Leonard. And ""One Nation Undecided"" by Peter H. Schuck, professor emeritus at Yale Law School, who writes: ""In what may be the cruelest single action in our immigration history, Congress defeated a bill in 1939 to rescue 20,000 children from Nazi Germany despite American families' eagerness to sponsor them — on the ground that the children would exceed Germany's quota!""The next phase of America's immigration debate, like the previous one, will generate the most heat about border security and whether those who are here illegally should stay. The heat will be disproportionate.The border was irrelevant to the 42% of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S., mostly at airports, with valid visas that they then overstayed. Spending on border security quadrupled in the 1990s, then tripled in the next decade. Now that net immigration of Mexicans has been negative for ten years, Americans eager to build a wall should not build it on the 1,984-mile U.S.-Mexico border but on the 541-mile Mexico-Guatemala border.Fifty-eight percent of the more than 11 million — down from 12.2 million in 2007 — who are here illegally have been here at least 10 years; 31% are homeowners; 33% have children who, having been born here, are citizens. The nation would recoil from the police measures that would be necessary to extract these people from the communities into the fabric of which their lives are woven. They are not going home; they are home.After 9/11, attitudes about immigration became entangled with policies about terrorism. So, as The Economist noted, ""a mass murder committed by mostly Saudi terrorists resulted in an almost limitless amount of money being made available for the deportation of Mexican house-painters."" This month, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents raided 98 7-Eleven stores in 17 states, making 21 arrests, approximately one for every 4.5 stores. Rome was not built in a day and it would be unreasonable to expect the government to guarantee, in one fell swoop, that only American citizens will hold jobs dispensing Slurpees and Big Gulps.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

117,ICE,"Oil's bull market rally stumbled into some bad news.Futures fell as much as 3.1% in New York after OPEC output rose and shale drillers put rigs back to work. The group of crude-exporting nations added 120,000 barrels a day in September, according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts, oil companies and ship-tracking data. At the same time, U.S. explorers added oil rigs last week for the first time since August. The dollar strengthened, further weighing on the appeal of commodities.""It's coming out that OPEC's oil output rose last month, another rise in the rig count. That's all feeding in here to generating some downward pressure,"" John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York-based hedge fund, said by telephone. Oil's loss also comes as ""we've seen some decent dollar strength.""Oil entered a bull market last week on signs that rising demand and OPEC-led production cuts were helping reduce a global supply surplus, while Turkey threatened to halt exports from Kurdistan.West Texas Intermediate for November delivery declined $1.13 to $50.54 a barrel at 1 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 21% below the 100-day average. Prices climbed 9.4% in September, the biggest monthly increase since April 2016.Brent for December settlement fell 76 cents to $56.03 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The November contract expired Friday up 13 cents at $57.54. The global benchmark crude traded at a $5.20 premium to December WTI.The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the currency against 10 major peers, rose as much as 0.5%. A stronger U.S. currency reduces the appeal of dollar-denominated raw materials as an investment.Output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was 32.83 million barrels a day in September, according to the survey. Production in Libya rebounded by 30,000 barrels a day as the Sharara field restarted and Nigeria's output increased by 20,000 bpd to 1.77 million bpd, just short of the 1.8 million bpd that could eventually lead to its participation in OPEC's effort to reduce output. Both countries have so far been spared from the deal to pare supplies.""There's a lot of crude oil in storage still. And OPEC, who knows what can happen there? They've been pretty good with the compliance levels, but that can slide at any given moment,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by telephone. ""This market was really overbought.

119,ICE,"Oil pared losses after an industry report was said to have shown an unexpected decline in crude inventories.Prices were little changed in post-settlement trading after the American Petroleum Institute was said to report on Tuesday that U.S. crude stockpiles slid by 761,000 barrels last week. That would be the first draw since August if confirmed in Energy Information Administration data scheduled to be released on Wednesday. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey were bracing for a 3.1 million-barrel increase in the stockpiles.""It was a little bit of a shock, but we'll see what the EIA says tomorrow. Considering all the lingering impacts of Harvey, it would not surprise me to see a deviation of 4 or 5 million barrels between the API and the EIA,""  Kyle Cooper, director of research at IAF Advisors in Houston, said by telephone. But, ""certainly if the EIA confirms this, then you'd probably find quite a bit of support in the market.""Oil has gained about 10% this month in New York and its global counterpart traded in London reached a two-year high on Monday amid forecasts for rising consumption in the face of output cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' and partners including Russia. The two benchmarks posted declines Tuesday, yet losses were limited due to OPEC's continued output restrictions and lingering concerns that Turkey may disrupt Kurdish oil shipments.We're going to go back to watching our inventory reports,"" Gene McGillian, a market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn., said by telephone. The supply caps implemented by OPEC and allied producers are ""working and we're seeing a tightening in the supply-demand balance.""West Texas Intermediate for November delivery traded at $52.10 a barrel at 4:38 p.m. ET after settling at $51.88 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Futures closed at $59.02 on Monday, the highest settlement since July 2015. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $6.56 to WTI on Tuesday.The API report also showed that gasoline stockpiles rose by 1.47 million barrels, while distillate supplies fell by 4.53 million, according to people familiar with the data, who asked not to be named because the information isn't public. Inventories at the Cushing, Okla., storage hub climbed by 1.06 million, the API data showed, which would be the biggest build since March if the EIA confirms it.Gasoline inventories probably dropped by 750,000 barrels, while distillate supplies likely shrank by 2.05 million barrels, according to the Bloomberg survey. At Cushing, crude stockpiles probably increased by 1.5 million barrels last week, according to the survey.

Kurdish oil supplies may be in jeopardy as Turkey, Iran and the Iraqi central government in Baghdad sought to isolate the semi-autonomous Kurds as balloting began on Monday. Meanwhile, OPEC and its partners implemented more than 100% of their agreed cuts last month, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said Friday in Vienna, providing more fuel to the oil rally.""It's pretty clear the Kurds are going to vote for independence and we will have yet another geopolitical hot spot in the Middle East that threatens a significant amount of oil supply,"" John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund, said by telephone. At the same time, ""the cooperation and the strong effort by OPEC is registering with the market.""U.S. crude prices have risen 9.6% this month as U.S. refiners recovered from Hurricane Harvey and both OPEC and the International Energy Agency sweetened their worldwide demand forecasts. At the same time, U.S. explorers reduced the number of rigs searching for crude last week to the lowest level since June. Yet, there's still speculation an extension of the OPEC-led deal beyond March may be needed to rebalance the markets.Brent for November settlement advanced $1.61 to $58.47 a barrel at 11:28 a.m. ET on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange after earlier touching $58.48, the highest intraday price since July 15, 2015.

However, it's not possible to say whether the deal will need to be extended until closer to its March expiration, Kuwait's Oil Minister Issam Almarzooq said.Output from Kurdistan would be at Turkey's mercy should the nation ""close the valves"" on exports, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday in his gravest threat to date against the Kurdistan Regional Government's primary source of revenue. Turkey also announced joint military exercises with Iraq, while Iran called the vote ""illegal and illegitimate"" and said it had closed its borders with the Kurdish region at the request of Iraq's government.""Erdogan's speech is a reason driving prices higher as the market worries there could be supply disruptions and that's getting priced in,"" said Michael Poulsen, an analyst at Global Risk Management Ltd. ""OPEC's comments are also supportive. An extension of the deal would probably be required and OPEC will likely keep it brewing for a while with its comments.""

121,ICE,"Crude edged higher Wednesday as OPEC showed increased determination to curb production and tighten markets.X Futures rose 0.4% in New York to $63.97 a a barrel following Tuesday's decline. Strict adherence by OPEC, Russia and other major producers to self-imposed supply limits has been counterbalanced by concern that hedge fund managers may begin unwinding a record level of bullish bets on crude prices. Meanwhile, gasoline futures jumped amid U.S. refinery shutdowns because of the cold weather.""The market continues to take support from signs that OPEC and Russia's compliance with their production cuts is really high and it doesn't seem that there are any worries that there is cheating going on yet,"" Gene McGillian, a market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn., said by telephone.Despite Tuesday's price drop, crude remains close to levels last seen in December 2014. The Organization of Petroleum Countries and allied crude producers complied with their output limits at a rate of 125% in December, up from 122% a month earlier. Discipline within the group should remain high this year, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Bakheet Al-Rashidi told reporters in Kuwait City. Citgroup (C) said the cartel and its allies have already achieved their supply goals.West Texas Intermediate for February delivery advanced 24 cents to settle at $63.97 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Brent for March settlement added 23 cents to end the session at $69.38 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.

""There is no plan at all to talk about any exit strategy,"" he said. ""We are committed until the end of the year; this is the agreement.""In the U.S., the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute is scheduled to release its stockpiles data on Wednesday and the Energy Information Administration is scheduled to release its weekly inventory tally on Thursday.U.S. crude inventories probably declined by 3.15 million barrels last week, according to the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma, pipeline hub probably fell by 2.5 million barrels last week, according to a forecast compiled by Bloomberg.""WTI is continuing to outperform Brent as the reductions at Cushing have been really pronounced,"" Thomas Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group LLC in Wellington, Florida, said by telephone.Meanwhile, a blast of Arctic air pushing deep into the South hindered refinery operations in the region, sent natural gas prices soaring and drove electricity demand in Texas to a record high. Marathon Petroleum's refinery in Garyville, Louisiana, had a power outage early Wednesday and is working to restore normal operations. The units are said to be on circulation, heated up but unable to process anything, according to a person familiar with operations.The rise in gasoline prices can be attributed to refinery shutdowns in the Gulf, such as at Marathon Garyville, due to the cold weather, Finlon said.

122,ICE,"Litigation may be as American as apple pie, but some lawsuits are so destructive that they stand out even among the hugely expensive wreckage wrought by our legal system. The most prominent current example is the ""children's"" climate lawsuit (Juliana v U.S.): A group of kids, including ""future generations, through their guardian Dr. James Hansen,"" claim that the government's actions and failures to act have caused climate change, thus violating the youngest generation's constitutional rights to life, liberty and property, and have failed to protect essential public trust resources.X I leave the numerous legal issues to the lawyers, although precisely how the ineffable Hansen came to be the ""guardian"" for future generations is a question both fascinating and amusing. Instead, it is crucial to recognize first that the fundamental policy assumption underlying this lawsuit — we can make ""the children"" better off by making them poorer — is preposterous.More generally, the lawsuit is a blatant attempt to circumvent democratic processes, in terms of both the Congressional power to make policy and the authority of the president to implement it.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveClimate policies — mandated reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions — by and large are energy policies, and the constitution is silent on which such policies would serve the interests of future generations, or on the appropriate tradeoffs between the interests of ""the children"" and the adults alive in the here and now.Those are policy questions, and this attempt to induce judges to interfere with Congress' legislative powers is deeply destructive of our constitutional institutions. Should ""the children"" not be concerned about that? Why are ""the children"" not suing about, say, the national debt?Second, the claim about the protection of ""essential public trust resources"" boils down to an assertion that carbon dioxide is a ""pollutant.""  No, it is not: A certain minimum atmospheric concentration of it is necessary for life itself. (Merely look at NASA's time-lapse photo of the earth's greening over the last 30-plus years.) By far the most important GHG is water vapor; does anyone claim that it is a ""pollutant?"" Obviously not, and not because ocean evaporation is a natural process; so are volcanic eruptions, and the massive amounts of effluents emitted by volcanoes are pollutants by any definition.Third, consider a homo sapiens baby born in a cave some tens of thousands of years ago, in a world with environmental quality effectively untouched by mankind. That child at birth would have had a life expectancy on the order of ten years; had it been able to choose, it is obvious that it willingly would have given up some environmental quality in exchange for better housing, food, water, medical care, safety, ad infinitum. That is, it is obvious that people willingly choose to give up some environmental quality in exchange for a life both longer and wealthier.In other words, the children's lawsuit is inconsistent with actual interests of future generations, as the obvious underlying assumption is that future generations would prefer the purest possible environmental quality. That is not correct: Future generations want to inherit the most valuable possible capital stock in all of its myriad dimensions, among which environmental quality is one important component among many, and among all of which there are tradeoffs that cannot be avoided.Is it the position of the attorneys representing ""the children"" that making energy more rather than less expensive unambiguously would make future generations better off? In order for future generations to receive the most valuable possible capital stock, the current generation must consume and invest resources most productively.If regulatory and other policies implemented by the current generation yield less wealth now and a smaller total capital stock for future generations, then more resource consumption and more emissions of effluents currently would be preferred from the viewpoint of those future generations.That is only the beginning of the problematic factual assertions and assumptions underlying the children's lawsuit. The measureable effects of increasing GHG concentrations are far smaller than the climate models would lead one to believe. The degree to which recent warming has been anthropogenic is unsettled in the scientific literature; and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its fifth assessment report (AR5) has reduced its estimated range of the effect in 2100 of a doubling of GHG concentrations from 2.0–4.5 to 1.5–4.5 degrees C.There actually is little evidence of strong climate effects attendant upon increasing GHG concentrations, in terms of  sea levels; Arctic and Antarctic sea ice; tornado activity; tropical cyclones; U.S. wildfires; drought; and flooding. IPCC in the AR5 is deeply dubious (Table 12.4) about the various severe effects often hypothesized (or asserted) as future impacts of increasing GHG concentrations.One might assume that the facts underlying a lawsuit ought to be consistent with its central claims; one would be wrong. And wrong again if one assumes that the policy objective would make an actual difference: The Paris agreement with full U.S. participation would reduce temperatures by 2100 by seventeen one-hundredths of a degree. The U.S. contribution would be fifteen one-thousandths of a degree. Add another one one-hundredth of a degree if you believe that the Obama pseudo-agreement with China is meaningful.  (It is not.)Precisely what is the children's climate lawsuit trying to achieve? It cannot be protection of our constitutional principles, or protection of future generations, or environmental improvement. Only one possibility remains: It is part of the long-term effort by the environmental left to use any means possible to exert control over other people's property, economic choices, and lifestyles. The plaintiff attorneys are happy to participate in a litigation process in which ""the children"" are irrelevant.RELATED:Despite What You've Heard, Global Warming Isn't Making Weather More ExtremeClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

While the draw was smaller than the 11.2 million barrels reported in an industry tally on Tuesday, it still was the largest for this time of year since 2014. The last time winter stockpiles shrank at this pace was a decade ago.Even though investors were expecting a massive draw, ""it was still a very sizable one,"" said Rob Thummel, managing director at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC, which handles $16 billion in energy-related assets. We're seeing ""falling inventories and rising geopolitical risk and that signals higher oil prices.""Prices have surged amid renewed optimism that cutbacks by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners are helping to drain a global glut.

As for fuels, the report showed a rise in gasoline and diesel supplies.""The inventory report still shows that crude stocks are plummeting like a stone,"" Adam Wise, who oversees an $8 billion energy portfolio at John Hancock Financial Services Inc. in Boston, said by telephone.

But as new evidence trickles out from peer-reviewed science studies, the legs beneath the climate change hypothesis — that the earth was doing just fine until carbon-dioxide spewing human beings came along — is increasingly wobbly.A new study published in the journal Nature Geoscience purports to support action by global governments to reduce carbon dioxide output in order to lower potential global warming over the next 100 years or so. But what it really does is undercut virtually every modern argument for taking radical action against warming.Why? The study admits that the 12 major university and government models that have been used to predict climate warming are faulty.""We haven't seen that rapid acceleration in warming after 2000 that we see in the models,"" said Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at Oxford and one of the authors of the study. ""We haven't seen that in the observations.""And, of course, he's quite right. As we've noted here numerous times, the much-feared ""global warming"" trend seems to have halted somewhere around 1998. We know this is true because satellite temperature readings — the most accurate temperature gauge since it takes in the entire atmosphere, not just parts of it — show there's been virtually no change.Based on the U.N.'s models, temperatures should have been shooting up sharply starting in about 1995. By this year, model temperatures show we should have had just under a 1.0 degree centigrade rise in temperature, a significant temperature spike in what is, in geological time, an extremely short period. It was those models that were used to sell the world on the idea that we needed a drastic reordering of our global economic priorities immedialy.The reality: virtually no change in temperature. Put simply, the models are wrong.And yet, advocates of the global warming dogma continue to ruin the careers of scientific apostates and hurl insults like calling skeptics ""deniers"" — which likens those who disagree about global warming science to those who ""deny"" the existence of the Holocaust — while denying painfully obvious facts about ""climate change.""As we noted back in May, we noted that the Sunday Telegraph of Britain had reported that temperatures had dropped sharply early this year following the supposed ""hottest year on record"" in 2016. How could that be? 2016 was an El Niño year, which are always unusually hot.""In recent months global temperatures have plummeted by more than 0.6 degrees: just as happened 17 years ago after a similarly strong El Niño."" Not only that, but despite doom-and-gloom prognostications by global warming's biased, bought-and-paid for ""scientist"" forecasters, ice in the Arctic and Greenland both grew this year.Recent revisions of climate data have all been in one direction: Older data have been revised to show cooler temperatures, more recent ones, warmer temperatures. Statistics would suggest that random errors would be not all in one direction.So it looks suspiciously like scientist-statisticians who are getting big fat checks from governments that have every interest in selling the idea of inevitable and disastrous global warming are, if you will, cooking the books.This might be merely an academic dispute if not for one thing: To remediate it, the United Nations and a legion of scientists around the world riding the global warming gravy train are seeking to have the world spend 2% of its GDP just to slow climate change.That's about $1.5 trillion a year, at current levels of world GDP, an enormous amount. And most of it would come from the U.S. and a small handful of other rich nations. A huge tax on you to remedy a phantom threat, in short.No one doubts the climate is changing. That's why it's called ""climate,"" not ""stasis."" The scientific knowledge of climate is still in its infancy.But now that we have further evidence in the form of another peer-reviewed study that shows the global warming models are flawed at best, fraudulent at worse, we do agree with global warming advocates on one thing: We need to take action.So once again, we call on President Trump to pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. That bad deal won't change the climate one bit, but it will hurt the world economy and lower Americans' standard of living.And we ask: Based on the growing evidence, who are the real deniers?RELATED:Science Unsettled: Why Trump Should Dump The Paris Climate Deal U.N.'s Global Warming Fraudsters Are More Interested In Climate Cash Than Climate Change Is Global Warming Science Just A Fraud? Check out all of IBD's Political coverage, including the award-winning editorial page.New to investing?

128,ICE,"Oil rose as an industry report was said to show U.S. stockpiles climbed less than expected.The price spike in after-hours trading helped erase almost all of the regular session's loss on Tuesday.U.S. crude inventories increased by 1.44 million barrels last week, the American Petroleum Institute was said to report Tuesday. That's less than half the 3.9 million-barrel increase the Energy Information Administration is forecast to report Wednesday, according to a Bloomberg survey. This may be a sign that demand from refineries battered by Hurricane Harvey is coming back to normal.""We're going to find that refiners are back online sooner,"" after Harvey-led shutdowns, James Williams, president of London, Ark.-based energy researcher WTRG Economics, said by telephone. ""Things are returning to normal. In the short-term, we are going to head back to pre-hurricane status.""While the U.S. benchmark has tipped above $50 this month, prices haven't sustained a close above that key level since the end of July as increasing U.S. shale output hindered efforts by OPEC, Russia and other major sources of supply to whittle a stubborn glut. The Energy Information Administration sees shale-oil production reaching a record high next month.Futures rose from the settlement after the release of API data. West Texas Intermediate for October delivery, which expires Wednesday, traded at $49.85 a barrel at 4:44 p.m. in aftermarket trading after settling at $49.48 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 6% below the 100-day average. WTI closed below its 200-day moving average after moving above the level earlier in the session.""It's no accident"" that prices rose slightly above the 200-day moving average before reverting lower, Bart Melek, head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said by telephone. ""We're going to hover around there for a while.""Brent for November settlement fell 34 cents to end the session at $55.14 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, the lowest level in a week. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $5.24 to November WTI.The API report also showed that gasoline stockpiles slid by 5.06 million barrels, while distillate supplies shrank by 6.13 million, the biggest draw since 2004, according to people familiar with the data, who asked not to be named because the information isn't public.At least 13 fuel-making plants from Louisiana to Montana, including the largest U.S. refinery operated by Motiva Enterprises in Texas, are postponing autumn maintenance for weeks or months, according to company statements and people familiar with the situations. Some plants are churning out more fuel to take advantage of strong profit margins, while others are understaffed because workers were dispatched to help Gulf Coast facilities restart after Hurricane Harvey.
"
129,ICE,"Oil closed at its highest in five weeks after the International Energy Agency and OPEC improved their outlooks for demand.Futures gained 2.2% in New York. The IEA sees global oil demand rising this year by the most since 2015, while OPEC boosted projections for consumption in Europe and China. Plus, the cartel and its allies are said to be considering an extension of their output-cut deal. In the U.S., refineries are set to process more crude as they come back online after Hurricane Harvey led gasoline inventories to tumble the most on record last week.The IEA's stronger demand estimate have helped lift oil prices, Matthew Beck, managing director of a $8 billion oil and natural gas bond and private-equity portfolio at John Hancock Financial Services Inc. in Boston, said by phone. At the same time, ""there has been a fair bit of OPEC rhetoric in the market the last few days of potentially extending cuts and focusing on reducing exports, which would all be positive.""Oil in New York has closed below $50 a barrel since July as efforts to drain a global glut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and partners including Russia confront rising shale output. One option that OPEC and its allies are considering is a six-month extension to supply curbs from the end of March, according to a person familiar with the matter.Compliance with the cartel's deal to reduce production was 94 percent in August, up from a revised 85% in July.""It looks like we are turning the corner,"" Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, said by phone. ""There's more of a bullish mood out there.""West Texas intermediate for October delivery rose $1.07 to settle at $49.30 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 15% above the 100-day average.The S&P 500 Energy Index climbed as much as 1.3%.Brent for November settlement increased 89 cents to end the session at $55.16 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange., the highest level since April. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $5.41 to November WTI.Brent's large premium over the U.S. benchmark ""is the most telling signal that U.S. crude oil markets need more time to return to normal in the wake of Hurricane Harvey,"" IHS Markit said in a note Wednesday.OPEC members are discussing prolonging their production cuts ahead of a ministerial meeting scheduled for late November in Vienna, with a three-month extension seen as the minimum, the people said. The duration will depend on multiple variables, including the level of compliance, the pace of the output recovery in Libya and Nigeria, U.S. shale supply and the strength of global demand.Amid refinery disruptions, nationwide gasoline stockpiles slid by 8.43 million to 218.3 million barrels last week, the lowest level since December 2015, a report Wednesday from the Energy Information Administration showed. At the same time, crude inventories climbed by 5.89 million barrels to 468.2 million, while refinery utilization sank. Cushing, Okla., supplies rose by the most since March, while oil production climbed by the most since 2012.""Storage data is going to continue to be choppy, as it was this week, for the next few weeks,"" Beck said. ""We expect crude prices to be stuck in somewhat of a holding pattern until we have Gulf Coast refineries brought back to full capacity.""

130,ICE,"Oil topped $62 a barrel for the first time since May 2015 after U.S. crude stockpiles shrank by the most since the summer driving season.Futures rose as much as 0.9% in New York. American crude inventories slipped by 7.42 million barrels last week as refiners boosted operating rates to the highest level in more than a decade, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. Stored crude supplies have been dwindling for seven straight weeks and the scope of last week's withdrawal surprised analysts.""The crude oil inventory number was pretty healthy relative to consensus,"" Brian Kessens, who helps manage $16 billion in energy assets at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC, said by telephone. ""People are optimistic that there are some tailwinds behind the underlying crude oil price.""Oil is hovering near $62 in New York and a settlement above that mark would be the first time since December 2014. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia are working to reduce global inventories and price levels have also been boosted by concerns over the stability of the group's third-biggest producer, Iran. Meanwhile, in the U.S., crude output rose last week.West Texas Intermediate for February delivery jumped 42 cents to $62.05 a barrel at 11:37 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest intraday level since May 2015.Brent for March settlement advanced 12 cents to $67.96 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $6.08 to March WTI.U.S. crude inventories fell to 424.5 million barrels last week, while distillate supplies climbed by about 8.9 million barrels, the most since December 2016, the EIA said. U.S. refineries boosted operating rates for a third straight week, contributing to the decline in stored oil supplies.
"
131,ICE,"Oil climbed to the highest level in two and a half years on expectations a U.S. government report will register the longest decline in crude stockpiles since the summer driving season.Futures rose as much as 1.6% in New York, topping $61 a barrel. Oil stored in U.S. tanks and terminals probably dropped for a seventh straight week, according to a survey of analysts. Prices also have been buoyed by almost a week of violent protests in Iran that the nation's Revolutionary Guard Corps on Wednesday said had been brought to heel.""The fundamental backdrop right now is stronger than we've seen in recent memory,"" said Michael Tran, commodities strategist with RBC Capital Markets in New York. ""Prices will likely be able to hang in there this year, due to tightening stockpiles.""Oil has risen for two years running as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers including Russia trimmed supplies to reduce a global glut. Prices will probably trade between $40 and $60 a barrel this year, penned in by rising U.S. shale production, declining but still ample spare supplies and slipping discipline among OPEC members, according to Moody's Investors Service.""The U.S. shale-OPEC tug of war will simultaneously cap upside price potential and downside risks,"" said Stephen Brennock, an analyst at PVM Oil Associates Ltd. in London.West Texas Intermediate for February delivery rose 78 cents to $61.15 a barrel at 10:12 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In earlier trading, the contract touched $61.35, the highest intraday price since June 2015.Brent for March settlement rose 64 cents to $67.21 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange after losing 30 cents on Tuesday. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $6.02 to March WTI.

132,ICE,"Brent crude jumped to its highest level since June 2015 Monday as a key North Sea pipeline shut down.The Forties Pipeline System, one of the most important oil conduits in the world, is to be fully halted after a crack was discovered. Repairs will take about two weeks, according to a spokesman from Ineos, the link's operator. The announcement boosted pricing that had been largely muted over the last week following an OPEC-led agreement by major producers to extend output curbs through the end of 2018. Brent rallied in London, pulling New York futures up to near $58 a barrel.""Brent is ripping,"" said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. ""You really don't have a lot of spare barrels before the supply situation becomes a problem.""The pipeline system feeds crude to the Hound Point export terminal near Edinburgh. The supplies that flow through the link are the single largest constituent part of the Dated Brent grade that helps to settle more than half the world's physical oil prices.Brent for February settlement gained $1.29 to settle at $64.69 barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $6.64 to February West Texas intermediate, the largest premium since early November.The WTI-Brent spread will ""widen and encourage U.S. exports,"" Yawger said, in reference to Brent rising on the Forties' pipeline outage.WTI for January delivery advanced 63 cents to end the session at $57.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level in more than a week. Total volume traded was about 7% below the 100-day average. Prices also received a boost earlier in the session as news broke of an explosion in New York.Following the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision with non-OPEC allies to extend output curbs through the end of 2018, OPEC may draft a strategy in June to end the curbs if the market is no longer oversupplied by then, the UAE's energy minister said Monday. Kuwait's oil minister said Sunday that the group's cuts may end earlier than 2019 if the market rebalances by June, signaling an optimistic outlook on market conditions next year.There is the ""expectation of tighter markets as 2018 unfolds,"" Bart Melek, head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said by phone. ""Certainly at Vienna, they've implied that they will be flexible. If the market rebalances, then we would expect somewhat looser rules.""Yet Russia is keen to end output cuts as early as possible, Issam Almarzooq, the Kuwaiti oil minister who was replaced on Monday, said in Kuwait City on Sunday. OPEC will study an exit strategy at its next meeting in June, and prices should remain near current levels in 2018, Almarzooq said.""Come June, you would have done a year and a half of supply cuts, which means a lot of countries participating are going to be questioning the necessity of pursuing for yet another six months after June because financially it comes at a cost,"" Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA in London, said by phone.

133,ICE,"Life is exhausting — and daily choices are unbearably burdensome — for some Americans who are so comfortably situated that they have the time and means to make themselves morally uncomfortable. They think constantly about what they believe are the global ripples, and hence the moral-cum-political ramifications, of their quotidian decisions. And they are making themselves nervous wrecks.If your anthropological curiosity is aroused, venture to gentrifying Brooklyn, in the spirit of Margaret Mead going among the Samoans. It is not necessary to actually go to Brooklyn. You can observe Karen Kipple's agonies while she drives herself to distraction and her life into a ditch as the protagonist of Lucinda Rosenfeld's novel ""Class."" It is a book with which to begin another school year. The drama swirls around two elementary schools that, because of the vagaries of neighborhood boundaries, are physically proximate but socially miles apart.Karen works for a nonprofit — what else? — and has been ""trying to write"" an op-ed ""for the past two years."" Her daughter, Ruby, attends Constance C. Betts Elementary, which epitomizes Karen's fervent belief that ""racially and economically integrated schools"" are essential to ""equal opportunity."" Still, Karen is vaguely troubled because Ruby's class ""completed the same study unit on (Martin Luther King) four years in a row. Ruby could even recite the date he'd married Coretta (June 18, 1953). At Betts, it sometimes seemed to Karen that every month was Black History Month — except when it was Latino History Month. In keeping with the new Common Core curriculum, Ruby had recently written an 'informative text,' as essays were now known, on Cesar Chavez's advocacy on behalf of Latino migrant workers.""""Over the past several weeks,"" Ruby's teacher tells a parents' meeting, ""your awesome kids have been busy creating their own amazing community."" The parents, however, are problems, including some white mothers, ""new to the school and likely soon to depart it, who were constantly complaining about how the milk served in the cafeteria came from hormone-treated cows"" rather than from ""aseptic eight-ounce cartons of organic vanilla milk"" suitable to wash down seaweed snacks.Karen knows that ""the outsize importance"" that people like her place on food has ""become a dividing line between the social classes, with the Earth Day-esque ideals of the 1960s having acquired snob appeal."" Karen, who favors single-origin organic coffee from Burundi, takes Ruby to the artisanal ice cream shop with flavors such as Maple Fennel, and no corn syrup. When Ruby, pausing over her organic Applegate turkey sandwich on European rye, pronounces a classmate's lunch — white bread sandwich, Cheetos, grape soda — ""disgusting,"" Karen frets that in her effort to simultaneously save ""both the health of her daughter and that of the planet"" she has produced ""a hideous food snob.""Ruby became such at her mother's knee. Karen has one of her tsunamis of disapproval when another mother brings to a playdate chocolate-chip cookies with embedded Reese's Pieces. ""Dark visions of polyunsaturated cooking oil"" addled Karen's head. Her adherence to the ""urban-farming movement"" — evidently there is one — is strained by a restaurant offering ""pan-seared locally sourced pigeon.""Reluctant to disadvantage her daughter because of her own progressivism, Karen lies about her residential address in order to sneak Ruby into a school that is less diverse than Betts but more financially flush, thanks to more affluent parents -- the kind who arrange playdates by saying, ""Have your nanny text our nanny."" Karen is, however, a virtuoso of guilt, and to assuage hers she embezzles money from the new school and mails it to Betts. By the time her lies and stealing are revealed, she realizes that her ""negativity was like a wisteria vine that, if left to its own devices, would creep into every last crevice of her conscience."" So she returns Ruby to Betts, leaving behind the school where ""the experimental puppeteering troupe Stringtheory is performing a kid-friendly version of 'Schindler's List.'""Rosenfeld's novel is a glimpse of how arduous life is for progressives, bowed as they are beneath the crushing weight of every choice's immense social significance. Convinced that people, like the planet, are frightfully fragile — vulnerable to ingesting refined flour and countless other dangers — it's no wonder progressives want a caring government to superintend our lives. This is for our own good, so they are, in their meddlesome way, nice. They also are tuckered out by their incontinent conscientiousness, so take one to lunch, if you can think of something he or she will eat.

134,ICE,"Oil edged higher as OPEC was said to be considering an extension of production caps beyond their March expiration and U.S. crude refiners accelerated their post-hurricane recovery.Futures climbed 0.3% in New York. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies may keep output cuts in place well into the second half of next year, according to people familiar with the matter. U.S. refineries hobbled by Hurricane Harvey more than two weeks ago continued to make progress on resuming normal operations, boosting demand for oil.OPEC potentially extending cuts is ""bullish in the sense that they are willing to do it, but it's effectively bearish that they have to,"" Kyle Cooper, director of research at IAF Advisors in Houston, said by phone. ""You've got refineries still in the process of coming back.""West Texas intermediate for October delivery added 16 cents to settle at $48.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

""If you look at flat price, it has gone nowhere over the last month-and-a-half to two months.""U.S. crude stockpiles likely rose by 4.82 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey ahead of Energy Information Administration data scheduled to be released Wednesday. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will release its inventory data on Tuesday.

135,ICE,"Oil advanced as the market shrugged off Hurricane Irma's effect on demand, with the Texas Gulf Coast repairing itself after Harvey.Crude jumped 1.2% in New York. Gulf Coast refiners hit by Harvey have managed to get most plants back on their feet in a region that processes about half the nation's crude. Gasoline futures, meanwhile, declined amid concerns that demand would weaken as Irma, now a tropical storm, continues to roll north through Florida.""From a technical basis, support held at $47. That continues to be a critical level,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund, in a phone interview. ""At this point, there is an expected hit to gasoline demand from Hurricane Irma in Florida, but we are hearing that the infrastructure isn't as bad off as feared.""Recovery from Harvey remains a bigger concern for the oil market than Irma, according to Goldman Sachs Group. Fuel producers in Texas are still working to restore normal operation at some plants, including the nation's largest refinery operated by Motiva Enterprises. But others such as Citgo Petroleum, Marathon Petroleum and Flint Hills Resources have resumed crude processing.The price move higher also ""reflects a little more confidence that the refiners are recovering,"" James Williams, president of London, Arkansas-based energy researcher WTRG Economics, said by phone. Still, the oil market may continue to chop around as there is some lingering uncertainty as to how much crude is actually being processed by these refiners, he said.West Texas intermediate for October delivery rose 59 cents to settle at $48.07 barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

138,ICE,"Bitcoin began 2017 trading under $1,000. Then it got much bigger. Investors big and small arrived, sometimes bailed hard — as they did on Friday — then arrived some more. Concerns were raised that Bitcoin barely qualified as money. Concerns were raised that its immense transaction volumes were swallowing up the world's energy. Comparisons to Dutch tulip mania piled up, and a securities regulator in December said ""We've seen mortgages being taken out to buy Bitcoin.""X Which all leads to one question for 2018: Is there any chance Bitcoin's jagged, face-melting run for the stratosphere might become a bit tamer?The advent of Bitcoin futures from Cboe (CBOE), CME Group (CME) and, eventually, Nasdaq (NDAQ), has the potential to reel Bitcoin back into orbit. A Bitcoin ETF in 2018? Certainly not impossible. Greater attention from regulators could help inform investors and stamp out fraud.After a week of some moderation on spot market, volatility has roared back in recent days. Shares of Bitcoin-related stocks like Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Marathon Patent Group (MARA) and Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) are also seeing big daily moves, while companies looking to rebrand themselves with blockchain such as Long Island Iced Tea (LTEA) and Net Element (NETE) keep jumping in. And other cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum and Litecoin, have shot up in price recently.But most big banks are unlikely, for now, to gorge on the tulips, and it's still debatable whether treating Bitcoin like a normal investment will make it behave like one. Others wonder if investors are prepared for the more complicated world of investing next year that the futures will bring — to a market where 40% of all Bitcoins are reportedly in the possession of 1,000 holders who could, on a whim, lop thousands of dollars off its price.""So, someone who put in $10,000 now has $2 million in his account — does he know how to protect it when trading might go against him?"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, a managing director at financial analytics firm S3 Partners.IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies a speculator's game? Individual investors should be extremely cautious about diving into this new area. Read this feature about Bitcoin risks and potential gains.Those questions were perhaps underscored on Friday, when Bitcoin's price crumbled below $12,000, then picked up another $1,000 later in the day, after a week of warnings from financial officials abroad and worries about possible insider trading. Bitcoin futures contracts from Cboe and CME were tracking close to the price of Bitcoin itself.Futures contracts will allow investors to wager on whether Bitcoin's price will rise or fall without owning the cryptocurrency directly. If more investors, possibly anticipating a bubble, use the futures to bet on a drop in Bitcoin, that might help tap the brakes on cryptocurrency's feverish price increases, the reasoning goes.That short-selling would also allow investors to hedge against their long bets on Bitcoin and make plays in the market more easily.""So if I bought Bitcoin at $200, and it's trading at $15,000, I might want to hedge out some of that without actually selling my Bitcoin,"" Dusaniwsky said. ""And this might be much easier with futures, to get in and out of that position intraday.""The contracts would also have trading and price limits, and could open a pathway for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund that would trade on the stock market — a development Dusaniwsky said was likely in 2018. Cboe this filed with the SEC to list six Bitcoin ETFs. The more securities available overall, the more opportunity to short. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the company that owns the New York Stock Exchange, also wants to offer a Bitcoin ETF.The massive retail brokerage TD Ameritrade (AMTD) said this month that it will let some clients trade Cboe's Bitcoin futures, and rival E-Trade Financial (ETFC) followed days later. Also this month, Interactive Brokers (IBKR) said it would allow customers to make some bets against those futures.Last week, there were some indications that short-sellers may have moved in and tempered the markets. Bloomberg reported at that time that the price of Cboe's Bitcoin futures, which cost up to 13% more than Bitcoin itself, had over a few days drifted much closer to the spot price of the cryptocurrency.But not everyone is convinced that Bitcoin futures will mellow out cryptocurrency markets.""While the futures markets help bring traditional financial institutions into the space, they do encourage speculation rather than owning the underlying asset and are unlikely to dampen volatility,"" Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research, said in an email, noting that a Bitcoin ETF or mutual fund would instead be more helpful in easing volatility.Any short-sellers would also be betting against a cryptocurrency whose price has ballooned more than 1,300% since the beginning of 2017. While short-selling seems likely, there might not be as much of it as many are anticipating.""Number 1, short-sellers aren't gluttons for punishment,"" Dusaniwsky said. ""With Bitcoin going up $1,000 a day some days, I don't see these guys jumping into the short side, just doing outright short positions, on a whim.""Financial institutions might be fine with letting their customers make futures trades, but the big banks are largely staying away from doing it themselves.But Goldman Sachs (GS) is setting up a trading desk for cryptocurrencies and hopes to have it running by the end of June, sources told Bloomberg Thursday.That would make Goldman the first of Wall Street's top trading firms to jump into the crypto-mania. Peers like Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) are waiting to see what what happens.Bitcoin futures are too new and too small, with too little regulatory underpinning, for the banks to get into right now, said CFRA analyst Ken Leon before the Goldman news broke.The volatile cryptocurrency isn't exactly fodder for banks' wealth management divisions, either. Banks, who have tried to detox from the high-risk investments that battered them during the financial crisis, would also have to calculate the potential loss risk of any asset tied to Bitcoin.""I wouldn't expect to see JPMorgan (JPM) involved anytime soon,"" said Clyde Tinnen, a corporate-finance partner at the law firm Withers Bergman, which advises clients on cryptocurrency markets.But hedge funds are getting in the game. Fortress Investment Group and Horizon Kinetics have purchased Bitcoin recently, while executives from firms like Quantbot Technologies and Steven Cohen's Cubist Systematic Strategies recently met to discuss how they could profit from cryptocurrencies, according to the Wall Street Journal.Still, as Bitcoin's price has scorched higher, and as startup entrepreneurs attach the ""crypto"" prefix to whatever's trending, the Securities and Exchange Commission has started to notice. The agency in December stopped at least two initial coin offerings — a form of digital fundraising — that it deemed suspicious or in violation of securities laws.The SEC has also issued advice to investors to avoid getting conned, and even urged caution when considering celebrities' promotions of things like ICOs — an announcement that came after Floyd Mayweather, Jr., Paris Hilton and a few others have thrown their support behind them. ""Any celebrity or other individual who promotes a virtual token or coin that is a security must disclose the nature, scope, and amount of compensation received in exchange for the promotion,"" the agency warned in November, later adding that those celebrity endorsers ""often do not have sufficient expertise to ensure … compliance with federal securities laws.""But as Bitcoin exchanges strain under the weight of more interest and more serious money, disputes among developers over how best to speed transactions through the network seem likely to resurface in 2018.Disagreement over how to proceed has led two ""fork"" currencies that have formed out of Bitcoin: Bitcoin Cash, in August, and Bitcoin Gold, in October. Those cryptocurrencies use different algorithms and equipment and have different sizes of the blocks of code that store transaction information.As that debate goes on, or as Bitcoin's price drifts out of reach, investors could turn their attention to lower-profile, lower-drama currencies such as Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin and others.""Some of them could even gain advantage in the future by offering better compliance with regulatory requirements,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a research note in December.As more people have piled into Bitcoin, the doubt from bigger names in the financial world has built up on a daily basis. Most recently, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said Bitcoin's presence in the payments landscape was still very small. But she said, as others have, that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" UBS' global chief economist called Bitcoin the ""bubble to end all bubbles"". Brian Armstrong, the co-counder and CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, said in a December blog post: ""Please invest responsibly.""""Most of the investors that I talk to, they look at Bitcoin truly as a commodity,"" Tinnen said, adding that they tend to guard against the cryptocurrency's occasional stabs downward with defensive investments elsewhere. ""I have to say that they are very enthusiastic, and sometimes that enthusiasm means that they are not always taking as clear-eyed a view as they should in order to hedge it.""Others, Dusaniwsky said, might not be the kind of traders you typically see on the stock market. They might not be familiar with the investment vehicles that are coming into the market. They might not know how to use, say, stop-loss orders, he said, or otherwise trade their positions more professionally, if the up-market this year heads south.""You've got a lot of sheep that are long Bitcoin,"" he said, ""and the wolves might be starting to get into the market.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:SEC Has This Advice For Investors In Bitcoin, Other CryptocurrenciesBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

139,ICE,"Crude rose Thursday after one of the most-influential voices in world oil markets issued mixed signals about the direction of supply and demand.X Futures closed 0.8% higher in New York. The International Energy Agency increased its forecast for 2018 production by nations outside the OPEC cartel even as it expressed confidence the Saudi Arabia-led group will significantly curb a global oversupply. Traders were also confronted with swelling U.S. gasoline stockpiles amid a four-week slide in American crude inventories.""You've got a mixed bag of data, frankly,"" said Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. The U.S. supply tally ""was pretty bullish for crude, but you are seeing this really impressive build in gasoline.""The U.S. benchmark has averaged more than $57 since the end of November, when the Organization of Petroleum Countries, along with Russia and other major suppliers, agreed to extend production curbs through the end of 2018. Crude inventories in developed nations, the cartel's key metric for assessing oversupply, have fallen to their lowest level since July 2015, the IEA said. In the North Sea, an important source of crude, Ineos Group declared force majeure on its Forties Pipeline System after discovering a hairline crack that forced it to halt oil shipments.The Paris-based IEA's decision to lift its supply forecast means ""near term, markets look a little bit more bearish,"" Michael Loewen, a commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said by phone. Yet ""longer term, 2018 looks much more compelling than even 2017 did in terms of balancing.""West Texas intermediate for January delivery rose 44 cents to settle at $57.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Brent for February settlement added 87 cents to end the session at $63.31 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $6.23 to February WTI.""On our current outlook, 2018 may not necessarily be a happy new year for those who would like to see a tighter market,"" the IEA, which advises most major nations on energy policy, said in its report on Thursday. ""Total supply growth could exceed demand growth.""Goldman Sachs said big oil companies will find themselves with a surplus of cash in 2018, while the latest U.S. government data showed domestic weekly crude production at a record 9.78 million barrels a day. Gasoline stockpiles jumped by 5.66 million barrels last week to the highest level since September.

140,ICE,"Climate Change: It's a heart-rending video: The National Geographic tape shows a plainly starving, shockingly thin polar bear rummaging for food. It's near death. The tragic scene went viral on the internet.""When scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what it looks like,"" said SeaLegacy photographer Paul Nicklen, whose video of the bear was later shared online by National Geographic.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveAnd, of course, the media wasted no time in fixing blame: global warming.The New York Times came right out and said it: ""Experts and environmentalists say the broad answer — however controversial and nuanced it may be — is to reduce the present levels of global greenhouse gas emissions in order to curb global warming. In January, federal wildlife officials issued a report that called climate change the biggest threat to the survival of the polar bear.""Not to be outdone, Britain's leftist The Guardian newspaper laid it on thick: ""Video footage captured in Canada's Arctic has offered a devastating look at the impact climate change is having on polar bears in the region, showing an emaciated bear clinging to life as it scrounged for food on iceless land.""Cristina Mittermeier, co-founder of SeaLegacy, the group that actually shot the footage of the starving bear, called the video the ""face of climate change"" in an Instagram post.X Unfortunately, the global warming guilt-mongering by the media and their allies in the green movement is almost entirely false.Both the media accounts above and several others noted the lack of ice. But the area in question where the polar bear was wandering lacks ice every year at that time. They call it ""summer."" So the lack of ice proves nothing, other than the utter tendentiousness of what passes today for environmental reporting.The fact is, polar bears get diseases like parasites and cancer just like any other animal — or humans, for that matter. The bear in question is plainly starving, but it's not clear why.It's important to note, however, that starvation is a leading cause of death among polar bears, especially the old and the young. Though they have no real predatory enemies, they can be outfought for food by bigger, more robust bears.Even the National Geographic, which put out the video, was somewhat circumspect in its conclusion about the bear, noting, ""As a whole, polar bear populations around the world are not in immediate peril.""Nor are polar bears in peril where the starving bear was filmed, on Baffin Island.As the Canadian Post noted, ""According to data collected by the federal government, polar bears along the entire west coast of Baffin Island are 'stable.' On the southeastern side of the island (around the Nunavut capital of Iqaluit) polar bears have even experienced a 'likely increase.' It's only on the island's northeastern corner — in a management area that meets Greenland — that polar bears are suspected to be in decline.""This is not science, nor is it documenting the ""effects"" of climate change as some would have it. It's mere green propaganda.""One starving bear is not evidence of climate change, despite gruesome photos,"" wrote Susan Crockford, a zoologist, on her website ""Polar Bear Science.""It should be noted that in other countries with significant polar bear populations, including Norway and Russia, polar bear populations are increasing. On Norway's Svalbard Island, for instance, the Norwegian Polar Institute reported a 42% increase from 2004 to 2015. Russia also reports increases.A far cry from mass starvation of polar bears due to global warming.This is an old trick of the environmentalists, who long ago discovered that people care a lot about so-called ""charismatic mega-fauna"" like whales, polar bears, lions and the like. So as soon as they get their hands on a heartbreaking video like this one, they exploit it to its maximum potential.Like everyone else, we felt sympathy for the stricken bear. But it's both dishonest and wrong to exploit a dying animal for your political cause — especially one that would involve a massive change in the global economy, increased poverty and thousands of human deaths just to reduce the Earth's temperature by a few thousandths of a degree.RELATED:Another Global Warming Study Casts Doubt On Media's Climate Change Fairy Tale The Global Warming Thought Police Want Skeptics In Jail Global Warming: Who Are The Deniers Now? Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

141,ICE,"Oil declined as a jump in gasoline supplies held in U.S. storage tanks suggested refiners may not need to process as much crude going forward.Futures declined as much as 2.4% in New York to a two-week low. American gasoline inventories rose by 6.78 million barrels last week, the steepest rise since late January, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday.The gasoline build exceeded the estimates of every analyst in a Bloomberg survey and overshadowed a third weekly slide in crude stockpiles.Although U.S. gasoline stockpiles typically expand at this time of year, last week's increase was ""a bigger number than people were looking for,"" Craig Bethune, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management, said by telephone. ""Can't hide from that.""U.S. refineries boosted operating rates for a seventh straight week, the federal data showed, contributing to the excess supplies shunted into storage.Oil topped $59 a barrel last month for the first time since mid 2015 as production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers such as Russia chewed into a worldwide glut. U.S. shale explorers have been a thorn in the side of the OPEC-led coalition, boosting output on an almost-weekly basis all year long.West Texas Intermediate for January delivery fell $1.25 to $56.37 a barrel at 11:19 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 18% below the 100-day average.Brent for February settlement dipped $1.22 to $61.64 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $5.28 to February WTI.Gasoline futures declined as much as 3.2% to $1.6635 a gallon, the lowest intraday level since late October.U.S. gasoline stockpiles rose to 220.9 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 1, the EIA data showed. Crude production also crept higher in the data, climbing for a seventh week.Meanwhile, inventories at the key pipeline hub in Cushing, Okla., declined to the lowest since November 2015.

142,ICE,"Oil posted its longest streak of monthly gains since early 2016 after an OPEC-led coalition of major crude producers followed through on a long-awaited extension of supply cuts.Futures were poised to finish November with a 5% gain in New York. The price was little changed after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries reached a deal with allies such as Russia on Thursday to extend output curbs to the end of next year. The accord involves nations that pump roughly 60% of the globe's crude.""The market is getting most of what it expected,"" Rob Haworth, who helps oversee $150 billion in assets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle, said by telephone. ""Even though they are extending, they are doing it cautiously.""Oil has rallied about 18% since the last time producers gathered for an official meeting back in late May. OPEC has ""come a long way"" toward eroding a worldwide oil glut, Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said before start of the producer meeting in Vienna. ""We must continue to work in unison and stay the course,"" he said at the beginning of Thursday's meeting. An exit strategy won't be discussed before the third quarter, according to Al-Falih.Two important suppliers that were exempt from the first round of output limits — Libya and Nigeria — have agreed to a collective cap, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said. Although delegates said the cartel agreed to review the deal at its next meeting in June, Zanganeh said that wasn't the case.West Texas Intermediate for January delivery slipped 7 cents to $57.23 a barrel at 11:54 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier falling to as low as $56.82 a barrel.Brent for January settlement, which expires Thursday, rose 32 cents to $63.43 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. Brent traded at a premium of $6.22 to January WTI. The more-active February contract declined 19 cents to $62.34.""It's not a clean nine-month extension, so that's going to hurt their efforts, at least price-wise in the short-term,"" John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund, said in a telephone interview. ""It appears they are going to revisit everything here in June.""'

143,ICE,"Buying right is important, but it's where you sell that determines your bottom line.Have you ever heard a speaker or an attendee at an IBD seminar remark that selling a stock is a lot tougher than buying one? Maybe someone said something like that in the bar, at the gym, or during a cocktail party. It's true.IBD's TAKE: New IBD readers can quickly improve their results simply by following this one rule. IBD calls it the golden rule.X Since its founding in 1984, Investor's Business Daily has been on a mission to make its readers more successful in the game of equities. When it comes to selling a stock to cut losses, IBD could not be any clearer. Always exit a stock when it falls 7% to 8% below your purchase price. No ifs, no ands, no buts.  The reason is simple; the stock is simply not behaving how you expected it. Accept the loss quickly, and you save your capital to invest again at a better time or in a better company.How about when it comes to selling your winners to lock in gains, big or small? IBD categorizes profit-taking sell rules into two types: offense-style (or selling on the way up) and defense-style (when a stock is falling sharply).Today, we will tackle a defense-style sell signal: locking in profits on the day that a stock makes its biggest single-session point decline during a long advance.It's nice to be able to sell into strength, but human emotions often get in the way. They make the act of selling more complicated. How do you fight this complexity? You follow more smart, time-tested rules.Investors need to have a concrete exit strategy, or be resigned to watch hard-earned gains disappear fast. So consider at least selling some shares if your stock suffers its largest one-day point loss since breaking out from a base.After a long advance of many weeks or months, this negative action often signals that the stock has topped. If accompanied by other signs of weak price action, then you'll have more valid reasons to sell and lock in your profits.A dramatic single-day point loss tells you two things. First, some large shareholders are unabashedly taking profits. A biggest one-day point loss in above-normal turnover is especially worrisome: This tells you that some institutions, such as mutual funds and hedge funds, are dumping their holdings.Second, it represents a change in the stock's character. David Landry, an author and money manager, puts it this way: If someone who's usually mean to you suddenly starts treating you really nice, be wary. The change in character may mean that something is up.An easy way to check for a biggest one-day point drop is by eyeballing stock charts.On an IBD chart at Investors.com, if you place your cursor on a specific price bar and then hold down the left button, the exact point change will show up in a small pop-up window. Just make sure you're looking at a daily time frame and not a weekly. You can also do this with MarketSmith, which requires a separate subscription.The Big Picture, intraday market updates and other columns in IBD will alert you to stocks that have suffered their biggest daily point losses. Use the Stocks On The Move table to track big moves down in heavy volume among leaders.IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), nicknamed ICE, cleared an 88.97 buy point in a flat base Nov. 14, 2006 (1). The fast-growing derivatives exchange operator came public just a year earlier. It owned solid IBD Ratings at the time of its breakout, too: Composite 99, Earnings Per Share 96 and Relative Price Strength 97.By February 2007, the stock had bolted 88%. On Feb. 21, it hit an all-time high intraday (2), but finished little changed as volume grew from the prior session. This marked stalling, or bearish action.On Feb. 27, ICE gapped down and dived nearly 13 points — the biggest one-day point loss since its Nov. 14 breakout (3). Six sessions later, the stock sliced its 50-day moving average (drawn in red in the chart above) in the heaviest volume since the start of the move (4).In some cases, a stock will pierce its 50-day line, hover below it for a few days, then rebound higher to resume its climb. When you have a large paper gain in such a stock, you can afford to give it a little more leeway, then decide to hold or fold.As seen in ICE's chart, the stock attempted a rally the very next day after violating the 50-day moving average, but the rebound fell flat. By March 26, ICE melted to as low as 119.42, 28% below its February peak.(A version of this column originally appeared in the Jan. 6, 2011, edition of IBD.)RELATED:When To Sell A Good Stock I: Sometimes Multiple Signals Occur All At OnceWhen To Sell A Good Stock II: Watch For Dramatic Weakness Among The Industry LeadersHow Do You Spot Key Market Tops?

144,ICE,"Economics: Florida grocery store shelves were empty and 40% of the gas stations in Miami were out of gas in advance of Hurricane Irene. But at least no one is price gouging, right?Florida, like other states, has a price-gouging law that bans retailers from jacking up prices for food, water, ice, petroleum products and other products during a state-declared state of emergency. Someone caught selling at prices that ""grossly exceed"" the average over the previous 30 days faces second-degree misdemeanor charges.By Thursday morning, the state's attorney general's office had received more than 3,000 complaints accusing stores of breaking that law.Airlines also came under attack for jacking up airfares out of Florida. Amazon was blasted for allegedly raising the price for water deliveries into the state.Such things are always treated with universal disdain and the perpetrators accused of unshackled greed. Thus the laws against gouging.But while Florida's price-gouging law might help protect residents from high prices during an emergency, it can't protect them from the immutable laws of economics.Whatever the intent of these price-gouging prohibitions, the result is always the same: rampant shortages. That's because they are, in effect, government-imposed price caps. And price caps always produce shortages.So, while Florida tries to stamp out price gouging, its grocery stores' shelves are empty, and gas stations are running out of gas.See How To Quickly Find The Best Stocks To Buy And WatchBottled water is now a precious commodity in parts of Florida. The Miami Herald noted that one couple with a small child spent hours looking for water in the Miami Shores area. Retailers are now rationing water. Publix, a large grocery chain in the state, had imposed a four-case per family limit at many of its stores. Lines form outside stores in the morning in hopes of new supplies.In South Florida, the line for gas at a Citgo station stretched out into U.S. 1. Drivers have been tailgating gas trucks to see where they go. Police are standing guard at some stations to keep order.How much would those people — who are spending a lot in time and money searching of water and gasoline — be willing to pay to have them readily available? Probably a lot more than retailers are allowed to charge.The truth is that while jacking up prices during an emergency seems unethical, it can be the best way to deal with an emergency situation. High prices not only discourage hoarders, they also send up a flare to suppliers to rush more into production and bring more into the region.This is economics 101. People might grumble about the cost, and post pictures on Facebook to cries of shame, but at least they can get the stuff.Unfortunately, rather than explain this reality, and the inescapable trade-offs involved with price controls, politicians and the press are content to play on people's ignorance.As George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen noted, ""price gouging, despite its obnoxious-sounding name, is usually the best of a set of bad alternatives.""RELATED:If You're Focused On The Government's Response To Harvey, You're Looking In The Wrong DirectionHarvey Will Boost GDP?

145,ICE,"Oil barely budged on Thursday as doubts linger over the restart of refineries that are flickering back to life in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.Futures ended the session in New York near a four-week high after the resumption of some plants on the Gulf Coast of Texas drove a rally of about 7% in four days. While millions of barrels of fuel-making capacity have been restored, the resumption of several key plants is still uncertain. Reaction to a government report showing an anticipated jump in U.S. crude stockpiles was muted.The Gulf Coast is recovering and there doesn't seem to be significant damage to infrastructure, but ""there are a lot of unknowns,"" Kyle Cooper, director of research at IAF Advisors in Houston, said by phone. ""I think people now are just sitting on the sidelines.""After slamming into the Texas coast 13 days ago and drenching thousands of square miles with record-breaking rains, Harvey left key U.S. refineries, ports and pipelines out of service or operating at drastically reduced rates. Refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO) and Citgo Petroleum have swiftly resumed operations at Texas plants, but Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA)'s Deer Park refinery on the Houston Ship Channel remains shut.U.S. crude inventories increased by 4.58 million barrels last week to 462.4 million, the most since March, according to Energy Information Administration data released Thursday. Imports into the U.S. Gulf Coast region fell to the lowest in records going back to 1990. Gasoline stockpiles slid by 3.2 million barrels to 226.7 million, the largest decline since mid-July. Crude production tumbled by the most since 2012.As refineries shut due to Harvey, ""you knew that there was going to be a build as it related to crude oil,"" said Brian Kessens, a managing director and portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors, who helps manage $16 billion in energy-related assets. ""We'll be able to get a better sense of the numbers over the next couple of weeks.""West Texas intermediate for October delivery fell 7 cents to settle at $49.09 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 5% above the 100-day average.Brent for November settlement gained 29 cents to end the session at $54.49 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $4.96 to November WTI.Hurricane Irma, a Category 5 storm that is forecast to hit Florida Sunday, battered Puerto Rico after slashing across a chain of small Caribbean islands.

146,ICE,"Climate Change: We keep hearing the ""science is settled,"" yet once again data emerge showing that there has been no appreciable warming now for 19 years. Memo to global warming advocates: People are starting to notice.Of course, it is pretty clear from the record that temperatures have risen in the past 150 years or so. But that should hardly be surprising, given that the period lasting into the early 19th century was known as the ""Little Ice Age.""But more recently, alarms were sounded over the rise in 2015 and 2016 of global temperatures, even though the rise was a result of a temporary phenomenon — the ""El Nino"" effect of warming seawaters in the Pacific that create higher temperatures and weather disruptions around the world.As Christopher Booker of the Sunday Telegraph in Britain noted this week, after being repeatedly warned about 2016 being ""the hottest year on record,"" we now have arrived at this: ""In recent months global temperatures have plummeted by more than 0.6 degrees: just as happened 17 years ago after a similarly strong El Nino.""By the way, those temperature readings are courtesy of satellites, which provide the most comprehensive and accurate temperature readings of all. Many of the scariest headlines come from far more limited, and localized, temperature readings, which can be deceptive.Scare headlines about disappearing arctic ice are similarly being shown as overblown if not outright false. The Danish Meteorological Institute reports that since December Arctic temperatures have pretty much been below -20 degrees Celsius. Arctic ice and the Greenland ice cap are both expanding, not shrinking.Knowing this, it pays to be skeptical of model-based data — not actual measured ones — that suggest a need to spend massive amounts of money to keep a purely hypothetical threat from taking place. It makes no sense.We've been told that the world will have to spend 2% of GDP, or roughly $1.5 trillion each year, to keep the threat of global warming at bay — even though estimates show that even if everything requested by the Paris Climate Change Accord were done, the effect on global climate would be negligible.What's galling is that, thanks to the fracking revolution, the U.S. is already sharply cutting its emissions of CO2. In February, the American Interest noted that ""U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions hit a 25-year low the first six months of 2016, continuing the progress that the EPA says we made in 2015.""So, temperatures and the output of CO2 are both falling? Meanwhile, recent reporting suggests the models on which the supposed global warming ""science"" is based have turned out to be highly questionable, unable to predict even past warming — something a model is supposed to be able to do.As we noted recently, since the 1997 Kyoto Accord, U.S. output of greenhouse gases has plummeted 7.3%, despite U.S. GDP growing by 52% during that time. Our greenhouse gas footprint is shrinking, not growing. Meanwhile, nations such as China and India that are boosting their output of greenhouse gases dramatically remain untouched by any of the recent anti-global warming agreements — including the damaging one that Obama agreed to in Paris in late 2015, but never submitted to the Senate for approval.Which raises a big question. The Trump administration right now is under intense pressure both here and abroad to remain in Obama's fraudulent Paris climate deal, which, as far as we can tell, is intentionally designed to destroy the U.S. economy and lower Americans' standard of living.Given the bad science and the enormous costs on which the Paris deal is based, why continue to give it any credence at all?President Trump should do himself and the U.S. a favor and withdraw from the Paris deal. As the renewed decline in temperatures shows, the only real threat Americans face is an unholy alliance between global bureaucrats and financially corrupted scientists eager for massive amounts of new spending so that they can stay employed. Time to put them all out of business.RELATED:If Global Warming Is Real, Why Do Government Scientists Have To Keep Cheating?Five Reasons Why Ridicule Is The Proper Response To Global Warming AlarmistsWith Trump, The U.S. Can Escape The Paris Climate Deal TrapIs Global Warming Science Just A Fraud?

147,ICE,"Oil lingered near $46 a barrel as Saudi Arabia and Russia sought to appease growing skepticism that a global supply glut is going away soon.Futures swung between gains and losses in New York on Monday after a rout last week erased the rally following OPEC's deal to cut production in November. Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid Al-Falih, said that while the rebound in U.S. production has slowed OPEC's efforts, the group will likely maintain cuts this year and possibly into 2018. Russia is ready to support extending the oil deal beyond 2017, the nation's Energy Ministry said.""The weak immediate fundamental picture continues to drive prices lower,"" Gene McGillian, manager of market research for Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn., said by phone. Even with Saudi Arabia and Russia discussing a deal extension, it's clear the market is saying it still has yet to see any meaningful effect of the cuts on inventories, he said.Oil is down almost 15% for the year after OPEC-driven optimism fizzled out as shale drillers keep adding rigs and U.S.  production has been rising every week since mid-February. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet May 25 to decide whether to extend supply cuts through the second half of the year.West Texas intermediate for June delivery fell 38 cents to $45.84 a barrel at 12:14 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier rising as much as 1.6%. Total volume traded was about 30% above the 100-day average.Brent for July settlement declined 47 cents to $48.63 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange after climbing as much as 1.7%. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $2.39 to July WTI.Ministers from some OPEC countries have discussed the possibility of deepening their output cuts, yet no consensus has been reached, according to delegates who asked not to be identified.Producers are studying different scenarios for extending the cuts, and Kuwait supports all efforts to stabilize oil markets, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Issam Almarzooq said. The global oil market will soon rebalance and return to a ""healthy state,"" Al-Falih said at the Asia Oil and Gas Conference on Monday.Saudi Arabia's and Russia's comments are ""very minor bullish pressure. If they come up with some kind of formal agreement and other countries sign off on it, that would be more meaningful,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts, said by phone. ""But right now, it's something that hasn't been done and it's still off into the future.""Money managers cut bets on rising WTI prices by 20% in the week ended May 2 to the lowest level since November, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data on Friday.

148,ICE,"Oil closed higher in New York Wednesday after a government report showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell for a third week as refinery demand surged.Crude stockpiles fell 3.64 million barrels to 528.7 million last week, the Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday — more than twice the 1.75-million-barrel decline forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Refineries processed a record amount of crude as they anticipate rising gasoline demand. Crude production and imports climbed as fuel stockpiles surged.""This report is what we've been waiting for,"" said Matt Sallee, who helps manage $17.2 billion in oil-related assets at Tortoise Capital Advisors in Leawood, Kan.

They simply don't have the long-term record of hot tracks that Beyonce, U2, Adele or Katy Perry do.The point? When looking for the best growth companies in which to invest, you don't want ones that are just one- or two-hit wonders.A company might be able to muster one or two quarters of solid bottom-line growth. But it's best to see several years of strong profit growth.Top-notch earnings growth is essential fuel for a high-performance stock. If the company isn't making money year after year, there's virtually no reason for the stock to go up.Before you decide to invest, always see whether your target firms have boosted earnings at respectable rates the past several years.The strong annual earnings growth is the A in CAN SLIM. You don't have to go back 10 or 20 years. IBD checks the past three to five years. Earnings growth should be up at least 25% in each of those years. Some of the market's biggest winners have annual earnings growth of 50%, 100% or higher — and that's before their stocks make big gains!When scouting potential stock investments, insist on those with solid annual profit growth as well as robust quarterly figures.The accompanying table shows current members of the IBD 50 as of Monday's close; all of these names are expected to increase full-year earnings per share by 20% or more.In ""How To Make Money In Stocks,"" IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote, ""It's the combination of strong earnings in the last several quarters plus a record of solid growth in the recent years that creates a superb stock, or at least one with a higher probability of success during an uptrending general market.""In-home nursing care provider Almost Family (AFAM)'s profit grew 56%, 65% and 73% from 2005 to 2007.Despite a tough year for the overall market, Almost Family was one of the best stocks of 2008. It advanced 131%.In April 2005, internet kingpin and Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) bolted out of a cup-with-handle base. It gained more than 60% in three months before settling into another consolidation. Google's annual earnings growth was well above the 25% minimum. From 2002 to 2004, the search engine's profit surged 1,733%, 138% and 92%.And finally, in 2009 Baidu (BIDU) was one of the top-performing stocks that year, gaining 213%.

152,ICE,"What does it say about environmentalists that a stand-up comic made famous in the 1970s by listing seven dirty words you couldn't say on TV has far more insight about the Earth than one of the green movement's most influential leaders?Is there any other conclusion to draw from a recent New York Times op-ed by Bill McKibben headlined ""The Planet Can't Stand This Presidency""?In it, McKibben — who founded 350.org and teaches environmental studies at Middlebury College (where students recently physically attacked libertarian Charles Murray for trying to give a speech) — declares that President Trump poses both an immediate and a permanent threat to the entire planet.""What Mr. Trump is trying to do to the planet's climate will play out over geologic time as well. In fact, it's time itself that he's stealing from us,"" McKibben writes.""We have only a short window to deal with the climate crisis or else we forever lose the chance to thwart truly catastrophic heating. We could,"" he continues, ""put enough carbon in the atmosphere in the next four years to eventually push us past that temperature limit.""But even McKibben ends up tacitly admitting that he's exaggerating what Trump can do, since all he manages to accuse Trump of doing is ""trying to give gas-guzzlers new life,"" ""slashing the money to help poor nations move toward clean energy,"" ""talking about pulling out of the Paris accords,"" and ""slow(ing) the pace at which (solar and wind power) would otherwise grow.""Even if all that ""trying"" and ""talking"" and ""slowing"" were true, it amounts to little more than nothing.What McKibben means by ""giving gas-guzzlers new life"" is that Trump might not stick with President Obama's unrealistic fuel economy mandate, which is slated to hit 54.5 mpg by 2025. Even if it could be implemented, it would take more than a decade to have any real impact on CO2 emissions.And whether U.S. money is slashed or not, poor nations will pump out more CO2 as they claw their way out of poverty. As the Energy Department notes, even with the Paris agreement, CO2 emissions in developing countries are expected to climb 52% from 2012 to 2040 due to ""increases in output per capita coupled with population growth.""Meanwhile, before Trump hit the scene, the nonbinding Paris climate agreement was already showing cracks, with several G-20 nations failing to enact legislation needed to carry their CO2-cutting promises out.And wind and solar? During the Obama administration, the Department of Energy forecast that, under Obama's policies, these two energy sources would supply a grand total of 9% of the nation's energy by …. 2050. Fossil fuels will still account for two-thirds of energy production. And as IBD pointed out recently, Obama's onerous ""Clean Power Plan"" would have made a negligible difference in global CO2 emissions.Is the Earth really that much of a delicate snowflake than it can't withstand such micro-changes in U.S. policies?It is, according to McKibben.He says that thanks to Trump, ""more ice will melt … more permafrost will thaw … species (will) go extinct … nations will be submerged"" …. cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria!OK, McKibben didn't write that last part — that was Dr. Peter Venkman from ""Ghostbusters"" — but all those other calamities are about as likely to occur because of Trump.What McKibben is doing here is just adding a new twist to the old ""point of no return"" warning that environmentalists have been issuing for years, many of which have been passed by. Yet every time the Earth passes one of these ""points of no return,"" environmentalists simply draw a new line a few years further out, making the same claims all over again.So what does any of this have to do with George Carlin, the comedian who famously revealed seven dirty words you can't say on the air?Carlin wasn't a right-winger by any means, but in a lesser-known stand-up bit later in his career, he completely shredded the entire ""save the planet"" crusade that people like McKibben keep pushing.""Save the planet? We don't even know how to take care of ourselves yet. We haven't learned how to care of one another. We're going to save the (expletive deleted) planet?"" Carlin says, just getting warmed up. ""I'm tired of these self-righteous environmentalists, white bourgeois liberals who think the only thing wrong with this country is that there aren't enough bicycle paths.""""Did you ever think about the arithmetic?"" he goes on. ""The planet has been here 4-1/2 billion years. We've been here, what, 100,000, maybe 200,000? And we've only been engaged in heavy industry for a little over 200 years. Two hundred years vs. 4-1/2 billion. And we have the conceit to think that somehow we are a threat? That somehow we are gonna put in jeopardy this beautiful little green ball that's just floating around the sun. The planet has been through a lot worse than us. The planet isn't going anywhere — we are.""There's much more. And if you don't mind the fact that Carlin uses almost all of the seven dirty words on his famous list in this eight-minute rant, it is well worth watching, and then sharing with those end-of-the world environmental evangelists.RELATED:Inconvenient Truths The Earth Day 'March for Science' Protesters Ignore Enviros Freak Over Trump's Climate Change Order, But Will Earth Notice?Memo To Trump: Run, Don't Walk, From The Destructive Paris Climate Treaty

153,ICE,"Oil dropped the most in six weeks after a report showed U.S. gasoline supplies increased for the first time since February, while crude output keeps rising.Gasoline stockpiles climbed 1.54 million barrels last week, surprising analysts surveyed by Bloomberg who projected the Energy Information Administration data would show a 2-million-barrel decrease. Crude inventories fell 1.03 million barrels to 532.3 million, the agency reported Wednesday. Crude production rose to the highest since August 2015. Price drops accelerated as the dollar strengthened against its peers, curbing the appeal of commodities.Oil had rallied above $53 a barrel after some members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries voiced support for prolonging cuts past June, but rising U.S. output is undermining the effort to trim a global glut. Production from major shale plays in May is forecast to climb to the highest level since 2015, according to the EIA.""The glaring rise in U.S. gasoline refined product inventories, in combination with persistent lower-48 production growth, keeps us cautious on oil prices,"" said Chris Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at Macro Risk Advisors in New York. ""We would not buy the intraday dip.""West Texas intermediate for May delivery dropped $1.97, or 3.8%, to settle at $50.44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the biggest decline since March 8 and the lowest close since April 3. Total volume traded was about 30% above the 100-day average.

""Production is up nine straight weeks here to the highest level since August 2015.

""The reasons are twofold: Refinery maintenance is finishing, which is leading to greater processing of crude, and the OPEC cuts are going to finally have an impact on U.S. inventories.""The gain pushed gasoline stockpiles to 237.7 million barrels in the week ended April 14, leaving them 21 million barrels higher than average for the date over the last 10 years.Gasoline futures for May delivery dropped 3% to $1.659 a gallon, the lowest close since March 28.

154,ICE,"Crude fell below $53 a barrel as the ramp-up of shale drilling spurred speculation that surging U.S. output will offset OPEC-led efforts to cut a global supply surplus.Futures dropped 1%. U.S. explorers added 11 rigs last week to cap the longest stretch of gains since 2011, Baker Hughes data show. American crude output climbed to the highest level in more than a year in the week ended April 7, according to the Energy Information Administration. Output at major shale plays is seen rising next month to the highest since November 2015, the EIA said Monday.The expansion in U.S. drilling is damping optimism that had lifted prices above $53 a barrel after some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries expressed support for prolonging production cuts with other nations beyond June. While U.S. crude stockpiles fell from a record, OPEC said Wednesday in a report that rivals in the American shale patch are growing stronger.""The rig count has climbed 32 of the last 36 weeks,"" Stephen Schork, president of Schork Group, a consulting company in Villanova, Pa., said by telephone.

The spread between the current Brent contract and the one for delivery a month later has widened to 52 cents, from 29 cents on April 3. The opposite, a situation known as backwardation, would indicate a more balanced market, which is what OPEC is pursuing.""The steeper contango is a negative signal,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by telephone. ""The OPEC cuts should be supportive, especially for Brent. Instead of moving into backwardation, the contango is growing.""Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said Monday that OPEC members and their allies are showing ""very good"" compliance with the promised output cuts they began making in January.

"
155,ICE,"Amid all of the wrangling and unpredictability surrounding the future of health care, one thing remains certain: 400 pages of burdensome menu-labeling regulations required by the Affordable Care Act are set to take effect on May 5.If the Trump administration does not act soon, these regulations will add millions of confusing signs and labels to retail spaces and cost customers and our economy billions without proving useful. While the government architects of this rule at the Food and Drug Administration may have had noble intentions, one important and basic ingredient was missing from their efforts: common sense.Back in 2010, the FDA was tasked with implementing Section 4205 of the Affordable Care Act, which requires chain restaurants with 20 or more locations to provide calorie information on in-store menus. The goal was to give customers increased access to nutritional information while establishing a single, national, uniform menu-labeling standard, rather than a patchwork of disjointed state and local ordinances.For restaurants that generally have static menus this approach makes sense. After all, the calories of a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese or a Dunkin' Donuts Wake-Up Wrap do not change that much.But not all food service businesses are alike. The FDA applied the rule to grocery and convenience stores, which offer far more varied food offerings. These include many single ingredients and self-serve items not listed on any existing menu or menu board, such as fruits, vegetables and yogurt, and many items prepared on-site daily in store kitchens using available ingredients.The rule requires that all of these items be labeled individually. But take the items at a salad bar or hot-food bar. Calorie counts on individual items in these areas would be difficult to maintain as items are switched and moved throughout the day to match customer demand and store supply.A better approach by the FDA would be to allow grocery and convenience stores the opportunity to use one central sign to provide customers with the required information and simultaneously limit the risk of errors.One particularly egregious part of the rule is the definition of a ""menu."" The FDA so broadly defined what a menu is that grocery circulars, window posters, sidewalk advertisements, signs on top of gasoline pumps, and social media posts — yes, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter activity — might need to be labeled with calorie information as if they are menus.Under the rule, if a store uses a local supplier for an item that is sold is at just a few stores, that supplier would have to provide the store with nutrition analysis, labeling/signage, record keeping (including potentially the recipe), and a signed affidavit in order to sell the product. This compliance burden risks limiting the availability of fresh and local foods and hurting small businesses. These small businesses are already losing contracts as a result of this rule.The rule also fails to account for inherent variations in caloric content when it comes to certain food items. Locations within the same chain may all sell rotisserie chicken, but chickens naturally come in different shapes and sizes and the FDA is saying that the entire chicken has to be labeled if it is hot, but not if it is cooked and then has cooled down.Then there is cut fruit, which has a different nutritional content depending on ripeness. Seven years in, the FDA has not provided guidance on how to deal with these chicken and fruit challenges.Finally, the most chilling aspects of this rule are the possible monetary and criminal penalties, including prison time, on employees who commit accidental errors, as well as the serious threat of frivolous class-action lawsuits. These could result from something as inadvertent as an employee putting a little too much cheese on a sandwich or giving a generous scoop of ice cream.Let employees have the opportunity to correct their mistakes rather than be immediately fined for a violation.Common sense, this is not. And not only is consumers' interest in getting the information in the way they best can use it undermined by this regulation, the costs to businesses are substantial and may impact pricing.Even President Obama's own Office of Management and Budget estimated menu labeling to be the third-most-onerous rule proposed in 2010, requiring more than 14.5 million hours of compliance.And that dramatically underestimated the time, costs, staff burden, and complexity involved. Not only does it take months to formulate compliance plans and send foods to scientific laboratories for calorie and nutrition testing, menus, menu boards and labels will have to be created and then constantly updated. The FDA is throwing innovation and choice out the window.On the cost front, first-year compliance estimates for some 37,000 supermarkets exceed $1 billion. For more than 150,000 convenience stores, compliance costs will run into the hundreds of millions. For operators in the grocery or convenience industries, which operate on a 1%-2% net profit margin, these costs cannot be absorbed and will ultimately be felt by customers.Proponents of the rule are quick to argue that it is supposed to apply only to businesses with 20 or more locations, and large corporations can absorb these costs. But that is not the reality. Many companies falling within the regulations' scope are franchised and independent locations, owned and operated by small-business owners who often own and operate just one store.During the rule-making process, the FDA chose not to address the concerns of our members. Now, we are asking the Trump administration to delay the rule so as to allow the FDA to bring some common sense to this process, and rewrite the rule to give customers the information they want. Information that is accurate and useful — without creating an unnavigable and expensive regulatory morass. The rule could be much less complex and much less expensive with only a few changes.It's time for some basic common sense with this rule.

156,ICE,"Crude retreated for the first time in seven sessions Wednesday after a government report showed U.S. production climbed to the highest level in more than a year, offsetting data on declining stockpiles.Futures ended the longest stretch of gains this year in New York. Crude output climbed for an eighth week, the longest stretch since 2012, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Inventories fell 2.17 million barrels, compared with a 1.5 million barrel drop forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Prices rose earlier on reports that Saudi Arabia will support an extension to OPEC-led production curbs.While speculation that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will extend their six-month pact aimed at eroding a global glut is helping boost prices, there's also concern that rising U.S. output will counter the reductions. In its monthly report on Wednesday, OPEC boosted estimates for rival supplies as shale drillers emerge from the industry's two-year slump.""Overall supply and demand are coming into balance,"" Brian Kessens, a managing director and portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors in Leawood, Kan., who helps manage $17.1 billion in energy assets, said by telephone. ""There's a little less focus on the weekly inventory numbers and more on OPEC rhetoric.""West Texas Intermediate for May delivery slipped 29 cents, or 0.5%, to close at $53.11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices touched $53.76 earlier, the highest intraday price since March 7. Total volume traded was about 16% above the 100-day average.Brent for June settlement slipped 37 cents, or 0.7%, to $55.86 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark oil climbed the previous seven sessions, the longest stretch of gains since July 2012. Brent closed at a $2.34 premium to June WTI.American crude production rose by 36,000 barrels a day to 9.24 million in the week ended April 7, the most since January 2016. U.S. oil drillers boosted the rig count to 672 last week, the most since August 2015, Baker Hughes data show.""The market isn't doing much because we've been anticipating a draw,"" Adam Wise, who helps run a $7 billion oil and natural gas bond and private equity portfolio at John Hancock in Boston, said by telephone. ""The market has had a strong run-up and it's taking a pause before the next move.""The decline left nationwide crude stockpiles at 533.4 million barrels last week. Inventories at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI futures and the nation's biggest oil-storage hub, increased 276,000 barrels to a record 69.4 million.Refineries processed 16.7 million barrels a day of crude, up 268,000 barrels from the prior week and the highest since January, according to the EIA.Gasoline supplies fell 2.97 million barrels, while inventories of distillate fuel, a category that includes diesel and heating oil, slipped 2.15 million barrels.""The biggest take-away is that all three main categories had draws that were bigger than expected,"" Kessens said. ""Refinery utilization was up and should pick up as we go through the month.""Saudi Arabia will decide on an extension depending on the stance of other OPEC nations such as Iraq and Iran, as well as Russia, which isn't a member of the group but joined the output cuts, a person familiar with the kingdom's internal discussions said.The kingdom — OPEC's largest producer — reduced supply below 10 million barrels a day in March, more than pledged under the deal, according to OPEC's monthly report. The group is scheduled to gather in Vienna on May 25.

157,ICE,"Traditional retailers, whose obituaries have been started and scrapped for years, are on the critical list again, with stores shuttering and e-commerce giants like Amazon.com (AMZN) in ascendance.Executives say put the death notices away, at least for one category. Malls aren't going extinct — they're changing, sometimes by healthy natural selection. While store closures are painful, often they represent a Darwinian moment, allowing a shopping center to refresh its mix by adding a grocery market or an Apple store.Investors aren't buying it. Literally. Mall REIT stocks have dropped 18% in the past year, compared with a 4% gain in the broader REIT group, as stores close at a record pace. At the same time, a view is building among industry analysts that skepticism has gone too far.Down 7% this year, Bloomberg's BBREIT Regional Mall Index trades for 5.1 times book value, down from its 2016 high of 6.7 and roughly in line with its decade average.New York University's REIT Symposium on April 6 featured presentations from chief executive officers at 27 REITs spanning numerous industries. But the conversation kept bouncing back to retail. Here's what the executives had to say:Retail properties come in many varieties, and shouldn't be lumped together. Malls aren't the same as strip centers, and, more importantly, high-quality malls — or ""A"" malls — are different from ""B"" and ""C"" malls. The consensus is that the high-quality malls will outperform.""If you own the best real estate, you will thrive,"" said Sandeep Mathrani, CEO of mall operator GGP (GGP). Retailers no longer care whether they're operating out of a strip center or a mall, he said. Quality is what matters. And of the 7.5 billion square feet of retail real estate in the U.S., only 1.2 billion is currently occupied by stores that are considered high quality, Mathrani said.When it comes to malls, ""high quality"" has been synonymous with luxury apparel brands. But the definition is changing as e-commerce puts a premium on creativity. A trip to the mall is no longer just about buying a designer handbag. Now it often involves going to a grocery store, doctor's office or upscale restaurant — all businesses that face less risk from e-commerce than traditional tenants. Some REITs are tacking on office space or apartments to diversify. One mall in Dubai even boasts an aquarium and an Olympic sized ice rink, and another features a ski slope.Mathrani said today's ideal mall includes one department store, a supermarket, an Apple store, a Tesla store, and businesses that started out online, such as Warby Parker. Clothing stores, which used to take up about 70% of the average shopping center, now represent closer to 50%, he said. Meanwhile, food is roughly 15%, up from around 6%.""Food is the new fashion, and fitness is the new food,"" said Acadia Realty Trust (AKR) CEO Kenneth Bernstein.Shoppers also aren't willing to travel as far as they once were for a day at the mall, so location and convenience are important. ""Old-fashioned retail shopping centers will continue to exist as long as they're in the right location,"" Mathrani said.Store closures such as those at Sears Holdings (SHLD) and J.C. Penney (JCP) have driven a lot of the recent negativity around retail, but some REITs have said good riddance. The exit of one retailer can present an opportunity to boost rents and lease space to a higher-quality store.Mathrani said that GGP had anticipated the fall of some stores, and has been able to fill 80% of the space that was left empty when retailers went bankrupt. Stores like Bonobos, Lululemon (LULU) and Warby Parker have filled the gaps.Technological innovation can also open doors, according to Conor Flynn, CEO of shopping center REIT Kimco Realty (KIM). He said driverless cars and ride-sharing could allow his company to transform parking lots into apartments and hotels.Some REIT executives said the U.S. has too much retail space. Flynn said a lot of shopping centers were built to keep up with household formation, but many of those households were never built. So as e-commerce continues to take more market share, parts of the country may need to do some demolition. In the future, the city you live in may have four malls instead of eight. The key, Flynn said, is having a good business both in stores and online.""Home Depot (HD) is a perfect example of being very efficient at both the physical bricks-and-mortar as well as the e-commerce business,"" he said. ""There is an omnichannel wave now that is widely accepted by most consumers.""MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:Investors Who See Plenty Of Life In Dying MallsSeeking E-Commerce Shoots Among Retail's Brick-And-Mortar DeclineWho's Driving The Housing Recovery Now?

159,ICE,"Crude capped its longest run of gains this year as Libya's biggest oilfield suffered another outage, while Russia signaled it's weighing an extension production cuts.Futures rose for a fifth day in New York, adding to the 3.2% gain last week that followed a U.S. military strike on Syria. Libya's Sharara field halted output just a week after reopening, with the National Oil Corp. declaring force majeure on exports, according to a copy of its decree obtained by Bloomberg. Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Friday his ministry had been in talks with oil companies regarding the need to prolong the six-month deal with OPEC.Support from some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to extend the curbs triggered a rally above $50 a barrel in the past two weeks. The cuts have stabilized the market and Russia will continue to watch inventory levels, but it's too early to decide whether the pact should be  prolonged, Novak said. Libya, an OPEC member that's exempt from the accord, said Sharara had been pumping 200,000 barrels a day before the latest disruption. A week earlier, exports were interrupted by a pipeline halt.""The Libyans are constantly shutting and reopening their fields because of political and technical issues,"" said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass. ""The talk of an extension, strength of the U.S. economy and ongoing minor supply problems like Libya are leading people to think the market will probably be getting tighter.""West Texas intermediate for May delivery climbed 84 cents, or 1.6%, to settle at $53.08 a barrel at on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

It's the highest close since March 6. The global benchmark oil ended the session at a $2.50 premium to June WTI.Production from the Buzzard field in the North Sea returned to full capacity late Saturday morning, according to a person with knowledge of matter. The field was shut on April 2 following an unplanned outage.Russia, which pledged to trim output by as much as 300,000 barrels a day by the end of this month, will make a decision on prolonging the curbs after ""monitoring results in April and May,"" according to Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich. Cuts so far haven't delivered the expected price boost, he said at an Energy Ministry conference Friday in Moscow. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC members joined the group in cutting output from January.U.S. crude and fuel inventories probably declined last week, according to a Bloomberg survey before an Energy Information Administration report on Wednesday. Explorers in the U.S. increased the oil rig count last week to the highest level since August 2015. U.S. drillers targeting crude added 10 rigs to 672, according to data Friday from Baker Hughes Inc.""We're looking for an overall petroleum draw,"" Kyle Cooper, director of research with IAF Advisors in Houston, said by telephone. ""There should finally be a small drop in crude supplies, and between decent demand and strong exports there will probably be another draw in the products.""

American crude output rose for a seventh week and supplies expanded, government data showed Wednesday. Refineries utilized the most capacity since January. Prices rallied above $50 a barrel a week ago after some OPEC countries supported a possible extension of their six-month deal trimming output. Disruptions at Canada's second-biggest oil sands upgrader has curbed some supplies.The increase in U.S. stockpiles is reviving concern they'll counter output curbs led by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

The gain left output at the highest level since January 2016.Inventories rose 1.6 million barrels to 535.5 million barrels, the highest level in weekly EIA data compiled since 1982. Supplies at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI futures and the nation's biggest oil-storage hub, increased 1.41 million barrels to a record 69.1 million. Refineries processed 16.4 million barrels a day in the week ended March 31, up 203,000 barrels from the prior week and the highest since January, the EIA data show.""Crude is rising even though we have record inventories at Cushing,"" Thomas Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group in Wellington, Fla., said by telephone. ""That's because the rise in refinery utilization is a reflection of where inventories are heading.""A fire at Syncrude Canada's plant is restricting supplies of both light synthetic crude and heavy Alberta oil. The unit, which can process 350,000 barrels a day of bitumen from oil sands formations, moved forward maintenance following the fire last month. The shutdown coincides with maintenance on other Canadian plants.

161,ICE,"Crude closed at the highest level in almost one month as concern over record U.S. stockpiles was offset by speculation that rising refinery demand will curb supply in coming weeks.Supplies rose to 535.5 million, the most in weekly data going back to 1982, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Refineries operated at 90.8% of capacity, up 1.5 percentage points from the prior week and the highest since January. Refiners typically increase crude processing at this time of year as they prepare for the summer surge of gasoline demand.Oil in the U.S. rose above $50 a barrel last week after some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries voiced support for an extension to a six-month deal to cut production past June. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said on Sunday in Baghdad that he's ""cautiously optimistic that the market is already rebalancing.""""People are probably looking beyond these numbers and thinking that we'll see three to four weeks of draws because of the pickup in refinery utilization,"" Joe Bozoyan, an equity portfolio manager who helps oversee $5 billion in energy and utility shares at John Hancock in Boston, said by telephone.

162,ICE,"Crude advanced the most in six weeks Tuesday as key refineries and pipelines resumed operation following hurricane-driven shutdowns, stoking demand and making oil futures the best-performing energy contract of the day.Oil climbed as much as 3.6% in New York. Refiners including Valero Energy (VLO) and Citgo Petroleum  worked to get Texas plants back on track, while Exxon Mobil (XOM) began supplying filling stations with fuel after repairs to a Houston pipeline. Even as the hardest-hit operators worked to resurrect output, traders watched another major hurricane approaching from the east that has already led to the shutdown of an oil terminal.The market was ""waiting for the refineries to restart so demand could start to pick up again,"" Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle, which oversees $142 billion of assets, said by telephone. ""That's really what speculators had been waiting for.""Harvey forced refineries, pipelines, ports and offshore platforms to shut as the storm intensified before making landfall on Aug. 25. While many of those facilities are back in service, others have yet to resume production, including plants owned by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Total (TOT). Still, Goldman Sachs sees half of the refining capacity lost to Harvey back to work by Sept. 7. Dry weather across southeast Texas should help minimize the loss of demand for gasoline and diesel, according to the bank.Fuel makers are ""starting to put more supply into the chain — that's going to put pressure on gasoline prices,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by telephone. Simultaneously, oil demand is rebounding ""and you get the corresponding rally in crude oil prices.""West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery gained $1.37, or 2.9%, to $48.66 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Earlier in the trading session, the contract was up as much as 3.6% for the biggest intraday gain since July 25. Brent for November settlement advanced $1.07 to $53.41 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange and traded at a premium of $4.25 to November WTI.October gasoline futures dropped 4.9 cents, or 2.8%, to $1.699 a gallon. There was no settlement Monday because of the U.S. Labor Day holiday.
"
163,ICE,"Gasoline climbed to the highest level in more than two years as traders assess how quickly key Gulf Coast refineries and pipelines are able to return to service following Harvey.Motor-fuel prices jumped 13.5% in New York. Harvey has shuttered about 23% of U.S. refining capacity since its first landfall on the Texas coast as a Category 4 hurricane on Friday. While refineries in the Port Arthur, Beaumont and Houston areas remain offline, some plants in the Corpus Christi area — where Harvey first hit — are working to restart and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on Thursday approved the release of 1 million barrels of crude to a Gulf Coast processor.Colonial said its Lines 1 and 2 are operating east of Lake Charles and it will be able to bypass any shuttered terminals near Port Arthur, Texas, when it resumes shipments Sunday from the Houston area.The focus is on how long refineries will take to get back online, Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors, said in a telephone interview. ""This is more of an unleaded gasoline story. The impact on the whole Texas area — the story is still developing.""Gasoline has lingered at a two-year high as Harvey affects refineries, terminals, ports and pipelines. The storm has also triggered a flurry of trans-Atlantic gasoline trading and disrupted exports of liquefied petroleum gas, causing price spikes in Asia.Meanwhile, oil in New York has traded below $50 a barrel amid a dip in demand from refiners during the storm and as cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries continue to be threatened by output increases from other producers. OPEC shipments will drop by 80,000 barrels a day to September 16, according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.Gasoline for  September delivery, which expired Thursday, advanced 25.52 cents to settle at $2.1399 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level in more than two years. The more-active October contract rose 8.7% to $1.7792 a gallon. The gasoline crack spread, a rough measure of the profit from refining crude into gasoline, jumped to the highest in two years.West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery climbed $1.27 to settle at $47.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent for October settlement, which expired Thursday, also rose $1.52 to end the session at $52.38 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $5.15 to WTI.Now that Harvey has moved east, Valero Energy, Citgo Petroleum and Flint Hills Resources are preparing to restart refineries at Corpus Christi, according to regulatory filings and people familiar with the matter.Plants in the Port Arthur, Beaumont and Houston, Texas areas remain shut, including the nation's largest oil refinery operated by Motiva Enterprises, which has no timeline for its restart. The area surrounding Lake Charles, La., is also under threat, yet Citgo said its refinery in the area didn't sustain damage.The U.S. government, meanwhile, authorized the release of 400,000 barrels of sweet crude and 600,000 barrels of sour crude to Phillips 66's Lake Charles refinery. The last time the Energy Department authorized an emergency exchange of oil from the reserve was in 2012 during Hurricane Isaac.U.S. crude stockpiles fell for a ninth week to the lowest level since January 2016 last week, according to Energy Information Administration data Wednesday.Wednesday's inventory report ""points to a fairly healthy picture still,"" said Gene McGillian, market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn.
"
164,ICE,"Gasoline hit a new a two-year high as investors assess the impact of refinery outages and restarts as Harvey moves away from the Houston area.With Harvey sliding farther inland over Southwestern Louisiana, Motiva Enterprises' Port Arthur refinery, the country's biggest, began a controlled shutdown. The disruption helped send motor fuel up 5.7% in New York, while oil fell. An Energy Information Administration report showed U.S. crude stockpiles slid for a ninth week, though production — often given more weight by traders — continued to rise last week.""The market right now is more worried about the tropical storm than they are about the weekly inventory,"" said Matt Sallee, who helps manage $16 billion in oil-related assets at Tortoise Capital Advisors, by phone. ""This storm is basically very effective in its path of shutting down refinery capacity.""Harvey, the strongest storm to hit the U.S. since 2004, is throwing the energy market into disarray, leading to multiple refinery shutdowns in the Port Arthur, Beaumont and Houston areas, as plants further west restart. The storm is also affecting the distribution of crude and product on pipelines. Flooding from storm Harvey is ""now the greatest threat"" to U.S. Gulf Coast energy infrastructure, according to Goldman Sachs Group analysts.Gasoline for September delivery, which expires Thursday, climbed 10.14 cents to settle at $1.8847 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level since July 2015. The more-active October contract rose 3.56 cents to $1.6375 a gallon.West Texas intermediate for October delivery declined 48 cents to end the session at $45.96 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest level in five weeks.Brent for October settlement, which expires Thursday, dropped $1.14 to settle at $50.86 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $4.90 to WTI.U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 5.39 million barrels to 457.8 million last week, the lowest level since January 2016, EIA data showed Wednesday. At the same time, gasoline supplies rose by 35,000 barrels and crude production also increased.Motiva's Port Arthur, Texas, refinery has a capacity to process 605,000 barrels of oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. When it can restart will depend on the recession of floodwaters, the company said. Total SA's refinery in the same area also had a power loss, which led to a shutdown while Valero Energy's nearby facility was also said to be shutting.

165,ICE,"The biggest challenge facing the environmental movement is … environmentalists.  They can be their own worst enemies. They've succeeded in increasing public awareness of their dire warnings, and yet the public remains generally apathetic about taking action.One reason is the public recognizes the disingenuousness, exaggerations, inconsistencies and hypocrisies coming from the movement — especially with respect to the use of fossil fuels.Disingenuousness. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) just confirmed that 2016 was the hottest year on record.Of course, the Earth has been on a slow warming trend since the end of the last ice age 10,000 years ago — one of many glacial periods in earth's history.  So the notion that temperatures are slowly increasing — assuming they are — shouldn't be news.The problem is those ""records"" — NOAA scientists have been fudging the numbers.In 2015, NOAA's Thomas Karl — trying to disprove evidence that global temperatures had plateaued for perhaps 15 years — released a report saying that the agency revisited past ground and sea-level temperature data.According to the study authors, ""Here we present an updated global surface temperature analysis that reveals that global trends are higher than reported by the IPCC, especially in recent decades."" What they did was adjust both land- and sea-based temperature readings up to prove that temperatures had been rising all along.Shortly after the report, a former NOAA climate scientist, John Bates, blew the whistle: ""Gradually, in the months after (the report) came out, the evidence kept mounting that Tom Karl constantly had his 'thumb on the scale' — in the documentation, scientific choices, and release of data sets.""Temperatures may be rising, but how would we know when scientists change them to validate their predictions?Exaggerations. Some of the most prominent environmentalists have made predictions that now sound silly.In 2007, the BBC reported that Professor Wieslaw Maslowski told an American Geophysical Union meeting that his modeling showed the Arctic would be ice-free in the summers in five or six years — that is, about four years ago.Al Gore picked up on that claim and repeated it frequently.Whether it's global warming, mass starvation, resource depletion or overpopulation, the environmental crowd's predictions seldom appear correct, and often seem hysterical, and the public has grown increasingly indifferent to them.Inconsistencies. Environmentalists' biggest concern these days is the increase in carbon emissions — currently at 408 parts per million.There was a time when environmentalists realized that clean energy sources could not meet the needs of a dynamic, industrial economy — at least not anytime soon. So they encouraged transitioning to more natural gas as a cleaner-burning ""bridge fuel"" until clean energy could replace it.Were that still their mentality, they would applaud innovative drilling techniques such as fracking, which have allowed us to dramatically increase natural gas production and resulted in the U.S. gradually reducing its carbon emissions.Instead, they condemn drilling, and especially fracking, while ignoring the environmental problems created by giant wind turbines and solar panels.For example, the Audubon Society estimates that wind turbines kill an estimated 140,000 to 328,000 birds each year — and that's just in North America. President Obama even issued the turbine industry a special dispensation to kill thousands of eagles and other raptors.And yet the environmental community winks at this destruction.Hypocrisies. Some of the most prominent environmental spokespersons travel to conferences around the world in private jets, and upon landing are driven to their destinations in stretch limos so they can scold the rest of us about the need to reduce our fossil-fuel consumption.The National Center for Public Policy Research just released a report on the amount of electricity Al Gore's 10,070 square-foot home consumes. According to NCPPR, ""Gore guzzles more electricity in one year than the average American family uses in 21 years."" And ""From August 2016 through July 2017, Gore spent almost $22,000 on electricity bills.""Oh, and Gore used enough energy to power six average U.S. homes for a year just heating his pool.At least there's a good chance natural gas is powering some of that electricity, and Gore would probably be paying more for it without fracking.Americans want a clean and healthy environment. But until some of the most outspoken environmentalists abandon the inconsistencies and hypocrisies, the public is likely to continue tuning them out.RELATED:Al Gore's Climate Change Hypocrisy Is As Big As His Energy-Sucking MansionThe Inconvenient Truth About Al Gore And The Climate 'Experts'Are Electric Cars Doomed To Fail … Again?

166,ICE,"The revival of the GOP push to repeal and replace ObamaCare didn't last long.Negotiations reportedly hit a wall late Tuesday, as concessions to House conservatives repelled more moderate Republicans, leaving no clear way forward.After signals that the House might vote on a revised bill before the end of the week, Republicans are now saying that talks about reviving TrumpCare have been tabled indefinitely.The initial demise of House Speaker Paul Ryan's American Health Care Act two weeks ago was a negative for markets, raising concern that the rest of President Trump's fiscal agenda might be sidelined. Yet Wall Street appears to have decided that there's nothing to be gained by diving back into the treacherous politics of ObamaCare repeal.Stocks opened higher on Wednesday after ADP reported that private employers added a bigger-than-expected 263,000 jobs last month, and confirmation that TrumpCare has no pulse did nothing to dampen the mood. The Nasdaq composite rose to a record high in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.8%, paced by McDonald's (MCD) and another good day for Caterpillar (CAT).Even as TrumpCare was being put back on ice, there were more signals from the White House that it wants to speed up the timetable for bringing forward an infrastructure bill. Dozens of Republican members of Congress were reportedly briefed on the Trump administration's emerging infrastructure proposal.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market uptrend has been under pressure lately, a signal to investors to be more cautious about buying stocks and quick to cut losses. Will Wednesday's rally give stock investors a green light? Read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's trend.Talks to revise ObamaCare repeal legislation collapsed, even as conservative groups that opposed the initial legislation were ready to climb on board. The Club for Growth put out a statement blaming moderates for balking at language that would let states opt out of ObamaCare regulations requiring guaranteed coverage with the same rate for sick and healthy customers.Hospital and insurer stocks that got hit on Tuesday bounced backed strongly.

167,ICE,"Crude climbed to a four-week high on forecasts that U.S. inventories have dropped from a record and reports of a North Sea oilfield shutdown.Futures climbed 1.6% in New York. U.S. crude supplies probably fell by 150,000 barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts before an Energy Information Administration report Wednesday. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute was set to release its weekly data Tuesday. The Buzzard oilfield closed after an unplanned outage, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Oil rose 5.5% last week, the most since December, after Kuwait and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries joined with Oman to voice support for an extension of the six-month output cuts that began in January. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said Sunday that he is ""cautiously optimistic that the market is already rebalancing,"" even as the number of active oil rigs in the U.S. rose to the highest since September 2015 and Libya was said to restore production.""There's an expectation, one that I don't share, that the EIA and API will report crude draws,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by phone.

That was also the highest close since March 7. The global benchmark crude ended the session at a $2.66 premium to June WTI.The global benchmark advanced more than WTI following the reports of the unplanned shutdown of the Buzzard field. The field operator, CNOOC's Nexen unit, didn't reply to an email seeking comment.David Pursell, a managing director at investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., sees crude reaching $65 a barrel in the fourth quarter and $75 in 2019. He expects a big drawdown in inventories over the next eight weeks and said stockpiles will revert to normal levels by the end of the third quarter.""Prices are going to get better, and you can take that to the bank,"" Pursell said at Hart Energy's DUG Permian Basin conference in Fort Worth, Texas.Since mid-February, between 10 million and 20 million barrels have left storage in the Caribbean, according to estimates from traders who asked not to be named because their data is proprietary. The decline, hardly noticed by most in the market, reflects the impact of the OPEC-led output cuts.Crude output by OPEC members fell by 200,000 barrels a day in March, helped by cuts in Nigeria and Libya that aren't part of a production-curbing accord, a Bloomberg News survey shows. The group pumped 32.095 million barrels a day last month, based on information compiled from analysts, oil companies and ship-tracking data. Among the 10 members bound by output caps, compliance weakened to 89% of pledged reductions from 104%.OPEC will meet May 25 in Vienna to make a decision on whether to extend production cuts.

168,ICE,"Crude dropped as the reopening of Libya's biggest oil field countered OPEC's optimism about production cuts.Futures slipped 0.7% in New York after rising 5.5% last week. Libya's output rose to about 660,000 barrels a day, a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified said. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said Sunday that he is ""cautiously optimistic that the market is already rebalancing,"" while data on Friday showed the number of active oil rigs in the U.S. rose to the highest since September 2015. Prices also fell as the dollar climbed and equities slipped.Barkindo's comments support the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' commitment to drain swollen inventories before the group meets May 25 in Vienna. Kuwait and other producers from the group joined with nonmember Oman to voice support for an extension of the six-month deal to cut output that began in January. The effects of the curbs have been mitigated by a surge in U.S. supply and production.""The rebound of Libyan production stalled the rally,"" Gene McGillian, manager of market research for Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn., said by telephone. ""We were rallying on the signs that the OPEC production agreement will be extended.""West Texas Intermediate for May delivery dropped 36 cents to close at $50.24 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices gained $2.63 last week to settle at $50.60.

The global benchmark crude closed at a $2.41 premium to June WTI.Libya's output had dropped to about 500,000 barrels a day last week when production was halted at the Sharara field. Libya has sought to boost crude exports after fighting among rival militias hobbled oil production following the overthrow in 2011 of Moammar Al Qaddafi.OPEC's progress in curbing the global glut relied on contributions from Libya and Nigeria in March, two countries that are exempt from output cuts, according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts, oil companies and ship-tracking data. The group pumped 32.095 million barrels a day, down 200,000 a day from February. Supply from Nigeria and Libya fell by a combined 210,000 barrels a day to 1.55 million and 620,000 a day, respectively.Rigs targeting crude in the U.S. increased for an 11th week to 662, the longest run of gains since 2011, according to data from Baker Hughes. American oil production expanded for a sixth week to 9.15 million barrels a day in the week ended on March 24, the highest level since February 2016, according to Energy Information Administration data.

169,ICE,"Gasoline futures jumped to a four-month high and oil dropped as flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey in Texas led to the shutdown of major refineries.Motor fuel prices rose 2.7% and oil in New York slipped 2.7%. Harvey, the strongest storm to hit the U.S. since 2004, has flooded cities and caused plants to shut, leading to about 2.26 million barrels a day of crude and condensate capacity in Texas offline. Several key pipelines were also closed, potentially stranding crude in Texas and interrupting gasoline supplies to other parts of the country.""There's a big drop-off suddenly in crude oil demand,"" John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York-based hedge fund, said by phone. ""We have a supply disruption event in gasoline production. Gasoline demand in the balance of the country is still elevated, so we could see a real impact on gasoline inventories if these refineries are unable to get restaffed quickly.""Harvey's widespread flooding has interrupted refining operations, leading plants such as Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSA) Deer Park, Texas, refinery and Exxon Mobil's (XOM) Baytown, Texas, complex to shut. Meanwhile, Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP) suspended its inbound and outbound refined products and crude pipeline transportation services in the Houston area and Colonial Pipeline Co.'s Cedar Bayou, Texas, operations are shut. Several energy traders closed their offices Monday and Houston's utility said restoring power would take at least until Sept. 2.Gasoline for September delivery climbed 4.57 cents to settle at $1.7123 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange after touching $1.7799 a gallon, the highest intraday price for a front-month contract since July 2015. The gasoline crack spread, a rough measure of the profit from refining crude into gasoline, rose to $19.42 a barrel.West Texas intermediate crude for October delivery slipped $1.30 to settle at $46.57 a barrel, the lowest level in five weeks. Brent for October settlement dropped 52 cents to end the session at $51.89 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $5.32 to WTI, the widest in two years.An estimated 300,000 to 500,000 barrels a day of oil output from the Eagle Ford shale formation in Texas has been shut, according to the Texas Railroad Commission. At the same time, about 19%, or 331,400 barrels a day, of Gulf of Mexico oil production is offline, compared with 22% Sunday, according to government data.Other infrastructure outages include Explorer Pipeline Co.'s suspension of its product shipments from origin points in Pasadena, Texas, and a service halt by Magellan on the Longhorn and BridgeTex crude pipelines.The U.S. could see 30% of refining capacity shut on Harvey and if the storm moves up the Texas coast toward Louisiana, then additional shutdowns could occur in Port Arthur and Beaumont in Texas as well as in Lake Charles, La., Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. analysts said.The storm has drifted back into the Gulf of Mexico and is poised to regain strength before crashing into the Texas-Louisiana border, according to the National Hurricane Center. While two refineries in the Corpus Christi, Texas, area are said to be preparing for restart, other plants on the Gulf Coast are still closed with the potential shutdown of more in the Port Arthur area, including the nation's largest refinery operated by Motiva Enterprises LLC.

170,ICE,"Former Vice President Al Gore stars in his second documentary, ""An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power.""""Sooner or later,"" Gore tweeted, ""climate deniers in the GOP will have to confront their willful blindness to the climate crisis."" But skeptics of climate alarmism have their eyes wide open and don't like what they see.Donald Trump won the popular vote among people 45 years and older. Many in these ranks have followed grass roots environmentalism since it began, following publication of Rachel Carson's book, ""Silent Spring,"" in 1962. Over time they've learned that celebrated environmental experts make false and wildly exaggerated predictions. A prime example is Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich, a longtime environmental icon and author of the 1968 book ""The Population Bomb.""""Population will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in food supplies we make,"" Ehrlich confidently predicted in a 1970 issue of Mademoiselle. ""The death rate will increase until at least 100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during the next 10 years.""He assured readers of The Progressive in 1970 that between 1980 and 1989, 4 billion people, including 65 million Americans, would perish in the ""Great Die-Off."" In a 1969 essay titled ""Eco-Catastrophe!"" Ehrlich said ""most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born.""Undeterred, the celebrity doomsayer and his cohorts now offer a new theory, claiming in a July 2017 issue of ""Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"" that human civilization stands in peril from an ongoing mass extinction on Earth: ""Dwindling population sizes and range shrinkages (of vertebrates) amount to a massive anthropogenic erosion of biodiversity and of the ecosystem services essential to civilization. This 'biological annihilation' underlines the seriousness for humanity of Earth's ongoing sixth mass extinction event."" And so on.Ehrlich has cried ""The sky is falling!"" so many times that anyone with common sense and a memory rightfully dismisses his apocalyptic rhetoric.If the environmental movement's so-called experts had been correct, nearly all animal species would be extinct today, as S. Dillon Ripley, longtime head of the Smithsonian Institution, predicted. As Nigel Calder and Kenneth Watt had it, the Earth would likely be in another ice age today. According to geochemist Harrison Brown, copper, lead, zinc, tin, gold and silver would now be gone. Likewise, Watt and U.S. government analysts predicted that U.S. oil and natural gas reserves would be depleted by now. Instead, we're drowning in the stuff.Hearing these spectacularly wrong predictions for decades, a large segment of the population has lost confidence in environmental research, regardless of its potential merits. Climate and natural resource scientists have only themselves to blame.The failure to enforce rigorous scientific standards and publicly denounce alarmists and charlatans has left many Americans feeling hoodwinked, disregarding all environmental research, which is a shame.But truth and accuracy don't seem to matter to many environmentalists.The late Stanford University climatologist Stephen Schneider told Discover magazine in 1989, ""we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have. ... Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest.""Rather than pursuing scientific truth, the goal is to win political battles. In 1988, then-Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., said, ""We've got to ... try to ride the global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong ... we will be doing the right thing anyway in terms of economic policy and environmental policy."" And ride the issue they have.Environmental ""grievance hustlers"" have used deception, lies, hype and hysteria, often covered with the gauze of taxpayer-funded research, to score political victories that expand Big Government.Here's the real inconvenient truth. If Al Gore wants the people he denounces as ""climate deniers"" to take him seriously, his next documentary should target the intellectual dishonesty of many of his pals in the environmental movement. Don't hold your breath.

171,ICE,"The National Football League's preseason is underway, and national anthem-hating quarterback Colin Kaepernick still doesn't have an NFL job. One can easily identify the liberal journalists by their anguish over this so-called injustice. You can also identify them by their dishonest arguments.Washington Post sports columnist Jerry Brewer pulled out a very large straw man on Aug. 17 in a column headlined ""Days of Docile Black Athlete Have Ended. Get Used to It."" He doubled down in the text, saying: ""Sorry for the inconvenience, sports fans, but the days of the docile black athlete are over. This isn't a time to stick to sports. This isn't a time to be afraid because Kaepernick has been blackballed."" To argue that Kaepernick's critics want ""docile blacks"" is character assassination.Then, Brewer added that the national anthem lasts about two minutes, as does an interview after the game about that anti-American kneeling stunt. He spewed: ""If you think that's too much of a distraction from sports — the ultimate distraction — you're living an awfully petty life. I'm sorry you didn't get to put extra sprinkles on your ice cream, but there are more important matters.""Brewer surely knows that Kaepernick's antics didn't cause two minutes of liberal concern or conservative outrage. We've had an entire summer of ESPN and other liberal sports pundits like Brewer demanding that Kaepernick somehow has an inalienable right to a job in the NFL after his antics.Most of these liberals impose their own righteousness about America's ""systematic racism"" without acknowledging that Kaepernick went beyond this quiet pregame stance. They ignore that he wore socks in training camp featuring pigs with police hats on them. They ignore that he wore a T-shirt with former Cuban leader Fidel Castro on it as he supposedly advocated for freedom of speech.When challenged by Cuban exile Armando Salguero of the Miami Herald about the T-shirt, Kaepernick proclaimed that communist Cuba was better than America. He said, ""One thing that Fidel Castro did do is they have the highest literacy rate because they invest more in their education system than they do in their prison system, which we do not do here, even though we're fully capable of doing that.""Salguero called that out as false, as phony as the Castros winning 100% of the vote. When he told the quarterback that Castro's regime broke up families (including his own) as they sought to escape, Kaepernick attacked America again. ""We do break up families here,"" he said. ""That's what mass incarceration is. That was the foundation of slavery, so our country has been based on that as well as the genocide of Native Americans.""It's not a matter of ""extra sprinkles on our ice cream"" to smear the police as porcine, racist killers and smear America as founded not on liberty and justice but on slavery and genocide.But Brewer, that professor of logic, thinks that Kaepernick's complete evisceration of America is somehow what makes this country ... great? He said: ""But if America is still America — beautiful despite some ugly features, slow to evolve but persistent, a compassionate democracy — history will judge Kaepernick ultimately not as a rogue and defiant objector, but a man ahead of this time who helped spur an important athlete revolution.""What liberal journalists are demanding here is that every famous person in front of a microphone exploit that platform to call for a leftist revolution. Athletes, actors, musicians, reality TV stars and everyone else should always be shilling against the horrid country that America was — and presently is under the Republicans. ""History"" (always equated with liberalism) will grade them as heroes ahead of their time.

172,ICE,"Oil in New York closed near $47 a barrel, a new ""battle line"" for bullish and bearish traders, as they assessed U.S. supply data and key technical levels.Futures added 0.7% after switching between gains and losses during the session. U.S. production had its biggest weekly gain since the end of June, yet crude stockpiles slid the most since September, Energy Information Administration data showed Wednesday. A slump of more than 6% so far this month hasn't brought prices below the 50-day moving average yet, showing some support.""This is the battle line right here, between the bulls and the bears, right around $47,"" John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund, said by phone. ""It's worth it to some to try to pick up what looks like cheap crude oil at the moment, but again, there's a lot of bearish factors in this market.""Oil has failed to hold a rise above $50 since May as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies struggle to reduce elevated crude supplies. While U.S. stockpiles have dropped for seven weeks, concerns remain that the declines may only be seasonal. Oil is probably capped at $60 a barrel during the next five years due to plentiful supplies from both OPEC and U.S. shale, according to Citigroup Inc.West Texas intermediate crude for September delivery rose 31 cents to settle at $47.09 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 20% above the 100-day average. Prices fell 77 cents to close at $46.78 Wednesday, the lowest since July 24.Brent for October settlement climbed 76 cents to end the session at $51.03 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $3.79 to October WTI, the largest since September 2015.Brent crude's October-November spread strength relative to WTI is caused by temporary factors of lower North Sea crude production and higher West African crude flows to Asia, Michael Wittner, the head of commodities research at Societe Generale in New York, said in a note. Hedge funds have been more bullish on Brent than on WTI.While U.S. crude stockpiles slid by 8.95 million barrels to 466.5 million last week, supplies at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI and the biggest U.S. oil-storage hub, expanded a second week to 57 million barrels. Crude output rose by 79,000 barrels a day last week to 9.5 million a day, the EIA reported.""Crude inventories dropping almost 9 million barrels is a pretty sizable drop. I would have expected prices to be a little better than they were today,"" Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research in New York, said by phone. But sentiment in the market is ""still pretty weary.""

174,ICE,"Crude rose to a three-week high after Kuwaiti comments bolstered optimism that OPEC and its partners will extend output curbs.Futures in New York climbed 1.7%. Kuwait and other countries support prolonging production cuts that are scheduled to expire in June, the Persian Gulf emirate's Oil Minister Issam Almarzooq told state-run news agency KUNA.Prices rose Wednesday after U.S. government data showed that gasoline inventories dropped more than expected, while refineries boosted the amount of crude they processed by the most in almost three years.While U.S. crude supplies rose to a record last week, they increased by less than they were expected to, signaling that more oil is being pulled out of storage. That optimism and the disruption in Libyan output has helped drive up prices for three days, their longest stretch of gains in more than a month. They slid last week to the lowest since November as American supply gains countered output cuts by other producers.""It looks like they will potentially extend the cuts,"" said Mark Watkins, the Park City, Utah-based regional investment manager for the Private Client Group at U.S. Bank, which oversees $136 billion in assets. ""Even though there's been skepticism about OPEC and its partners, the signs are pointing toward their success.""West Texas intermediate crude for May delivery advanced 84 cents to settle at $50.35 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

The global benchmark crude closed at a $2.61 premium to WTI.U.S. gasoline inventories dropped by 3.75 million barrels last week, according to an Energy Information Administration report on Wednesday. They were projected to fall by 2 million barrels. Refineries processed 16.2 million barrels a day of crude last week, up 425,000 barrels from the prior week, according to the EIA. It was the biggest weekly increase since June 2014.Nationwide crude stockpiles rose by 867,000 barrels to an all-time high of 534 million. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projected a gain of 2 million barrels. Oil output climbed to above 9.1 million barrels a day.""Traders are responding to speculation about the possible extension of the output cuts,"" said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass. ""This is more important than inventory levels at the moment. We'll have to start seeing inventories decline before long or prices will come back under pressure.""

175,ICE,"The bullish sentiment following OPEC's deal is almost all gone.Hedge funds haven't been so skeptical on rising West Texas Intermediate crude prices since Nov. 29, the day before the cartel agreed to cut output, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Their net-long position, or the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a decline, has dropped 37% from a record touched last month as American crude production climbed, sending inventories to an all-time high.""Things trend, and sentiment from the hedge funds has turned bearish,"" Mike Wittner, head of commodities research at Societe Generale SA in New York, said by telephone. ""People rushed into the market and their patience ran out, so they ran for the exits.

""Although net length is greatly reduced, money managers still have a lot of net length. They still remain vulnerable to further price declines.""The agreement between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 non-OPEC producers to cut output for six months starting Jan. 1 helped spur a wave of buying.

Arrivals into the country reached the highest level in more than four years in the week ended Feb. 3 as barrels that were pumped before OPEC and its partners made cuts arrived at U.S. ports. These shipments will probably slip in the weeks ahead, according to Thummel.""Lower OPEC imports and the ending of refinery maintenance will reduce inventories eventually,"" Thummel said.U.S. refineries typically increase activity in April as they finish maintenance before the summer peak driving season.

176,ICE,"PHOENIX — As a boy, Barry Goldwater Jr., son of the former senator and 1964 Republican presidential nominee, would step out of his father's house and shoot at tin cans 50 yards away. Now 78, he says he could fire in any direction and not endanger ""anything but a cactus."" His father, born in 1909 in Arizona territory, three years before statehood, built the house on a bluff where, as an adolescent, he rode his horse there and slept under the stars. There were about 30,000 people in Phoenix.The house is now in the nation's 12th-largest metropolitan area (about 4.6 million). Arizona's population, which was approximately 200,000 when the future senator was born and 750,000 when he was elected in 1952, is now approaching 7 million. Today's governor, Doug Ducey, is demonstrating the continuing pertinence of the limited-government conservatism with which Sen. Goldwater shaped the modern GOP, after himself being shaped by life in the leave-me-alone spirit of the wide open spaces of near-frontier Arizona.Last year, Ducey, 52, told National Review, ""If you want to learn something new, you need to read something old. As Barry Goldwater wrote in 'Conscience of a Conservative,' 'My aim is not to pass laws, it's to repeal them.'"" Ducey was preaching what he already had practiced.He took office in January 2015, as the Super Bowl was about to be played in suburban Glendale. The head of a state agency vowed that he was going to stage a sting to put Uber out of business, thereby benefiting Uber's taxi and limousine competitors. Ducey says he fired the man and abolished the agency.Ducey has sided with Airbnb against local governments restricting it in order to protect competitors, and has removed government-imposed limits (benefiting large beer brands) on the growth of microbreweries. He does not want Arizona to be part of ""the permission society.""This is the title of a new book by Timothy Sandefur, a litigator for the Goldwater Institute, a liberty-promoting think tank located 3.5 miles from the governor's office. Sandefur documents how far America has lapsed from the Founders' premise that our rights pre-exist government, which is instituted to protect them. Today, Americans' rights are increasingly restricted to those privileges that government grants for its purposes.Ducey recently demonstrated his understanding of this regarding the rogue barber. A Tucson cosmetology student, who himself was once homeless, disturbed the State Board of Cosmetology's serenity by giving — without possessing a barber's license — free haircuts to homeless people. Ducey asked the board to dismount from its high horse and recognize ""an act of charity that we should be celebrating."" About a third of Americans now need some form of government permission to do their chosen work, and Ducey wants Arizona to be an oasis of liberty in a society plagued by excessive occupational licensing.Born in Ohio, he came here to attend Arizona State University and became a businessman who attended Goldwater Institute events. After he joined the founder of Cold Stone Creamery ice cream shops and opened 1,400 nationwide, he was elected state treasurer, then governor. Seeking advice from the best, he called former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, who suggested appointing to his administration business people looking for new challenges. (Daniels asked, ""Do you know anyone who plays golf on Tuesdays and is miserable?"")Ducey wants Arizona to have a ""West Coast vibe with a Midwestern work ethic,"" and he cheekily calls California's Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown ""my partner in growing Arizona's economy"" because California's business climate is a powerful incentive for firms to relocate in Arizona, where more than 60% of its residents were born elsewhere. Arizona's motto is ""Ditat Deus"" (""God Enriches""), but His work can be facilitated by Ducey's goal of getting the state's income tax ""as close to zero as possible.""He calls himself a ""full-spectrum conservative,"" including support for free trade (NAFTA has been good for Arizona's commerce with Mexico), but there are limits to his Western libertarianism. Last year, he led the campaign that resulted in Arizona being the only one of five states voting on the issue to defeat legalization of recreational marijuana: ""I'm the son of a cop and the father of three teenage sons.""The current president has pointedly said, ""This is called the Republican Party. It's not called the Conservative Party."" Actually, it became a conservative party partly because of what an Arizonan did many decades ago. It may become such a party again, with another Arizonan's help.

177,ICE,"Oil slipped after investors focused in on a rise in U.S. crude production, even as stockpiles slipped by the most since September last week.Futures fell as much as 0.8% in New York. While crude inventories declined by 8.95 million barrels last week to 466.5 million, production jumped by the most since late June, according to data from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday. Gasoline stockpiles rose for a second week and inventories at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI and the biggest U.S. oil-storage hub, increased by 678,000 barrels.""Everybody loves the inventory decline, but the production is just something the bears continue to focus on,"" Rob Thummel, managing director and portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC, said by telephone. Investors are looking at ""that continued increase in U.S. production and the pressure that might put on oil prices.""Oil in New York has fluctuated below $50 a barrel as investors weigh rising global supply against output cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies. OPEC won't clear the global glut any time soon since any increase in price continues to bolster rival production from U.S. shale, according to the International Energy Agency.""In a normal market, a decline in inventories like this would have a significant, positive impact on prices, but in this market, because sentiment is so challenged, not just for oil, but also for energy stocks, it's just a very difficult market to operate in,"" said Thummel, who helps manage $16 billion in energy-related assets.West Texas Intermediate for September delivery fell 24 cents to $47.31 a barrel at 11:37 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 26% above the 100-day average. WTI has fallen 6% so far in August, which put it on track for the worst monthly decline since March.Brent for October settlement fell 4 cents to $50.76 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $3.29 to October WTI.U.S. gasoline inventories rose by 22,000 barrels to 231.1 million last week, EIA data showed. Cushing, Okla., crude supplies climbed to 57 million barrels. At the same time, crude production jumped by 79,000 barrels a day to 9.5 million a day.

178,ICE,"Oil pared losses in New York as concerns about growth in U.S. shale production were abated by the prospect of declining crude inventories.Futures ended the session little changed after declining as much as 1.2%. While production at shale fields is forecast to hit a record in September, a government report may show that crude inventories declined for a seventh week, according to a Bloomberg survey. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will release its inventory data later on Tuesday.""People are squaring up in anticipation of those figures,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by phone. Yawger expects a crude draw of at least 4 million barrels.Oil in New York has been unable to hold a rally above $50 a barrel this month as investors' concerns about rising supplies outweigh cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies. The gain in U.S. shale output next month is being led by the oil-rich Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. Citigroup Inc.'s Ed Morse says U.S. shale will prevail over OPEC as the two rivals compete.""With producers unwilling for the time being to contemplate deeper supply cuts, we're stuck in the same situation. How do you actually rebalance the market if the efforts you are making are not sufficient in light of what's happening elsewhere?"" Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA in London, said by phone.West Texas intermediate crude for September delivery declined 4 cents to settle at $47.55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest level in three weeks.

Gasoline inventories dropped 450,000 barrels, the survey showed. Yet, crude supplies at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI and the biggest U.S. oil-storage hub, rose 700,000 barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg-compiled forecast.""If we continue with declines in crude inventories and gasoline inventories, then I'd think we'd have some stabilization in the price of oil,"" Mark Watkins, a Park City, Utah-based regional investment manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said by phone.

179,ICE,"Oil dropped as fears of falling oil demand in China overshadowed news that Libya's crude supply was disrupted.Futures fell 1% in New York. China's oil refining dropped the most in three years in July, while crude output retreated from the highest this year. Libya's biggest oilfield, Sharara, cut output by more than 30% because of security threats, a person familiar with the matter said. Meanwhile, the dollar strengthened, eroding the lure of commodities as a store of value.""We're seeing some strength in the dollar, and the preponderance of news seems to be favoring the bears right now,"" Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, said by phone. ""If you look at the China data this morning, when it came to the China refinery runs being down in July, that's adding to the perception of slowing demand, and it's offsetting the concerns about Libyan oil production.""Oil has fluctuated below $50 a barrel as investors weigh rising global supply against output curbs from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies. Data on China's sliding refinery runs are stoking fears that the world's second-largest oil consumer will taper its appetite.In the U.S., producers keep drilling for more oil, with the number of active rigs at its highest since April 2015, data from Baker Hughes showed Friday. Amid all the signs of a persistent supply glut, famed trader Andy Hall said goodbye to the oil market as the outlook for prices worsens.West Texas intermediate for September delivery fell $1.01 to $47.81 a barrel at 1:23 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 0.7% below the 100-day average. Prices fell 1.5% last week. WTI traded between $47.77 and $49.16 Monday.Brent for October settlement fell $1.11 to $50.99 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, after sliding 0.6% last week. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $3 to October WTI.The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose as much 0.4%.Chinese oil processing in July dropped 4.4% from the previous month to about 10.76 million barrels a day, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data released Monday by the National Bureau of Statistics.""The China news for oil is a concern,"" Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, said by phone. ""Beijing is trying to land an aircraft being buffeted by strong crosswinds. After goosing the engine earlier this year, now they're tapping the brakes a little bit.""Hall, a trader nicknamed ""God"" by his peers, said he decided to close his flagship hedge fund amid a deteriorating outlook for prices next year and the ""frustrating"" dominance of algorithmic traders.""The fact that OPEC has had to talk about further extending its production cuts is ultimately a sign of weakness, not of strength,"" Hall said in an Aug. 1 letter to investors that was reviewed by Bloomberg News. There's no clear view on how shale supply will respond to shifts in the market and therefore no consensus on a long-term price anchor for oil, he said.The news that Libya's Sharara field output has dropped to 200,000 barrels a day, while loadings at Zueitina ceased, wasn't enough to dispel the pessimism.""At the end of the day, we're still stuck in this trading range we've been in for two weeks,"" Michael Hiley, Head of OTC Energy Trading at New York-based LPS Futures, said by phone. While OPEC's agreement is trying to cap supply, U.S. shale producers are quick to ramp up production as prices rise, he says.
"
180,ICE,"Oil dropped as U.S. crude supplies rose to an all-time high while investors await a meeting between OPEC and its allies that may signal whether they'll extend output curbs.Futures fell on both sides of the Atlantic, sending Brent to its lowest close since November. American crude output continued to rise along with inventories last week, an Energy Information Administration report showed on Wednesday.While OPEC won't formally decide until May whether to prolong production cuts, officials will meet this weekend in Kuwait to discuss their deal's progress.West Texas intermediate and Brent crudes dipped below $50 a barrel this month for the first time in 2017 as rising U.S. inventories weighed on output cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih has said the group would extend the deal if oil stockpiles remain high. The Russian cuts are ""slower than what I'd like,"" Al-Falih said in an interview with CNBC March 7.""There's a lot weighing on the market and I believe it's a matter of time before we move lower,"" John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy, said by phone. ""Saudi patience is being tried by Russia and others that aren't abiding by the agreement.""WTI for May delivery dropped 34 cents to close at $47.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 20% below the 100-day average. Prices are up 20% from a year ago.Brent for May settlement fell 8 cents to $50.56 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It's the lowest close since Nov. 30. The global benchmark ended the session at a $2.86 premium to WTI.Crude supplies rose by 4.95 million to 533.1 million barrels last week, the EIA report showed on Wednesday. Prices tumbled upon the release of the data before erasing most of the loss as attention shifted to fuel stockpile gains.Gasoline inventories fell to 243.5 million barrels, while supplies of distillate fuel, which includes diesel and heating oil, slipped to 155.4 million barrels.

181,ICE,"Oil closed at the lowest level since November, erasing the gains that followed OPEC's deal to cut output, as U.S. crude supplies are forecast to climb.Futures dropped 1.8% in New York, erasing an early gain, while the S&P 500 Index fell the most in five months, as investors assessed the prospects for Donald Trump's pro-growth policies gaining congressional approval.The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute was said to have reported that U.S. supplies rose last week. Government data Wednesday will probably show stockpiles climbed to a record, a Bloomberg survey showed. Prices increased earlier amid speculation OPEC may extend its supply-cut deal past June.""There's a generalized sell-off here,"" Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, said by telephone. ""Oil has been tracking the S&P 500 pretty closely, and of course has its own issues. General expectations about what Donald Trump would do for growth helped both oil and stocks. Those are fading fast.""Oil dipped below $50 a barrel this month for the first time in 2017 as record U.S. stockpiles and rising output weighed on the reductions by OPEC and its allies. While the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries won't decide until May whether to prolong the cuts, ministers and officials from outside the group, including Russia's Alexander Novak, will meet this weekend in Kuwait to discuss the deal's progress.West Texas Intermediate for April delivery, which expired Tuesday, dropped 88 cents to $47.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the lowest close since Nov. 29. The more actively traded May contract slipped 67 cents to $48.24. May futures traded at $48.14 at 4:39 p.m. after the API report.Brent for May settlement declined 66 cents to $50.96 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude settled at a $2.72 premium to May WTI.Trump met with House Republicans Tuesday morning in Washington to rally support for the repeal of ObamaCare as investors look for signs that his plans to cut corporate taxes and boost spending will move forward. House Republicans warned that a failure to pass a health care bill could imperil tax and spending reform.""The catalyst is concern over demand due to potential difficulties with President Trump getting his pro-growth agenda through,"" Bart Melek, the head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said by phone.U.S. crude inventories eased off the highest level in more than three decades in the week ended March 10, dipping to 528.2 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a 3 million-barrel increase for the week ended March 17, which would take supplies to a new high.Nationwide crude stockpiles rose 4.53 million barrels last week, the API said, according to people familiar with the data. Supplies at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI and the biggest U.S. oil-storage hub, rose 1.97 million barrels. If the EIA reports a Cushing gain of the same size it would leave stockpiles at a record high.WTI is nearing key technical resistance levels, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 50% Fibonacci retracement from the August low of $39.19 to the January high of $55.24 stands at $47.22. The 38% retracement of rally is $45.32. Investors typically sell contracts when prices dropped below technical support.""This is a do-or-die time for the oil bulls,"" Stephen Schork, president of Schork Group, a consulting company in Villanova, Pa., said by telephone. ""Prices have to hold in the $47.22-to-$45.32 range or there will be a flush back to $40, and even lower.""

182,ICE,"Oil fell as a Libyan port is set to resume shipments and the U.S. drilling revival undermines the potential for OPEC output curbs to rebalance the market.Futures dropped 1.2% in New York. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said on March 16 that the kingdom may extend its cuts if supplies stay above the five-year average. A day later, though, data showed the U.S. rig count growing for a ninth week, and a Libya official said Sunday that the Es Sider and Ras Lanuf ports are preparing to restart oil exports.U.S. oil prices dipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in 2017 this month as near-record American stockpiles and rising output weighed on the production reductions by OPEC and its allies.While the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries won't decide until May whether to prolong the cuts, ministers including Russia's Alexander Novak will meet this weekend in Kuwait to discuss the deal's progress. Money managers cut net-long positions on oil by a record.""The reopening of the Libyan ports is the reason for today's drop, and the U.S. rig count doesn't help,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York, said by phone. ""The drop in net-length is a signal from speculators that the market is vulnerable.""West Texas intermediate crude for April delivery, which expires Tuesday, fell 56 cents to settle at $48.22 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The more actively traded May contract dropped 40 cents to $48.91. Total volume traded was about 4% below the 100-day average.Brent for May settlement slipped 14 cents to $51.62 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude closed at a $2.71 premium to May WTI, the widest since January.Futures briefly pared losses after Reuters reported that OPEC producers increasingly favor extending production cuts into the second half of the year.""This is probably a short blip,"" Michael Cohen, head of energy commodities research at Barclays in New York, said by phone. ""This spread isn't sustainable. Our forecast is that WTI will go from a $2 discount early this year to a discount of 50 cents in the second and third quarters.""U.S. oil drillers boosted the rig count by 14 to 631 last week, data from Baker Hughes showed. They have added 106 machines to fields this year. The nation's crude output has climbed to 9.1 million barrels a day, the most since February last year, according to the Energy Information Administration. The agency is projected to report that crude stockpiles rose 3 million barrels last week, according to the median response in a Bloomberg survey.""We're in a very precarious position ahead of what should be an important report this Wednesday,"" Yawger said. ""We finally got an inventory drop in last week's report, but that came with a big drop in imports that may have been temporary. The market can't take another 2-, 3- or 4-million-barrel build without breaking its back.""Libya's Es Sider and Ras Lanuf ports will restart shipping oil in one week to 10 days, Jadalla Alaokali, a board member at National Oil Corp., said by phone. The country's oil output has increased to 646,000 barrels a day from 621,000 on Sunday due to more production from Waha Oil Co., he said.

183,ICE,"Last month's Homeland Security policy memos implementing President Trump's executive orders on illegal immigration elicited the inevitable charges that the policy is un-American and that ""rounding up millions"" is a quixotic impossibility. Both charges are empty.Trump is enforcing long-standing U.S. law, which is any American president's first duty, and, while reports from around the country confirm that he is ramping up enforcement, he has abandoned his campaign cry that ""they all gotta go,"" all the estimated 11 million or more illegal immigrants.At more moderate scale, Trump's policy becomes eminently feasible with a reasonable increase in enforcement resources, while still delivering on the central promise of his campaign. Abandonment of that promise would be suicidal for Trump.Enforcement begets respect for the law. It establishes deterrence, the key dynamic which discourages the violation of any and all laws. Research (and common sense) shows that, as more violators are caught and penalties are meted out, fewer people violate the law.Trump's embrace of deterrence contrasts with Obama's virtual abandonment of it, starkly separating the two president's immigration policies. Otherwise, their policies are almost identical. Trump, like Obama, is prioritizing the deportation of convicted criminals, and he, like his predecessor, is explicitly exempting about 750,000 ""Dreamers"" brought here as young children.And Trump is temporarily exempting the estimated 5 million illegal immigrants who are parents of American citizens or legal residents (so-called DACA parents).Apart from these categorical similarities, the two presidents' overall policies couldn't be more different. Obama sought to make all illegal immigrants feel safe, with the support of many sanctuary cities and states.Trump's DHS memo, on the other hand, puts all illegal immigrants on notice ""Except as specifically noted above (""Dreamers"" and, temporarily, DAPA parents), the Department no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement."" The DHS release says it will enforce immigration laws ""against all removable aliens.""Under the Obama Administration, there was no realistic chance of being apprehended and deported, and illegal immigrants knew it. Not only was Obama's language all about nonenforcement, but the combined number of ""returns"" (turnarounds at the border) and ""removals"" (actual deportations) declined from about 1.2 million in 2008 to about 340,000 in 2016, albeit due, in part, to reduced illegal border crossings.Immigration statistics are more confusing than most, leading to Obama's undeserved reputation as ""The Deporter in Chief."" To comply with anti-human trafficking laws, hundreds of thousands apprehended near the border by Border Patrol were not ""returned"" but were turned over to Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE) and then ""removed,"" converting ""returns"" into ""removals"" under Obama.In 2016, three-quarters of Obama's 240,000 deportations were ""removals at the border,"" i.e. what would have been classified as ""returns"" under his predecessor. The Obama Administration justified its feckless enforcement with a claim of not having the resources to deport more than 400,000 annually, yet it didn't requested more resources in its annual budget requests.In addition, Obama publicized an easy-to-follow blueprint for evasion. It prioritized apprehensions within 100 miles of the border and within 14 days of illegal entry.So, illegal immigrants knew to move immediately away from the border and keep a low profile for a couple of weeks. In many ways, any noncriminal deported under Obama was either unusually unlucky or unusually inept.Not only were the odds of apprehension negligible, but Obama followed a policy of ""catch and release."" As a result, today, there are about 2 million illegal immigrants on the ""nondetained docket,"" a list of those apprehended, but not detained or deported. Without catch-and-release, ""millions would have been rounded up.""Trump's policy is the direct opposite on all counts, and it is eminently reasonable. In addition to prioritizing apprehension of criminals, he should prioritize the deportation of those who've received a ""final removal order."" These violators number almost 1 million today. They have had their day in court. There's no reason not to deport them.Indeed, during last year's primaries, virtually all the leading Republican candidates went on the record saying they would deport them. When I asked Jeb Bush, he said ""I would. You can create a deterrent effect.""If President Trump does so, he should be able to count on solid GOP support in Congress, including the funding to hire more Border Patrol and ICE agents and more immigration court prosecutors, judges and staff.In the primaries, Marco Rubio said he would deport them, adding, ""As the son of immigrants, I can tell you that enforcing immigration laws is not anti-immigrant."" He continued, saying that enforcement against illegal immigrants doesn't make America anti-immigrant, because, after all, we admit about 1 million legal immigrants every year, more than any other nation on Earth.

"
185,ICE,"The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the House GOP plan to repeal and replace most of ObamaCare would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 24 million by 2026.Because the GOP bill would mostly retain ObamaCare coverage rules, insurance would be unaffordable for lower-income and older adults with the new, smaller tax credits on offer, so some 30 million people wouldn't claim the GOP tax credit averaging $3,000 in 2020 and rising with inflation. That would add up to more than $600 billion in unclaimed subsidies through 2026, or roughly the same $600 billion amount by which House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan cuts taxes. Those unspent subsidies go a long way to explaining why CBO found that the American Health Care Act would reduce deficits by $323 billion over a decade.Concerns about coverage losses, particularly under Medicaid, have weighed on the shares of hospital groups like Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA), and Medicaid-focused insurers like Centene (CNC) and Molina Healthcare (MOH). Other major insurers including Anthem (ANTM), one of the biggest exchange players, and UnitedHealth (UNH), have fared better amid the ObamaCare repeal debate.(Tenet Healthcare fell 3.1% on the stock market today, ahead of the CBO report released after the closing bell. HCA slid 0.9%. Centene shares rose 1.5% but Molina's sank 1%. Anthem advanced 0.5% and UnitedHealth 0.1%. Health stocks did not move much in late trading.)The increase in the ranks of the uninsured under the plan put together by House Speaker Paul Ryan would come as 14 million lose Medicaid coverage, the number of people covered by employer plans falls by 7 million and individual market coverage drops by 2 million.The budget scorekeeper's view that the American Health Care Act will substantially reduce the deficit and eventually lower average insurance premiums — by about 10%, due to rules that favor young adults, less comprehensive coverage and a reinsurance fund — may provide House GOP leaders enough encouragement to keep pushing their plan. Yet the official score of RyanCare provides reason to the think that the GOP bid to repeal ObamaCare faces high odds of failure.While the House bill easily passes the budget test, it does so by dramatically increasing the ranks of the uninsured in a way that several moderate GOP senators have criticized. That means there may not be a great deal of flexibility in improving health insurance outcomes without violating the deficit-neutral hurdle required for Senate passage via reconciliation.IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.Any bill passed via reconciliation will have to be at least deficit-neutral in the 11th year and beyond. CBO's score of the House bill in the 10th year shows a hefty $92 billion surplus. That's partly due to the inclusion of the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% tax on the cost of employer health insurance above a set threshold.The Cadillac tax has faced bipartisan opposition, which eventually led Congress to put it on ice until 2020. Including the tax may make the budget numbers add up but may risk losing support among both moderates and conservatives.The key point is that, even with the Cadillac tax, there may be less room than it appears for higher subsidies or less stringent Medicaid cuts that will still allow the budget numbers add up. With conservatives complaining about RyanCare because it does too much to preserve ObamaCare, there's also a risk that RyanCare could lose support on the right if the GOP makes significant concessions to moderates.For perspective, the additional 24 million uninsured under the GOP plan, on top of an estimated 6 million who don't claim subsidies they are eligible for under ObamaCare, would leave more than $100 billion in tax credits unclaimed in 2026 alone, an IBD analysis finds. That's more than the $92 billion in net budget savings that year. Increasing subsidies to entice or enable many more people to get coverage could wreck the plan's budget score.One last point: Republicans are talking about a multiphase process that would eventually include a relaxing of ObamaCare benefit requirements. That's to be expected, since the one thing Republicans seem to agree on about health care is that the government shouldn't tell people what kind of health insurance they have to buy.If ObamaCare's essential benefits requirements were axed, health policy experts believe that insurers would inevitably offer people coverage that costs no more than the value of their tax credit under the GOP plan. In other words, people would find a way to use their tax credits, even if they could only afford to buy the skimpiest coverage — too little in many cases to be considered insured under CBO's assessment. Still, if that's the GOP's eventual plan, it means that the CBO is underestimating the true cost of RyanCare by about $600 billion.RELATED:Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesThe Biggest Puzzle About Paul Ryan's ObamaCare RepealTrumpCare Has Momentum: These Health Stocks Are Scrambling

186,ICE,"OPEC and its partners have seen the post-agreement oil rally evaporate as the U.S. inventory glut becomes impossible to ignore.West Texas Intermediate closed at the lowest since Nov. 29, the day before OPEC approved the first supply cuts in eight years. Crude supplies rose 8.2 million to the highest level in weekly government data since 1982. Harold Hamm, the U.S. shale oil billionaire, warned on Wednesday that the industry could ""kill"" the market if it embarks on another spending binge. The market swoon stoked the second-highest WTI options trading volume ever.Oil had fluctuated above $50 a barrel since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other countries started trimming supply for six months starting Jan. 1 to reduce a global glut. While U.S. shale output has rebounded, larger-than-expected cuts elsewhere and signs of growing demand suggest stockpiles will eventually decline, according to Goldman Sachs Group.""People are nervous about the global supply-demand balance,"" Adam Sieminski, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and former head of the Energy Information Administration, said by telephone. ""Shale is coming back with $50 oil and there's uncertainty about whether OPEC and its partners are going to roll over the production agreement.""West Texas Intermediate for April delivery dropped $1, or 2%, to close at $49.28 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

187,ICE,"Oil slid on concerns that supplies may rise once the summer driving season ends, with traders shrugging off an industry report showing U.S. stockpiles declined.Crude inventories dropped by 7.84 million barrels last week in an American Petroleum Institute report released Tuesday, people familiar with the data said. That would be the largest draw since September if Energy Information Administration data confirm it Wednesday. However, stockpile declines are common during this time of year. The EIA Tuesday raised U.S. oil output forecasts while cutting price estimates for this year.There are only about ""five more weeks of draws and then inventories start to rise again. You're coming rapidly to the end of the draw season for crude,"" Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, said by telephone.Oil in New York climbed above $50 a barrel early last week, but then swiftly retreated below that key level as signs of elevated global supplies stoked concerns that output-cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners aren't helping to rebalance the market as expected. That comes amid rising output from producers such as Libya, Nigeria and the U.S. and lower compliance by some nations to the output-reduction deal.West Texas Intermediate for September delivery traded at $48.96 a barrel at 5:20 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange after settling at $49.17. Total volume traded was about 16% above the 100-day average.Brent for October settlement declined 23 cents to end the session at $52.14 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.

Compliance with the output-reduction deal was 86% in July, according to a recent Bloomberg survey.U.S. crude output will average 9.35 million barrels a day this year, rising from a previous forecast of 9.33 million and is seen at 9.91 million barrels a day in 2018, according to the EIA's Short-Term Energy Outlook. The agency cut its WTI price forecast for this year to $48.88 a barrel from $48.95, and reduced its Brent forecast to $50.71 from $50.79.Gasoline supplies rose by 1.53 million barrels last week, and inventories at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI, increased by 319,000 barrels, the API was said to report. Nationwide crude stockpiles probably decreased by 2.2 million barrels, according to a Bloomberg survey before the release of EIA data. Gasoline inventories slid by 1.5 million barrels, the survey showed.Crude stockpiles at Cushing, the biggest U.S. oil-storage hub, probably increased by 200,000 barrels last week, according to a forecast compiled by Bloomberg.""We're in the last big month of the driving season and the question is, can OPEC balance the lower fall and winter demand?""

That's the big problem.""

Libya's production recovery was back on track as operations at its biggest oil field, Sharara, returned to normal after being halted Sunday by armed protesters. Rebounding Libyan supply has hindered efforts by fellow OPEC members to plug a global glut. Worldwide drilling reached its highest in almost two years in July, according to Baker Hughes.""The only thing we have is what comes out of the OPEC meeting,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by telephone.

189,ICE,"With the bond ETF industry celebrating an anniversary last month, it's high time to take a look at those funds.""Right smack in the midst of a bear market for U.S. equities, the first four bond ETFs started trading 15 years ago this week,"" Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's director of ETF and Mutual Fund Research, wrote in a July 25 report. ""Fast forward to today, and U.S. listed bond ETFs have pulled in more than $530 billion of net assets.""XThe first four bond funds began trading on July 22, 2002. They are: iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (TLT), iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond (SHY), iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond (IEF) and iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond (LQD). There are now more than 300 U.S.-listed ETF bond market offerings.Equities have outperformed bonds so far this year as the stock market continues hitting new highs. But SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Convertible Securities (CWB) returned nearly 13% through Aug. 1, topping other bond funds and outpacing the S&P 500's 11.9% year-to-date gain (see table below).The fund, launched in April 2009, has gathered $4.2 billion in assets. CWB holds convertible bonds, which can be exchanged into a set number of common shares in the future. The biggest sector weightings as of Aug. 1 were utilities, 74%, health care 16% and about 10% in industrials. The ETF offers a 4.09% annualized yield, well above the S&P 500's average 1.91% payout.Shares are pulling back near the 50-day moving average and could set up a potential buy opportunity on a solid rebound off the line. CWB advanced 5% following each of its prior two 50-day bounces in July and May. It carries a 0.40% expense ratio.Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury (EDV), which tracks the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Treasury STRIPS 20-30 Year Equal Par Bond Index, returned 8.7% through Aug. 1. The $578.1 million fund seeks to provide high current income with high credit quality. The average effective maturity of its holdings is 25 years and the average credit quality is AAA, according to Morningstar Inc.EDV, which marks its 10th anniversary in December, has an annual dividend yield of 2.89%. Its expense ratio is 0.07%.Further down the list is one of the first bond funds, iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond with a 6.2% YTD gain. The $7.4 billion fund tracks the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index. Its bond holdings have an average effective maturity of just above 26 years and AAA average credit quality. TLT, which has a 0.15% expense ratio, offers a 2.49% yield.Both EDV and TLT have advanced since the Fed held interest rates steady July 26 and said it would wait to start unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Goldman Sachs forecasts that once it begins doing so, the 10-year Treasury yield could rise by 20 basis points over time. Bond yields move inversely to prices.""The Federal Reserve's rate-hike program has started, but the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond and other fixed income securities have not climbed meaningfully higher in the last few years,"" Rosenbluth said. ""This trend will not persist forever, and investors can prepare to reduce their rate sensitivity with lower-duration products.""Of the other three original bond ETFs, LQD returned 5.3% YTD, IEF 3.1% and SHY 0.6%.""With 15 years of history, bond ETFs have weathered the global financial crisis, quantitative easing and several rounds of interest rate hikes,"" Matthew Tucker, head of fixed income strategy at iShares, noted in a recent report. ""Now investors can use bond ETFs to build model portfolios, follow asset allocation guidance, or express their own tactical views, all in a low-cost manner.""The first four bond ETFs are among the biggest in their category, but none of them is the biggest. That distinction belongs to another iShares ETF: iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG). The fund, which debuted in September 2003, weighs in at $48.57 billion in assets.  AGG tracks the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index, which measures the performance of the total U.S. investment-grade bond market. AGG is up nearly 3% this year, yields 2.4% and carries an expense ratio of  just 0.06%. RELATED:The Fed Just Gave A Green Light To Wall StreetBond Funds End Q2 On A Positive Note After Fed Hikes RatesWhere Does Top Asset Manager BlackRock See Opportunities?

190,ICE,"Oil slipped as investors weigh concerns over rising production from America's shale fields against the steady decline in crude stockpiles.Futures fell 0.7% in New York after inching closer to $50 a barrel earlier. A decline in U.S. inventories and a rise in fuel demand helped prop up prices on Wednesday, while production at its highest since July 2015 is stirring fears of a persistent glut. Meanwhile shale producers like EOG Resources (EOG) are boasting higher production targets in their earnings reports. Adding to the worries, Andy Hall, one of the most storied oil traders, is said to be closing down a fund.Oil climbed above the key $50-a-barrel-level this week for the first time since May as Saudi Arabia  promises to trim exports this month. But investors continue to evaluate whether output curbs by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are helping to get the market back on track.""In the end, it looks like we are continuing to see lower inventories, not only on the oil side, but also on the product side. Demand remains quite robust,"" Bart Melek, head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said by telephone. Yet, prices won't rally too much further ""until there is more certainty surrounding OPEC policy and what the fundamentals will look like into next year.""Hall, who has been trading oil since the 1970s and has sometimes been referred to as ""God"" by his peers, is closing down his main hedge fund after large losses in the first half of the year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The global crude market has ""materially worsened"" and prices may be stuck around $50 a barrel or below, Hall told investors in his Astenbeck Capital Management firm in a letter last month.The legendary trader, who gained notoriety in 2009 when he earned a $100 million pay package from Citigroup, had until recently been one of the most bullish voices in the market.""This Andy Hall story sometimes can be just enough to get people to take at least a short-term move in the market,"" Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said by telephone. ""When you don't have a lot to go on, sometimes a headline like that can be enough to get a few people to cover and get a few computers to light up.""West Texas Intermediate for September delivery dropped 34 cents to $49.25 a barrel at 12:40 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 6% above the 100-day average. The contract advanced 43 cents to $49.59 on Wednesday.Brent for October settlement lost 10 cents to $52.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, after advancing 58 cents on Wednesday. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $2.85 to October-delivery WTI.Brent futures for the nearest delivery traded at a premium of 2 cents to those for the following month. This pattern, known as backwardation, typically signals tighter supplies, while the opposite contango structure signals a glut. The front-month spread had settled in backwardation on July 28 before flipping back to contango.U.S. production increased by 20,000 barrels a day to 9.43 million last week, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 1.53 million barrels, while gasoline stockpiles dropped to the lowest level since December. Gasoline consumption surged to a record high.""People have the sense that although visible inventories have tightened somewhat, that maybe the unmeasured inventories, floating inventories, have been moving now toward rebalancing,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts, said by telephone.

191,ICE,"In a newspaper piece about a White House in turmoil, a prominent paper described an atmosphere of beleaguered aides confused by their unscripted boss, a man who needed a ""rudder on what many believed was a loose and listing ship.""This is not from a recent piece about President Donald Trump's White House. The Washington Post, in 1997, wrote this about President Bill Clinton and the state of his presidency in mid-1994. The White House staff, wrote the Post, ""was suffering from what increasingly looked to be callowness and naivete."" Enter veteran congressman and new chief of staff Leon Panetta, who learned, as he put it, that ""no one had an organizational chart."" He added, ""As far as I know, anybody who walked down the hall walked in (to the Oval Office)."" Clinton, whose approval ratings were at one time about as bad as Trump's, went on to an easy re-election.As to Trump's changing of White House personnel, President Barack Obama, over his two terms, had five chiefs of staff. One ""interim"" chief of staff lasted less time than did Reince Priebus. Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, two-term presidents, had four each.Obama had four secretaries of Defense, more than Clinton and Reagan. In the case of Obama's first three, upon departure, they had significant policy differences with the boss.Leon Panetta, Obama's second secretary of Defense, complained about what he considered Obama's poor leadership, one that ""avoids the battle, complains and misses opportunities."" On Iraq, Panetta felt that Obama ""kind of lost his way"" when he pulled out all the troops over Panetta's objection.Obama declared a ""red line"" in Syria, that the U.S. would strike if Syria used chemical weapons. Panetta criticized Obama's flip-flop, which left the decision to Congress, which, Panetta says, was, ""as he well knew, an almost certain way to scotch any action."" This hurt America's credibility, Panetta said, because ""the power of the United States rests on its word, and clear signals are important both to deter adventurism and to reassure allies that we can be counted on.""On Obama's deliberation over whether to intervene in Libya, Robert Gates, his first secretary of Defense, a holdover from the George W. Bush administration, wrote: ""I was running out of patience on multiple fronts, but most of all people blithely talking about the use of military force as though it were some kind of video game."" White House staff, said Gates, were ""talking about military options with the President without Defense being involved.""He even said that Hillary Clinton and Obama both admitted that when they were in the Senate and opposed the Iraq ""surge,"" they did so for political, not technical, reasons. Gates was shocked that they so candidly admitted it during a meeting he attended: ""Hillary told the president that her opposition to the (2007) surge in Iraq had been political because she was facing him in the Iowa primary. ... The President conceded vaguely that opposition to the Iraq surge had been political. To hear the two of them making these admissions, and in front of me, was as surprising as it was dismaying.""Gates dismissed the then-pending Iran nuclear deal as a ""hope"" that Gates called ""unrealistic"": ""The pursuit of the agreement is based on the President's hope that over a 10-year period with the sanctions being lifted that the Iranians will become a constructive stakeholder. ... That as their economy begins to grow again ... they will abandon their ideology, their theology, their revolutionary principles, their meddling in various parts of the region. And frankly, I believe that's very unrealistic.""Speaking of dysfunction, Obama's secretary of Defense No. 3, Chuck Hagel, said the Obama White House tried to ""destroy"" him even after he submitted his resignation, with some administration officials maligning him in anonymous comments to the media during his last days in office. ""I don't know what the purpose was,"" he said. ""To this day, I'm still mystified by that."" Hagel reportedly battled the White House's micromanaging of the Pentagon. He claimed the chairman of the Joint Chiefs complained, ""White House staffers were calling generals 'and asking fifth-level questions that the White House should not be involved in.'"" These were serious criticisms by ex-secretaries of Defense about an incumbent president during wartime. Yet the media did not foam at the mouth.This is not to say that there haven't been missteps, pullbacks and recalibrations at a dizzying rate in Trump's new administration. This stems from the top, and the recent personnel changes make it clear that Trump knows he needs discipline. Business and politics are two different creatures, as a frustrated President Trump has, no doubt, discovered. Building an ice rink in Central Park under budget and ahead of schedule is one thing. Getting a consensus on political issues like ""repeal and replace"" is quite another.But few remember the tumult of the early Clinton months. If Trump succeeds in getting the economy humming at about 3 percent growth, the musical chairs of today will be a distant memory.

Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Khalid Al-Falih, said in Houston Tuesday that global supplies have been slower to decline than OPEC and its partners expected, leaving the door open for an extension of cuts that started in January.""The crude market is losing patience,"" Mike Wittner, head of commodities research at Societe Generale SA in New York, said by phone. ""The big rally in December after the OPEC agreement was based on expectations that the cuts would balance the market. While it looks like OPEC has cut more than 1 million barrels a day of output, it's difficult to see any impact on U.S. stockpiles.""West Texas intermediate crude for April delivery dropped $2.86, or 5.4%, to settle at $50.28 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest close since Dec. 7. It was the biggest decline since Feb. 9, 2016. Total volume traded was about 55% above the 100-day average.Brent for May settlement tumbled $2.81, or 5%, to $53.11 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, also the lowest close since Dec. 7.Saudi Arabia and Russia, the architects of the deal, presented a united front on complying with the cuts at the CERAWeek conference Tuesday in Houston. Alongside officials from Iraq and Mexico, they insisted the curbs are working.Managed money reduced its record wagers on price climbs in data released last week.

""The comments at the conference weren't reassuring to the market, and the crude inventory builds are going to continue for a while given the low utilization rates.""Supplies climbed 8.21 million barrels to the highest in weekly data going back to 1982 as production rose to the highest in a year.Wednesday's market swoon has led to a return of volatility. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Crude Oil Volatility Index climbed to the highest level in two months after falling to the lowest since October 2014 on March 1.""As long as inventories do not drop, the market will be volatile,"" Total SA Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said Wednesday in Houston.Energy companies were the worst performers on the S&P 500.

OPEC members Iraq and Angola signaled at the same conference on Monday that they're willing to prolong the accord if it's necessary. U.S. crude production is projected to surge to a record next year as domestic drillers respond to higher prices spurred by the cuts elsewhere, according to a government report.Crude has fluctuated above $50 a barrel since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other state producers started trimming output on Jan. 1. The rally in recent months has spurred a rebound in U.S. shale-oil production, but larger-than-expected cuts elsewhere and signs of growing demand suggest stockpiles will decline, Goldman Sachs Group's Jeff Currie said on Bloomberg TV.""If OPEC can stick to its cuts and shale output doesn't climb more than expected, oil can break to the upside,"" Tim Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd. in Calgary, said by phone. ""Seasonally, this is a time when inventories build so traders are being cautious.

Overall, index movements were minor, although the Nasdaq and Dow reached new highs during the session.Volume was higher, according to unconfirmed numbers.Defensive industry groups led Wall Street. Soap, soft drinks, food wholesalers and auto parts were in the top six of the day. But chip designers, internet content providers and online retailers also were among the session leaders.After the close, Zillow Group (Z) fell sharply.

Volume was flat, which was another indication the breakout is premature. The chip company reports quarterly results after the close Thursday. Air Lease (AL) also couldn't stick above its buy point. The stock topped the 37.33 entry, only to slip right back into the flat base. Volume was below average for the airline plane leasing firm.

198,ICE,"In the 2000s, there was Bush Derangement Syndrome, but it faded after Barack Obama was elected. Then came Trump Derangement Syndrome after it turned out that it wasn't Hillary Clinton's turn after all. It, too, will fade after Donald Trump is either voted out of office or serves two terms.Yet with us always and forever, it seems, is the Global Warming Derangement Syndrome.Just as Democrats and journalists, typically Democrats with a media pipeline, have lost their minds over the Trump election and have vilified him as a sprite from Hades — often claiming things that are simply untrue and repeatedly declaring him to be mentally ill just because they disagree with his policies or found something he's said or tweeted that violates their ever-flexible sensibilities — they've gone around the glacier over climate change.It seems a day can't go by without at least one mainstream media outlet reporting that Old Testament-esque disasters have already begun, or covering the rant of an elected official who is yammering on about how the end is near if big policy changes are immediately enacted. Consider the reaction from Trump's announcement that he's pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord. Contact with reality was severed.Well, actually it's been severed for some time. It's the media and alarmists' distance from reality that has moved. How else to explain how the alarmists, with a supportive media, could rip Trump for backing out of a deal they said was insufficient to start with?Yet they did, even though James Hansen, the global warming alarmist in chief, said when the Paris accord was agreed to that it was ""a fraud really, a fake.""But this is only a small portion of the derangement that has produced a rising ocean of fake news.For years we've been bombarded with claims that we had only so many months or years to do something about climate change, only to have those deadlines pass without incident; that every ice shelf that has naturally broken off from a landmass or glacier that's receded is a sign of imminent human-caused disaster; that heavy storms are indisputable evidence that man is cooking his planet with carbon dioxide emissions; that our capitalism-driven advancements are going to eventually cause famine, war, and economic and civilizational doom.The alarmists' screeching is incessant, their lectures grating and without restraint, their hypocrisy as fetid as the wrong side of a sewage treatment plant. And of course their fanaticism is so rigid they cannot acknowledge anything that challenges their narrative.Such as a report issued last month that says the global average surface temperature (GAST) data that are used to frighten and force everyone to surrender to the leftist-progressive agenda ""are not a valid representation of reality.""The report says that ""it is impossible to conclude from the three published GAST data sets that recent years have been the warmest ever — despite current claims of record setting warming.""This isn't a news release from an oil company trying to pass a public relations effort off as science. It is authentic work that has been, in the words of a Zero Hedge blogger, ""peer reviewed by administrators, scientists and researchers from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.), and several of America's leading universities.""But it will be tossed into the ""Ignore"" baskets in the mainstream media's newsrooms, just as these ""80 graphs from 58 new (2017) papers invalidate claims of unprecedented global-scale modern warming"" will also be trashed.Because none fit the narrative. Because none will help the Democrat-media industrial complex ""Dump Trump."" Because all challenge the ""scientific consensus"" and therefore the power and status that the alarmists have seized through their campaign of fear and intimidation. Because this is just the deranged way the political left and its media wing operate.RELATED:Global Warming: The Imminent Crisis That Never ArrivesFor Climate Change Hypocrites, U.S. Is Too Frackin' MuchGlobal Warming Alarmists Who Say End Is Near Reach Mental Tipping Point

Output fell to 32.17 million barrels a day in February, a 65,000 barrel-a-day drop from January, the first month of the agreement.As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 other nations trim supply in an effort to end a glut, U.S. producers are ramping up and potentially offsetting the curbs.

Crude production rose to 9.03 million barrels a day, the highest since March 2016.Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, cut pricing for April oil sales to the U.S. and Northwest Europe and trimmed most grades for buyers in Asia and the Mediterranean. State-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco, cut its official pricing for Arab Light crude to Asia by 30 cents, to 15 cents a barrel below the regional benchmark, it said in an emailed statement.""When you lower price on anything your mission is to sell more of it,"" Yawger said. ""You are looking to capture market share at the expense of profit.""Crude prices also retreated because of the falling gasoline crack spread, a measure of profit margins from refining crude into the fuel, according Olivier Jakob, managing director at consultants Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland.April gasoline futures dropped 2.1% to $1.6433 a gallon on the Nymex. The crack spread slipped as much as 6.5% to $15.561.

A 3 million-barrel supplies gain was projected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before the Energy Information Administration report.Compliance among the 10 OPEC members that pledged to cut production rose to 89%, while gains from other members meant total output rose slightly, consultant JBC Energy said.As the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 nonmember nations work to reduce supply to end a three-year glut, U.S. producers are ramping up, sowing speculation they may fill the gap. That has so far subdued price swings, sending the Chicago Board Options Exchange Crude Oil Volatility Index on Monday to the lowest since October 2014.""The market's still in a struggle between OPEC cuts and the reality that there's a lot of oil in storage here,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass., said by telephone.

Meanwhile, U.S. inventories probably climbed to an all-time high last week, according to a Bloomberg survey before the government's next report on Wednesday.While U.S. inventory gains have begun to slow, Citigroup sees OPEC needing to extend cuts beyond the planned six-month duration to trim the global glut it created by boosting output prior to the deal. A resurgence of exploration and production from American shale plays has kept prices in a tight range above $50 this year.Money managers boosted their bets on rising oil prices to a record on speculation that OPEC's production curbs will eventually ease the global supply glut.""The market has a lot of length, which is due to exuberance regarding OPEC,"" Kyle Cooper, director of research with IAF Advisors in Houston, said by telephone.

The International Energy Agency raised its estimate for 2017 global demand growth by about 100,000 barrels a day to 1.4 million, the strongest in two years. Yet the agency said it needs to wait longer to confirm whether the supply-demand rebalancing process started as forecast in the second quarter.""Demand is starting to pick up in the back end of the year and things are looking a little bit better,"" Michael Loewen, a commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said by telephone. ""The market's starting to realize that.""Oil has traded below $50 a barrel since May amid concern that rising global supply will offset curbs by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and partners including Russia.

207,ICE,"Oil rose the most in more than a week Tuesday after the Energy Information Administration cut its U.S. crude output forecast for next year and as investors focused on the pace of rebalancing.Futures advanced 1.4% in New York, after fluctuating between gains and losses during the session. The EIA cut its 2018 crude output forecast to 9.9 million barrels a day from 10.01 estimated in June. It's the first time the EIA lowered its forecast for 2018 production since the agency started posting the estimates in January. The market earlier shrugged off a report that Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, told OPEC it raised output above its agreed-upon limits.""This pullback in production is kind of wake-up call to people who thought that shale was going to be viable no matter what OPEC did,"" Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, said by telephone. If output doesn't rise as much as previously anticipated, ""then it's time for the bears to start questioning their religion again.""Oil has traded below $50 a barrel since May amid concern that rising global supplies will offset curbs by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners including Russia. Increases in output from Libya and Nigeria, as well as a rising U.S. rig count and production, have been diluting the impact of supply curbs. OPEC needs to increase output cuts with little public announcement in order to jolt investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.Saudi Arabia told OPEC it pumped 10.07 million barrels a day in June, above its 10.058 million limit set last year, according to a person with knowledge of the data. The country usually boosts production during summer months to meet power demand for air conditioning, leaving less output for exports.While Saudi Arabia producing above its target is not seen as a positive sign, ""if you put it in the seasonal context, people understand that Saudi Arabia typically raises production over the summer,"" Harry Tchilinguirian, the head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA in London, said by telephone.West Texas Intermediate for August delivery advanced 64 cents to settle at $45.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest gain since July 3.

208,ICE,"Oil closed above $44 a barrel Monday as the market weighed the likelihood and potential effectiveness of Libya and Nigeria capping production.The two African producers, which have boosted output since being exempt from OPEC cuts, have been invited to a July 24 meeting in Russia to discuss the stability of their production, Kuwait's Oil Minister Issam Almarzooq said in Istanbul. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said the oil market situation will be discussed at the meeting and the pact between OPEC and non-OPEC is working ""successfully.""The possibility of Libya and Nigeria agreeing to production caps is giving investors hope that prices may rise, though the uncertainty is causing ""a seesaw effect,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass., said by telephone. ""People are worried that it could turn out to be a prolonged affair getting them to the table to sign off on something.""Oil has traded below $50 a barrel since May in New York amid concerns that elevated global oil inventories and rising output from the U.S. and other producers will offset cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners. U.S. shale production can expand with prices in the mid-$40s, according to JPMorgan. Libya and Nigeria together added 440,000 barrels a day of production in May and June as fields restarted, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.West Texas Intermediate for August delivery rose 17 cents, or 0.4%, to settle at $44.40 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after trading in a $1.19-range.

""If they can put a freeze, that remains to be seen, but that will be an important driver in terms of really reducing OPEC's exports.""Deepening production cuts already agreed to by OPEC and partners is not on the agenda for the July 24 meeting in St. Petersburg, Almarzooq said. It's premature to talk about that option, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said in Istanbul.BNP Paribas cut its 2017 Brent forecast by $9 to $51 a barrel and for 2018 by $15 to $48, while making similar reductions for WTI.

U.S. supplies probably rose by 3.25 million barrels last week, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before an Energy Information Administration report Thursday. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will release its inventory data on Wednesday. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries must prolong the curbs beyond six months in order to have a significant impact on bloated global stockpiles, said Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of Total.A surge in U.S. crude stockpiles to the highest level in more than three decades has kept oil futures in a tight range above $50 a barrel this year, offsetting supply cuts by OPEC and 11 other nations. It's too early to say whether the production agreement could be extended beyond its initial six-month term, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said.""The fundamentals actually do matter sometimes,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by telephone.

""There's a massive overhang in supply, which just doesn't justify WTI at over $55.""The pace of the decline in global oil stockpiles, which OPEC wants to see fall back in line with the five-year average, will determine the group's next move, Barkindo said. Representatives of member countries are meeting in Vienna on Wednesday to discuss compliance with their Nov. 30 supply accord.""If they want really to have an impact on the market, which means to have the inventories going down because inventories are quite high, it will have to be extended beyond May,"" Pouyanne said Tuesday in a Bloomberg television interview in New York. ""I'm convinced that they will do it.""The CEO of the French oil and natural gas company said he's ""not fully convinced"" that tough times for the industry are over. Factors including rising U.S. shale oil production and increasing output from Libya may continue to have a negative impact on prices, Pouyanne said.""If OPEC wants to get oil trading in a $60-to-$70 band they will have to continue with the quota, extending it for another six months,"" Cavan Yie, senior equity analyst at Manulife Asset Management in Toronto, said by telephone.

210,ICE,"Immigration: What a difference an election makes. When President Obama was in the White House, Democrats were crowing about the historic number of illegal immigrants he was deporting each year. Now, every arrest of an illegal immigrant is a cause for protests.When President Trump's Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly announced on Monday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement had arrested 680 illegals — 75% of whom are convicted criminals — the left had another emotional breakdown.The enforcement actions were called ""sweeping"" and part of an ""immigration crackdown"" under Trump. Pro-immigration groups said the ""level of intimidation seems new."" Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer called it ""deeply disturbing"" and said that ""undocumented immigrants"" were ""confused and scared.""In fact, it was just ICE doing its job, as they made clear in the statement on Monday. As Kelly explained, ""ICE conducts these kinds of targeted enforcement operations regularly, and has for many years.""Indeed, less than two weeks after President Obama was inaugurated in 2009, ICE arrested 140 illegals in raids in Georgia, the Carolinas and Colorado. These weren't criminals, either. They had simply failed to show up at immigration hearings.By the end of 2009 year, ICE deported a total of more than 390,000 illegal aliens — a record high — only a third of whom had criminal records. Deportations would continue at record highs throughout Obama's two terms in office.There were no protests. There were no highway blockades. There was no wailing and gnashing of teeth, or cries about the inhumanity of it all. In fact, outside of ICE news releases and the occasional grumbling from pro-immigration groups, these deportations went completely unremarked.That is, until the Obama administration — including Obama himself — started to openly brag about how many illegals were being deported.Obama's Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano promised in 2011 that the rapid pace of deportations would continue. ""The numbers are going to be very robust in terms of numbers of removal — we don't fool around about this,"" Napolitano said that summer. ""Our border enforcement is second to none.""Obama liked to say that in his first five years, he'd deported more illegals than President Bush had over his entire eight.Democrats didn't mind this kind of tough talk one bit. Marshall Fitz of the left-wing Center for American Progress noted in 2014 that Homeland Security was ""patting itself on the back for reaching these record numbers"" because ""it was important to show they were serious about this.""And when conservatives complained that Obama was inflating his deportation numbers by including ""returns"" — those caught crossing the border who were sent back — as well as ""removals,"" journalists rushed in to defend the White House, pointing out that those returns were part of an enhanced process that made it far less likely that those sent back would try again.So we ask, what has changed between then and now, other than the tough-talking new occupant of the White House and the determination of his critics to protest anything and everything that happens on his watch?RELATED:Trump's Right: Law-Breaking 'Sanctuary Cities' Must Obey The LawAre We Going To Freak Out Every Time Trump Does What He Promised?Now We Know: Those 'Spontaneous' Anti-Trump Airport Protests Weren't Spontaneous At All

213,ICE,"Oil declined in New York as OPEC's supply cuts are tempered by a revival of shale drilling in the U.S.Futures slid 1.7% in New York, the biggest drop in more than three weeks. Saudi Arabia told OPEC it cut oil production by the most in eight years, while Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzooq said the organization as a whole has delivered 92% of the output curbs it pledged. Meanwhile, U.S. oil drillers increased the rig count to the highest since October 2015, and the Energy Information Administration sees U.S. shale-oil output jumping next month to the highest level since May 2016.Oil has fluctuated above $50 a barrel since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 other nations started trimming supply from Jan. 1 to help ease a global glut. The market will shift into a deficit during the first half of the year, and U.S. crude stockpiles will shrink amid a decline in imports as the curbs take effect, Goldman Sachs said last week. Higher crude prices have spurred drilling in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer.""This is where the market takes a pause,"" Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas in London, said by telephone.

The global benchmark closed at a premium of $2.16 to April WTI.A monthly report from OPEC on Monday showed the group lowered production by about 890,000 barrels a day in January, citing so-called secondary-source numbers. Saudi Arabia reduced output by 717,600 barrels a day last month. Venezuela's Oil Minister Nelson Martinez said the country will reach 100% of its reduction goal in February.The 11 OPEC nations bound by the accord cut production by 1.12 million barrels a day to 29.93 million a day last month, according to a Feb. 10 report from the International Energy Agency. Non-OPEC producers who are part of the deal implemented 269,000 barrels of their pledged cuts of 558,000 barrels a day in January. Even if all those reductions are made, total supply from outside OPEC will increase by 400,000 barrels a day this year.While the cartel implements its deal, exempt producers are ramping up output. Libya's production rose for a fifth month to 690,000 barrels day in January, the highest level in more than two years, while Nigeria's output expanded to 1.6 million barrels a day last month.U.S. crude production jumped to the highest since April 2016 in the week ended Feb. 3, according to EIA data. Output from major U.S. shale plays is  forecast to grow to 4.87 million barrels a day in March, with production in the Permian Basin rising to 2.25 million barrels a day. Nationwide crude stockpiles probably rose by 3.25 million barrels last week, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.""OPEC did its job in that it was able to put a floor under the market. Compliance has exceeded most people's expectations,"" Bruno Stanziale, director of commodity strategy at Eurasia Group, said by telephone. ""However, they have to come to the realization that they are only going to be cutting production to bring prices to a level where shale producers will start to invigorate drilling and that's what we are seeing.""

217,ICE,"In the Audi Super Bowl ad, a male voice in grave tones says:""What do I tell my daughter?""Do I tell that her grandpa is worth more than her grandma?""That her dad is worth more than her mom?""Do I tell her that despite her education, her drive, her skills, her intelligence, she will automatically be valued as less than every man she ever meets?""Or maybe ... I'll be able to tell her something different.""If there was ever a more mendacious or socially destructive ad during the Super Bowl, let alone on television, I am unaware of it.As a believer in the free market and the free exchange of ideas, I have rarely advocated for or participated in a boycott of a company for the political positions of its owners or directors. I eat Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream despite the fact that I have opposed every left-wing political and social position Ben and Jerry have ever advocated. It's a free country. And I want to keep it free.But Audi crossed a line. It should pay an appropriate price.First, we need to stop the politicization of everything in America. We need to be able to watch sports, for example, without the intrusion of left-wing propaganda. I would feel the same about right-wing propaganda, but the right believes in allowing people to enjoy life without injecting politics wherever possible.Second, the ad sent the false and debilitating message to every girl that being born in America is to be born oppressed and persecuted. ""I am a woman, therefore I am a victim,"" it says.In the words of the ad, ""she will automatically be valued as less than every man she ever meets."" It is hard to imagine a worse message to give a child. I devote an entire chapter in my book on happiness (""Happiness Is a Serious Problem"") to victimhood because regarding oneself as a victim makes happiness impossible. This is a big reason many feminists are unhappy human beings.Third, the ad sent a false and destructive view of America as a country in which Grandpa is worth more than Grandma, and Dad is worth more than Mom. It is an accusation that is so false as to constitute libel of American society.Fourth, the ad equates worth with income. There is no other explanation for Grandpa and Dad being ""worth more"" than Grandma and Mom. This view is in keeping with the materialist view of life that has permeated the left since Karl Marx. On the left, the human being is an economic being. Period. Our worth is determined by our material state. If you get a check, you have worth; if you have no check, you have no worth. It is yet another destructive message sent by this ad to the young people watching the Super Bowl.Fifth, even from just a materialistic perspective, the ad is based on a lie. Women do not make less than men for the same work. And wage differences based on gender have been illegal for over 50 years. This fraudulent claim has been debunked so often that it is utterly irresponsible to keep repeating it. (A powerful five-minute video on the subject titled ""The Myth of the Gender Wage Gap,"" presented by Christina Hoff Sommers, is available on the Prager University website. It has 2.3 million views.) Using common sense alone, why would any employers hire a man if they could hire a woman to do the exact same work for 25% less?Sixth, if Audi is not financially hurt as a result of this ad, be prepared to have next year's Super Bowl feature more left-wing ads.I have long lamented the fact that while America is engaged in a culture war (now a civil war, as I wrote two weeks ago), it is a war in which only one side seems to be doing almost all of the fighting. The November presidential election suggests that this might finally be changing. The Audi ad will serve as an excellent test case of whether conservatives are prepared to press the fight.Don't buy an Audi. And let them know why. Tell them you and America value your mother and grandmother every bit as much as you and America value your father and grandfather, and that you value truth more than an Audi.RELATED:Corporate Executives Play Politics At Their Company's PerilAnother Big Company Departs California — Will Last One To Leave Shut The Lights?

218,ICE,"Nina Agabian, a retired director of research in global health science at the University of California, bought a 29th-floor apartment in San Francisco's Millennium Tower in 2010. ""It was supposed to be a wonderful building,"" she said in January, sitting in a leather chair in the building's vast, low-lit, owner's-club level. ""For many of us, who left our business lives to start our older years, this had become a nice, comfortable place.""The building, which opened in 2008 and was touted as the most luxurious tower in San Francisco, became a beacon of the city's burgeoning wealth, attracting tech millionaires, venture capitalists, and even the San Francisco 49ers retired quarterback Joe Montana.The 58-story tower's shine faded on May 10, 2016, when Agabian attended a homeowners association meeting and was informed that the building had sunk 16 inches into the earth and tilted over 15 inches at its tip and 2 inches at the base, according to suits filed by residents and the city of San Francisco. ""You can imagine how distressed we were to know that, for one, our lifetime investment and savings are at risk,"" she said. ""And we have no idea whether or not there's a fix to it, and if there is a fix to it, what it will entail.""The building, meanwhile, continues to sink.As Agabian and more than 20 other residents file multiple lawsuits against the building's developer, the city of San Francisco, and the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, another, potentially more ominous development has emerged. Two people with knowledge of Millennium Partners' liability policy say the developer is insured to cover some $100 million in damages caused by settlement or construction defects; the policy is split among several insurers. Ancillary policies held by the building's architect, structural engineer, and general contractor are worth another $50 million to $100 million, according to one of the people. Any legal fees incurred by the policyholders could be deducted from their policies. But according to experts, fixing whatever is causing the building to tilt could cost far more than that amount.Further adding to residents' woes is that it's not even clear if coverage will be available under the liability policy: It might have been voided by the flaws in the building.""I don't foresee a scenario where anyone writes a check under any policy,"" said Sarah Sherman, the U.S. property practice leader at JLT Specialty USA, an insurance broker in San Francisco. ""There's no way to avoid litigation at this point.""It's possible, in other words, that homeowners already under water on their damaged real estate investments may have to cover millions in costs to repair the building. And that's not even the extreme worst-case scenario — in 1989, some buildings on loose San Francisco soil collapsed during an earthquake. The city has asked Millennium Partners for information on how much the building can further settle without compromising the building's stability and how it will perform during a quake. In a letter dated Jan. 13, MP declined to supply the city with that data, citing ongoing litigation and mediation.""I don't want to be in a situation in two years where we look back and think we really could have done something to prevent a terrible situation,"" warned San Francisco Superior Court Judge Curtis Karnow at a Jan. 13 hearing. ""If such a terrible situation occurs, there is little clarity as to who would pay for the damage.""""Let's say there's an earthquake and there's major damage, the insurer will fight like hell not to pay the claim,"" Sherman said. ""I would not be pleased if I was in that building.""Surrounding the building is the $1.1 billion new Salesforce Tower, the new condominium tower 181 Fremont, and a neighborhood bar.While the best method of fixing the building's tilt won't be known until an engineering firm hired by the developer completes its investigation — and perhaps not even then — the cost is certain to be millions, and perhaps hundreds of millions, of dollars.Conservatively, ""I think it's fair to say that you're at least in the tens of millions of dollars,"" said Joe Maffei, who noted that his San-Francisco-based structural engineering firm is not associated with project. Stopping the settling would be very expensive, he explained, and then you have the added expense of actually evening out the building's base. A recent study released by the city which examined the fire safety, disability access, plumbing and electricity, declared the building ""remain(s) safe for occupancy at this time.""Beyond their lawsuits, the residents can't hope for recourse from the developer.""Millennium Partners doesn't own the building,"" said P.J. Johnston, a spokesman for the developer. ""Even if there was an immediate and agreed upon measure to take, the building is owned by homeowners. Millennium Partners cannot just move forward with any set of measures"" to fix the building, he said.Since the mid-19th century, the city of San Francisco has expanded its shoreline by dumping debris into its coastal marshlands and transferring sand and clay from the ocean bed onto land. Much of downtown San Francisco, including parts of Mission Street, where Millennium Tower was built, is constructed on this loose, wet soil. But the city's proximity to two major faults — the San Andreas and the Hayward — could render that same ground unstable in an earthquake, said Keith Knudsen, the deputy director of the U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Science Center. ""The soft material tends to amplify the parts of the shaking — the earthquake's wavelengths — which are damaging to buildings,"" he said.The engineers who designed Millennium Tower were aware that the building sat on unstable soil and constructed the 645-foot tower's base so it would behave ""dynamically"" in the event of an earthquake, at least partially withstanding the shocks on the unstable ground. To achieve this effect, they chose a support known as ""friction piles,"" a series of rods bored into the ground that would help stabilize the building as the earth rocked. While other buildings in the area were built with similar foundations (and still others use pilings drilled all the way down to firmer bedrock), the majority of the skyscrapers in downtown San Francisco are built with steel frames. Millennium Tower, in contrast, is made of vastly heavier concrete.A decade after the first piles were drilled, walls in the underground parking garage have begun to crack due to the shifting, marble floors in the lobby have begun to buckle, and residents have complained that the ventilation units have begun to fail, raising questions about when the tilt will stop, or if it will stop at all.Sales for Millennium Tower started around November 2007. By 2013 the building was fully sold for a reported total of $750 million; an April 5, 2013, article in the San Francisco Business Times, which Millennium Partners posted on its website, quoted the building's costs at $600 million.In the same story, Richard Baumert, a partner at the company, sounded a triumphant note. ""We saw it through and in the end our plan and vision for the project were validated,"" he said. The building's appeal, he continued, was ""not as much about the physical structure as the residential experience.""The article also quoted Gregg Lynn, a broker at Sotheby's International Realty who reportedly represented about a dozen Millennium Tower buyers. ""The situation we are facing is that everybody wants to buy into that building, and they are kicking themselves that they didn't when they had the chance,"" he said. ""People who sell now are expecting to cash out with major profits."" The golden era for the Millennium Tower would last less than three years.No one is quite sure why the building began to sink and tilt. It could be a flaw in the structure, which would make it Millennium Partners' responsibility, according to the building residents, or the result of the nearby construction of a major transit station, which would make it at least partially the responsibility of the station's builder. Possibly, it could be some combination of the two.A class-action by 20 building residents, led by their fellow resident, patent litigator Jerry Dodson, alleges that Millennium Partners knew the building had sunk 8.3 inches into the ground by 2009, the year after it was completed.""There's the possibility that when they poured in 2006-07, that it immediately sank,"" Dodson said in an interview in his living room in the tower, which is filled with art-deco vases and sculptures and overlooks San Francisco Bay. ""It's extremely unlikely in my mind that as we began 2009 that it immediately tilted 6 inches to the northwest. What's more likely is they poured the oil.""Millennium Partners denies responsibility for the tilting. ""At the time of its completion in 2008 and throughout its entire sales process, (the tower) had settled within predicted, safe ranges,"" said Johnston, the developer's spokesman.Dodson's 20 homeowners, who collectively paid some $75 million for their condos, claim that the developer hid the building's faulty structure from prospective buyers and that the city's administrators joined in the alleged fraud by helping conceal the tower's engineering flaws as early as February 2009 by signing mutual nondisclosure agreements. The two colluded over half a decade to keep Millennium Tower's design defects secret to allow the city to move forward on its own construction in the neighborhood, according to Dodson's complaint. The city and Millennium Tower deny these allegationsAnother target of Dodson's suit is the Transbay Joint Powers Authority (TJPA), which is building what it calls a ""Grand Central Station of the West"" next door to Millennium Tower. Part of the development, which also includes towers and below-ground rail tunnels in the soft soil, could have undermined Millennium Tower's foundation, causing the building to tilt, according to Dodson's complaint. If TJPA is found to be at fault, San Francisco taxpayers could be obliged to fund the tower's repair. The developer blames TJPA for the tilt. The TJPA has denied the allegations.The TJPA attempted to dismiss one lawsuit Millennium Tower residents filed by claiming that the tower was still structurally secure. In a move critics attributed to the city's desire to absolve itself of any blame surrounding the project, the San Francisco Attorney's office subsequently sued Millennium Partners on behalf of TJPA.Regardless of who is legally responsible, all parties have finally agreed that there is, in fact, a problem.A report commissioned by Millennium Partners and published in 2014 by the engineering firm Simpson Gumpertz & Heger determined that the building's support columns and foundation were experiencing ""significant stress."" Nevertheless, the report concluded: ""With the exception of the foundation,"" it read, ""none of the settlement-related demands on these elements are at levels that indicate impending failure."" The building's supports might be cracking, in other words, but — as of a few years ago, at least — it was unlikely to collapse.Recently, Millennium Partners entered private mediation with building residents, with the goal of halting environmental damage and to ""stop any undue further settlement of the building,"" according to the developer's spokesman. As far as Millennium Partners is concerned, the culprit is the TJPA project next door. ""We need to ensure that the damage being caused by our immediate neighbors, TJPA, is stopped,"" he added.The Oakland firm Sage Engineers has been hired by Millennium Partners to investigate the foundation, but as yet the firm hasn't offered potential solutions. Inspiration might come from the 1998 case of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino in Las Vegas, which sank almost 19 inches as its weight displaced water from an underlying aquifer. The solution was to drill 536 metal cylinders underneath the casino's 43-story tower, which stabilized the edifice at the cost of between $8 million and $10 million, according to a 2000 article in the Las Vegas Sun.Several engineers and developers contacted by Bloomberg suggested a similar methodology — the insertion of slender, 5-inch to 12-inch supports called ""micropiles"" beneath Millennium Tower's existing foundation — could be effective. Engineers might ""have to go down to the bottom of the garage and drill through the mat slab,"" said Jake Albini, the senior manager of real estate development at Jay Paul, which is developing a 70-floor, mixed-use skyscraper neighboring Millennium Tower. ""It's not an easy task, but nothing's impossible.""But Steven Sanders, the president of Sage Engineers, cautioned against jumping to conclusions. ""You have to be very careful about these different fixes,"" he said. ""They're very dependent on soil conditions and building types."" Millennium Tower, he said, is fairly unique. ""It may be tough to really go down the road and identify possibilities based on historical knowledge,"" he said. ""I think it would be hard and probably dangerous to say, This is done here, why don't you do the same thing there?""Any fix to the building will almost certainly take several years, and the lawsuits over who will pay for it could take even longer. In the meantime, residents of the building remain in limbo.""There haven't been a lot of resales in the building since all of this news came out,"" said Gregg Lynn, the Sotheby's broker. ""There's still no clarity about what it takes to fix or stop the problem.""""We can't sell, we can't rent, we can't move,"" said Agabian, the retired scientist. ""I'd sell it in a second if I got fair market value for it."" She corrected herself: ""Well, there's not a fair market for it, because now the fair market for it is zero.""Lynn recently sold deceased venture capitalist Tom Perkins's Millennium Tower penthouse for $13 million but noted that it was purchased by an existing resident and was a unique transaction. The buyer ""was aggressively convinced that this problem is solvable,"" Lynn said, and felt that the apartment was a bargain. (Perkins purchased the apartment for $9.4 million and reportedly spent another $9 million renovating it.)Other residents are stuck.""I'm getting a lot of calls from homeowners in the building who want to make plans to list their places once the settlement solution is announced,"" Lynn said, adding that he had close to 25 clients in the building. ""What we're waiting for is the public announcement for what the solution to the structural concerns might be and how it's going to be paid for."" It's the latter question, Lynn said, that could be the hardest to answer. ""The second is going to be mired in litigation for five to 10 years,"" he continued. ""But from what I hear from people at the top, this is very fixable — we just don't know when the solution is going to be announced.""That's fine for residents who want to stay put — people are ""absolutely passionate about it, the service there is extraordinary, and the HOA is extremely well-run,"" Lynn said — but there are many others who are hoping to move yet are unwilling to sell at fire-sale prices. ""I can't tell you what percentage down the values are,"" Lynn said, ""because nothing is trading.""Currently, just three apartments are on the market: apartment 4E, which has 1,136 square feet and is listed at $1.299 million, or $1,143 a square foot; it last sold in 2013 for $915,000. There's also penthouse 1A, which is 2,706 square feet and is listed at $8.995 million, or $3,324 a square foot; it's been on the market since July and last sold in 2014 for $3 million.

219,ICE,"A few decades back, an upstanding member of the global warming alarmist community said that if the public was going to take the threat of man-caused climate change seriously, the alarmists were going to have to exaggerate the evidence.It was in 1989 that Stephen Schneider wrote in Discover magazine that in order ""to capture the public's imagination . . . we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have.""Let's not forget that the late climatologist was first a believer in global cooling in the 1970s. He was worried that a new ice age was coming.Of course the alarmist community has followed Schneider's script. It's spent much of the last three decades trying to spook the public into a panic.One example of this agenda to drive fright into our brains was the ClimateGate scandal at Britain's University of East Anglia. A series of email threads between climate scientists showed that they were torturing the temperature data to produce evidence of warming that wasn't occurring.Who can forget their conspiracy to ""hide the decline""?Don't think this is an isolated incident. News out of the United Kingdom over the weekend tells us that ""world leaders were duped into investing billions over manipulated global warming data.""""A high-level whistleblower has told this newspaper that America's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) breached its own rules on scientific integrity when it published the sensational but flawed report, aimed at making the maximum possible impact on world leaders including Barack Obama and David Cameron at the United Nations climate conference in Paris in 2015,"" the Daily Mail reports.""The report claimed that the 'pause' or 'slowdown' in global warming in the period since 1998 — revealed by U.N. scientists in 2013 — never existed, and that world temperatures had been rising faster than scientists expected.""The Daily Mail identifies the whistleblower as ""John Bates, a top NOAA scientist with an impeccable reputation."" His strong objections to the publication ""of the faulty data were overridden by his NOAA superiors in what he describes as a 'blatant attempt to intensify the impact.' ""Bates blames Thomas Karl, the paper's lead author, whom he said insisted ""on decisions and scientific choices that maximized warming and minimized documentation . . . in an effort to discredit the notion of a global warming pause.""Please don't be surprised. Government-paid researchers are desperate to perpetuate the climate shock. They know that if there is no warming as they have predicted, the generous public funds that support their work will eventually dry up.It is in their financial interest to keep the public tied up in knots of anxiety and to dupe politicians, who are eager to assume the posture of caring guardians of the environment so they'll to continue to hand them moneyAnd it fits right in with the other evidence problems that undermine the global warming narrative, such as the hopelessly flawed temperature record, the unreliable models that can't even predict the past, and the possibility that as many half of the alarmist research papers could be wrong.Instapundit Glenn Reynolds is fond of saying that he'll believe there's a warming crisis when the people who are saying it's a crisis start acting like it is. Maybe we'll start believing there's a warming problem when government scientists quit cheating to make it look like a problem exists.RELATED:June Hottest Month On Record?

220,ICE,"Oil fell from a one-month high Thursday amid signs that OPEC will have to make further cuts to fully comply with last year's historic production deal.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut output by 840,000 barrels a day last month, according to a Bloomberg survey. Nigeria, Libya and Iran, which are exempt from the curbs, boosted production by a combined 270,000 barrels. Prices climbed earlier after President Donald Trump said that Iran has been ""put on notice"" for testing ballistic missiles. U.S. crude supplies rose to the highest level since August last week, government data show.Oil has fluctuated above $50 a barrel since 11 nations including Russia last month joined with OPEC to trim supply. While Middle Eastern producers from Saudi Arabia to Iraq have implemented cuts and Russia says it's ahead of schedule with its own reduction, wary investors are also considering signs that U.S. drillers are taking advantage of higher prices to stage a comeback.""We're trying to asses a lot of moving parts,"" Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York, said by phone. ""We're trying to figure out just how good compliance has been with OPEC's production numbers. We need to pay attention to more than the overall production number.""West Texas Intermediate for March delivery declined 34 cents, or 0.6%, to settle at $53.54 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures touched $54.34, the highest intraday price since Jan. 3. Total volume traded was about 15% below the 100-day average.Brent for April settlement slipped 24 cents to $56.56 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark closed at a $2.39 premium to April WTI.OPEC pumped 32.3 million barrels a day in January, the Bloomberg survey of analysts, oil companies and ship-tracking data showed. The 10 members of the group that pledged to make cuts implemented 83% of those reductions on average, but their efforts were offset by gains from Iran, Nigeria and Libya.Accounting for the members who raised output and the suspension of Indonesia, OPEC's total output remains 550,000 barrels a day above the target set out in the Nov. 30 deal. That means the group as a whole is only about 60% of the way toward the production level it deems necessary to eliminate a global oversupply and boost prices.""Bloomberg data shows that OPEC needs to make additional cuts,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said by telephone.U.S. crude stockpiles rose for a fourth week to 494.8 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday. Inventories of gasoline and distillate fuel also expanded last week.

221,ICE,"By 2007, Michelle Jackson, a 30-something writer in Denver, held a master's degree, had traveled the world, and was enjoying her social life as a single woman. She also felt the pull to purchase her own home, a rite of passage she thought was reserved for the coupled.""I wanted to have my own place,"" Jackson said. ""A lot of people in my circle of friends were women purchasing their homes when they got married, but I still felt like I wanted to build my own wealth and buy. If and when I met someone, it's something that just added to what I bring to the relationship. It didn't make sense to wait.""A few open houses later, Jackson was pre-approved for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage and had put an offer in on a small one-bedroom home in a triplex in Denver for $72,500. She still lives in the home, which was appraised last year at more than double the price she paid, and said she plans to renovate it and perhaps buy an additional property nearby.""I'm so happy,"" Jackson said. ""It's completely changed how I feel connected to the place where I'm living. It's one of the best things I've ever done.""The news and research about women and money can be dreary. Women earn less than their male counterparts, pay harsher workplace penalties for pursuing parenthood, struggle more with debt, and save less for retirement.But there's one area of personal finance where single women are outpacing men in the U.S., and it's a significant one: homeownership.Nearly a century since the publication of ""A Room of One's Own"" — Virginia Woolf's essay on women's urgent need for a private physical space in which to flourish — and a legacy of laws that restricted women in owning property or considered them to be property, single women account for 17% of homebuyers in the U.S., compared with 7% of single men. The data, from last year, are from the National Association of Realtors.Although women have been ahead of men in the NAR's data since 1981, the gap has widened even further in recent years, said Jessica Lautz, the NAR's managing director of survey research and communications. Property values and mortgage lending imploded after the 2008 financial crisis, and low interest rates have made lending more appealing to new, more frugal buyers.Single women are also likelier than single men to be parenting on their own, Lautz noted, and therefore likelier to seek stable housing for raising children. There were 8.6 million single-mother households in 2011, more than three times the 2.6 million single-father households, according to the Pew Research Center.""If you have children, it's definitely going to play a role in where you're thinking of living and how,"" Lautz said. ""And a mortgage can provide financial security. I think women, even with lower incomes, want a place where they can have roots and really own a place. The psychological desire to do that is great.""With that comes an increase in financial sacrifices women are willing to make to own a home, Lautz said, such as taking a second job or working their budgets to save for a down payment. ""They really value homeownership, and they're willing to give up a lot to have a home of their own.""Then there are single women's sheer numbers. As millennials postpone or shrug off marriage, more women are unmarried than ever before. Today, 1 in every 5 Americans 25 years and older have never been married, a sharp contrast to just 9% in 1960, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. More of them are men (23%) than women (17%), according to the Pew Research Center, but it's the women who dominate as homebuyers, for the reasons above, and more.For one, unmarried women may be likelier than men to seize singledom as a lifestyle, said Bella DePaulo, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the author of ""Singled Out.""""Despite the stereotypes that insist that women care more about marriage than men do, it may actually be single life that women embrace more than men,"" DePaulo said. ""Some research suggests that single women are especially unlikely to be lonely — again, contrary to our stereotypes. ... I think that buying a home is a way of living your single life fully, rather than seeing your single years as just marking time until you find The One.""When single women do buy their first homes, they do so at an older age than men, 34 compared with 31, according to NAR research from last year. And women are buying at a lower average price: $173,000 compared with $190,600.Single women also have long had a slightly higher foreclosure rate than men: 73 per 10,000 vs. 70 per 10,000, Daren Blomquist, a senior vice president with Attom Data Solutions, said. One reason may be that men's properties involved larger initial sales and appreciated faster than women's.""There's a domino effect,"" Blomquist said. ""Because of the wage gap, you see women having to purchase lower-value homes, and they're more open to risk when they do. Typically what causes a foreclosure is some kind of shock, like a job loss. If you have a lower-value home that's appreciating less quickly, you have less of a cushion than someone who has seen their value appreciate more.""For Rachel Weiss, a fashion executive in New York, the thought of owning a home in Manhattan ""always seemed so unattainable."" Having spent her 30s and some of her 40s in a rent-stabilized studio in the West Village, she accumulated a pile of cash that was sitting dormant in a savings account and was hungry to invest. On a whim last spring, she began to look at properties, and she said she was surprised when, running the numbers and being pre-approved for a mortgage, she saw that a one-bedroom in a co-op in the area could be within reach.""I outgrew my apartment 10 years ago, and buying a home was always in the back of my mind,"" Weiss said. ""But I didn't know what to do and never knew if I could afford an apartment. I started looking online at Trulia and Streeteasy, and the next day (real estate agents) started calling. It wasn't premeditated or anything. It was almost like I was on Tinder for an apartment.""After a few open houses, Weiss had narrowed her search to apartments in smaller buildings with lower maintenance fees. She was OK in a walk-up, but location was still a priority. She put an offer on a one-bedroom co-op in Chelsea for $640,000. It was accepted. She moved in last August.""There was a psychological aspect to it, too,"" Weiss said. ""I'm in my 40s, and I looked at what my life was like. I'm not married, I don't have kids. I can live alone, and fabulously. I feel empowered.""MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:The Most Affordable Major Housing Markets Are In America, Survey SaysHomebuying Cheaper Than Renting In Most Of U.S., But For How Long?Real Estate Agents Foresee Year Of Low Inventory, Low ExpectationsFor Home Sellers, Winter Can Break The Ice

222,ICE,"Oil rose to the highest close in more than three weeks Wednesday as the dollar retreated after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and as evidence mounts that OPEC and its partners are making promised output cuts.Futures advanced 2% in New York. Gains accelerated after the central bank's announcement sent the U.S. currency lower. Russia reduced oil output by 117,000 barrels a day last month, putting it ahead of schedule to fulfill its agreement with OPEC, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Wednesday. The market shrugged off a government report showing that U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles climbed last week.Oil gained almost 15% the last two months of 2016 as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on Nov. 30 to reduce supply, with 11 other nations including Russia joining the deal less than two weeks later.

""All signs are pointing to strong compliance by OPEC and its partners.""Refineries operated at 88.2% of capacity, the lowest since November.

224,ICE,"When former President Obama was just Barack Obama running for the White House, he indicated that if elected, he could, like the creator of the universe, calm the rising seas. So how did that work out for him?Not so good.In June 2008, when Obama knew that he had clinched the Democratic nomination, he claimed that it ""was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal."" Not only is Obama not a deity who controls the earthly waters, he's not a good forecaster, either.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported last June that ""sea level has been rising over the past century, and the rate has increased in recent decades. In 2014, global sea level was 2.6 inches (67 mm) above the 1993 average — the highest annual average in the satellite record (1993-present). Sea level continues to rise at a rate of about one-eighth of an inch (3.2 mm) per year, due to a combination of melting glaciers and ice sheets, and thermal expansion of seawater as it warms.""So there's been no slowing in ""the rise of the oceans"" under Obama. Just a natural steady increase every year, according to NOAA. Obama apologist Think Progress has even said that increases that are ""much faster than we thought"" – of course that's just what the political left wants the public to believe – though it's clear that while the seas have been rising for 10,000 years, there has been no acceleration.So where are the fact-checkers? Why no Pinocchios for such a gross exaggeration? Why hasn't the mainstream media called him out on this? This was an embellishment on the order of ""if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor."" Shouldn't the media be setting the record straight on this?Yes, but there's no chance it will. Remember, Obama is ""sort of God,"" at least according to the media. He's a supernatural being ""standing above the country, above the world."" The media aren't going to question their god. They're just going to keep worshipping at the church of Barack.But where could they have gotten such a lunatic idea that Obama is a divine being anyway? Charles Krauthammer knows. Just before the year turned to 2017, Krauthammer noticed that ""Obama sees himself as God hovering over the country dispensing goodies to the extent that he's got control.""So if Obama sees himself as God, his flock will too. His congregation won't turn on him even if he can't stop the rising seas. Or fix the economy. Or create jobs. Or live up to his Nobel Peace Prize. Or establish racial harmony. Or achieve anything even a middling president could.Of course all this makes the media false prophets. But that's not a revelation.RELATED:The Theory Of Gravity Is Wrong?

That number was almost 8 million barrels above the American Petroleum Institute's estimate released Tuesday, which showed a 4.6 million decrease during the same week. That estimate had helped send oil prices up nearly 2% on Tuesday.Oil was already being closely watched early Wednesday, as tensions rose in the Persian Gulf where Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain had effectively blockaded Qatar, and after reports of multiple armed attacks on official buildings in Tehran, Iran, that reportedly left at least 12 dead. News reports said the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Tehran attacks.As a result, U.S.-based oil benchmarks led the declines, with West Texas Intermediate crude ending down nearly 5% to below $46 a barrel, its lowest mark since early May.On the stock market, oil-related groups took six of the session's 10 worst losses among industries.

228,ICE,"Immigration: A battle is brewing between the federal government's right to enforce U.S. immigration laws and some cities' and blue states' desire to provide ""sanctuary"" for illegal immigrants in the U.S. But unlike the past four presidents, Donald Trump is willing, even eager, to fight this battle.While we often sympathize with states and cities in their fights with big government, this is one case where the federal government is right.By both tradition and law, immigration and control of U.S. borders have always been a duty and obligation of the federal government — not states and cities.That idea was vindicated this week as the Supreme Court let most of President Trump's temporary restrictions on Muslim immigrants from six Middle Eastern nations go into effect — despite lower-court rulings by Obama-appointed judges in California, Hawaii, Washington and Maryland that Trump's temporary travel ban discriminated against Muslims.The largely city-based sanctuary movement in a number of states poses another challenge and, as with the travel ban, leftist Obama holdovers on the lower courts have supported these illegal actions.As Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times noted this week, ""federal judges remain major stumbling blocks to (Trump's) aggressive immigration plans, with courts from California to Michigan and Atlanta limiting his crackdown on sanctuary cities and stopping him from deporting illegal immigrants he has targeted for removal.""These sanctuary-city movement and its anti-Trump allies on the bench are wrong, constituting a clear effort to illegally circumvent federal law.Trump understands this. He's ratcheting up the heat on the Obama-appointed holdovers in lower courts and their local political allies who stymie his efforts to stanch the flow of illegals across U.S. borders and to deport those who come here and commit serious crimes.Right now, his most powerful weapon is changing the Supreme Court. Trump is just one nominee away from making Obama's left-wing lower-court judges irrelevant on larger issues of immigration.As for the blatantly illegal sanctuary-city movement, Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Tom Homan said this week he supports letting victims of criminal aliens to sue sanctuary city officials who allowed the criminals to stay.In short, sanctuary city officials are being put on notice: You can't flout U.S. law and allow your own citizens to be victimized any longer.Congress also is getting in on the act, with two bills now before it to tighten up immigration rules.One of the bills, Kate's Law — named for Kate Steinle, a tourist to San Francisco who was brutally murdered by an illegal immigrant — imposes strict minimum prison sentences on deportees who return to the U.S.It passed late Thursday in the House, and is likely to pass in the Senate, too.The second bill would take away some federal grants from states and cities actively taking part in the sanctuary movement.Trump is encouraging Congress to pass the bills as part of his broader effort to reduce the number of illegal-alien gang members, drug dealers and even terrorists within U.S. borders.""Closing these loopholes in our laws must be a priority if we are to make America safe from these dangerous transnational organizations,"" Trump said.Yes, as the left frequently reminds us, America is a nation of immigrants. But it's a nation of legal immigrants, not illegal ones. And there is a difference. Any nation that ceases to control its borders ceases to be a nation.We urge Congress to pass both laws and show it's serious about protecting our borders. Nobody stands above the law — not the self-righteous local officials who obstruct the law by taking part in the sanctuary city movement, and not the criminals who return to the U.S. again and again and commit violent crimes.We hope Americans — tired of having the nation's laws ignored by far-left politicians and judges and of seeing fellow citizens victimized by illegal alien criminals — understand that this really isn't about immigration at all.No, it's about keeping America a sovereign nation and protecting the rule of law, two pillars of our nation's founding that the open-border left just hates.RELATED:Did Votes By Noncitizens Cost Trump The 2016 Popular Vote?

229,ICE,"Crude oil prices increased as government data showed a drop in U.S. gasoline supplies that have remained stubbornly high at the start of the summer driving season.Futures rose 0.6% in New York after the Energy Information Administration reported gasoline stockpiles fell 894,000 barrels. While total U.S. crude inventories rose by 117,999 barrels last week, the amount of oil held at the Cushing hub fell for the sixth week in a row.""At least there were draws in gasoline and distillates,"" Brian Kessens, a managing director and portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC in Leawood, Kansas, who helps manage $17.1 billion in energy assets, said by telephone. ""The market's giving the gasoline demand numbers the benefit of the doubt.""Oil tumbled into a bear market last week on concerns that rising global supply will undermine output cuts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners. U.S. crude inventories remain stubbornly high, more than 100 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.West Texas intermediate for August delivery rose 26 cents to $44.50 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 11:46 a.m. ET, after climbing as much as 1.4% to $44.84. Total volume traded was about 10% above the 100-day average.Brent for August settlement rose 36 cents to $47.01 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $2.51 to WTI.The slight crude build combined with the gasoline draw, which is expected during the summer, makes for a mixed report, Stephen Schork, president of Schork Group Inc., a consulting group in Villanova, Pennsylvania, said on Bloomberg TV.""This report strikes me as a push, neither bullish nor bearish,"" he said. ""The biggest concern for the oil bulls at this point"" is what happens when demand declines in the fall while U.S. drillers are still adding barrels.

230,ICE,"Oil declined after a U.S. government report showed that crude and fuel inventories increased.Futures fell 0.8% in New York. Crude supplies rose 2.84 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 20, the Energy Information Administration said. Gasoline stockpiles climbed a fourth week. While Kuwait expects complete compliance with a pact between OPEC and non-OPEC nations, some countries haven't fully carried out the cuts yet, said Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzouk, who chairs the panel that will oversee the curbs.""There's lots of talk about OPEC, non-OPEC production cuts but the fact remains that U.S. crude supplies are very high and rising,"" Thomas Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group in Wellington, Fla., said by phone. ""Gasoline always rises at this time of year but this is different. I am surprised by the velocity of supply growth.""Oil has held above $50 a barrel since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 other nations agreed late last year to curb supply by about 1.8 million barrels a day. While Saudi Arabia says more than 80% of the targeted reduction has been implemented since the deal took effect on Jan. 1, the International Energy Agency predicted a rebound in shale output as prices rise. U.S. drillers last week added the most rigs to oil fields since 2013.West Texas Intermediate for March delivery dropped 43 cents, or 0.8%, to $52.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

231,ICE,"Oil gains eased in New York after an industry report said U.S. crude and fuel stockpiles climbed last week.Crude supplies rose 2.93 million barrels, the American Petroleum Institute was said to report. Futures lost about 27 cents per barrel from the close after the release of the data. Iraq has trimmed supply by 180,000 barrels a day and will cut a further 30,000 a day by the end of the month, Oil Minister Jabbar Al-Luaibi said. President Trump took steps to advance construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines while foreshadowing a ""renegotiation"" of terms.Oil has held above $50 a barrel since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 additional countries agreed late last year to curtail supply by about 1.8 million barrels a day. While Saudi Arabia says more than 80% of the targeted cut has been implemented since the deal took effect Jan. 1, Goldman Sachs warned Tuesday that prices above $60 will boost output, including from shale. U.S. drillers last week added the most oil rigs since 2013.""The market is having to filter a lot right now: Keystone, Trump and OPEC issues,"" Tim Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd. in Calgary, said by phone. ""OPEC adherence appears to be a lot better than anticipated.""West Texas intermediate crude for March delivery rose 43 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $53.18 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

""This isn't a surprise because these pipelines fit into his pro-industry, pro-infrastructure agenda.""In Iraq, OPEC's second-biggest producer, 90% of output cuts have come from oil companies run by the federal government. But Baghdad is also coordinating reductions with the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan and international oil companies, Al-Luaibi said in London. It's too early to say if the cuts could be extended beyond the initially-agreed-upon six-month term, he said.
"
232,ICE,"Oil fell for the first time in three days after U.S. drillers added the most rigs in more than three years, making it difficult for OPEC to drain global oversupply.Futures fell 0.9% in New York. Companies in the U.S. put 29 more oil rigs to work in the week ended Jan. 20, the most since April 2013, data from Baker Hughes show. OPEC and other producers have cut oil supply by 1.5 million barrels a day, more than 80% of their collective target, since a deal to trim output took effect on Jan. 1, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Energy and Industry Khalid Al-Falih said in Vienna.Oil has held above $50 a barrel since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia agreed late last year to curb supply. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Algeria and Venezuela met counterparts from non-OPEC nations Russia and Oman in Vienna to find a way to verify that the 24 signatories to their Dec. 10 accord are fulfilling pledges to remove a combined 1.8 million barrels a day for six months. Progress may be hindered by Libya and Nigeria's plans to raise output, and the U.S., where shale production is predicted to rise.""Prices at these levels allow shale producers to profit from increasing output,"" Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist in Seattle at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which oversees $133 billion of assets, said by telephone. ""We're seeing this reflected in the rising rig count and increases in 2017 investment plans.""West Texas Intermediate for March delivery declined 47 cents to settle at $52.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

The global benchmark contract climbed 2.5% to $55.49 on Friday.Futures pared declines as the U.S. dollar dropped. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge of the currency against 10 major peers, slipped 0.7%. A weaker greenback increases investor interest in commodities denominated in the currency.Energy shares declined with futures and were the worst performers on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration and Production Select Industry index slipped 0.9%. 
"
233,ICE,"Oil advanced for a fourth day in New York, its longest run of gains in a month, as estimates that U.S. crude inventories continued their decline from record levels eased jitters over a global supply glut.Futures added as much as 2.4% after rising 2% in the previous three sessions. Inventories probably dropped by 2 million barrels last week, a Bloomberg survey showed before an Energy Information Administration report Wednesday. A weakening of the dollar against the euro also made commodities priced in the greenback more attractive to holders of other currencies. Plus, oil's 15% slump in the past five weeks because of oversupply worries may have been excessive.""A lot of that concern has now been priced in"" as short positions have been growing, said Gene McGillian, manager for market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn. ""We're getting a little bit of a correction.""Oil tumbled into a bear market last week on concerns that expanding production from places like the U.S. and Libya will counter output cuts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and partners including Russia. The bearish mood is unusual for the month of June, when refineries typically process more crude to meet rising demand during the summer driving season. While U.S. stockpiles have fallen by 26 million barrels since March, they remain 100 million above the five-year average and drillers have added rigs for the longest stretch in at least three decades.The increase in bearish bets on crude signals prices are vulnerable to a sharp, sudden rebound, investors and analysts have said. Short positions in Brent, the global benchmark, rose to the highest since 2011 last week.West Texas intermediate for August delivery was at $44.19 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 81 cents, at 1:20 p.m. in New York. Total volume was about 2% below the 100-day average. Prices rose 0.9% on Monday but are down about 9% this month, the worst June performance in almost 30 years.Brent for August settlement was up 84 cents to $46.67 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, and traded at a $2.46 premium to WTI. The global benchmark crude advanced 0.6% to $45.83 on Monday.Adding to tensions in the Middle East, the U.S. said it suspects Syrian forces are planning another chemical-weapons attack. Meanwhile, cyberattacks across Europe have been hitting major companies including Russian oil producer Rosneft PJSC and ship operator A.P. Moller-Maersk in Copenhagen.U.S. crude stockpiles peaked at 535.5 million barrels in the week ended March 31, according to EIA data. While inventories have steadily declined since then, American oil production has climbed above 9.3 million barrels a day to the highest level since August 2015. At the same time, high gasoline inventories amid weak summer demand remain a concern. Supplies fell last week after two weeks of builds.""If we get another sizable drawdown this week, that could be supportive,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York-based hedge fund. ""We've got some very important weekly inventory numbers coming up.""

But we have neither the space nor time to rack up all the missed global warming predictions. So we will merely point out that instead of these disasters, we have the climate alarmist community admitting that there has indeed been a pause in the warming and that its models failed to predict it.Yes, that's right. The alarmists are acknowledging in the abstract of a research paper that was published this month in Nature Geoscience that there have been ""differences in model and satellite tropospheric warming rates.""""In the early twenty-first century, satellite-derived tropospheric warming trends were generally smaller than trends estimated from a large multi-model ensemble,"" wrote the climate scientists led by ""climatista"" Benjamin Santer and including the litigious Michael Mann, purveyor of the hockey-stick graph that supposedly proves human-produced carbon dioxide is overheating the planet.""It's more than a little shocking,"" say Michael Bastasch and Ryan Maue in their post in the Watts Up With That climate blog. They are calling this admission ""the new 'consensus' on global warming.""What must be particularly galling is that this confession ""settles"" the claim made by Trump Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, who noted in written comments after his Senate confirmation that ""over the past two decades satellite data indicates there has been a leveling off of warming.""Naturally, when Pruitt made his statements, condemnation ""was swift,"" David Whitehouse, science editor of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, wrote in Canada's Financial Post, and ""a study was quickly put together for the journal Nature Scientific Reports to disprove Pruitt's comments.""And, of course, the study ""concluded that Pruitt was wrong and many media outlets reported that conclusion."" Will they be just as aggressive in reporting that Pruitt was right?Not a chance.Meanwhile, Steven Hayward at Powerline wrote that ""while it is evident that the authors have done all the necessary contortions that essentially say 'our models are just a little off' so as to convey a 'nothing to see here' conclusion, the abstract can hardly be reassuring because it has to concede the problem.""As Leslie Eastman of the Legal Insurrection blog noted, ""the fact that Ben Santer authored this piece is a fascinating development.""""He is a climate researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and former researcher at the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit. His former place of employment was the center of the first 'Climategate' scandal, in which hacked emails showed that the scientists were allegedly manipulating data that would have undermined their global warming assertions,"" Eastman wrote.On some level the admission is shocking, as Bastasch and Maue say.

235,ICE,"X Oil tumbled to the lowest level in nine months, pulling energy stocks down, amid growing concerns that OPEC-led output cuts are failing to ease a global supply glut.Futures declined 2.2% in New York, entering a bear market for the first time since August, as investors focus on rising production from countries that are not part of OPEC's deal. Libya is pumping the most crude in four years, and the amount of oil stored in tankers reached a 2017 high earlier this month. U.S. drillers have added oil rigs for 22 straight weeks. An industry report on a decline in American inventories didn't improve the mood.""We still have a lot of oil,"" Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors, said by telephone. ""Libya is coming on a little bit more than people expected.

WTI for July delivery, which expires Tuesday, fell 97 cents to settle at $43.23, the lowest since mid-September. Total volume traded was about 35% above the 100-day average.Futures were little changed from the settlement after the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute was said to report that U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 2.72 million barrels last week, while gasoline supplies rose by 346,000 barrels.

To win the e-commerce wars in India, says Windsor, Amazon's plan will be to offer good smartphones at low prices, with the hope they will be used for e-commerce transactions with Amazon.According to a report from India-based Gadgets 360, an affiliate of Indian TV station NDTV, Amazon is testing a new line of company-branded smartphones, known internally as ""Ice."" The smartphones would run the latest version of the Android operating system and include a variety of Google applications, such as Gmail and Google Play, making the phones fully compliant with the Google ecosystem by Alphabet (GOOGL). Amazon has not commented on the report.""The Ice device portfolio could serve as a way to encourage users to do their online shopping with Amazon rather than Flipkart,"" Windsor said.""Google has no e-commerce offering to speak of and so Amazon can produce Google ecosystem devices (which Indian users demand) and at the same time install its shopping apps, optimize them and set them by default,"" Windsor wrote.IBD'S TAKE: While Amazon faces increased competition overseas, the stock has been outperforming much of the market. Amazon, an IBD Leaderboard stock, has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a possible 99. The stock hit a record high on Tuesday.Amazon stock was up 0.7% to 1,010.07 in the stock market today. Alphabet was up 0.5% to 1,001.59.Amazon's initial attempt at making smartphones, the Fire Phone, was a massive flop, attributable in part to high prices, gimmicky software and apps that users didn't want. Amazon quit the Fire Phone in 2015.The new line of phones would reportedly come with the latest Qualcomm (QCOM) Snapdragon processor and be priced under $100, said Gadgets 360, saying the information came from two sources familiar with the matter.""Hence, we can see Amazon selling Ice devices at 0% gross margins in order to win over more affluent Indian users to its shopping proposition at the expense of Flipkart & Co.,"" Windsor wrote.Flipkart is the e-commerce leader in India with a 35% market share, followed by Amazon at 23% and Snapdeal at 15%. Flipkart, founded by two former Amazon employees, recently received a $1.4 billion investment from Microsoft (MSFT), eBay (EBAY) and China's Tencent Holdings (TCEHY). Flipkart is reportedly in talks to acquire Snapdeal.""Softbank, the backer of Flipkart, is keen for it to merge with Snapdeal which, if perfectly executed, would give the combined entity 50% share,"" said Windsor.

238,ICE,"Indiana's Thomas Marshall, who was America's vice president 100 years ago, voiced — he plucked it from a Hoosier humorist — one of the few long-remembered utterances to issue from that office: ""What this country needs is a good 5-cent cigar,"" which would be $1.11 in today's currency. A century later, what the country needs is a $12 twelve-ounce cup of coffee.Or so Howard Schultz thinks. Betting against the man who built Starbucks (SBUX) to a market capitalization of $86 billion is imprudent.Today, you cannot swing a dead cat without hitting a Starbucks store. There are 25,000 in 75 countries, with another 12,000 due by 2021, so Starbucks is not an elusive or exclusive experience. This poses a problem peculiar to affluent societies, and an opportunity. Seattle, where the original Starbucks was opened in 1971, now has a Starbucks Roastery where customers can turn a cup of ""small-batch"" coffee into an experience — Starbucks sells experiences as much as coffee — of both conspicuous consumption and conspicuous connoisseurship. Bloomberg reports that for a pittance, aka $10, skinflints will be able to buy a cold-brew coffee, which presumably is an excellent thing, infused with nitrogen gas, which sounds like an acquired taste.Many existing Starbucks are located to capture foot traffic in malls and shopping centers, which have been losing customers to online shopping. The original 30 Roasteries — Reuters says they will be ""ultra-premium,"" not mere tacky premium — will be destinations where people will go to linger. So, by 2021, when there will be more normal Starbucks than McDonald's, the few Starbucks Roasteries scattered from New York to Shanghai will be Starbucks' entry into the positional economy.Very pricey coffee is just a fresh-brewed variation on the familiar phenomenon of positional goods. They are necessarily, inherently enjoyments for the few. They exist because, particularly in the upper reaches of affluent societies, it is not love that makes the world go 'round, it is a compound of envy and pretentiousness.Four decades ago, the economist Fred Hirsch distinguished between the material economy and the positional economy. Once a society has satisfied basic material needs (food, shelter, clothing), it turns yesterday's luxuries (cars, air conditioning, college educations) into necessities. Because these are mass-market commodities, such material prosperity is a leveling, egalitarian force. Positional competition is emphatically not.In the competition for an ""elite"" education or an ""exclusive"" vacation spot, one person's success is necessarily a loss for many other persons because positional goods cannot be expanded indefinitely. Of course, Starbucks Roasteries could be expanded by the thousands, but this would make the ""experience"" banal and drain the stores of their positional power.After elementary needs — food, shelter, clothing — are satisfied, consumption nevertheless continues, indeed it intensifies because desires are potentially infinite. People compare themselves to their neighbors, envy their neighbors' advantages, and strive to vault ahead in the envy-ostentation sweepstakes.The political equality of democratic societies leaves ample room for, and incites, social inequalities, which are coveted because they counter the leveling forces of mass affluence. Furthermore, as inherited privilege has been replaced by social rationality — Napoleon's ""careers open to talents,"" a meritocracy based on skills and education — there is a residual human urge for irrational distinction. Such as savoring a $12 cup not just for the — let us stipulate — divine flavor but for the sheer fun of showing that you can and that your palate is so refined that merely very good coffee would be excruciating.In any American city large enough to sustain a social ecosystem of snobbery, there is a magazine to guide fastidious consumers to ""the five best craft breweries"" or ""the five best artisanal cheese shops."" Heaven forfend that anyone should have to settle for the sixth best. For discerning tipplers, there are artisanal ice cubes. In San Francisco, The Mill, a cafe and bakery, offers artisanal toast for $4 a slice. It is to die for, say the cognoscenti.Where will the positional economy end? It won't. Stanford professor Francis Fukuyama notes that it is a peculiarity of humans that they desire some things ""not for themselves but because they are desired by other humans."" Hamsters have more sense. This characteristic of our species — the quest for recognition by distinguishing oneself from others — provides limitless marketing possibilities because for many wealthy people, ""the chief enjoyment of riches consists in the parade of riches."" So wrote Adam Smith in ""The Wealth of Nations,"" published in the resonant year of 1776.

239,ICE,"Oil rose to a 17-month high Tuesday as the market shifted focus from output cuts by OPEC and other nations to the global supply balance in 2017.Futures rose 0.3% in New York after surging 2.6% Monday when Saudi Arabia signaled it may cut more than initially agreed and 11 non-OPEC producers also committed to a reduction. That prompted the International Energy Agency to predict U.S. shale output will rise next year, while the oil glut will disappear and global markets will become undersupplied in the first half of 2017. Investors boosted bullish crude bets in the run-up to the Nov. 30 deal.""These cuts move the market from surplus into deficit,"" Andrew Slaughter, executive director at the Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions in Houston, said by phone. ""These cuts will eat into the inventory overhang. How fast this happens depends on how much of a cut OPEC delivers.""Oil has risen about 17% since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed Nov. 30 to trim output for the first time in eight years. The subsequent deal reached last weekend with nonmembers encompasses countries that produce about 60% of the world's crude. The price rally has led to predictions of a production revival in the U.S., where shale output from seven fields may increase next month, a report showed.West Texas intermediate oil for January delivery rose 15 cents to settle at $52.98 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It's the highest close since July 14, 2015. Total volume traded was about 17% above the 100-day average.Brent for February settlement increased 3 cents to $55.72 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, closing at a $1.78 premium to WTI for the same month. The global benchmark crude also closed at the highest level since July 2015.""I think $50 to $60 crude is here to stay,"" said Rob Thummel, a managing director and portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors in Leawood, Kan., who helps manage $15.5 billion. ""It's a sweet spot that will lead to adequate rates of demand growth while spurring enough production.""The Federal Reserve began a two-day policy meeting Tuesday that's projected to result in an interest-rate hike Wednesday.""All of the markets are focused on the Fed right now,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. ""There are doubts about how closely OPEC will adhere to its targets. History doesn't favor them when it comes to this matter.""Global oil stockpiles will decline by about 600,000 barrels a day in the next six months as curbs by OPEC and its partners take effect, said the IEA, which had previously assumed inventories wouldn't drop until the end of 2017.U.S. crude inventories probably shrank by 1.5 million barrels last week for a fourth straight decline, according to the Bloomberg survey before an Energy Information Administration report on Wednesday. Supplies remain at the highest seasonal level in weekly data compiled by the EIA since 1982.""The financial flows into crude after the OPEC and non-OPEC agreement have left a lot of froth in the market,"" said Ed Morse, head of commodity research at Citigroup. ""The higher the price goes and the faster it happens, the higher and faster production of U.S. shale goes up.""

240,ICE,"Standing in the living room of an oceanside $57.5 million home in Malibu, Calif., Jack Ryan, the founder of REX, an online brokerage, took in the view.""The only way you can sell a house like this,"" he said, as the shimmer of the Pacific glinted off gleaming white lawn furniture outside, ""is have them walk through it, either physically or virtually.""Ryan, a former partner at Goldman Sachs (GS) and a onetime opponent of Barack Obama for an Illinois Senate seat, founded REX in 2015 as a low-priced competitor to traditional real estate brokers. According to Ryan, whose business plan involves targeted online ads and charges a fraction of the normal broker's fee, there's an 80% chance that the buyer of an $800,000 home already lives within 15 miles of its location; still, as prices rise to levels only the super-rich can afford, that number plummets.""For homes like this,"" Ryan said, gesturing to the house's fireplace, ""there's a 50% chance that the buyer is outside the U.S., in around 15 financial capitals — London, Shanghai, Paris, Beijing.""To reach that elusive group of the super-rich, Ryan had to get creative, which is why he decided to pay Legend3D to map the house and create an interactive video.""If someone's in Moscow and sees a picture of this home, they say, 'Eh, it's over in Malibu, all I see is this photo; I'm not enthused,' "" Ryan said. ""But if we send them a 3D, fully immersive experience, they can really see the waves and get a feel for this house and say: 'It's perfect for me.'""Selling ItMost people associate virtual reality, or VR, with Oculus Rift and other video-game-oriented headsets, where users strap a black box onto their faces and enter a world where they can look up, down, and behind as the movie or game rolls along. But VR can also, it turns out, be a sales tool.""It's probably one of the only forms of marketing right now that consumers choose to actively engage with,"" said Patrick Milling Smith, co-founder and chief executive officer of the VR production company Here Be Dragons, whose clients include Samsung, Nike (NKE), and NBC. ""They actively engage with it with a sense of wonderment and excitement — you put on a headset, and you're fully immersed.""The real estate industry, in which a primary stage to closing a sale is the act of getting a client into the space, has been understandably eager to embrace just such an immersive technology. The industry has already embraced high-end drone footage of homes; VR was a logical next step.""Photos only tell part of the story, and most of the time they're retouched,"" said Randy Baruh, a broker at Corcoran who's used VR to market a $25 million town house and a $9,500-a-month rental apartment. ""The VR experience gives you an unvarnished experience of the home."" Moving through a space — in Baruh's videos, he acts as a tour guide through the homes — ""nothing beats physically walking through a property, but this comes pretty close,"" he said.VR is also being used on larger-scale projects.When Adam Greene, vice president of residential development at Forest City Ratner Cos. wanted to show off the as-yet unbuilt, eight-acre Pacific Park, he created a VR mock-up of the completed park and the new 17-story luxury condo building developed by Greenland Forest City Partners, 550 Vanderbilt.""When you're selling condos, people can go to a sales center and touch and feel the countertops, see the floor plans, look at finishes, etc.,"" Greene said. ""But they couldn't see the park itself, and we wanted to see if there was a way that people could be immersed in it.""The video, he said, has been useful, though he considers VR one of several marketing tools. ""I couldn't give tangible results, like 'five deals closed because we had VR,' "" he said. ""I think it gives the whole experience of the sales center something a little bit different."" Indeed, multiple brokers all echoed the same point: VR is currently a tool that can get buyers excited, not an actual replacement for seeing the house in person.When the author sat on a puffy white couch in the aforementioned Malibu mansion and toggled between reality and virtual reality, courtesy of an Android phone and a Google Cardboard headset, the medium's strengths and weaknesses became apparent. The most analogous real-life experience could be the act of putting on and taking off low-prescription glasses. You could still see everything, but with the glasses off (and the VR on) things were ever so slightly blurrier.But even with the low-fidelity fuzz, the VR headset was vastly more compelling than a photograph.The gracious flow among the sitting room, living room and kitchen was evident, as was the airy beauty of the living room's French doors, which overlook the Pacific Ocean. From the perspective of the pool house, the VR captured the grand scale of the pool, portico and flowered walkway that led to the main house. All that was missing from the experience was that ineffable gloss exclusive to high-end marketing materials, which, it turns out, is also possible in VR — it's just very expensive.REX's videos cost in the low tens of thousands to produce, according to the company; Baruh's, by comparison, cost in the low thousands, said the broker. The VR rendering of Pacific Park cost from $50,000 to $100,000, Greene said. Here Be Dragons' sleek, cinema-like VR films, in contrast, are on a different playing field.""For a four-to-10 minute, creatively-driven production, brands, studios, and networks will spend between hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars,"" said Milling Smith.The gap is closing, though.Just a year ago, Milling Smith said, people had to build their own rigs to shoot VR. Now, it's a lot more accessible. ""It's far less cost-prohibitive to shoot things.""For Ryan, the owner of REX, this first VR project is indeed just the beginning.""We're actually going to send a Google Cardboard to people who could qualify for a home like this."" he said. ""They don't have to fly from Shanghai to L.A. to check this out — they can just put on the glasses.""MORE ABOUT HOME SELLING:For Home Sellers, Winter Can Be A Break In The IceDesign Features That Sell A Home Faster, And For More MoneyManhattan Home Sales Slow As Sellers Cling To Dreams Of 40% Profit

241,ICE,"Oil advanced to the highest since July 2015 Monday after Saudi Arabia signaled it's ready to cut output more than earlier agreed and non-OPEC countries including Russia pledged to pump less next year.Futures climbed 2.6% in New York and 2.5% in London. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said Saturday the biggest crude exporter will ""cut substantially to be below"" the target agreed on last month with members of OPEC. His comments followed a deal by 11 non-OPEC countries to join forces with the group and trim output by 558,000 barrels a day next year, the first pact between the rivals in 15 years.U.S. oil futures have gained almost 20% since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on Nov. 30 to cut output for the first time in eight years. Saudi Arabia, which initiated OPEC's decision in 2014 to pump without limits, is leading efforts to regain control of the market. The OPEC and non-OPEC plan encompasses countries that produce about 60% of the world's crude.""The non-OPEC cut was expected but nobody foresaw the Saudi statement,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York, said by telephone. ""The market's giving bonus points because the Saudis are willing to do whatever has to be done to balance the market. We wouldn't be up anywhere near as much on the agreement alone.""West Texas Intermediate for January delivery rose $1.33 to settle at $52.83 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It's the highest close since July 14, 2015. Total volume traded was about 81% higher than the 100-day average at 3 p.m. ET.Brent for February settlement climbed $1.36 to $55.69 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contract closed at the highest since July 22, 2015. The global benchmark crude ended the session at a $1.94 premium to February WTI.""The main impact of the non-OPEC collaboration is to pull the global market into balance, if not in deficit, in the second quarter of 2017, rather than in the third quarter,"" said Sarah Emerson, managing director of ESAI Energy in Wakefield, Massachusetts. ""On an annual average basis, this pushed the global balance into a 200,000 to 300,000 barrel-a-day deficit for the year.""Oil and gas companies advanced in the U.S. and Europe. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), the biggest U.S. energy producers, climbed 1.9% and 0.7%, respectively, at 3 p.m. ET.""I can tell you with absolute certainty that effective Jan. 1 we're going to cut and cut substantially, to be below the level that we have committed to on Nov. 30,"" Al-Falih said Saturday in Vienna. The Saudi minister added that the country was ready to take production below 10 million barrels a day, a level it has sustained since March 2015.Al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak also revealed Saturday that they have been working for nearly a year on the agreement, meeting multiple times in secret. OPEC two weeks ago agreed to reduce its own production by 1.2 million barrels a day, and Saudi Arabia has long insisted that any cuts by the group be accompanied by action from other suppliers.""The Saudi statement show's they're really serious,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass., said by telephone. ""There's little chance that they'll bail if things get difficult. It's clear they want to make this work.""Oil prices at $60 a barrel would be ""ideal"" for OPEC as higher levels risk sparking a recovery in competing supplies from the U.S., Nigerian Minister of State for Petroleum Emmanuel Kachikwu said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
"
242,ICE,"Crude climbed as investors shifted their focus to whether OPEC will be able to persuade other producers to commit to output cuts.Futures rose as much as 2.3% in New York, paring a 3.9% loss over the previous two sessions. Prices tumbled Wednesday on the news that OPEC would be willing to count natural declines, rather than insisting on active cuts, in its effort to secure a 600,000 barrel-a-day output reduction from nonmembers, people familiar with the plan said before talks on Saturday. Crude inventories at Cushing, Okla., the largest U.S. storage hub, rose the most since 2009, according to government data.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed last week to trim its output for the first time in eight years, seeking to stem a supply glut and buoy prices. Nonmember Russia pledged a cut of as much as 300,000 barrels a day. OPEC has invited 14 producers from outside the group to discuss further curbs at a Saturday meeting in Vienna.""The market seems to be optimistic about this weekend's meeting and about OPEC's compliance with its agreement to cut output,"" said Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist in Seattle at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which oversees $133 billion of assets. ""The market has turned positive and price declines will be followed by speculators building and rebuilding positions.""West Texas Intermediate for January delivery rose $1.07 to settle at $50.84 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was 47% above the 100-day average at 3 p.m. Prices closed at a 16-month high of $51.79 on Monday.Brent for February settlement climbed 89 cents, or 1.7%, to $53.89 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark closed at a $2.01 premium to February WTI.The pending meeting has kept traders on edge. Futures in New York dropped from $50.54 a barrel to $49.77 and then rebounded to $50.41 in seven minutes as the Russian news agency ITAR-Tass issued a report saying the Saturday meeting may be postponed. The report was followed by one quoting the country's oil ministry as saying that the talks will take place as planned.Oil market volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Crude Oil Volatility Index, dropped about 36% since the OPEC agreement. The index slipped to the lowest since Oct. 25 Wednesday.While OPEC expects that Russia will contribute half of non-OPEC production cuts, part of the further 300,000-barrel curbs required can come from natural declines, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as the talks are private. So far, only Russia and Oman have agreed to cut actual output, they said.""It's looking more and more likely that there will be a deal this weekend,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities in New York, said by telephone. ""We've got a very-oversupplied global market while the guys at OPEC try to change that. This has led to a daily battle royal in the market.""The increase in supplies at Cushing, the delivery point for WTI, led to a widening of the contango in the market, Yawger said. The discount between WTI futures closest to delivery and those for delivery in coming months widened to the highest since April on Thursday. Stockpiles at the hub rose by 3.78 million barrels to 65.3 million last week, according to Energy Information Administration data on Wednesday.
"
243,ICE,"Oil rose as U.S. crude stockpiles are seen falling for a ninth week, ahead of the release of industry-funded data on inventories.Futures climbed 1.7% in New York after declining as much as 1% during the session. A Bloomberg survey found that U.S. crude inventories probably dropped last week, creating impetus for higher prices. Contango, the market structure where the near-term contract trades at a discount to those for expiration later, narrowed between the July and August West Texas Intermediate crude contracts, lending to bullish sentiment.Meanwhile, Kuwait's Oil Minister Issam Almarzooq told the official news agency KUNA that Qatar is committed to the global oil-cuts deal, with a compliance rate of 93% to 102%. This comes as efforts are underway to resolve a clash between Qatar and Saudi Arabia.""The rumors that this could somehow disrupt the OPEC production deal obviously were overplayed,"" Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, said by telephone. Oil's rally comes as investors expected a drop in U.S. crude inventories, pushing them out of short positions, he said.Oil has traded below $50 a barrel in New York since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners agreed to extend output cuts into 2018 amid speculation that despite the curbs, a supply glut will persist. While American stockpiles have recently edged lower, output from the country has expanded to the highest since August 2015.U.S. crude inventories probably declined by 3.25 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey before the release of data from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday. Crude stockpiles at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI and the biggest U.S. oil-storage hub, probably decreased by 750,000 barrels, according to a forecast compiled by Bloomberg.West Texas Intermediate for July delivery rose 79 cents to settle at $48.19 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 26% above the 100-day average. The spread between July and August WTI narrowed to a discount of 15 cents, the smallest contango for the rolling front-month spread since September 2015.Investors are expecting a U.S. crude inventory draw, which is lending support to the market, according to Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we saw the front spread get even a little bit stronger. That would definitely give a bid to crude prices,"" he said by telephone.Brent for August settlement climbed 65 cents to end the session at $50.12 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $1.78 to WTI for the same month.Saudi Arabia port authorities say no vessels will be allowed coming from or going to Qatar, regardless of flag or owner nationality, Inchcape Shipping Services said on its website. The Saudi ban on vessels going to and from Qatar will create logistical difficulties for some combination charters of crude oil supertankers from the Persian Gulf and will likely increase the use of smaller vessels, according to Per Mansson, a shipbroker at Affinity Shipping in London.

244,ICE,"Oil dropped to the lowest level in more than three weeks as the market refocused on glut concerns after a diplomatic clash involving Saudi Arabia and Qatar was seen as having a limited impact on supply.Futures dropped 0.6% in New York, after rising as much as 1.6% earlier in the session. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt said they will suspend air, sea and land travel to and from Qatar, escalating a crisis that started from a dispute over relations with Iran. Qatar, though, still has access to shipping routes to deliver oil and gas to global buyers, and the specter of rising U.S. rig counts remains an issue.""The market has again turned its focus to worries that excess supplies are going to continue to keep the glut in place,"" Gene McGillian, market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, said by telephone.West Texas Intermediate for July delivery slipped 26 cents to settle at $47.40 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest level since May 10. Total volume traded was about 12% above the 100-day average. WTI fell 4.3% last week, the largest weekly drop since early May.Gasoline futures for July delivery declined 2.5% to settle at $1.5381 a gallon, the lowest level in more than three weeks. The July gasoline crack spread, a rough measure of the profit from the refining crude into gasoline, fell by $1.38 to settle at $17.20 a barrel.Brent for August settlement fell 48 cents to end the session at $49.47 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $1.89 to August WTI, the smallest premium since late February.Crude has traded below $50 a barrel in New York since the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to extend output cuts amid lingering concerns that the reductions won't be enough to shrink global inventories as U.S. output continues to expand. While the Saudi-Qatar diplomatic spat hasn't affected shipments, further escalation could raise the prospect of supply disruptions from the Middle East, including OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Iran and Qatar.The nations all use the Strait of Hormuz, through which the U.S. Department of Energy estimates about 30% of seaborne oil trade passes.""The gas continues to flow. There is no disruption in the cargo schedule. At the end of the day, it sends the signal that there's not this unified OPEC-type situation that is advertised,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York, said by telephone.In the meantime, ""the rig count in the United States is up 20 weeks in a row,"" Yawger said. ""We're not going to burn off the storage overhang here in the U.S. any time soon.""While OPEC members have had political disputes and even fought wars through the organization's 57-year history, their shared economic interests have meant agreements on oil production have still been implemented. The same will probably happen during the current dispute, said Abdulsamad Al-Awadhi, a London-based analyst who was one of Kuwait's representatives to the group between 1980 and 2001.Drillers targeting crude in the U.S. added rigs for the 20th straight week to the highest level since April 2015, according to data Friday from Baker Hughes Inc. Nationwide crude output is at the highest level since August 2015.Worries remain that OPEC and non-OPEC's deal to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels a day ""is really going to face a significant offset by rising production levels elsewhere in the world,"" Tradition Energy's McGillian said.
"
245,ICE,"A decrease in crude stockpiles that spurred an early oil rebound wasn't enough to counter broader market concerns about U.S. production that continues to rise.Futures fell after gaining as much as 1.7% in New York. While U.S. inventories declined by 6.43 million barrels last week, production jumped by 22,000 barrels a day to 9.34 million, the most since August 2015, the Energy Information Administration reported on Thursday. At the same time, output from Libya, exempt from OPEC's deal to cut supply, rose to the highest since October 2014 as production from its biggest field increased.""The U.S. output is a bearish factor for sure, maybe the bearish factor,"" said Clayton Rogers, an energy derivative broker at SCS Commodities in Jersey City, N.J.West Texas Intermediate for July delivery rose 4 cents to settle at $48.32 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract lost $1.34, or 2.7%, to close at $48.32 on Wednesday, the lowest level since May 12. Prices fell 2.1% last month.Oil slid below $50 a barrel last week after the agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to prolong supply cuts for nine months disappointed some investors hoping for more. While U.S. stockpiles have fallen for eight straight weeks, American production and drilling continues to climb.The trading range between $45-$55 is ""the path of least resistance,"" said Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, in a telephone interview. ""You stay in that range until you get some kind of clear and convincing evidence"" to break out higher or lower.Brent for August settlement fell 13 cents to $50.63 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The July contract expired Wednesday after dropping $1.53, or 3%, to $50.31. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $2.06 to August WTI.While traders remain bearish, Bob Dudley, chief executive officer of BP (BP), said he believes the OPEC extension has helped stabilize the market and is preventing further price declines. Much of the industry can continue to cut costs to withstand lower prices, he said in a Bloomberg TV interview in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Thursday.
"
246,ICE,"Oil fell amid doubts that prolonged cuts by OPEC and its allies will succeed in clearing a surplus while U.S. output remains so resilient.Futures pared losses after falling as much as 3.9%. While Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid Al-Falih, said the cuts are working and predicted global inventories will fall to the five-year average in early 2018, American drillers continue to add rigs to shale fields.The market's initial reaction to increased output from Libya was tempered as OPEC and Russia affirmed the goal of tackling the global glut, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy.""Competing commentary from the Saudis and Russia"" on ""keeping up the good work"" offset the response, he said. ""At some point, the verbal interventions do work.""Even with U.S. crude stockpiles forecast to show declines for an eighth week, West Texas intermediate for July delivery settled at $48.32 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down $1.34.

The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $2.16 to WTI.The deal is coming across as ineffective to investors as more barrels enter the market from the U.S. and Libya, said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York.""There doesn't seem to be an end to supply out there,"" Yawger said in a phone interview. ""And demand is not exactly rip-roaring.""By the end of the year, U.S. output is seen reaching a record 10 million barrels a day, according to consulting and data firm Rystad Energy AS. Production with oil at $50 a barrel has grown faster ""than any analysts in the market predicted,"" said ­Bjornar Tonhaugen, vice president for oil markets, in a report Wednesday.U.S. crude stockpiles probably fell by 3 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey before an Energy Information Administration report on Thursday. American drillers last week boosted the number of active rigs to 722, the most since April 2015, according to data from Baker Hughes.
"
247,ICE,"Climate Change: President Trump is letting it be known that he intends to take the U.S. out of the Paris Accords on climate change. While it will no doubt cause a political flap, it's a smart move that ends the cynical charade of limiting climate change by shrinking our economy.Trump is reportedly working with Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt on the details of pulling out before announcing the decision, according to news reports. Trump issued a tweet earlier Wednesday saying only that he ""will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days.""Even so, the hyperventilation by climate-change fanatics has already begun.Tom Steyer, the billionaire leftist who has embraced the global warming cause as a springboard to political power, termed Trump's possible move a ""traitorous act of war."" Tesla and Space X founder Elon Musk said he'll quit all the advisory groups he serves on in the White House if Trump withdraws.A group of very big energy companies, including ExxonMobil (Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's old firm), Shell, BP, Cheniere Energy and a large number of others joined together (for political reasons) to get Trump to stay in. Even Ivanka, Trump's daughter, pressured him.Yet, Trump promised a little more than a year ago that he would pull out, and seems on his way to keeping his promise — even if it angers China and the European Union, which have joined forces to oppose Trump's move, not to mention Ivanka.Sorry, Trump's right, and his foes are wrong. The Paris Agreement is a bad deal that will devastate the economies of the West, in particular, the U.S., while leaving the fastest growing emitters of CO2 — namely, China and India — out of the picture.Has the world heated up in the last 150 years? Of course. But that's because we were leaving something that climatologists have dubbed ""The Little Ice Age.""But is human-produced CO2 the cause? The proof is thin, and relies heavily on more than 70 mathematical models, none of which can even back-cast past temperatures, much less forecast future ones.And the temperature data themselves are compromised. They have been fudged so many times by pro-global warming scientists that there's now little question that much of what passes for science is really fraud. The most reliable temperature data, which come from satellites, show unequivocally no warming since 1998. But this is ignored.Worst of all, the 200 signatories to this so-called accord would have us all spend trillions of dollars each year to mitigate global temperatures by a mere 0.17 of a degree by 2100. That's one-fifth of a degree, rounded up.Put in perspective, the main global warming models predict as much as two degrees of warming by the end of the century.  Take that at face value: That means we'll  spend literally trillions of dollars each year for 1.8 degrees of warming instead of 2 degrees of warming.This is crazy from a cost-benefit perspective, especially since many agriculture experts say that if the climate warms — for whatever reason — it will raise crop yields and help us to feed the two billion or so added people we are likely to have on Earth by then.Meanwhile, as a report reminded us last year, Europe's CO2 emissions have continued to rise, despite spending over $1.2 trillion on green subsidies of various types.As for the U.S., its emissions have plunged 12.2% since peaking in 2007. Thanks to fracking and other new technologies, we are cutting more CO2 per capita than any major nation on Earth.So the question arises: if the Paris Accords are so bogus, why are they being pursued with such intense, even fanatical, political energy?The short answer is, bureaucrats and government officials want to keep their power, even as disenchantment with bad governance sweeps the globe. What better way than to predict a catastrophe that will occur if we all don't give them massive amounts of our money and near-total control over our lives?And if you think that isn't true, just this month, a new report by 13 economists, all global warming true believers, called for a $4 trillion global carbon tax ""to avoid dangerous climate change,"" as Britain's Independent reported.Let's be clear: There is no evidence that a carbon tax of that magnitude will do anything other than crush the world economy, making billions of people poorer.That's not all. At a global warming conference earlier in May in Bonn, Germany, conferees called for $400 billion to be handed over each year to poor countries to help them deal with the effects of warming. This has nothing to do with global warming science; it's a massive income-transfer scheme from rich nations to poor nations cooked up by socialist climate planners.This is another reason why Donald Trump's election has been so fortunate; had all this taken place under President Hillary Clinton, the U.S. would today be saddled with economy-killing regulations that would have destroyed our prosperity and cost us hundreds of billions of dollars a year for nothing in return.If the reports are true and Trump is indeed planning on leaving the Paris Agreement, we applaud him. He's keeping a promise, and doing the right thing, both economically and scientifically. Some day, people will understand the global warming ""crisis"" for what it is: One of the greatest political frauds ever perpetrated.RELATED:Memo To Trump: Walk, Don't Run, From The Destructive Paris Climate TreatyScience Is Unsettled: Why Trump Should Dump The Paris Climate DealYou Have To Laugh At What Environmentalists Are Saying About Trump

248,ICE,"Cocoa prices soared amid signs of tighter supplies in Ivory Coast, the world's top grower, raising prospects that chocolate costs will climb.July futures jumped as much as 6.8%, the most ever for the contract. Farmers in West Africa are already locking in more forward sales for next year's crop than traders were expecting, a sign that supplies from the current harvest are beginning to ebb.The outlook for tighter supplies marks a shift for the market that's been suffering from a global surplus. The overhang pushed prices down 32% over the past 12 months, helping to lower some retail costs for chocolate. The treats may not stay cheap for long — at least that's what hedge funds are signaling. Money managers have backed away from their bearish cocoa bets for three straight weeks, U.S. government data show.On ICE Futures U.S., cocoa for July delivery added 6.6% to settle at $2,037 a metric ton Tuesday in New York. Aggregate trading was about 70% higher than the 100-day average for the time of day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prices are rebounding after reaching the lowest in almost 10 years in April.Ivory Coast growers have sold 950,000 tons of cocoa beans from the 2017-18 main crop as of May 27, according to a person familiar with the matter. The main crop, which starts Oct. 1, is the larger of the country's two annual harvests.""That's a pretty big upfront sale, and it's probably the reason why prices are rallying,"" Jack Scoville, vice president for Price Futures Group in Chicago, said in a phone interview.Some growing regions in Ivory Coast and Ghana, the second-largest producer, have been dry and need moisture to aid early crop growth, according to Gaithersburg, Md.-based MDA Weather Services. Trees are also stressed from a lack of moisture in Indonesia's Sulawesi region.

250,ICE,"Both Donald Trump and daughter Ivanka reportedly met Monday with Al Gore to discuss global warming. The Trumps couldn't have wasted their time more if they had spent their entire day eating Cap'n Crunch straight out of a family-size box while watching a marathon of ""The View"" reruns.There's a strong temptation to call Gore a crackpot, but what he truly is is a swindler. He's made a fortune out of peddling fear where none should be. Apparently his net worth is roughly $200 million. Bloomberg News calls him ""Romney-rich."" There's no way he could have reached those financial heights without running the Great Global Warming Scam. Years of his climate exaggerations were gold for his investment portfolio: He makes up stories about a monster, then sells the frightened townspeople the weapons he tells them they need to slay the dragon.But the monster is of course no more real than the Big Bad Wolf. He's been talked about but never seen. There's a reason for that.In January we listed five ways that we know Gore has been running a global warming racket, and as the year closes we are finding items that we could add to the list.First, there are reports that ""show global temperatures are dropping fast.""""It is obvious that the world is cooling after El Nino and nobody knows how much it will as global temperatures bottom out,"" Global Warming Policy Forum science editor David Whitehouse wrote in the Watts Up With That blog.Then there's this from Climate Depot: Princeton physicist William Happer says that ""if global warming were any other branch of science it would have been abandoned a long time ago.""Climate scientists are, of course, obsessed with man's carbon dioxide emissions. But Happer says this is essentially nonsense.""All of the geological evidence indicates that CO2 is a minor player"" in previous eras of warming, he said last week in a Climate Depot podcast.""We've had ice ages with 10 times more CO2 than we have today. That's not supposed to happen, according to current computer models, but it did happen.""Trump ran as the candidate who said that man-made global warming is a ""hoax."" We think it's more fraud than hoax, but his point is well-taken. That he and his daughter would give Gore even a minute of their time is a bit unsettling. The Tennessee preening horse is central to the climate deception and deserves not even a courtesy visit or call from the incoming administration. Let's hope the Trumps walked away from the meeting realizing that Gore is a con man.RELATED:The Growth Of Global Warming Nonsense: Surely We've Reached Peak MadnessFive Ways We Know That Al Gore Is Running A Global Warming RacketGlobal Warming: Trump Is Adult Supervision The Climate Kids Need

251,ICE,"One of the more salutary outcomes of the recent election is that Democrats are finally beginning to question the wisdom of basing their fortunes on identity politics. Having counted on the allegiance of African-Americans, Hispanics, gays, unmarried women and the young — and winning the popular vote all but once since 1992 — they were seduced into believing that they could ride this ""coalition of the ascendant"" into permanent command of the presidency.They're reconsidering now not because identity politics Balkanizes society, creates state-chosen favored groups and fosters communal strife. They're reconsidering because it's not working.Democrats read the 2008 and 2012 election results as a harbinger of the future. Then came 2016. They now realize that the huge turnout of their constituencies was attributable to Barack Obama, a uniquely gifted campaigner whose aura is not transferable.And why assume that identity politics creates permanent allegiances? Take the Hispanic vote. Both Mitt Romney and Donald Trump won less than 30%, but in 2004 George W. Bush won 44%. Why assume that the GOP cannot be competitive again?As these groups evolve socioeconomically, their political allegiances can easily change. This is particularly true for the phenomenally successful Asian-American community. There is no reason the more entrepreneurial party, the GOP, should continue to lose this vote by more than 2-to-1.Moreover, the legitimation of identity politics by the Democrats has finally come back to bite them. Trump managed to read, then mobilize, the white working class, and to endow it with political self-consciousness. What he voiced on their behalf was the unspoken complaint of decades: Why not us? All these other groups, up to and including the relatively tiny population of transgender people, receive benefits, special attention and cultural approbation, yet we are left out in the cold, neglected and condescended to as both our social status and economic conditions decline.For all the embrace of identity politics at home, abroad Obama has preached the opposite. Here is a man telling a black audience in September that he would ""consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy"" if they don't turn out for the Democratic candidate in November. Yet on his valedictory tour abroad just nine weeks later, he lectures anyone who will listen on the sins of parochialism. His urgent message for the nations of the world, including his own, is to eschew ""tribalism"" in the name of a common universalism.This doctrine of global consciousness found its photographic expression just two weeks ago. There was parka-bundled John Kerry on a visit to the Antarctic, to which he had dropped in to make a point about global warming. Three days later, Vladimir Putin, thinking tribally, renewed the savage bombing of Aleppo and then moved nuclear-capable missiles into Kaliningrad to remind Europeans of the perils of defying the regional strongman.Putin is quite prepared to leave the Antarctic ice sheets to Kerry while he sets his sights on Eastern Europe and the Levant. Our allies, meanwhile, remain amazed that Obama still believes the kinds of things he said in his maiden U.N. address about the obsolescence of power politics and national domination — and act accordingly as if his brave new world of shared universal values had already arrived.Seven months ago, Obama went to Britain to urge them — with characteristic unsuccess — to remain in Europe. Now he returns to Europe to urge everyone to resist the siren song of ""a crude sort of nationalism, or ethnic identity, or tribalism.""This is rather ironic, given that what was meant as a swipe at both European and Trumpian ethno-nationalism is a fairly good description of the Democratic Party's domestic strategy of identity politics.To be sure, ethnic appeal has been part of American politics forever. But the Hillary Clinton campaign was its reductio ad absurdum: all segmented group appeal, no message. Even Bernie Sanders is urging that ""we go beyond identity politics"" if Democrats are ever to appeal again to the working class.As for foreign policy, there has always been and always should be an element of transcendent mission to American actions. But its reductio ad absurdum was the Obama doctrine of self-sacrificial subordination of U.S. interests to universal values. That doctrine is finished. The results, from Ukraine to Aleppo to the South China Sea, are simply too stark.For the Democrats, the road back — from tribalism at home and universalism abroad — beckons. RELATED:Media Malpractice?

Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said it's ""highly probable"" OPEC will reach a consensus at the talks, according to comments published by Shana news service. Iraq will offer plans to help reach an accord, Oil Minister Jabbar Al-Luaibi said. Discussions went well, Libyan OPEC Governor Mohamed Oun said as he left the group's Vienna headquarters on Monday evening. Goldman Sachs Group (GS) said the likelihood of an agreement meant the bank was bullish on oil in the short term.Oil has rebounded from an eight-week low on Nov. 14 as members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries make renewed diplomatic efforts before their Nov. 30 meeting to finalize the supply deal they agreed to informally in September. The group's plan to trim output for the first time in eight years is complicated by Iran's commitment to boost production and Iraq's request for an exemption to help fund its war with Islamist militants.""The news flow from OPEC is encouraging,"" said Mike Wittner, head of oil-market research at Societe Generale in New York. ""This could turn on a dime, but for now the noise is positive and points to a deal.""West Texas Intermediate for December delivery, which expired Monday, rose $1.80 to $47.49 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

""We're paying attention to signals from the OPEC ministers as they try to finalize an agreement.""It's likely that OPEC members will honor the accord and try to put it into action, Iran's Zanganeh said after meeting OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo in Tehran on Saturday. Iraq's ""legitimate demands"" shouldn't be considered an obstacle to reaching a deal to freeze production, Al-Luaibi said.Russian President Vladimir Putin said he sees no obstacles to an OPEC agreement this month as he reaffirmed Russia is willing to freeze crude output at current levels. Russia has added more than 400 billion rubles ($6 billion) in projected budget revenue based on this year's production talks, according to two officials familiar with the government's calculations.""Whether an agreement will be reached, I can't say 100%, but there's a strong likelihood that it will be achieved,"" Putin told reporters on Sunday after attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima.Goldman Sachs sees WTI at $55 in both the first and second quarters of next year, compared with prior estimates of $45 and $50 a barrel, according to a note on Monday. It lowered third- and fourth-quarter estimates to $50 from $55 and $60 a barrel previously.The bank now forecasts that OPEC will put in place a short-term cut to 33 million barrels a day, while Russia will freeze production.

OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said he's confident the group can reduce record oil inventories and bring forward the rebalancing of the market.""The Saudis are working hard to reach a deal,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. ""You don't fight the Fed in the bond market and when it comes to oil you don't fight the Saudis.""The September agreement marked the end of OPEC's two-year long experiment with pumping at will. Saudi Arabia led the group in the effort to grab market share and curb the development of more expensive reserves such as U.S. shale.While U.S. production has dropped from last year's 44-year high, the decline is slowing. The Energy Information Administration this month raised its output forecast for 2017. Rigs targeting oil in the U.S. rose the most in 16 months last week, according to Baker Hughes.Producers and merchants increased short positions, or protection against lower WTI prices, to the highest level since March 2011.

256,ICE,"The heat is on, not because summer beckons, but instead because of a pressure campaign now being aimed at the new California Attorney General, Xavier Becerra. An alliance of environmentalists, plaintiff attorneys, public-sector spending interests, public officials, and others is attempting to induce him to investigate the fossil-fuel industry in general and Exxon in particular.The argument is that Exxon supposedly knew long ago that increasing atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations would engender a series of climate catastrophes, which purportedly already are visible; but then misled the public writ large and its own investors over decades about those risks in order to protect the value of its fossil-fuel assets.Evidence of this perfidy is asserted to exist in a number of internal memorandums at Exxon, Shell and other firms, reflected, for example, in Exxon's internal recognition that rising GHG concentrations created climate risks, and in Shell's decision to increase the height of a North Sea drilling rig in order to withstand rising seas, even as the industry proclaimed uncertainty about the future climate effects of greenhouse-gas emissions.Please allow me to translate all that: Exxon and other fossil-fuel companies ""knew"" things decades ago about which the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to this day reports (page 14) as large uncertainties. That ""knowledge"" was based upon climate models that remain very poor in their actual ability to predict temperatures and climate phenomena.Accordingly, Exxon ""knew"" that increasing GHG concentrations would cause about twice as much warming as has actually occurred! And: Making investments in the face of uncertainty about the nature and magnitude of future dangers is evidence of duplicity.Wow. When you pay an auto insurance premium, is that evidence that you ""know"" you will cause an accident? Or do you do so out of caution?But never mind. Let us focus instead on the common assertion that the dangers of GHG emissions already are ""significant and growing"" and that Exxon knew it decades ago. It is absolutely true that anthropogenic climate change is ""real"" in the sense that increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations are having a detectable effect, important evidence of which, perhaps counterintuitively, is declining temperatures in the lower stratosphere.But the temperature records are not consistent with a looming crisis view. Atmospheric temperatures have been roughly flat since 2002. (1998 was a strong El Nino year, and so a few years of cooling followed). Largely because of another very strong El Nino, 2015-16 was hot, but surface and atmospheric temperatures have declined sharply since then.More generally, the temperature record since the late 19th century does not correlate well with increasing GHG concentrations. No one claims, for example, that the warming observed from 1910 to the mid-1940s was caused by man.Global temperatures appear to be on a longer-term upward trajectory, but the degree to which that trend is man-made is not known; the Earth since roughly 1850 has continued to emerge in fits and starts from the Little Ice Age.Increases in sea levels have been roughly constant at about 3.3 mm per year since the early 1990s, despite increasing GHG concentrations. There is a close correlation between sea levels and the El Nino/Southern Oscillation.The Arctic sea ice has been declining, although more slowly in recent years, while the Antarctic has been gaining mass. There has been no trend in total U.S. tornado activity since 1954, and a declining trend in strong-to-violent tornadoes.There has been no trend in the frequency of tropical cyclones since the early 1970s, no trend in the frequency of global hurricanes, and no trend in tropical accumulated cyclone energy (crudely, the destructiveness of cyclones and the cyclone season). The annual number of U.S. wildfires shows no trend since 1985. The Palmer Drought Severity Index shows no trend since 1895. There is no correlation between U.S. flooding and increasing GHG concentrations.And IPCC in its latest report does not support (Table 12.4) the various assertions about catastrophic future impacts of increasing GHG concentrations.And so the argument that ""Exxon knew"" that apocalypse was looming is preposterous. Can anyone doubt that this political campaign is designed to extract many billions of dollars from the fossil-fuel sector in a repeat of the 1998 tobacco shakedown?In a constitutional republic governed by the rule of law, public officials are not supposed to pick out a politically unpopular group and then try to find ways to hammer it. Instead, upon discovering actual evidence that a crime has been committed, those officials are supposed to gather additional facts leading them to file charges against the parties suspected to have committed those crimes, individuals who enjoy a presumption of innocence until convicted in a court of law governed by the rules of due process.Many seem to believe that none of that matters because they dislike the oil industry. They will applaud politicized prosecutions a lot less when they find themselves the targets of big, powerful government.

Nvidia also raised its Q4 sales target above views. Microchip EPS rose 42% and sales 56%. MaxLinear also topped views, though guidance was weak due to legacy-product declines. Nvidia shares skyrocketed 30% on Friday to a new high. For the week so far, Microchip rose 4.8%, MaxLinear 12% and Microsemi 9.7%.Walt Disney (DIS) missed fiscal Q4 estimates and warned that 2017 would be ""an anomaly"" in its growth arc, with the box-office-melting success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" making for a tough year-over-year comparison. But investors may already be looking to fiscal 2018, when Disney will release four Marvel movies and two more ""Star Wars"" films. Disney also said that the factors that have caused ESPN to lose subscribers ""have abated,"" and that the sports network would likely continue to grow as ESPN adapts to more digital platforms. Disney shares rose nearly 6% for the week so far.Macy's (M) missed Q3 estimates but cited strong results from Apple and Michael Kors (KORS) products that should continue in the current holiday quarter. (But luxury apparel maker Kors itself warned on its holiday sales). Macy's raised its full-year same-store sales forecast. Kohl's (KSS) reported Q3 EPS and revenue above expectations, with strong back-to-school and October sales that should continue into the holiday season. Nordstrom (JWN) crushed EPS growth estimates. The upscale department store operator raised its full year EPS guidance to $2.85-$2.95, well above Wall Street estimates. However, J.C. Penney (JCP) sales missed expectations and cut its sales forecast.But shares of all four retailers enjoyed double-digit percentage gains for the week.Priceline reported Q3 earnings and revenue that topped estimates, sending its shares to an all-time high. Priceline also said interim CEO Brett Keller is taking over as permanent chief executive, effective immediately. TripAdvisor (TRIP), a Priceline rival, reported weaker-than-expected Q3 revenue, sending shares falling.E-commerce giant Alibaba Group processed $17.8 billion worth of sales on China's biggest online shopping day of the year, known as Singles Day. That busted last year's record of $14.3 billion. But growth slowed to 24% from 60% last year. Alibaba takes a small percentage of sales for managing the transaction for vendors. Alibaba shares fell 1.4% Friday, extending a slide since late September.The Singles Day event towers over the U.S. shopping events known as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Black Friday last year had total sales of $4.5 billion, and Cyber Monday had $3 billion.Chinese online game maker and portal NetEase (NTES) earned $3.42 per U.S. share excluding items in the third quarter, up 47%. Sales rose 38% to $1.38 billion in Q3. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected NetEase to earn $2.89 per share excluding items on sales of $1.43 billion. Online games accounted for 71% of revenue. NetEase tumbled 3.6% for the week afternoon, falling significantly below its 50-day line for the first time since April.Gold prices skyrocketed Tuesday night as stock futures and the dollar initially tumbled on fears that a Trump win would spur massive selling and put the Fed on ice. But with stocks actually faring well and bond yields spiking, gold prices quickly reversed for a weekly loss of more than 6%, the worst since 2013. Gold mining stocks that retook some key technical levels went back down. Newmont Mining (NEM) fell 16%, Barrick Gold (ABX) 19%. Meanwhile, industrial miners rallied as Trump infrastructure plans lifted copper, other industrial metals and materials.China-based Momo (MOMO) reported Q3 earnings that beat estimates, which the company credited to its success with live video. The provider of a video streaming website and mobile social platform said revenue surged 319% to $157 million, soaring past estimates of $130.5 million. Momo sees Q4 revenue of $185 million-$190 million, above forecasts for $140.2 million.But Momo's stock, which initially rose to a new high, reversed sharply lower to trade down more than 8%.Acacia Communications (ACIA) late Thursday reported Q3 earnings minus items that rose 240% to $1.01, as revenue jumped 107% to $135.3 million. Analysts had modeled non-GAAP EPS of 81 cents and revenue of $130.8 million after Acacia revised guidance twice during the quarter. The maker of high-speed optical devices for communications networks sees adjusted EPS of 85-92 cents vs. views of 78 cents. But revenue of $138.5 million at the midpoint of its guidance is just above the consensus for $137.2 million. Acacia fell 1% Friday but rose 12.8% for the week.Fabrinet (FN) late Monday said fiscal Q1 EPS leapt 78% to 80 cents while revenue was up 53% to $332 million, its fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth. Both easily beat analyst estimates. Fabrinet also gave upbeat EPS and sales guidance for the current Q2. Fabrinet shares rose 8.9% for the week.Oil prices initially rose but closed down 1.5% to $43.41 a barrel — the third straight weekly slide — amid concerns about rising supply and weak demand. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has called for less regulation and more drilling for the U.S. industry, which could ultimately boost supply further. Weekly U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 2.43 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said, an increase that was above analyst expectations. OPEC said its October production hit a record high, adding doubts that it will finalize and implement a production-cut agreement. The International Energy Agency warned that sluggish economic growth will continue to weigh on oil demand, and ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its capital spending for next year.

260,ICE,"Oil climbed as global markets weighed the implications of Republican Donald Trump's election as the 45th U.S. president.Futures rose 0.6% in New York after falling as much as 4.3% earlier. U.S. equities gained amid speculation Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress will pursue business-friendly policies. The knee-jerk sell-off of risky assets began to abate as Trump, 70, promised to try to unite America's divided political factions after his victory over Hillary Clinton.""This is quite a reversal from midnight last night,"" said Matt Sallee, who helps manage $15 billion in oil-related assets at Tortoise Capital Advisors in Leawood, Kansas. ""We're still coming to grips with the implications of the election. A consensus may be forming that fiscal stimulus, lower taxes and a loose monetary policy will be good for growth.""The result nonetheless rattled markets that had banked on a continuation of economic and trade policies under a Democratic president. Most polls had shown Clinton ahead of Trump going into the vote and websites that took bets on the victor had put her odds of winning at 80% or more.West Texas Intermediate for December delivery rose 29 cents to settle at $45.27 a barrel  on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

""We're getting a relief rally pretty much on nothing. The fundamentals are not that bullish.""Trump exceeded the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become the president-elect and the Republicans also retained control of Congress. Trump has pledged to clamp down on immigration to the U.S. and renegotiate free-trade agreements with countries including Mexico.""I don't think President Trump will have a big impact on oil demand or output,"" said Mike Wittner, head of oil-market research at Societe Generale in New York. ""He's made statements, but we haven't seen any thought-out policies. We will have to wait for him to get a team in place and come up with policies.""In the longer term, the reaction in oil markets to the election result would likely take a back seat to questions over whether OPEC will be able to complete a deal to restrain output at its late-November meeting in Vienna.U.S. crude stockpiles rose 2.43 million barrels to 485 million last week, Energy Information Administration data showed Wednesday. A 2 million-barrel gain was forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and a 4.4 million increase was reported Tuesday by the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute.""The market is in wait-and-see mode,"" said Tim Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd. in Calgary. ""We can look forward to a lot of volatility as the policies and plans of the Trump administration are formulated.Oil retreated below $45 a barrel following the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' failure to agree on output quotas for member countries on Oct. 28. The group must reach a consensus before finalizing its September deal to cut production. OPEC's chief warned of prolonged market instability if there is no agreement to limit supply.""We're going to be focused about the demand impact of the election in the short run,"" said Chip Hodge, who oversees a $12 billion natural-resource bond portfolio as senior managing director at John Hancock in Boston. ""If there's no OPEC deal prices will be under bullish pressure.""Other raw materials and the companies that produce them were whipsawed by Trump's shock victory. Agricultural commodities declined while industrial metals rebounded from earlier losses and gold surged with haven assets.

A 2 million barrel  increase was forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Imports surged 28% to the highest in four years. Prices were down before the report's release on record OPEC output last month, which is complicating the group's effort to stabilize prices.Oil is continuing its retreat triggered by the failure last week of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on the member quotas required to implement an output deal reached in Algiers in September. While Goldman Sachs Group sees little chance of an agreement at an official meeting of the group on Nov. 30, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and OPEC's head remain confident of a deal.""Market conditions have deteriorated and we're back at $45,"" said Chris Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at Macro Risk Advisors LLC in New York.

That contrasts with government data due Wednesday that's expected to show a 2 million barrel decline, according to a Bloomberg survey.Russia and Saudi Arabia, the largest of the 24 producers that agreed to a deal to cut supply for six months starting in January, are reaffirming their commitment, which should prompt other countries to follow, according to Goldman Sachs Group. There's still concern that a surge in U.S. production, together with an increase in Libyan output and signs of recovery in Nigeria, may undercut the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' strategy to stabilize the market and prop up prices.""We're going to be in a holding pattern until we see the inventory reports,"" Thomas Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group in Wellington, Fla., said by telephone.

Supplies of gasoline probably dropped 1 million barrels, while inventories of distillate fuel, a category that includes diesel and heating oil, slipped 1.45 million barrels last week.The world's oil stockpiles increased only slightly in the first quarter and are set to decline in the second as demand picks up seasonally and OPEC constrains output, the International Energy Agency said Tuesday in its monthly report. Still, even if OPEC and its partners prolong their measures when they meet next week, inventories will probably remain above average through the end of the year, it said.""The backing of a nine-month extension by Saudi Arabia and Russia got the market moving higher,"" Gene McGillian, manager of market research for Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn,, said by telephone.

While output curbs that started Jan. 1 are working, global inventories aren't yet at the level targeted by OPEC and its allies, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said Monday in Beijing alongside his Russian counterpart, Alexander Novak. The ministers agreed the deal should be extended through the first quarter of 2018 at the same volume of reductions, they said.""When Saudi Arabia and Russia come out together it sends a very strong signal to the market,"" Mike Wittner, head of commodities research at Societe Generale in New York, said by telephone. ""With these two countries behind the extension of the accord, chances are very high that they will get all of OPEC behind it.""The largest of the 24 producers that agreed to cut supply for six months are reaffirming their commitment to the deal amid growing doubts about its effectiveness so far.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ended talks with nonmembers such as Russia and Brazil on Saturday without an agreement, Brazil's Oil and Gas Secretary Marcio Felix said. The previous day, OPEC still hadn't resolved how to allocate among its members an output cut announced last month. Iraq has joined Iran, Nigeria and Libya in seeking to be excluded from any curbs.Oil traded near $50 a barrel after OPEC's first agreement to reduce output in eight years was reached in Algiers on Sept. 28. Prices fell in five of the six past sessions amid doubts about the group's ability to implement the cuts at its official November meeting. As the gathering opened in Vienna last week, Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo warned of the consequences if producers don't follow through on an agreement to reduce output. The price recovery has already taken far too long, he said.""People are getting weary about the chances of OPEC and non-OPEC (parties) coming to an agreement to cut supply,"" said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass.

Reuters reported Saudi Arabia and its Gulf OPEC allies are willing to cut 4% from their peak oil output, citing sources familiar with the matter. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo urged members to show ""maximum flexibility"" to agree on output cuts, after saying Tuesday that the group is facing its ""hardest"" challenge.""There is a report that the Saudis and their Gulf compatriots are willing to cut output by 4%,"" John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy, said by telephone.

Nigeria, Iran and Libya are exempt from the proposed output cuts. Speaking from Iraq, OPEC's Barkindo said he would work with members to overcome the ""challenges and uncertainties"" of the market and urged them to be accommodating to achieve an agreement. Meanwhile, Algeria's Energy Minister Noureddine Boutarfa said there's ""no turning back"" on the Algiers deal and that the group's Nov. 30 summit will fix quotas.""The market is increasingly convinced that there won't be meaningful production cuts from OPEC and Russia even if an agreement is made, but the gradual path towards tighter supply-demand balances and psychological impact of OPEC cooperation is limiting downside risk,"" said Clayton Rogers, an energy derivative broker at SCS Commodities in New Jersey.

270,ICE,"Any honest man, looking back on a very long life, must admit -- even if only to himself -- being a relic of a bygone era. Having lived long enough to have seen both ""the greatest generation"" that fought World War II and the gratingest generation that we see all around us today, makes being a relic of the past more of a boast than an admission.Not everything in the past was admirable. Poet W.H. Auden called the 1930s ""a low dishonest decade."" So were the 1960s, which launched many of the trends we are experiencing so painfully today. Some of the fashionable notions of the 1930s reappeared in the 1960s, often using the very same discredited words and producing the same disastrous consequences.The old are not really smarter than the young, in terms of sheer brainpower. It is just that we have already made the kinds of mistakes that the young are about to make, and we have already suffered the consequences that the young are going to suffer, if they disregard the record of the past.If you want to understand the fatal dangers facing America today, read ""The Gathering Storm"" by Winston Churchill. The book is not about America, the Middle East or nuclear missiles. But it shows Europe's attitudes and delusions -- aimed at peace in the years before the Second World War -- which instead ended up bringing on that most terrible war in all of human history.Black adults, during the years when I was growing up in Harlem, had far less education than black adults today -- but far more common sense. In an age of artificial intelligence, too many of our schools and colleges are producing artificial stupidity, among both blacks and whites.The first time I traveled across the Atlantic Ocean, as the plane flew into the skies over London I was struck by the thought that, in these skies, a thousand British fighter pilots fought off Hitler's air force and saved both Britain and Western civilization. But how many students today will have any idea of such things, with history being neglected in favor of politically correct rhetoric?You cannot live a long life without having been forced to change your mind many times about people and things -- including in some cases, your whole view of the world. Those who glorify the young today do them a great disservice, when this sends inexperienced young people out into the world cocksure about things on which they have barely scratched the surface.In my first overseas trip, I was struck by blatantly obvious differences in behavior among different groups, such as the Malays and the Chinese in Malaysia -- and wondered why scholars who were far more well-traveled than I was seemed not to have noticed such things, and to have resorted to all sorts of esoteric theories to explain why some groups earned higher incomes than others.There are words that were once common, but which are seldom heard any more. The phrase ""none of your business"" is one of these. Today, everything seems to be the government's business or the media's business. And the word ""risque"" would be almost impossible to explain to young people, in a world where gross vulgarity is widespread and widely accepted.Back when I taught at UCLA, I was constantly amazed at how little so many students knew. Finally, I could no longer restrain myself from asking a student the question that had long puzzled me: ""What were you doing for the last 12 years before you got here?""Reading about the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, and the widespread retrogressions of Western civilization that followed, was an experience that was sobering, if not crushing. Ancient history in general lets us know how long human beings have been the way they are, and dampens giddy zeal for the latest panaceas, despite how politically correct those panaceas may be.When I was growing up, we were taught the stories of people whose inventions and scientific discoveries had expanded the lives of millions of other people. Today, students are being taught to admire those who complain, denounce and demand.The first column I ever wrote, 39 years ago, was titled ""The Profits of Doom."" This was long before Al Gore made millions of dollars promoting global warming hysteria. Back in 1970, the prevailing hysteria was the threat of a new ice age -- promoted by some of the same environmentalists who are promoting global warming hysteria today.

Several are D.C. outsiders who likely will need luxury living spaces.Connecticut's Linda McMahon, who's slated to lead the Small Business Administration, shares a net worth of at least $1.35 billion with her husband, Vince, as the co-founders of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Exxon Mobil (XOM) Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, a Texan who was picked for secretary of state, has a net worth of $365 million, according to a Bloomberg wealth analysis. Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group (GS) partner and hedge fund manager, has wealth estimated at $655 million.Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross, the New York private equity titan with a $2.9 billion net worth, has already settled on a place, the Washington Post reported Dec. 13. He bought a 10,000-square-foot estate in Massachusetts Heights that was listed for $12 million, the newspaper said. Ivanka Trump and her husband, real estate developer and Trump advisor Jared Kushner, also are looking in the area, according to the New York Post.""We would all love to have the distinct privilege of selling our listings to any of the folks coming in to town,"" said David Howell, executive vice president of McEnearney Associates, which has eight offices in the region. ""We're all clamoring for that business and dusting off our contacts.""Still, Howell cautions against too much excitement. The number of wealthy cabinet members is finite. And the 4,000 executive appointments that typically come with a new administration tend to happen gradually over the course of 18 months, he said. Some of the new arrivals take time renting before they commit to a purchase.""It's not like come Jan. 20, a switch gets turned and 4,000 bodies arrive in Washington and they're all ready to buy a house,"" said Howell, who himself relocated to Washington in 1976 to work for Gerald Ford's campaign.When they do come, the real estate market feels it. In the five months after a presidential election, home sales in the Washington metropolitan area typically increase about 12% from the same period the year before, according to an analysis by the National Association of Realtors, which measured the average from the past six elections. Home prices climb about 6.5% during those same five months.Those who are buying high-end houses are entering a tepid market. In the third quarter, the average sale price of a Washington luxury home, defined as the priciest 5% of sales, fell 0.9% from a year earlier to $2.38 million, according to brokerage Redfin. Prices in the rest of the market were up 5.1% to an average of $582,000.Trump appointees who are sending teams now are the higher-level officials whose staff come to town for a day, look at homes and then narrow the list down to a final three or so for their boss to visit, said Nancy Itteilag, a broker with Washington Fine Properties, who has shown them her listings.One of the properties they looked at was an 11,242-square-foot home at 2509 Foxhall Road in the Northwest area that is listed for $15.5 million. The seven-bedroom house, previously rented by the French ambassador, also is available for lease at $42,000 per month, she said. It has an infinity pool and a wine cellar, according to the listing.DuShuttle's listing in Alexandria, which she took over from a previous broker last month, highlights the kind of amenities that a high-placed official who enjoys entertaining might want in a home. The kitchen includes four ovens, and the circular driveway ""provides ample parking for many guests,"" according to the listing, which notes that previous occupants of the 5,400-square-foot house held several dinner parties there, some with ""notable VIPs.""More than 100 varieties of birds, including bald eagles, have been spotted in the garden outside, and the grounds include what is possibly the town's oldest magnolia tree, according to the listing.""We thought this might appeal to someone, especially someone coming in from the Pence side,"" DuShuttle said of Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is the governor of Indiana. ""They're used to a little bit more land but don't want a long commute.""MORE ABOUT HOME SELLING:For Home Sellers, Winter Can Be A Break In The IceDesign Features That Sell A Home Faster — And For More MoneyVirtual Reality Is Finding A Home In High-End Sales

272,ICE,"Most in the U.S. still say it's a good time to either buy or sell a home, but not as many as did at the start of the year. And renters, especially, are feeling less optimistic about homebuying than they did a year ago. Those are some of the key findings of a quarterly survey by the National Association of Realtors, measuring sentiment about the U.S. economy and housing.Even though most in the U.S. said in the fourth quarter that it's a good housing market for both buyers and sellers, sentiment has shifted toward the sell side, the NAR data indicate. In the first quarter of this year, 75% of U.S. households said it was a good time to buy, with 44% saying they felt strongly about that. In the current quarter, the share who said it was a good time to buy fell to 70%, even though those who felt strongly about that edged up, to 45%.Those who felt moderately positive about homebuying shrank from 31% in Q1 to 25% in Q4.Those who felt it was a good time to sell rose from 56% in Q1 to 62% currently, with those feeling strongly about that growing from 28% to 35% over the same span.The Midwest had the greatest share (77%) expressing optimism about buying while the West, where home prices have been accelerating for some time, had the biggest segment (41%) who said it wasn't a good time to buy.The West also had the biggest share (69%) who said it was a good time to sell, while the Northeast had the biggest percentage (44%) who were pessimistic about that.Living situation was also a major factor in respondents' outlook toward purchasing a home, with 78% of homeowners agreeing it was a good time to buy, but only 57% of renters saying the same. That's a drop of 11 percentage points among renters from last year, when the share was 68%.Homeowners also saw a pullback on homebuying from Q4 2015, but only by 4 percentage points from last year's 82%.The NAR survey was taken before the recent move by the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates; that might be why only a slightly bigger share of those who don't currently own a home said it would be ""very difficult"" to qualify for a mortgage, given their current situation. (It was 30% in Q4 compared to 29% in the previous quarter). And fewer of them than in Q3 thought it would be ""somewhat difficult"" — 31% compared to 36% previously.""Rents and home prices outpacing incomes and scant supply in the affordable price range has been a prominent headwind for many prospective buyers this year,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, in a news release accompanying the report. ""Making matters worse, the unwelcoming reality of higher mortgage rates since the election is likely further holding back confidence. Younger households, renters and those living in the costlier West region — where prices have soared in recent months — are the least optimistic about buying.""Still, among all respondents, 54% said they felt the U.S. economy was improving, while only 48% had said so in Q3. And for those under 34 years old, a key demographic for first-time homebuyers, that sentiment was held by 62%, compared to 58% in the previous quarter.Other highlights of the NAR report:The NAR says its report resulted from a survey that was conducted from October through early December, among a random sample of U.S. households, with about 900 qualified households responding each month.MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:For Home Sellers, Winter Can Be A Break In the IceHome Flipping Follows Its Six-Year High With A FlopRust Belt Eclipses Sun Belt For Rental Income

273,ICE,"While we're just entering the month when it's believed U.S. homebuyers are likely to score their best deals, that situation can change dramatically as the new year begins. A recent study by residential real estate company Redfin says that winter is second only to spring as the best time for a seller to put a home on the market — and it's a very close second.In winter ""you may have fewer people looking to buy, but those who are looking are serious,"" said a Redfin real estate agent, Michelle Leader, in the report. ""Buyers that time of year often need to move,"" the Oklahoma-based agent added, ""so they're much less likely to make a lowball offer and they'll often want to close quickly — two things that can make the sale much smoother.""In its study, Redfin looked at data from 7 million for-sale homes listed across 23 metro areas during the past four years. In grouping them by the season in which they first went on the market, Redfin found that winter was only slightly behind spring — the traditional home-selling season — in its share of homes that sold for more than the listed price. Among the homes listed in the spring, 18.7% got more than sellers asked for; among those listed in winter, it was 17.5%.Winter was also a strong second in the briskness with which dwellings moved off the market. While 48% of the spring listings sold within 30 days, winter's share was 46.2%. Summer's portion was nearly 5 percentage points behind, at 43.6%, while autumn's was 40.9%.And while you might expect less foot traffic in places hardest hit by winter weather, Redfin found that ""when broken down by metro, winter and spring maintained their top spots consistently, even across markets with weather as varied as Los Angeles, Boston and Atlanta.""Despite those numbers, the winter season falls behind spring and summer in its portion of home listings. Spring is the clear leader there, with 32.6% of for-sale homes being listed then. Summer is next, with 26.7%. Winter's share is 23.7%.But that, says Redfin, also plays to a seller's advantage: It means less competition in attracting those serious homebuyers.MORE ABOUT HOME SELLING:Fewer Vacant Homes In U.S., But 3 Out Of 4 Belong To InvestorsIt's Still A Good Time To Buy A Home, But Also To Sell, Survey SaysDesign Features That Sell A Home Faster — And For More Money

A force majeure on its western port of Zawiya has been lifted, according to a person familiar with operations. Both U.S. gasoline and distillate stockpiles rose by the most since January last week, according to an Energy Information Administration report Wednesday. Nationwide crude output is at the highest level since August 2015.Oil has declined over the past two weeks amid concern that rising U.S. output will offset efforts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to trim a global glut. Russia, which joined the bloc in cutting production in the six months to June, may find it more difficult to extend the deal as that would constrain plans by local companies to expand. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said this week his country will wait to decide on joining OPEC in prolonging the output curbs.""The market is technically weak and the Libya headline was the excuse we needed to sell off,""  Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, said by telephone.

Refineries processed 17.3 million barrels of crude a day, a record amount. Crude stockpiles slid by 3.64 million barrels and nationwide crude output rose by 13,000 barrels a day to 9.27 million a day.Gasoline futures for May delivery fell 2.5% to settle at $1.5500 a gallon, the lowest level since late February.

But the fund expands its scope with more than 30% of holdings in financial services firms such as NYSE operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and BlackRock (BLK), which happens to be the parent of the iShares family of ETFs.About 10% of the portfolio is categorized as software, where credit card companies Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) are found.The fund differs from its larger cousin, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), in a couple of significant ways. Financial Select Sector has about two-thirds as many holdings and they're generally bigger stocks. The average market cap for Financial Select Sector is $89.6 billion, compared with $69.5 billion for iShares U.S. Financial, according to Morningstar.A great many of the 110 stocks in the iShares fund are near the 10-week moving average, including most of the largest holdings. Similarly, iShares U.S. Financial Services is testing support as it pulls back to the 10-week moving average.

282,ICE,"After the nation watches Donald Trump swear the presidential oath of office, the world will watch how he positions America as the leader of the free world.Before the inauguration, the world was watching something very different. More than 175,000 professionals — including 55,000 non-U.S. executives — gathered in Las Vegas for CES 2017 to marvel at the miracle of technological innovation. If CES showed the world anything, it is that there is a global market for ingenuity — a market with great potential for job creation and to address global challenges. But for that market to thrive, we must have trade deals that work.Candidate Trump promised to revisit trade agreements with the goal of expanding U.S. manufacturing, creating higher-paying U.S. jobs and expanding the economy. Since Election Day, he has charged his pick for commerce secretary to lead trade policy and created a White House role for an economist not favorable to trade with China. This may be innocuous — the secretary of commerce will be the liaison to business, and the other White House trade advisors will handle other broad pieces that many don't think of as trade, such as education, infrastructure, advanced automation and technology.But ultimately, it seems when Trump talks trade, he's looking to create an entirely new, bottom-up approach to trade policy. Given his goal to create a competitive, modern trade structure, here are five worthy, achievable objectives:Since its inception, the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) has boosted U.S. trade, lowered U.S. consumer prices and increased our economic growth. But Nafta is not perfect. The 1993 agreement did not account for the internet and the digital economy. Nafta must be modernized to address cross-border data flows, prohibit forced data localization and reflect balanced copyright policy. Nafta can also harmonize standards to eliminate conflicting and costly energy-efficiency requirements, as well as other unnecessary technical trade barriers. This is the approach advocated by Trump advisor Anthony Scaramucci in his early-December presentation to the problem-solvers group No Labels.Rather than blocking Chinese access to our markets, insist on parity in our economic relationships. Americans cannot do business in China without a majority Chinese partner, nor can Americans easily buy real estate in China. Meanwhile, Chinese citizens invested $300 billion in the U.S. real estate market from 2010 to 2015. Requiring parity in how we treat each other's citizens and companies will level the playing field between our countries. Additionally, we can balance China's influence by exerting leadership in Asia and kick-starting the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Imposing tariffs on imports will add costs for U.S. consumers and businesses, while inviting retaliation from our trading partners. Instead, we can grow jobs and spark our economy by lowering our corporate tax rate and enabling U.S. companies to repatriate funds held abroad. We can reform our immigration system to encourage the world's best and brightest to build businesses in the U.S.We must ensure the U.S. has a world-class physical and digital infrastructure. And we can remove barriers to innovation like the recent Department of Labor overtime rule and a legal system that incentivizes nuisance patent lawsuits.Frustrated by its inability to create new innovative companies, the EU increasingly uses ambiguous laws to restrict or demand huge payments from successful American companies such as Amazon, Apple, Intel, Qualcomm and Google. President Trump is the kind of leader who will push back strongly and effectively.Historically, Great Britain has been our closest ally, and the recent Brexit speech by British Prime Minister Theresa May offers Trump an opportunity to create a trade agreement that would cement the relationship with our parent nation. It would also send a message to the EU to change its anti-American tone, and could send a message to other pro-American countries such as Germany, which may want to consider a different approach than the stifling rules and huge costs imposed by Brussels.We're living in a rapidly changing world and America chose a new leader who literally wrote a world best-seller on deal making. ""The Art of the Deal"" describes how Trump, as a young man, envisioned a better future where everyone else saw grime and despair. He created a gleaming modern hotel next to Grand Central Station where a decaying structure stood. He built a Central Park ice skating rink at a fraction of the cost and time of prior efforts by the city government. And he imagined and sold a convention center where only empty train tracks lay.Businessman Trump was a doer. Candidate Trump tore up the campaign rule book and won. President Trump has the opportunity to make positive changes for trade, keeping the U.S. as a leader in great jobs and innovation.

But few details about the closed meeting were revealed.Trump, who took shots at Apple, Amazon and tech in general during the campaign, looked to forge some common ground with the tech leaders. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, in the only public comment by a tech attendee, called the meeting ""very productive."" At the meeting's start, which was open to the press, Trump complimented the industry and said he wanted to help it do well.But Trump is off to a rocky start with China's government, starting with a breach of long-held protocol by accepting a phone call from Taiwan's president. China claims Taiwan as part of China, and the U.S. has officially recognized ""One China"" diplomatic relations since 1979. The Trump camp has suggested the One China policy could be used as a bargaining chip to win future trade concessions.During the campaign, Trump promised to brand China a currency manipulator. He warned of slapping a 45% import tariff on all Chinese goods.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix is a current member of the exclusive IBD Leaderboard, where only the very best stocks at or near buy points reside. Netflix has a conventional buy point of 129.39, but investors willing to be more aggressive should check out Leaderboard for some more information.If Trump follows through and elevates the international status of Taiwan and enacts protectionist trade measures, China's government would retaliate, observers say. China did protest Trump's phone conversation with Taiwan's president.U.S. tech, and other, companies should be ""plenty worried"" about Trump's statements, says Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. But if Trump's words don't turn into action, it could blow over. China will hold Trump more accountable once he's sworn in as president on Jan. 20, Lardy says.""He's not president yet,"" Lardy said. ""There are a lot of things China could do, but I don't think they will do any of them until there's something that goes beyond rhetoric.""Talking about how he's going to be a hard deal maker, all these things are not going to set the Chinese off on a path of retaliation immediately. But if it becomes more concrete than just rhetoric, at that point you could see retaliation in the commercial sphere. There are lots of screws they can turn on U.S. companies.""China's possible retaliatory actions include case-by-case enforcement of anti-monopoly laws and business regulations, slapping tariffs on U.S. goods and favoring European multinationals in purchases. China also could put an economic embargo on Taiwanese products.One worry for Silicon Valley is that Trump's transition team and early Cabinet appointments have few ties to the tech industry. Trump has focused on manufacturing jobs, not the digital economy. Wilbur Ross Jr., selected to head the Commerce Department, is well-known for deals in the steel and coal industry.Trump has named Gov. Terry Branstad, R-Iowa, as his ambassador to China. Branstad calls President Xi Jinping of China an ""old friend."" Lardy, though, says it's not clear how much of a ""moderating effect"" Branstad will have on Trump's dealings with China.Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA) has warned Trump about raising trade barriers. And a Chinese state-run newspaper warned in November that companies such as Apple and Boeing (BA) would be among the first to be punished if a trade war erupts.For its fiscal Q4 ended Sept. 24, Apple garnered 19% of its revenue from the Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong. Amid tougher competition from local smartphone makers, Apple's revenue from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan fell 30% year over year in the quarter to $8.8 billion. The was by far its worst-performing region, but Apple has high hopes for its business in the world's biggest nation.Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) gets some 38% of revenue from China, says a JPMorgan report. Qualcomm in 2015 agreed to pay a $975 million fine as part of a settlement with Chinese antitrust authorities that probed its licensing deals.IBM (IBM), Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) head a long list of computer companies that could be impacted by a U.S.-China trade battle, as well as chipmakers Intel and Micron Technology (MU) and data storage product makers such as Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX).Some companies have already been harmed from revelations by Edward Snowden that U.S. tech firms' products have been used by the National Security Agency for spying. China's government responded by telling state-owned companies to buy more local equipment.One wild card is whether Trump can be more helpful to U.S. companies aiming to crack China's market than the Obama administration.Video streamer Netflix (NFLX) recently shelved its expansion in China, saying ""the regulatory environment for foreign digital content services in China has become challenging.""IBM, Intel and Microsoft have complained of Beijing pressure to hand over the keys to intellectual property to win more business.China's censorship and monitoring of social networks has stymied U.S. internet firms. Google pulled out of mainland China in 2010. Facebook, anxious to break into China, has developed censorship tools designed to let the nation's regulators suppress content, according to reports from the New York Times and others.Cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA), which acquired movie studio DreamWorks in April, is ""very, very bullish"" on its China business, Steve Burke, CEO of Comcast's NBCUniversal, said on the company's earnings conference call in July.""I'm talking movies, television, consumer products and theme parks,"" Burke said.Comcast is on track to open a new theme park in Beijing, with local partners, in 2020. Meanwhile, China is poised to become the world's No. 1 film market.Then there are companies like Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) that have a stake in trade relations. China last year said it would open up its fast-growing electronic payments market, including bank card transactions, to foreign companies. China has been under World Trade Organization pressure to open up its payments card business since 2001.One risk for U.S. companies is that joint ventures on the mainland could be put on ice if trade frictions rise. Wang Jianlin, China's richest man and chairman of real estate and entertainment giant Dalian Wanda Group, has warned Trump of trouble if Chinese acquisitions of U.S. assets are blocked.Since China joined the World Trade Organization 15 years ago, U.S. exports to China have risen by more than 600%, while U.S. exports to the rest of the world rose by 80%, Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia, told IBD in an email.The U.S. ran up a $366 billion trade deficit with China last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It has been declining, but Trump aims to lower further.""Many American jobs and corporate profits would be lost if China would retaliate against new tariffs, including in the Republican-leaning Farm Belt, as China is the second-largest market for American agricultural exports, led by soybeans,"" Rothman said. ""Prices for goods sold at places such as Wal-Mart (WMT) might rise by 10% or more.  That would hurt the spending power of Trump's working-class political base.""RELATED:Apple, Palantir Among Loose Ends At Trump Tech SummitApple Hits Great Wall Of iPhone Competition In ChinaAlibaba Singles Day Breaks Record, But Growth SlowsChina GDP Rises 6.7% In Q3, Same As Q2, Q1

284,ICE,"ObamaCare was on the way to the emergency room and in need of major surgery no matter who won the election.The pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly, and premiums are soaring as a result. The reason is simple: The law succeeded in making insurance affordable for older, higher-cost, and near-poor individuals, but has fallen far short of its promise for those who are relatively young, lower cost, working class and middle class.Those latter groups comprise some 24 million people who lack either employer or government coverage, and if TrumpCare were to give them a better deal, while preserving the protections afforded to the vulnerable, Democrats would have every reason to get on board.There is an exceedingly simple bipartisan formula for replacing ObamaCare's individual market reforms with ""something terrific,"" in Donald Trump's words, at least relative to the status quo and to the GOP plans on the table.That formula, explained in further detail below, is this: Get rid of the heavy-handed mandates and give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have (and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need) and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for catastrophic care and set aside funds in a Health Savings Account to cover basic medical needs.There's good reason to think that this is the only possible path to a bipartisan health care fix and that the political window for seizing this opportunity may quickly shut if not seized early in 2017. Unfortunately, the GOP is contemplating a repeal-now, fix-later strategy that, at worst, could blow up the individual health insurance market or, at best, let ObamaCare's problems fester for three years or more, hurting millions and millions of working-class and middle-class individuals and families that need — and in many cases voted for — a better deal.Keeping ObamaCare on life support for years while the GOP wracks its collective brain to come up with something terrific would require insurer ""bailouts"" — the Republicans' own term for it — that could exceed anything seen under President Obama. To keep insurers from bolting the troubled markets en masse after a repeal vote, Republicans would have to essentially guarantee that they'll at least break even after administrative expenses.Republicans would be attending to the bottom line of big insurers such as Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI) and Humana (HUM) while ignoring the needs of 20-plus million people who are getting a bad deal from ObamaCare and would like to see that deal ripped up tomorrow.Before getting into the details of a replacement, let's take a moment to consider just who these 20-plus million people are who have nothing to gain and much to lose from repeal and delay.IBD'S TAKE: Despite the uncertainty over what will happen to ObamaCare and Medicaid in the Trump era, shares of UnitedHealth have surged to a record high since the election. Here's why the company is well on its way to becoming the Amazon of health care.There are about 7 million people buying ObamaCare plans off the exchange, mostly because they earn too much to qualify for exchange subsidies. That's hardly fair treatment when nearly everybody else gets government subsidies to buy health insurance, either through the tax exclusion for employer-provided coverage or through a government program. On top of that, there are another 3 million with income above ObamaCare's 400% of poverty level cut-off for subsidies who remain uninsured and more than a million buying unsubsidized coverage through the exchanges. All of these people would stand to benefit from GOP proposals to offer a tax credit for everyone buying coverage in the non-employer market, but Republicans in Congress now say that such ideas may be put on ice, even as ObamaCare premiums are soaring, making coverage harder to attain.Another 4.5 million people are uninsured despite working full time and having an offer of employer coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. These people have modest to moderate incomes that would qualify them for ObamaCare subsidies, but they — and their spouses — are ineligible as long as employer coverage doesn't cost more than about 9.7% of income. That means high-deductible bronze-level coverage can cost some full-timers five times or even upwards of 10 times what its costs someone at the same income level who is eligible for exchange subsidies (perhaps because they work two part-time jobs or at a smaller company not subject to ObamaCare's employer mandate).KFF estimates that there are another 5.3 million uninsured people who are eligible for subsidies but have spurned ObamaCare coverage, either because they see it as a bad deal — even with subsidies, if they buy coverage, and fines, if they don't — or perhaps aren't fully aware of their eligibility. The Urban Institute estimates this group is even larger, comprising 6.9 million people.Finally, there are 2.6 million low-income Americans in states like Texas and Florida who earn too little to qualify for Medicaid but can't get exchange subsidies. That's because the Supreme Court created a coverage gap when it ruled that the Medicaid expansion must be voluntary for states.That makes about 24 million Americans who have a huge stake in the GOP's coming decision, and that doesn't even include the 8 million-plus subsidized ObamaCare exchange customers who don't want to see their coverage disrupted or roughly 10 million gaining coverage via the Medicaid expansion.If Republicans stick to their repeal and delay strategy, experts warn that the individual insurance market could be thrown into crisis with far-reaching repercussions. While the GOP can conceivably avoid outright chaos in the individual market by protecting insurers' bottom lines, what will that achieve? They'll never get any Democratic votes needed to overcome a filibuster and there will likely never be a bridge to a strictly Republican vision of reform. To understand why, just consider this analysis showing that the same plan which costs a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level (about $23,600) less than $1,000 under ObamaCare would cost the couple roughly $18,000 under the Empowering Patients First Act authored by Rep. Tom Price, Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.Making coverage affordable for older, higher-cost, low-income patients isn't the problem with ObamaCare. The problem is that ObamaCare's rules stacked the deck in favor of comprehensive coverage and gave a bad deal to pretty much everyone else, which is why the pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly.Even among households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, a group that was supposed to be among the big beneficiaries of the law, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting silver-level coverage that will protect them from financial disaster, an IBD analysis of ObamaCare's effect on the working class has found.Consider the example of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis, Mo., with pre-tax income of $40,000 (200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare this year costs about $2,200, and carries a $1,000 deductible (and $4,500 out-of-pocket limit on top of premiums), but they're probably already struggling to save money and that may be too much of a financial stretch.Alternatively, this couple could buy the cheapest bronze plan for $1,260, but it carries a $13,700 deductible, which means that a trip to the hospital could be financially devastating.The chasm between silver and bronze deductibles — $1,000 vs. $13,700 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. The architects of ObamaCare decided to attach extra cost-sharing support only to silver plans, effectively turning silver plans to platinum for modest-income beneficiaries while making bronze plans of questionable value. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers on a monthly basis, whether or not the policy holder gets medical care.Looking through the lens of this 30-year-old St. Louis couple, a bipartisan replacement that merges Republican principles and Democratic values is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a comprehensive policy that limits their liability.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option: a high-deductible plan with a Health Savings Account on top. TrumpCare, unlike ObamaCare, could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings with two simple tweaks. ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young could be eased for high-deductible plans (without putting comprehensive plans out of reach of older adults), and cost-sharing subsidies could be used against bronze plan premiums. Those two steps would shrink that 30-year-old St. Louis couple's premium to zero this year, and they'd have about $800 left in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses.While Democrats don't want modest-income households to opt for high-deductible plans that could sink their finances, having some coverage is better than none, as is all too common at present — despite ObamaCare's penalties for those who go uncovered. That's why families above 200% of the poverty level should be able to opt for catastrophic coverage — with higher deductibles than bronze, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democratic senators. This approach, along with the tweaks noted above, could make coverage free for everyone up to about 250% of the poverty level.Third, give people fair treatment. There's no reason why members of the middle class who earn too much for ObamaCare subsidies should be denied a comparable level of help given to those who get coverage through the workplace. A logical way to do this would be giving a tax credit equal to 25% of the cost of a silver plan, while limiting the income-tax benefit to 25% of the cost of employer-provided coverage and capping that benefit for high-income households. Further, full-time low-wage workers who can't afford the coverage offered at work and their spouses shouldn't be denied the help given to people buying coverage on the individual market.Fourth, get rid of the mandates. The employer mandate is easy to dodge and ends up harming the low-wage workers it was supposed to help. As for the individual mandate, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get coverage essentially for free, and those with lower incomes get Health Saving Account deposits on top, there's really no point in threatening them with penalties.Even for people above 250% of the poverty level, coverage would be a lot cheaper for the young adults who are the prime target of the individual mandate, so take-up would naturally increase. Still, to ensure a broad risk pool, TrumpCare should eliminate the incentive to go without coverage when one is young and healthy, then sign up when one's health starts deteriorating. A logical approach would very gradually and incrementally shrink tax subsidies for those above 250% of the poverty level based on how long they go without coverage. This should apply to both the individual market and employer market, or else people would have reason not to get coverage between jobs.Republican plans would steer people who develop costly conditions while their coverage has lapsed to separate subsidized high-risk pools. The idea is understandable, since a small number of high-cost patients can substantially raise premiums for the whole pool, particularly in relatively small markets. Yet, if the coverage provided by these separate high-risk pools is good and affordable (as it should be), the availability of this option could provide peace of mind for the uninsured and encourage people to go without coverage. That's one reason why it may make more sense to hold down premiums in the individual market through another mechanism that accomplishes the same goal. That would entail an ongoing federal reinsurance program that recoups insurer expenses of the highest-cost patients, much like Alaska is doing to keep its individual market viable (while asking the federal government for financial backing). Reinsurance may have come under attack as part of overall opposition to ObamaCare, but it's hardly a partisan idea. Public reinsurance is a feature of Medicare's Part D prescription drug benefit that came into being under President George W. Bush.All of these features would create a broad, stable risk pool, affordable coverage options and plenty of flexibility to let people get the coverage that suits them best, including an option for modest-income households to deposit subsidies in excess of premiums in a Health Savings Account. This approach, or something very close to it, is likely the only approach to replacing ObamaCare's individual market reforms that can win bipartisan support, but the chance for seizing it may go quickly out the window if Republicans opt for repeal and put the replacement debate on hold.The reason why should be clear: Making sure that no one currently benefiting from ObamaCare is ""worse off"" and that the 20 million-plus who get a bad deal can get a better deal — the goal for replacing the law sketched out by Paul Ryan — will require some hard choices. That includes reforming the income-tax (though not payroll-tax) exclusion for employer-provided coverage as outlined above. There are other logical offsets as well to pay for what essentially would be a tax cut for millions of people without raising tax rates. But once the debate is poisoned by the consequences of repeal and delay on the individual market, and once Republicans move forward with the rest of their tax-cutting agenda, the opportunity will almost certainly be gone. At that point, as in President Bush's failed push for Social Security reform in 2005, Democrats will have a whole list of Trump tax cuts they'll want repealed before they begin to consider reforms that require any politically difficult trade-offs.

"
289,ICE,"In the election cycle dominated by Donald Trump, it should not be much of a shock that the first October Surprise came from ""Access Hollywood."" In a 2005 outtake, Trump told then-""Access"" co-host Billy Bush how he could rudely grab women's genitals and get away with it because ""when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.""They say it was a recent discovery. No media October Surprise there. No, siree.Smelling Trump's blood in the water, the Clinton-enabling press sprung into action. None of them seemed to reflect for 5 seconds about how Trump could be describing Bill Clinton's modus operandi. Trump talked as Clinton did. The press' moral outrage was as phony as Hillary Clinton's. ""This is horrific,"" Clinton shamelessly tweeted. ""We cannot allow this man to become president.""The women who were actually harassed by Bill Clinton were never offered any support from Hillary Clinton, or her feminist army in the press. In February of 1994, Paula Jones held a press conference to accuse Bill Clinton of exposing himself and requesting oral sex in a hotel room in Little Rock, Arkansas. Other than 16 seconds on ABC, the media decided that wasn't news ... until Jones filed a lawsuit and the Clintons hired a lawyer three months later.But the Jones case vanished from the press and played no significant role in the 1996 presidential campaign. There were 11 network stories during the entire election year. Half of them were perfunctory notices of legal claims, and the other half focused on the Republican National Committee making an ad mocking Bill Clinton for claiming that he couldn't be sued because he was on ""active duty"" as commander-in-chief. Once Clinton was safely re-elected, a few establishment media outlets decided that maybe there was something to this Jones thing.The lawsuit eventually led to the deposition of former Clinton intern Monica Lewinsky, so the story became a huge, national nightmare -- in part because both Bill and Hillary Clinton claimed for months that Lewinsky was lying. When the story broke, Hillary Clinton even said on ABC that Lewinsky misunderstood that Bill Clinton is just ""a happy, friendly, loving, kind, good person."" He ""reaches out to all kinds of people.""ABC enabled that. No laugh track. No skepticism.

290,ICE,"In the election cycle dominated by Donald Trump, it should not be much of a shock that the first October Surprise came from ""Access Hollywood."" In a 2005 outtake, Trump told then-""Access"" co-host Billy Bush how he could rudely grab women's genitals and get away with it because ""when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.""They say it was a recent discovery. No media October Surprise there. No, siree.Smelling Trump's blood in the water, the Clinton-enabling press sprung into action. None of them seemed to reflect for 5 seconds about how Trump could be describing Bill Clinton's modus operandi. Trump talked as Clinton did. The press' moral outrage was as phony as Hillary Clinton's. ""This is horrific,"" Clinton shamelessly tweeted. ""We cannot allow this man to become president.""The women who were actually harassed by Bill Clinton were never offered any support from Hillary Clinton, or her feminist army in the press. In February of 1994, Paula Jones held a news conference to accuse Bill Clinton of exposing himself and requesting oral sex in a hotel room in Little Rock, Arkansas. Other than 16 seconds on ABC, the media decided that wasn't news ... until Jones filed a lawsuit and the Clintons hired a lawyer three months later.But the Jones case vanished from the press and played no significant role in the 1996 presidential campaign. There were 11 network stories during the entire election year. Half of them were perfunctory notices of legal claims, and the other half focused on the Republican National Committee making an ad mocking Bill Clinton for claiming that he couldn't be sued because he was on ""active duty"" as commander in chief. Once Clinton was safely re-elected, a few establishment media outlets decided that maybe there was something to this Jones thing.The lawsuit eventually led to the deposition of former Clinton intern Monica Lewinsky, so the story became a huge, national nightmare — in part because both Bill and Hillary Clinton claimed for months that Lewinsky was lying. When the story broke, Hillary Clinton even said on ABC that Lewinsky misunderstood that Bill Clinton is just ""a happy, friendly, loving, kind, good person."" He ""reaches out to all kinds of people.""ABC enabled that. No laugh track. No skepticism. It was gullible to a fault.The emergence of Lewinsky led to other women who said that Clinton assaulted them. In March of 1998, Ed Bradley interviewed Kathleen Willey on CBS ""60 Minutes."" Willey said the president fondled her breast and put her hand on his crotch during a 1993 Oval Office visit. Willey had been begging for a job.

291,ICE,"Stocks gave up some of their morning gains after Donald Trump, in his inaugural speech, pledged to shake up the establishment and vowed to follow a ""Buy America"" policy, but the major averages were still modestly positive in afternoon trading.The Nasdaq composite, buoyed by unusual strength in the semiconductor industry, rose 0.2% after being up as much as 0.6% in early-morning trading. The Dow Jones industrial average outperformed with a 0.25% gain as investors deployed more cash into oil drilling, fertilizer, ship transport, basic chemicals and mining gear stocks.The S&P 500 advanced nearly 0.2% at 2 p.m. Washington D.C. time, while the Russell 2000 rose nearly 0.5%. The former is poised for a flat weekly finish, but the latter is on course to lose more than 1%.After Donald Trump finishes his swearing-in ceremony, he and family members are scheduled to join members of Congress for a lunch of steak, lobster, ice cream and chocolate souffle, according to reports by USA Today.While some commentators showed disapproval over Trump's inaugural address, the fact that it didn't rain on the outdoor ceremony may confirm an odd trend that shows good weather on the important day has led to higher returns.Research by LPL Financial, the investment advisory giant, shows that in terms of the S&P 500, since 1949, no rain or snow on Inauguration Day has presaged an average annualized 11.4% positive return during a presidential term, as seen in 13 occurrences. The median return was 11.1%. But when there's some precipitation, the average return was -1.3% and the median return was +1.7% (across six occurrences).Meanwhile, certain chip manufacturing firms rallied sharply, a subtle hint that perhaps Apple (AAPL), up mildly to 120.02, may continue to extend its gains since forming a bottoming base that led to an initial breakout on Sept. 14.Apple iPhone supplier Broadcom (AVGO) vaulted nearly 3% to 190.80, adding to strong gains the prior two sessions, and is now extended more than 5% past a 178.12 early entry within a flat base. The diversified semiconductor giant, which merged with Singapore-based Avago Technologies last year, joined IBD Leaderboard as an emerging new winner on Oct. 24. Another iPhone play, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), gapped up 12.5% to 88.26, moving sharply past persistent upside resistance near 80 seen over the past four months.The Woburn, Mass., firm reported a 1% rise in Q4 profit to $1.61 a share, barely above estimates, but it halted a two-quarter slide of falling profit. Revenue sank 1%, smaller than the 7% and 5% drops seen in the prior two quarters.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), also in IBD's semiconductor manufacturing industry group, rose more than 1% to 30 in heavy trading. The chip foundry titan is working on a new shallow base that for now features a 31.71 entry.Watch to see if the mega-cap tech firm, which has a market value exceeding $155 billion and sports a 2.5% annualized yield, can hold above its 50-day moving average while continuing to form its new base.Returning to Apple, the largest publicly traded company in the U.S. financial markets, shares rose 6 cents to 119.83, lagging stronger gains by the major indexes. However, the stock continues to slowly rise past a new 11-week cup-with-handle entry at 118.12 and is acting like a big-cap growth stock should. Apple is fighting concerns over what the next great product will be. As IBD tech writer Patrick Seitz noted in a recent IBD Weekly front-page piece, since the start of the Tim Cook era as CEO, the Silicon Valley giant has debuted just one brand-new product, the Apple Watch, and the company declines to disclose quarterly sales.Looking at the stock action of Apple Watch rival FitBit (FIT) (currently at 7.07 a share, more than 86% below its 51.90 peak set on Aug. 5, 2015), it seems apparent that the size of the potential market for the Apple Watch is limited.However, Apple still has plenty going for it, including a huge treasury of cash, a rising cash payout to shareholders that gives the stock an annualized yield of 1.9%, accelerating growth in service-related revenue, the possibility that an upcoming new iPhone will reinvigorate sales of its most important revenue generator, and decent changes of an earnings turnaround.In the past three quarters, Apple's earnings per share declined 18%, 23% and 15% vs. year-ago levels amid a slump on the top line. For the fiscal first quarter, however, Wall Street sees earnings falling just 2% to $3.22 a share.In the prior four quarters, Apple exceeded the consensus estimate three times, and the average beat was 1.7%.After forming a first cup with handle with a 110.33 proper entry from April to September of 2016, Apple rallied nearly 8% before getting reeled back into its long, deep bottoming base.The new cup with handle, which formed from Oct. 11 last year to the start of January, featured a shallower decline from head to toe of just 12%, a good sign because it implies strengthening underlying demand for shares.RELATED:The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull Run: Which Sectors May Lead Stocks?Skyworks Skies To 16-Month High As Earnings Beat, Apple In LineThe Bottoming Base, Part I: How It Helps Traders Make MoneyThe Bottoming Base, Part II: Why Apple Formed One In 200910 Years After The iPhone Debut, How Will Apple Innovate Now?Investing Like A True Wall Street Wizard: Lessons From Gerald Loeb

292,ICE,"Oil rose in New York after a government report showed that crude stockpiles at the biggest U.S. storage hub dropped the most since October.Futures climbed 0.6%. Supplies at Cushing, Okla., fell by 1.27 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said. The agency reported that nationwide stockpiles rose 2.35 million barrels, while the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute said there was a 5.04 million-barrel decrease on Wednesday. OPEC output cuts won't necessarily trigger a ""bonanza"" of U.S. shale supply, the International Energy Agency said.Oil has held above $50 a barrel since OPEC and nations including Russia agreed late last year to trim supply by about 1.8 million barrels a day to reduce bloated global inventories. While producers from Saudi Arabia to Iraq have signaled that they're implementing the reductions, the IEA predicted a rebound in U.S. shale output as prices rise.""We would be lower if not for the significant drop at Cushing,"" Thomas Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group in Wellington, Fla., said by telephone. ""Imports dropped from very high levels, which explains why crude supplies increased by so much.""West Texas Intermediate for February delivery, which expires Friday, rose 29 cents to $51.37 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was 17% below the 100-day average. The more-active March contract advanced 23 cents to $52.12.Brent for March settlement advanced 24 cents to $54.16 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark closed at a $2.04 premium to March WTI.""The oil price has support at $50,"" Matt Sallee, who helps manage $16.3 billion in oil-related assets at Tortoise Capital Advisors in Leawood, Kan., said by telephone. ""We should trade between $50 and $60 this year. We will approach $60 in the later part of the year and move higher as we go into 2018.""Crude stockpiles at Cushing, which is the delivery point for WTI, dropped to 65.7 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 13, according to the EIA. Nationwide crude inventories rose for a third week, climbing to 485.5 million.Refineries processed 16.5 million barrels a day of crude last week, down 639,000 barrels from the prior week's record pace of 17.11 million, the report showed. Refineries operated at 90.7% of capacity, down 2.9% from the prior week, the biggest decline in three months.Gasoline stockpiles rose 5.95 million barrels to 246.4 million, the highest since March. Inventories of distillate fuel, a category that includes diesel and heating oil, slipped by 986,000 to 169.1 million.As supply curbs by OPEC and Russia drain a global glut, rising prices will spur drilling by U.S. shale explorers that are more efficient after the two-year downturn, according to the IEA. The agency had previously seen American production stagnating in 2017.In other oil-market news: OPEC and 11 other producers are making ""tremendous efforts"" to cut output, according to Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo. The heads of oil traders Gunvor Group and Mercuria Energy Group predict that crude prices will range between $50 and $60 a barrel in 2017. WTI will average $60 a barrel in 2018, according to the median of 30 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg, just $5 higher than what they were forecasting a year ago for 2017.
"
293,ICE,"Oil fell to a one-week low in New York after the head of the International Energy Agency predicted a rebound in U.S. production.Futures dropped 2.7% after IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said that higher oil prices will trigger a ""significant"" boost in U.S. shale output as OPEC and other producers rein in supply. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia said deeper-than-planned production cuts and robust demand were helping the market rebalance. Price declines eased after OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said that OPEC will have to wait to decide whether the six-month production deal will be extended.Oil has gained since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 other nations agreed late last year to trim supply, but a rally above $55 a barrel was short-lived amid concern that rising prices would spur more production elsewhere. While producers from Saudi Arabia to Russia have signaled they're implementing the reductions, U.S. shale output next month is forecast to climb to the highest level since November.""At current prices you're seeing an increase in the rig count, which will increase U.S. production,"" Adam Wise, who helps run a $7 billion oil and natural gas bond and private-equity portfolio at John Hancock in Boston, said by phone. ""We're going to see headline-driven movement from day to day, but the long-term trend remains higher.""West Texas intermediate for February delivery fell $1.40 to $51.08 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It's the lowest close since Jan. 10. Total volume traded was about 5% above the 100-day average. Prices are up 80% from a year earlier.Brent for March settlement declined $1.55, or 2.8%, to $53.92 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, closing at a $2.03 premium to WTI for the same month.""U.S. shale-oil production will definitely react strongly,"" the IEA's Birol said Wednesday in a Bloomberg Television interview in Davos, Switzerland. At $56 to $57 a barrel, ""a lot of shale plays in the United States would make perfect sense to produce.""It's premature to say whether OPEC should continue cuts once the accord expires, Barkindo said in Bloomberg television interview in Davos. OPEC and Russia may not need to extend the curbs when they expire in June, Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said on Monday.""We're going to continue to chop around in this area until there's further evidence that OPEC is complying with its promised cuts,"" Kyle Cooper, director of research with IAF Advisors in Houston, said by phone.U.S. crude stockpiles dropped by 1 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey before an Energy Information Administration report on Thursday.Stockpiles are at 483.1 million barrels, the highest seasonal level in more than three decades, according to weekly data compiled by the EIA since 1982.In oil market news, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) will more than double its presence in the Permian Basin, the biggest U.S. oilfield, with acquisitions valued at as much as $6.6 billion. Output from major U.S. shale fields is forecast to climb to 4.75 million barrels a day in February, according to a drilling report from the EIA.
"
294,ICE,"Oil climbed, posting the biggest two-day gain in almost six weeks, after Saudi Arabia said it cut production even more than required by an OPEC deal.Futures increased 1.5% in New York as Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the kingdom reduced output to less than 10 million barrels a day, going beyond its obligations under an accord between OPEC and other producers to curb production. Energy Information Administration data on Wednesday showed that U.S. refineries used 17.1 million barrels a day of crude last week, the most in weekly data compiled since 1989. Crude output rose to the highest level since April and the dollar weakened.Crude has advanced since the deal among OPEC and 11 other nations to temper global supply, but it hasn't been able to sustain that rally above $55 a barrel amid concern that rising prices will spur more production, especially in the U.S. While Middle East producers have signaled they're sticking to the pledged reductions, the U.S. government recently raised this year's output forecast, and explorers have added drilling rigs for 10 straight weeks.""Whether or not OPEC proves to be fully compliant in their cuts, the market is impressed with their ability to overcome political and fiscal issues, to band together and create a floor,"" Bruno Stanziale, director of commodity strategy at Eurasia Group, said by telephone. ""It all rests in the hands of the U.S. shale oil producers. The degree to which producers get back in the field will dictate the cap of this market.""U.S. crude inventories rose by 4.1 million barrels last week, the EIA reported, while analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had projected a 1.5 million-barrel gain. Crude production increased by 176,000 barrels a day to 8.95 million barrels a day.West Texas intermediate for February delivery rose 76 cents to settle at $53.01 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was 32% above the 100-day average.Brent for March settlement climbed 91 cents to settle at $56.01 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark was at a premium of $2.17 to March WTI.Oil is rising due to ""chatter out of OPEC right now that they are committing to the cuts,"" Michael Loewen, commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said by telephone. ""Crude is going to trade higher on the dollar and OPEC commentary. I would almost call it OPEC hopes and dollar dreams.""The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge of the greenback against 10 major peers, fell 0.5%. A weaker U.S. currency increases the appeal of dollar-denominated raw materials as an investment.Saudi Arabia, currently producing at a 22-month low, will consider renewing its pledge to reduce its oil output in six months, al-Falih said. The world's biggest oil exporter plans to meet members of OPEC in May at their biannual meeting in Vienna to assess the market and the group's output policy.An oil monitoring meeting later this month in Vienna will evaluate compliance with the producer deal to cut output, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said. Russia is ready to discuss oil export monitoring at the meeting as well, but has not received any proposals on the issue, he said.Algeria will cut its oil output by 60,000 barrels a day in January, more than the previously agreed upon 50,000 barrels a day as part of the OPEC deal, Algeria's Energy Minister Noureddine Boutarfa told Bloomberg.""Even if the market retains its long bias, and producers continue to send reassuring messages relative to the follow-through on their pledges, we are still faced with a lot of the move based on sentiment,"" Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas in London, said by message. ""We will not have hard data to evaluate what producers are doing until early February. In the meantime, the price moves can prove erratic.""
"
295,ICE," In May 1986, a 39-year-old Manhattan real estate developer named Donald Trump promised to get Wollman Rink in Central Park up and running — something the city government, despite spending $13 million, had failed to do for six years. Trump delivered, ahead of time and under a $3 million budget.The 70-year-old president-elect surely remembers that. His proposal for massive infrastructure spending holds out the opportunity to transform government spending programs much as he transformed the process of building an ice skating rink in the beautiful infrastructure Frederick W. Olmsted designed in the time of the Civil War.Federal transportation infrastructure programs, designed in the post-World War II years, have run out of gas. Gas tax receipts have been flagging because of decreases in driving and increased gas mileage requirements. Projects are doled out by congressional committee members, and environmental procedures hold up completion for years.As President Barack Obama said after his 2009 stimulus didn't do much stimulating, ""there's no such thing as shovel-ready projects.""Common Good's Philip K. Howard points out that government agencies set out in 2008 to raise the Bayonne Bridge, which connects Staten Island and New Jersey, to permit new super-container ships coming through the widened Panama Canal to enter Port Newark. The widened canal was opened in June. Despite millions spent on plans and environmental approvals, the bridge hasn't been raised yet.This is just one of many examples of how, as Howard writes, ""decade-long review and permitting procedures more than double the effective cost of new infrastructure projects.""Congress, at the prodding of the Trump administration, could change that. Republicans may be wary of spending as much as Trump wants, and Democrats may be wary about changing some of the rules. But the author of ""The Art of the Deal"" could point out that Congress can change those rules.It could repeal the requirements for environmental impact statements or require that they be completed within a given time — six months? — with the default assumption that the project would go ahead otherwise. Congress could cut off endless appeals to the courts. That would put out of business groups that exist solely to bollix things up.Congress could overrule — pre-empt is the legal word — the BANANA (build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything) regulations of states such as California. If California complained, it might forfeit federal money.Counsel might be taken from Howard, who wrote: ""Dumpsters can be filled with obsolete laws. Inflexible dictates can be replaced by open frameworks that permit officials to act sensibly. ... Give a federal agency the job of deciding when there's been sufficient review.""With low interest rates, government could right now borrow cheaply for infrastructure. It still would have to pay off the debt, but not all of it if Congress encouraged infrastructure public-private partnerships. Canada employs them extensively and is using one to finance the new bridge across the Detroit River. Having private money at risk also would increase the chance that infrastructure would be built where it is needed, not just in some senior committee member's district.Another thing that makes infrastructure in the U.S. so much more expensive than in Canada, Australia and Europe is the Davis-Bacon Act, passed originally to exclude blacks from construction work and now employed to favor labor unions. Davis-Bacon requires government bureaucrats to calculate the ""prevailing wage"" in each of the 3,141 counties involved — a lengthy and money-wasting process.A gifted dealmaker might tell the unions that they can keep Davis-Bacon in, say, 50 counties — which is where most of their members are concentrated — but that it will go away for the rest of the country.Another thing Congress might want to consider is that good infrastructure requires not just construction but maintenance. Large hunks of Washington's Metro subway are out of service these days because, as fatal accidents have shown, the system has been stinting on maintenance for 40 years.Maintenance and repair jobs in the long run will outnumber construction jobs, and they also tend to be more permanent. And maintenance will inevitably be concentrated on infrastructure that is actually useful and used.A big infrastructure package could also include revision of civil service rules, something Trump called for in his 100-days video. And it could encourage the privatizing of the air traffic control system — something Canada has done — which has been held up for more than a decade.The beginning of an administration offers an opportunity to make sharp changes to processes previously considered unchangeable. Will the 45th president do for infrastructure what he did for Wollman Rink?

296,ICE,"Oil closed near $45 a barrel in New York as Americans voted in the presidential election, with opinion polls showing Hillary Clinton ahead of Donald Trump.Futures rose 0.2%, following a 1.9% gain on Monday after the FBI reiterated that Clinton's handling of emails wasn't a crime. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo warned of prolonged instability in the oil market if the group and other major suppliers fail to act jointly to limit output and curb a global glut. U.S. supplies grew 2 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey before government data Wednesday.Oil has been stuck around $45 a barrel following the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' failure to agree on output quotas for member countries on Oct. 28. The group must reach a consensus before finalizing its September deal to cut production at a Nov. 30 meeting in Vienna. Russia is ""on board"" with an agreement to limit crude production to help rebalance the market, according to Barkindo.""A Clinton victory should be neutral to a bit positive for the market,"" said Mark Watkins, the Park City, Utah-based regional investment manager for the Private Client Group at U.S. Bank, which oversees $136 billion in assets. ""OPEC appears to be putting in the ground work for an agreement. At the Nov. 30 meeting we have to see that they've made progress, meaningful progress, and something is coming to fruition to support the market.""West Texas Intermediate for December delivery rose 9 cents to close at $44.98 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract increased 82 cents to $44.89 on Monday, the biggest gain since Oct. 19. Total volume traded was 24% below the 100-day average.Brent for January settlement declined 11 cents to $46.04 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark closed at a 43-cent premium to WTI for January delivery.U.S. crude stockpiles rose by a 14.4 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 28, the most ever in weekly Energy Information Administration data. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute is scheduled to release its weekly stockpile data Tuesday.""Some people are on the sidelines because there's still questions about the election,"" said Gene McGillian, manager of market research for Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn. ""Supply and demand are the major movers and neither candidate would make an impact on them in the short term. We should head lower once the vote's over because of the realization that there's more than ample supply.""World oil demand will average 96.92 million barrels a day in 2017, a 250,000 barrel gain from October, the EIA said in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook released Tuesday. Global production will average 97.43 million barrels a day in 2017, up 420,000 barrels from October. That will leave an excess of 510,000 barrels a day next year, wider than the 340,000 surplus estimated last month.

297,ICE,"Two recent news stories highlight how pernicious the welfare state has become in America today.The first was an announcement by the feds that food stamps can be used to have groceries delivered right to a recipient's door. Service with a smile. The Obama administration says it is too much of a hardship for those on welfare to actually travel to the grocery store. What's next? Cooking the meal for them? If only the DMV would do home deliveries for drivers' licenses.The second story was about the hullabaloo over a proposal by Maine Governor Paul LePage to prohibit food stamp recipients from using their food aid to purchase junk foods like sugary soft drinks and candy bars. He says that the state has an obesity problem, and he will ""implement reform unilaterally or cease Maine's administration of the food stamp program altogether."" ‎The Obama administration rejected his request, and the left activists act as if the idea that a welfare recipient can't buy a pint of Ben & Jerry's ice cream at taxpayer expense is a violation of civil liberties.  ‎The welfare/entitlement state of mind has spiraled out of control in America. No one is lifting a finger of opposition. The cost of welfare is now well over $1 trillion a year. Food stamps are so ubiquitous that they have replaced dollars as the new standard currency in many inner cities in America. Even in affluent areas with up-scale grocery stores, food stamp recipients fill their carts with everything from cakes to lobster.Liberals love welfare. It was only a few years ago that Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi opined that putting more people on food stamps and unemployment insurance is one of the ""best ways to stimulate the economy."" Which is more astonishing? That she believes this lunacy or that she would be dumb enough to say it out loud.We are in the seventh year of a so-called recovery, yet 45 million Americans depend on taxpayers to put food on their table. This is roughly 5 million more than when Obama took office. Medicaid rolls have exploded by more than 10 million too, and Obama openly boasts about how many people he's moved into the program.Unemployment insurance beneficiaries have fallen, thankfully, but the number of Americans collecting disability has continued to climb. Wow this is some recovery.By the way, disability rolls are growing even as worker safety has hit an all-time high. Shouldn't safety and automation mean fewer disabled workers? The reality, as everyone in the welfare industry knows, is that food stamps and disability are the new welfare. Neither one of them requires work in exchange for benefits.No one wants to admit that the ease of entry into the welfare state and the generosity of the benefits is one big reason why labor force participation has collapsed. Why work?Welfare expert Peter Ferrara notes that ‎a big instigator for the welfare state expansion has been the decimation of welfare reform laws passed in 1996. ""It's infuriating that a law that worked incredibly well in lowering costs and getting the unemployed into the workforce, has been largely gutted,"" he concludes.As a result, the Census Bureau tells us that most families that are in poverty have no one working. Poverty is still widespread in America, not because wages are too low, but because fewer poor people have a job. If there are no wages earned at all, it is impossible to get out of the poverty trap.Welfare incentivizes non-work in many other ways. Former George W. Bush economist Larry Lindsey reports that welfare recipients generally lose at least 50 cents of every dollar benefit they gain in wage and salary from working. Sometimes the benefits fall by 70 cents per dollar earned. So a $12-an-hour job returns as little as $4 an hour of extra income. Why work?Democrats in Congress have vociferously opposed putting even baby teeth back into work-for-welfare requirements. Even modest workfare requirements are ‎denounced as anti-poor. So a proposed federal law mandating work for food stamp recipients who are non-disabled adults without kids got shot down.We know that changing welfare laws can have a very positive impact on getting recipients back into the workforce and off welfare. When unemployment ‎benefits were reduced and the number of weeks of benefits were limited in North Carolina, entry into the workforce shot up, growing by more than nearly any other state in the country. Go figure.In Maine, we saw a similarly remarkable result from work requirements. According to a Heritage Foundation report: ""SNAP recipients in Maine totaled 201,151 in April of 2015 -- a decline of more 28,000 in just one year. The number of ABAWDs - Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents--  in Maine declined about 80%"" to 2,530 in 2015, from 12,000 prior to the work requirement.  ‎This result was in line with the federal work for welfare requirements enacted in 1996. Caseloads fell by more than half and costs of aid tumbled.So why aren't Republicans pushing workfare for all federal welfare recipients? Some are afraid that they will be viewed as hard-hearted or even cruel. But getting people off of welfare into a productive job is not just a way‎ to reduce costs, it's a proven way to rebuild broken lives and move people into the mainstream. There is dignity in work. There is despair in welfare.After three generations of the failed entitlement state, hasn't welfare done enough harm to the very people it was supposed to help.
"
298,ICE,"Oil fell to a three-month low, edging closer to a bear market, after U.S. crude supplies unexpectedly rose from what was already the highest seasonal level in at least two decades.Futures dropped 1.9% in New York. Crude inventories climbed last week for the first time since May as output rose, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. A Bloomberg survey had forecast a stockpile decline. Refineries cut processing volumes during the peak-demand summer driving season amid swelling gasoline supplies and weak profit margins.""Gasoline stocks are high, which is weighing on prices and margins,"" said Michael Wittner, the New York-based head of oil-market research at Societe Generale. ""Refinery crude demand is falling now for economic reasons and will only go lower as seasonal maintenance starts.""Oil is near the 20% drop from early June that would characterize a bear market. The recovery driven by supply disruptions that saw prices almost double from a 12-year low reached in February has petered out amid renewed concerns about the strength of demand. Oil producers including BP (BP), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Total (TOT) reported sharp declines in second-quarter earnings as lower crude prices continued to take their toll.West Texas Intermediate for September delivery fell 78 cents to settle at $41.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It's the lowest close since April 19. Total volume traded was 24% below the 100-day average at 2:35 p.m. ET.Brent for September settlement, which expires Friday, fell 77 cents, or 1.8%, to $42.70 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the lowest close for a front-month futures contract since April 8. The more-active October contract dropped 68 cents to $43.23. September Brent closed at a $1.56 premium to WTI.""We're going to test support around $40,"" said Kyle Cooper, director of research at IAF Advisors and Ion Energy in Houston. ""Crude inventories are building. There's still more supply than demand.""U.S. crude stockpiles climbed by 1.67 million barrels to 521.1 million, the first gain in 10 weeks, the EIA report showed. Inventories at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI and the nation's biggest oil-storage hub, rose by 1.11 million barrels to 65.2 million.Crude production in the U.S. rose by 21,000 barrels a day to 8.52 million last week, marking the longest series of gains since January.Refineries reduced operating rates by 0.8 percentage point to 92.4% of capacity. Refiners typically bolster their operations in June and July to meet peak gasoline demand before ratcheting back in August. Over the past five years, refiners' thirst for oil has dropped an average of 1.2 million barrels a day from July to October.Gasoline stockpiles rose 452,000 barrels to 241.5 million in the week ended July 22. Production of the motor fuel and demand for it increased, EIA data show.August gasoline futures slipped 1.2% to $1.3062 a gallon, the lowest close since March 3. Diesel for August delivery dropped 1.9% to $1.2704, the lowest settlement since April 19.The slump in oil prices is temporary, Ed Morse, head of global commodity research at Citigroup, said in an interview on Bloomberg television. Ample U.S. inventories and imports are weighing on prices now, he said.""We're going to rebound; the question is timing,"" Morse said.

299,ICE,"Oil climbed above $50 a barrel in New York for the first time since June as declines in U.S. crude inventories and OPEC's pledge to reduce supply lifted hopes the global glut may clear.Futures increased 1.2%. U.S. crude stockpiles shrank below 500 million barrels last week for the first time since January, government data show. OPEC pledged in Algiers on Sept. 28 to reduce the group's output to 32.5 million to 33 million barrels a day in a bid to shrink the world's bloated oil supplies and boost prices.The market is set to remain oversupplied in 2017 and prices will stall at $55 a barrel as shale drillers get back to work, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Head of Commodities Research Jeff Currie said.""The main issue is the big decline in North American storage,"" said Tim Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd. in Calgary. ""The OPEC agreement is just spin to help support the market.""Oil has advanced 13% since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to the first production cut in eight years. Some analysts have expressed doubt that individual output quotas — to be determined at a meeting of the group in Vienna on Nov. 30 — will be sufficient to erode the market surplus as several countries boost production to restore disrupted supplies.West Texas Intermediate for November delivery rose 61 cents to $50.44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It's the highest close since June 9. Total volume traded was 14% above the 100-day average at 2:48 p.m.Open interest in WTI, or the number of contracts outstanding, rose to 1.91 million as of Wednesday, the most in three years, according to CME Group Inc. data compiled by Bloomberg.Brent for December settlement rose 65 cents, or 1.3%, to $52.51 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It's the highest close since June 8. The global benchmark crude ended the session at a $1.53 premium to WTI for December delivery.U.S. crude stockpiles dropped by 2.98 million barrels for a fifth weekly decline, the Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday. A Bloomberg survey had forecast a supply gain. Crude production declined for a second week to 8.5 million barrels a day.""Crude inventories dropped by more than 25 million barrels in September,"" said Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees $5.2 billion. ""You should see prices rally after such a big number.""OPEC members will meet next week for talks on implementing an output-cut deal, with Russia joining to discuss how producers from outside the group can participate in the plan, Venezuelan Oil Minister  Eulogio Del Pino said in a government statement late Wednesday. Ministers from Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Gabon, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates will attend a meeting in Istanbul, along with Alexander Novak from non-OPEC member Russia, he said.""The drop in crude inventories over the last several weeks is seen by some as a sign that the market's rebalancing,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. ""It has a lot to do with an increase in crude-oil exports. The local glut is easing but that's not helping the global glut.""Hurricane Matthew is heading for Southeast U.S. and may disrupt East Coast fuel shipments. Matthew's top winds have grown to 140 miles (220 kilometers) per hour, up from 125 mph just hours ago as it churns in the Atlantic 125 miles east-southeast of West Palm Beach, according to the National Hurricane Center.Diesel futures for November delivery climbed 0.9 percent to $1.5958 a gallon, the highest close since Oct. 8, 2015. November gasoline advanced 0.3% to $1.4978 a gallon.The crude rally is threatened by the strengthening dollar, O'Grady said. The U.S. currency climbed against most of its peers as better-than-forecast jobless claims data boosted speculation that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates this year. A stronger greenback reduces the appeal of commodities as an investment. Precious and industrial metals declined Thursday.
"
300,ICE,"Oil surged the most since April amid reports, which were later confirmed, that OPEC agreed to a preliminary deal that will trim output for the first time in eight years. Stocks climbed, bonds fell.The rally in crude reverberated across global markets with companies from Exxon Mobil (XOM) to Chevron (CVX) soaring and currencies of oil exporters from Norway to Canada and Brazil leading gains against the dollar. Meanwhile, Treasuries retreated on concern that higher prices for the commodity would imply an increase in inflation.Markets were taken aback by the reports on the oil-output deal as Saudi Arabia and Iran wrong-footed traders who expected a continuation of the pump-at-will policy that the group adopted in 2014. The group agreed to drop production to a range of 32.5 million to 33 million barrels per day, said Iran's Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, following a meeting in Algiers. Many of the details remain to be worked out and the group won't decide on targets for each country until its next meeting at the end of November.""The cut is clearly bullish,"" Mike Wittner, head of oil-market research at Societe Generale in New York, said by phone. ""The number of actual barrels that will be taken off the market is unclear. What's much more important is that the Saudis appear to be returning to a period of market management.""Before the reports on OPEC's agreement, traders assessed comments from Federal Reserve officials for clues on the timing of interest-rate hikes. Chair Janet Yellen said Wednesday that the majority of the central bank's policy-setting group sees a rate hike as likely needed this year. Meanwhile, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said an extended period of low rates will leave policymakers with less room to navigate future shocks and reiterated that the ""lower-for-longer"" view is taking hold among businesses and investors.Meanwhile, investors are looking for signs that the economy is strengthening and awaiting the next earnings season, which will kick off in about two weeks. A report Wednesday showed that orders for durable goods were little changed in August, while shipments of capital equipment declined for a fourth straight month, indicating lingering weakness in manufacturing. A revised reading on second-quarter growth, pending home sales as well as measures of personal income and spending are due later this week.West Texas Intermediate for November delivery climbed 5.3% to settle at $47.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It's the highest close since Sept. 8. Brent for November settlement rose $2.72, or 5.9%, to $48.69 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark closed at a $1.64 premium to WTI.While some members of OPEC will have to cut output, Iran won't have to freeze production, Zanganeh said. The lower end of the production target equates to a nearly 750,000 barrels-a-day drop from what OPEC said it pumped in August. The deal will reverberate beyond the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. It will brighten the prospects for the energy industry, from giants like Exxon Mobil to small U.S. shale firms, and boost the economies of oil-rich countries such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. For consumers, however, it will mean higher prices at the pump.Tin climbed as inventories of the metal tracked by the London Metal Exchange continued to fall. Copper and aluminum also advanced. Gold retreated.Benchmark 10-year yields rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.57%. The price of the 1.5% security due in August 2026 was 99-12/32. U.S. two-year yields rose one basis point to 0.75%.Treasury yields have fallen across maturities since the central bank left rates unchanged at its Sept. 21 meeting, while signaling that the case to hike had strengthened on brightening U.S. economic data. The bullish comments paired with no policy action left bond traders wondering how good conditions need to be for the Fed to move, particularly as officials pared projections for the future path of tightening.""They say they're data-dependent but in September they couldn't even point to any data that suggest they should stand pat,"" Charles Plosser, former president of the Philadelphia Fed, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television on Wednesday. ""That does damage, I think, to their credibility about them being data-dependent.""

301,ICE,"Oil climbed to a two-week high after rival OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iran met in Vienna for a second day before the wider group holds talks in Algiers.Futures rose 2.2% in New York. Officials from Saudi Arabia and Iran, whose rivalry derailed an oil-supply accord earlier this year, have yet to reach an agreement, a person who was briefed on the discussions said. Oil extended gains as equities advanced and the dollar fell. U.S. crude supplies dropped to the lowest since February, trimming stockpiles that remain at the highest seasonal level in at least three decades, government data showed Wednesday.""The Saudi talks with Iran increase the likelihood of an agreement next week,"" said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. ""The Iraqis are saying it's the right time for OPEC to make a deal, which is also supportive.""Oil has fluctuated since August's rally on speculation that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia will agree on ways to stabilize the market when they meet Sept. 28. While Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said members are close to a deal, all but two of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg said an agreement to limit production is unlikely. Freezing output was proposed in February, but a meeting in April ended with no final accord.West Texas intermediate oil for November delivery advanced 98 cents to settle at $46.32 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the highest close since Sept. 8. Total volume traded was about 10% above the 100-day average.Brent for November settlement rose 82 cents, or 1.8%, to $47.65 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark closed at a $1.33 premium to WTI.Financial markets rallied around the world as the dollar weakened after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday and scaled back its projections for future hikes. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge of the greenback against 10 major peers, fell as much as 0.5%. When the dollar falls investors flock to dollar-denominated raw materials.""This is a risk-on day,"" Yawger said. ""Equities are up and the dollar is moving lower because of the Fed announcement, which is supporting commodities. The negative dollar correlation is definitely at work.""

302,ICE,"Oil advanced Monday as the dollar's decline against its peers increased investor appetite for commodities.Futures rose 0.6% in New York. The greenback fell as investors largely ruled out a Federal Reserve hike in September. Futures retreated from the day's high as a tanker returned to Libya's Ras Lanuf export terminal to load oil after clashes halted what will be the first overseas crude shipment from the terminal since 2014. OPEC may call an extraordinary meeting if ministers reach consensus at informal talks next week, Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said, according to the Algerian Press Service.""The market's moving on trepidation about the upcoming Fed meeting, which has had a big impact on the dollar,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. ""There's also a lot of sorting out of the OPEC comments. There are some people who pay inordinate attention to them.""Oil has fluctuated since rallying in August on speculation that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia will agree on measures to stabilize the market at the meeting next week in Algiers. Prices tumbled 6.2% last week amid concern the resumption of shipments from Libya, as well as Nigeria, would worsen a global glut.West Texas Intermediate for  October delivery, which expires Tuesday, climbed 27 cents to close at $43.30 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The more-active November contract rose 24 cents to $43.86. Total volume traded was 15% below the 100-day average.Brent for  November settlement advanced 18 cents, or 0.4%, to $45.95 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark closed at a $2.09 premium to WTI for November delivery.The dollar declined from a seven-week high as investors braced for the Fed policy decision on Wednesday while Goldman Sachs Asset Management said the greenback's rally is set to fizzle. A falling dollar makes raw materials priced in the currency more attractive to investors.The tanker Seadelta returned to Libya's third-biggest oil port to resume loading 781,000 barrels of oil for shipment to Italy, Nasser Delaab, an inspector at Harouge Oil Operations, said Monday by phone. Another vessel, the Syra, would arrive in Ras Lanuf later on Monday to ship 600,000 barrels of crude to Italy, he said.The Seadelta had halted loading after fighting on Sunday between local Petroleum Facilities Guard units and forces loyal to eastern-based military commander Khalifa Haftar.Next week's OPEC gathering will be a ""meeting of consultation and not of decision-making,"" unlike the group's meeting in Oran, Algeria, in 2008, when it agreed to cut production, Barkindo said Saturday, according to Algeria's official news agency.OPEC members are close to reaching an agreement on how to stabilize the market, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said Sunday at a press conference after speaking to his counterparts from Iran and Ecuador. Maduro said he hopes an accord can be reached by the end of the month.

303,ICE,"For too long, environmental activist organizations have unfairly inflicted huge economic harm on businesses by spreading misinformation and unfounded fearmongering. They are engaging in economic warfare on an international scale.Alas, too often businesses have made the strategic mistake of avoiding engagement to limit the damage of the attacks. It is time businesses go on the offensive and use every lever available to expose and stop this massive, well-coordinated and dangerous fraud.An outstanding example of how unfairly-attacked companies should respond is Resolute Forest Products, the world's largest producer of newsprint. It has courageously and boldly led the charge in fighting back through the courts. Others should follow suit.In 2013, Resolute filed a defamation suit against Greenpeace in Ontario, Canada Superior Court which is still making its way through the court system there. Then this May the company filed a federal racketeering suit against Greenpeace in the United States.According to the U.S. lawsuit, ""Greenpeace and others working with it have aggressively targeted Resolute's customers with extortive threats and other illegal conduct. To identify those customers, Greenpeace employees and agents have impersonated Resolute employees, its customers, and others to illegally misappropriate proprietary customer and supply chain information.""The damage Greenpeace has done to Resolute is undeniable. After a Greenpeace intimidation campaign, Best Buy dropped the company as its paper supplier. Greenpeace had gone so far as to tell its activists to write a ""false product review on Best Buy's website. Be creative and make sure to weave in campaign issues!""Greenpeace's own numbers estimated that it has done at least $100 million (Canadian) in damage to Resolute's bottom line.""We have an obligation to our business ethics, and our many shareholders, customers, partners and stakeholders to draw the line after all other means have been exhausted,"" Resolute President and CEO Richard Garneau said when the company filed the racketeering lawsuit.Bravo! All other companies should take the same stance. To ignore or accommodate these extremist organizations is to surrender to them. Companies owe it to their shareholders, their employees — and indeed to civilized society — to stop these malicious economic attacks. And the sad reality is that for far too long businesses have ceded the battle in the so-called court of public opinion and allowed the activists to frame the debate.Take the extremist greens' completely unscientific crusade against genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Both the National Academy of Sciences and the World Health Organization have stated unequivocally that foods containing GMOs have never been found unsafe for human consumption. In June, more than 100 Nobel laureates signed a letter urging Greenpeace to drop its anti-GMO campaign because the scientific research proves beyond a doubt that GMOs are not harmful.Yet despite the mountain of evidence which absolutely prove GMOs are safe, Greenpeace and other groups continue to convince the public that GMOs are a threat. A recent ABC News survey showed that only a third of Americans believed foods containing GMOs were safe.It is even harder to win over the public when governments cowardly collude with activists. On the very day in March when more than a dozen state attorneys general accused Exxon-Mobil of ""fraud"" and ""deceiving the American people"" on climate change, New York's attorney general, who led that news conference, met secretly with environmental activist organizations to discuss how they could attack oil companies.Email records show the New York AG's office urging activists ""to not confirm that you attended or otherwise discuss the event"" if reporters come calling.Exxon-Mobil won the first round in its fight against these coordinated state attorneys general in getting the truth-ignoring ringleader of this assault, who hails from the U.S. Virgin Islands, to withdraw his unreasonable subpoena. It should continue to take the fight to the other states that are coordinating with the green activists.Resolute Forest Products is awaiting the response to its racketeering suit against Greenpeace before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, but has already shifted the debate away from the Greenpeace messages against it to focus on the illegal activities being undertaken for the primary purpose of harming its bottom line.Unfortunately, there are many other examples of environmental activists putting this same playbook to work.  Whether it's their ""Our Forests Aren't Fuel"" campaign against the wood pellet industry ""in spite of the fact that (the industry) is helping the EU and UK meet their carbon reduction standards"" or the coordinated efforts to force public institutions and pension funds to divest their fossil fuel related stocks ""even though many of those investments have historically enjoyed among the biggest returns for their investors and their beneficiaries.""Sometimes, even the cover of the playbook can be tainted. That was the case when Al Gore was criticized for including a doctored photo of the globe on the cover of his book, ""Our Choice: A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis."" The cover incorporated an image with a reduction in the amount of visible polar ice as well as some artificial hurricanes pasted in, just to be sure readers were adequately alarmed.In the court of public opinion, businesses often tend to make decisions based on ethical considerations and codes of conduct, as well as legal limits to which the activists do not feel the same obligation. The activists will say and do almost anything to inflict economic harm on their targets. The legal system remains the ultimate venue to address these attacks.But companies should also be more aggressive in pushing the truth with the court of public opinion. I am encouraged by Resolute and Exxon-Mobil drawing the line and taking the fight to the environmental extremists. It is time more businesses stand up for themselves and their shareholders, fight back and force the activist environmental groups to pay a price for their corrupt behavior.

304,ICE,"Oil increased after a government report showed U.S. refiners processed a record amount of crude last week.Refineries nationwide used 17.1 million barrels a day of crude last week, according to the Energy Information Administration, the most in weekly data going back to 1989. Refineries operated at the highest utilization rate since September before they perform planned seasonal maintenance. Oil stockpiles rose 4.1 million barrels, more than the 1.5 million barrel increase forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.""Refineries are cranking out production to build fuel stockpiles before they go into maintenance,"" said Craig Bethune, a fund manager at Manulife Asset Management in Toronto who focuses on energy and natural resources investments. ""Seasonally, it's not that unusual to see big inventory builds.""Prices have rallied since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 other nations agreed to curb output to trim a global supply glut. Futures advanced earlier Wednesday as Saudi Arabia was said to reduce February crude sales to China and southern Asian nations as it curbs supply in accordance with the deal.West Texas intermediate crude for February delivery rose $1.64 a barrel to $52.46 at 12:16 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 40% above the 100-day average.Brent for March settlement rose $1.76 to $55.40 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.

They will have to hold up to support this rally.""Gasoline stockpiles rose 5.02 million barrels to 240.7 million, the highest since July. Inventories of distillate fuel, a category that includes diesel and heating oil, jumped 8.36 million to 170 million, the highest since 2010.

305,ICE,"Oil fell for the first time in four days as rising U.S. drilling activity fanned speculation that OPEC production cuts could boost North American output.Futures dropped as much as 3.2% in New York. Gulf oil producers Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait are implementing the cuts they promised, Nawal Al-Fezaia, Kuwait's OPEC governor, said in an interview Monday in Kuwait City. Still, that wasn't enough to revive prices after Baker Hughes on Friday showed that U.S. drillers added rigs for the 10th-straight week to the highest level in a year.Oil last year capped its biggest annual gain since 2009 as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 other countries agreed to curb output starting Jan. 1 in an effort to trim a global stockpile glut. While producers from Iraq to Kuwait say they've started to reduce supply, increases from exporters such as Libya, which is exempt from cuts, could put pressure on prices.""There's concern about the rising U.S. rig count and what that will mean for production in the next few months,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass., said by phone. ""We're getting confirmation of what was expected, the Arabian peninsula monarchies were expected to comply with the new targets. Iraq is the big question mark.""West Texas intermediate for February delivery fell $1.63, or 3%, to $52.36 a barrel at 12:16 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 14% below the 100-day average. The contract rose 0.4% to $53.99 a barrel on Friday to cap a fourth weekly gain.Brent for March settlement dropped $1.69, or 3%, to $55.41 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a $2.15 premium to March WTI.U.S. drillers boosted the rig count by four to 529 last week, according to data Friday from Baker Hughes. It's the highest level since the week ended Jan. 1, 2016. Companies have added more than 100 rigs since the end of September.The output cuts already announced comprise between 60% and 70% of the total decrease pledged by OPEC and other producers, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzouk said to reporters at a joint news conference with OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo in Kuwait City.Iraq's oil exports from its southern ports in the Gulf reached a record high in December, Oil Minister Jabbar Al-Luaibi said in an emailed statement. The country's production climbed in 2016 and it was initially reluctant to join the cuts, asking first for an exemption to help it fight Islamic State militants and then disputing OPEC's baseline production data. Energy Aspects doesn't expect Iraq to comply with its output quota, the London-based consultant said last week in a note.""The rising flows from Iraq may be the first sign of a crack in OPEC compliance,"" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said in a telephone interview. ""Compliance from the Gulf states is looking pretty good but there are a lot of questions about whether Iraq will follow.""A U.S. Navy destroyer fired three warning shots against four of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps vessels on Sunday in the Strait of Hormuz, a U.S. Defense official said, asking not to be identified because the information isn't public yet. About 20% of the world's crude passes through the waterway that connects the Persian Gulf with the Arabian Sea.""The market is overbought and under a lot of downward pressure,"" Yawger said. ""The shots fired at the Iranian boats in the Strait of Hormuz didn't do anything to the market. A few years ago that would have added a couple dollars to the price.""

306,ICE,"It's a better deal in most of the U.S. to buy a place to live rather than lease one, says a new analysis, even as wage hikes lag behind rising rents and home prices. But the better deal is still likely to average at least a third of your pay — or even much more if you dwell in a major population center.In its 2017 Rental Affordability Report, Attom Data Solutions concludes that buying was more affordable than renting in 66% of the 540 U.S. counties where there were at least 900 home sales last year.If you earned the average local wage, in 354 of the counties it was cheaper to buy a median-priced three-bedroom home — even when adding taxes and insurance to the cost of a monthly mortgage with a 3% down payment.Among major metropolitan areas, for example, the real estate data provider said it was better to buy in Chicago's Cook County; Phoenix's Maricopa County; Miami-Dade County; Fla., San Bernardino County, Calif.; and Las Vegas' Clark County. But it was better to rent in Los Angeles County; Houston's Harris County; San Diego County; Orange County, Calif.; and New York City's Kings County. In Kings, the most densely populated of New York City's boroughs, the average rental would only take 64.3% of the average wage compared to 116% for a home purchase.Nationwide, the analysis determined that the fair market rent of a three-bedroom dwelling takes a 38.6% bite out of the average wage and the payment on the same-size home takes 36.6%.""While buying continues to be more affordable than renting in the majority of U.S. markets, that equation could change quickly if mortgage rates keep rising in 2017,"" said Daren Blomquist, Attom's senior vice president, in the report, adding that renters could find it tougher to become homeowners.Along with mortgage rates, home prices also continued their climb, with the year-over-year rise averaging 5.7% nationally — outpacing that of rent, which jumped by 4.2%. And while the average wage also ascended, it was at a more modest 2.2%.MORE ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET:Confidence In Homebuying Ebbs As 2016 Ends, Realtors SayFor Home Sellers, Winter Can Break The IceDesign Features That Sell A Home Faster, And For More

307,ICE,"Oil fell from the highest level since July 2015, as the dollar strengthened, while doubts persisted about the ability of OPEC and its partners to balance the market.Futures slipped on the first trading day of 2017 after rising 45% last year, the biggest annual gain since 2009. Prices touched an 18-month high earlier as output cuts by Kuwait and Oman signaled that OPEC and its partners are delivering on their deal to stabilize the market. Oil fell from the session's highs as a strengthening greenback reduced investor demand for commodities priced in the U.S. currency.Oil rose in 2016 for the first time in three years as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 other countries agreed to cut output starting Jan. 1 in an effort to reduce bloated global stockpiles. Libya, which isn't party to the OPEC cuts, is ramping up output from its biggest oilfield again, a reminder of how vulnerable the quest to clear the glut might be. Rigs targeting crude in the U.S. rose last week to the highest level since January.""Too much faith has been put in OPEC and the other countries that have promised cuts,"" John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy, said by telephone.

308,ICE,"Oil dropped to a three-month low in New York amid speculation that U.S. fuel stockpiles increased, bolstering a glut in the world's biggest crude-consuming nation.West Texas intermediate oil fell 0.5%. U.S. gasoline supplies probably grew by 200,000 barrels last week, swelling stockpiles already at the highest seasonal level in at least two decades, according to a Bloomberg survey before a government report. Crude inventories, which are projected to have dropped for a record 10th week, are also at the highest seasonal level in decades.Crude has slipped more than 15% since early June after nearly doubling from a 12-year low in February as supply disruptions from Nigeria to Canada trimmed a worldwide surplus. BP PLC (BP), the first oil major to report Q2 results, missed analyst estimates as lower prices continued to erode income and refining margins shrank.""Concerns about fuel inventories are weighing on the market,"" said Gene McGillian, a senior analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn.

309,ICE,"Oil fell to the lowest in three months in New York after U.S. producers increased drilling for a fourth week even as the market contends with abundant stockpiles.West Texas intermediate crude declined 2.4%. U.S. oil explorers have boosted the number of active rigs by 55 since the start of June to 371, with 14 added last week, Baker Hughes said Friday. Government data show U.S. gasoline supplies are at the highest seasonal level in decades, which may spur refiners to shut sooner than usual for maintenance.

Prices are still about 65% above February's 12-year low as output disruptions added to speculation that the worst of the market rout is over.

311,ICE,"CLEVELAND -- Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli made news early on at the Republican Convention when he threw his credentials down on the floor of the convention hall to protest a decision that blocked a roll-call vote.But later on outside the convention hall, he was talking about a subject that had more import to businesses and state and local government -- the regulatory onslaught being unleashed from Washington today, and how to stop it.Cuccinelli, who is now general counsel for FreedomWorks, led a discussion sponsored by the group with three other state AGs about how they've become the ""last line of defense"" against the regulatory state.One message they made clear was that Congress is largely to blame.""Regulatory overreach is the fault of Congress,"" said Oklahoma AG Scott Pruitt. Lawmakers, he pointed out, have increasingly deferred to regulators in the executive branch to carry out vaguely worded statutes.""It gives lawmakers clean hands as they campaign,"" Pruitt said, ""because they can blame regulators for unpopular or costly rules. It's improper delegation abetted by court.""The pinnacle of this improper delegation was reached with Dodd-Frank and ObamaCare, which both handed regulators what amount to blank checks and which are spawning a massive explosion in new regulations.Worse, federal regulators are all too eager to expand their reach and control over the country beyond what Congress already granted them, particularly when they're given a free hand by a president who wants to ""fundamentally transform"" the country.Nevada AG Adam Laxalt said that ""what we are seeing in the past few years is truly unprecedented.""Not only has Congress ceded power to regulators, it's done little to stop the overreach, leaving it largely up to Republican attorneys general to apply the brakes.Cuccinelli says that ""attorneys general have stopped more of this administration's overreach than the U.S. Congress.""A perfect example is the EPA's Clean Power Plan. During the Bush years, the Supreme Court sided with several liberal states who wanted the EPA to regulate CO2 emissions from cars and trucks, even though the clean air law did not mention carbon as a pollutant the EPA could or should regulate.Under Obama, the EPA then granted itself the right to regulate stationary sources of CO2 as well, said Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia's attorney general, embodied in its new Clean Power Plan.""The president's Clean Power Plan is worse than ObamaCare,"" Morrisey said, calling it a ""regulatory power grab of historic proportions.""And this massively expensive regulatory scheme would be in effect now, if it weren't for the fact that 29 state AGs sued to stop it, which led to the Supreme Court's halting its implementation.The EPA's equally massive new water regulations have been put on ice as well, after 13 states sued to block them. In this case, the EPA is trying to expand the definition of ""navigable waters"" in the Clean Water Act to, as Laxalt put it, ""include just about everything in our state short of backyard swimming pools."" Last fall, an appeals court in Cincinnati concluded that the regulations could not be enforced nationwide because ""petitioners have demonstrated a substantial possibility of success on the merits of their claims.""The courts also blocked Obama's attempt to unilaterally grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants after 25 states sued to stop it (and after the GOP-led Congress backed a bill that would fund it).So what can be done? Step one is to to get Congress to pass legislation that protects, rather than gives away, its authority. Step two is to rewrite most of the laws that have granted federal agencies so much unchecked power. Otherwise, there is little that lawmakers, AGs or anyone else can do to stop most regulatory actions. Third is to require more stringent reviews of regulations to make sure that they are worth the costs.The state AGs are right when they say that it shouldn't fall on their shoulders to protect the prerogatives the Constitution grants to Congress.

U.S. crude supplies probably rose by 4 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey before an Energy Information Administration report Wednesday. The nation had the biggest supply decline in 17 years the prior week when a tropical storm disrupted imports and offshore production.""The IEA said the supply overhang will persist longer than previously expected,"" said Gene McGillian, a senior analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. ""Also, there are expectations that U.S. inventories will post a big build as all the imports that were delayed arrive.""Oil has fluctuated since rallying in August amid speculation that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia would agree on measures to stabilize the market at a meeting later this month.

As recently as last month, the agency had expected the market to return to equilibrium this year.""This was a marked shift in outlook by the IEA,"" said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas in London. OPEC's ""long game got a little longer, implying the need for oil prices to remain lower for longer to spur the necessary adjustments in supply for the rebalancing of the market.""OPEC flipped its forecasts for rivals' supplies in 2017, predicting an increase in output from outside the group instead of a decline, according to a report Monday. Production from outside the group will grow by 200,000 barrels a day next year, compared to 150,000 a day expected a month ago.U.S. gasoline stockpiles probably fell by 1.1 million barrels last week, according to the median estimate in the Bloomberg survey before the EIA report.

314,ICE,"TERRACE PARK, Ohio — Sen. Rob Portman probably will win a second term, despite the fact that he deserves to. The swarm of young people who gathered on a Saturday morning in this Cincinnati suburb to feast on doughnuts and his gratitude are among the 5,000 volunteer interns, including students from 35 campuses, who have made 3.5 million voter contacts. Portman's supporters are a forgiving sort, undeterred by his many accomplishments and qualifications that could be disqualifying in this season of populist antagonism toward people who have actually governed.A graduate of Dartmouth and the University of Michigan Law School, Portman was one of President George H.W. Bush's counselors. After six terms in Congress, Portman became President George W. Bush's trade representative and, a year later, director of the Office of Management and Budget.It gets worse: This year's Republican presidential nominating electorate decided that the lungs are the locus of wisdom, but Portman is as quiet as his 19th-century Quaker abolitionist ancestors probably were when assisting the Underground Railroad. (In ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" Eliza escapes over the Ohio River ice floes about 50 miles east of here.)Given today's apotheosis of the outsider, Portman is fortunate to be running against a former congressman and governor, Ted Strickland, a political lifer who first ran for Congress (unsuccessfully) 40 years ago. He is an ordained Methodist minister from the gun-toting coal country of southeastern Ohio. Fortunately for Portman, Strickland, after losing the governorship to John Kasich in 2010, became head of the Washington-based, impeccably liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund. What was he thinking? Probably not about running again in Ohio.Strickland has revised the Clintonian mantra about making abortions ""safe, legal and rare."" He seems to prefer ""safe, legal and as frequent as subsidies can make them"": He favors repeal of the Hyde Amendment which for 40 years has banned taxpayer funding of abortions. The center supports many gun control measures unacceptable to the NRA, which supported Strickland in 2010 but has endorsed Portman. The Center for American Progress shares the Obama administration's animus against coal, so the United Mine Workers (like the Teamsters and the Fraternal Order of Police) have abandoned Strickland.Tip O'Neill's incessantly quoted axiom -- ""All politics is local"" -- is increasing false in polarized America, where many elections are nationalized. This year, however, it is in Portman's interest to stress local issues unrelated to anything being bellowed about by the person at the top of the Republican ticket. Sixty-thousand eligible voters say that the biggest issue for them is algae threatening Lake Erie. And the biggest issue might be the epidemic of deaths from heroin and other opioids. Nationally, such deaths — about 27,000 a year — are almost half the drug overdose deaths that now take more American lives than do car crashes. Opioids are especially devastating in post-industrial communities, of which Ohio has its share. In 2012, Ohio was one of 12 states where the number of opioid prescriptions written was larger than the number of people. Ohioans who are pleased that Portman authored the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act must forgive him for having done so in Washington.In Portman's 15-minute parking-lot pitter-patter to his supporters here, he did not mention the choleric man at the top of the ticket. Portman's strategic reticence does not extend to the matter of trade: He has made the obligatory vow to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Strickland's one-track-mind campaign focuses on international trade as the root of most of Ohio's evils. Never mind that Honda is Ohio's biggest auto employer and that Portman says one-third of the state's farm acres are growing crops for export.Six presidents were elected from this state (William Henry Harrison, Rutherford Hayes, James Garfield, William McKinley, William Taft, Warren Harding), a seventh (U.S. Grant) was born here, and there could have been an eighth — Robert Taft (1889-1953). A president's son, he was ""Mr. Republican"" during his 14 years representing Ohio in the Senate seat that Portman now occupies. Then as now, Ohio had many blue-collar industrial workers, and Taft's critics said he could not represent them. So, in 1947 a reporter asked Taft's wife, ""Do you think of your husband as a common man?"" Aghast, she replied:""Oh, no, no! The senator is very uncommon. He was first in his class at Yale and first in his class at the Harvard Law School. We wouldn't permit Ohio to be represented in the Senate by just a common man.""

Trump praised Mexican-Americans and called Nieto a friend.The New York Times devoted five paragraphs of its coverage on protesters they clearly hoped would embarrass Trump and lamented that only a tiny handful showed up -- and then tried to blame the small showing on social media.But in the end, Trump managed to help dispel concerns that he couldn't properly represent the U.S. abroad with any sort of dignity.Clinton, in contrast, came across as reactive and petulant, whining about how it ""takes more than making up for a year of insults by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and flying home again.""Trump's immigration speech was likewise a thoughtful and compelling argument for his approach -- in other words, the kind of speech Trump should have been giving for months.His 10-point plan starts with building the wall, but includes many other much-needed reforms: ending catch-and-release, boosting the number of border patrol agents and ICE deportation officers, suspending visas from areas that can screen applicants, and reforming legal immigration ""to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people.""As to the 11 million here illegally, Trump's approach is exactly the right one. ""That discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past."" The speech is well worth watching.

322,ICE,"This comes after Trump bested Clinton during the historically devastating Louisiana flood, which both President Obama and Clinton appeared to ignore because it's a reliably red state. But Trump's visit forced Obama's hand -- he went down four days later.And Clinton? Well, she complained that Trump's visit was just a PR stunt. As if she and every other politician haven't taken advantage of such crises for political gain. (Anyone recall the fuss Clinton made over Flint's water crisis?)The day before Obama 's visit, Clinton was still refusing to go, claiming fatuously that she needed to wait so it wouldn't ""disrupt the response.""The fact that Trump's recent successes all came after the Aug. 17 shake-up in his campaign leadership is worth noting. But maybe Trump himself is coming to realize that -- given the public's overwhelming dislike for Clinton -- all he really needs to do to have a fighting chance in this election is come across as not crazy.Even before his Mexico visit, several polls were showing the race tightening. Reuters has Clinton up by just 1 point, and the Los Angeles Times has Trump beating Clinton by three points. Plus, there are still three debates to come that can easily shake up the numbers.In other words, the race continues to be competitive.The question is whether Trump can sustain this. He does, after all, have the maddening habit of shoving his own victories back into the jaws of defeat.But if he can continue to perform as he has these past two weeks, voters will surely take notice.RELATED:Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump Are Tied In Latest IBD/TIPP Poll

337,ICE,"The Treasury Department's annual financial review of Medicare found that its growth rate won't trigger a cost-cutting panel this week, sending drug stocks higher Wednesday.Ahead of the report on Tuesday, speculation had broken out that growth could be high enough to trigger an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to come up with ways to cut spending. The Brookings Institution had scheduled an event Thursday to discuss the issue.""Last year's report projected that the hospital insurance trust fund would be depleted by 2030 -- just 14 years from now,"" Brookings' website said. ""The report also predicted a more immediate and controversial event: The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), famously nicknamed 'death panels,' would be required to submit proposals to reduce Medicare spending in 2018, with the reductions taking place in 2019.""The report of the Medicare Board of Trustees actually moved the depletion date two years earlier, but it said that there still wasn't enough growth in costs to trigger an IPAB. That seemed to turn around the major medical groups: biotech stocks had headed south Tuesday afternoon, but after the mid-morning announcement IBD's Medical-Biotech group rose 1.35%. The Ethical Drugs group was up 0.6%.Even if an IPAB had been triggered, analysts doubted the impact would have been that big, given the restrictions on the sort of cuts the panel could make. Late Tuesday, RBC Capital Markets' Michael Yee ran the numbers:""We note 8 million to 10 million 'dual eligibles' added to 50 million 60 million Medicaid patients, thus growing by 20%,"" Yee wrote in his research note. ""Taking Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Medicaid exposure (10-20%) and growing it by 20% to get the larger Medicaid '23% rebate,' our calculations show that this would change revenues by no more than 1% or so if this happened.""Celgene stock, which fell 2.5% in heavy trading Tuesday, rose more than 3% intraday, closing 2.45% at 99.23 on the stock market today. Regeneron stock climbed 4% intraday, setting for a 2% rise to 351.92 after dropping 2.1% Tuesday. Amgen and Biogen shares rose fractionally after both sank nearly 1% Tuesday.Despite the timing of it all, though, hedge fund manager Leonard Yaffe wasn't convinced that the IPAB business was the actual reason for the stock moves, as biotechs had been trending downward since early June.""The rebound in biopharma stocks today is much more than offsetting the concerns mentioned yesterday, as well as the likelihood of fund redemptions; the stocks had become very attractive, and the prospects for several companies are bright,"" Yaffe wrote in an email.

341,ICE,"Climate Change: Global warming advocates like to pretend they are open-minded, all about science. But let someone else's science get in the way of their ""consensus,"" and you find out how little they really believe in science.Just ask Professor Valentina Zharkova of Britain's Northumbria University. She and a team of researchers conducted a study on sunspots, which are known to have a strong effect on solar radiation and thus on the Earth's climate.What they found was remarkable: solar activity, based on models that closely fit past trends, looks to be headed for a sharp downward turn. Indeed, activity could decline to levels not seen since the so-called ""Little Ice Age,"" an unusually cold period that stretched across the Northern Hemisphere and lasted from roughly 1650 to 1850.As such, a study of this kind, you might think, would be incredibly important. But instead of being greeted with scientific questions or open curiosity about her group's study, Zharkova's team was met with a most unscientific hostility.""Some of them were welcoming and discussing,"" she said in an interview with The Global Warming Policy Forum. ""But some of them were quite — I would say — pushy.""And some went well beyond just ""pushy.""""They were trying to actually silence us,"" said Zharkova. ""Some of them contacted the Royal Astronomical Society, demanding, behind our back, that they withdraw our news release.""Global warming scientists, among whom are some real fanatics, often style themselves as latter-day Galileos, standing strong against superstition and religion and bravely taking a stand for scientific truth, just as Galileo did by saying that the Earth revolved around the Sun, and not vice versa.But they are nothing of the sort. Indeed, many of these so-called scientists have more in common with Galileo's persecutors than with those who have bravely pushed scientific understanding of our universe and all its workings forward.For the record, Zharkova isn't alone in her conclusions. Other recent studies, including ones found here and here, suggest the Sun is headed for a period of extremely low activity — which means, all other things being equal, lower temperatures for much of the Earth.No, the problem isn't the science. The problem is such research is an uncomfortable impediment of the global warming complex's unholy alliance of green interest groups, clueless movie stars, bought-and-paid-for scientists, big government politicians, and even some major corporations that see new global warming regulations as an easy way to crush their smaller competitors.With global governments spending billions of dollars a year on climate change, almost all of it on those who believe the global warming dogma, there's too much at stake to allow a heretic to question the orthodoxy. That's why Zharkova and others are greeted with unscientific hostility.Anyone who thinks this type of behavior is ""science"" is wrong. It's not even right to call it ""religion,"" as some have, using that term as a pejorative. In fact, truly religious people actually question their faith. Only global warming's legions of true believers don't.RELATED:

346,ICE,"Where to start with actor Jesse Williams' widely praised rant on police brutality and white racism delivered at this year's Black Entertainment Television awards show?To his enthusiastic audience, Williams reeled off lie after lie, all in the name of black ""resistance"" over the ""oppressor"" -- meaning anyone he believes benefits from ""this invention called whiteness."" Time magazine called his discourse ""powerful.""Where are fact-checkers when the fact-devoid desperately need fact-checking? After all, Williams practically begged  to be fact-checked when he said, ""What we've been doing is looking at the data and we know that police somehow manage to de-escalate, disarm and not kill white people every day.""The ""police ... manage to ... not kill white people every day""?Let's start with 2014, the last year for which there are official records. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the police killed 261 whites and 131 blacks. The CDC also found that from 1999 to 2013, the police killed almost twice the number of whites compared to blacks, 3,160 and 1,724, respectively.Activists promptly note that whites account for nearly 65% of the population and that, therefore, one would expect whites to comprise most of those killed by cops. And we are told that blacks, while 13% of the population, represent a much greater percentage of those killed by cops. Institutional, systemic, structural racism!Here's what those promoting the ""police disproportionately kill black people"" narrative consistently omit. Whites, despite being almost 65% of the population, disproportionately commit less  of the nation's violent crime -- 10%. Blacks, at 13% of the population, disproportionately commit more  violent crime. As to murders, black commit nearly half. Yet whites are 50% of cop killings.Criminology professor Peter Moskos looked at the numbers of those killed by officers from May 2013 to April 2015 and found that 49% were white, while 30% were black. ""Adjusted for the homicide rate,"" says Moskos, ""whites are 1.7 times more likely than blacks to die at the hands of police."" So if anything, whites have more to complain about than Mr. Williams.What about traffic stops and race? Surely cops racially profile blacks, wrongly and disproportionately stopping them? Not according to the National Institute of Justice, the research arm of the Department of Justice. In its 2013 report, ""Race, Trust and Police Legitimacy,"" the NIJ found that 75% of blacks admitted that they were stopped for ""legitimate reasons."" And it turns out blacks disproportionately commit traffic offenses, whether speeding, driving without a license, driving with expired tags, driving without the seat belt on or without a car seat for a baby, and so on. Numerical disparities, said the NIJ, result from ""differences in offending"" in addition to ""differences in exposure to the police"" and ""differences in driving patterns.""What about 2015, a year in which Black Lives Matter protested a number of high-profile police/black suspect encounters? According to The Washington Post, the police killed 965 people. But the Post found that ""white police officers killing unarmed black men represent less than 4% of fatal police shootings."" Remember, a black man, extremely popular among blacks, has been president for over seven years. He has nominated, and Congress has approved, back-to-back attorneys general. Nothing stops the Department of Justice from filing civil rights charges against the officers for ""murder."" But the DOJ has not done so.Williams attacked whites for engaging in what has become known as ""cultural appropriation,"" although he did not use that term. He said: ""This invention called whiteness uses and abuses us, burying black people out of sight and out of mind while extracting our culture, our dollars, our entertainment like oil -- black gold, ghettoizing and demeaning our creations then stealing them, gentrifying our genius and then trying us on like costumes before discarding our bodies like rinds of strange fruit. The thing is though ... the thing is that just because we're magic doesn't mean we're not real.""That's a mouthful, especially when the primary buyers of rap music, a black-dominated genre, mostly are white consumers. Snoop Dogg, Ice-T, Run-D.M.C. and Jay Z got rich while happily being culturally appropriated by white kids living in the suburbs.It's also interesting to note that Williams is a product of a white mother and black father, both of whom were in the audience. So his mom is an ""invention,"" while his dad is ""magic."" Must make for interesting conversation in the Williams' home at dinnertime. And a rich, half-white actor delivered an attack on whites on a cable channel owned by a corporation whose primarily shareholders are a family headed by a patriarch named Sumner Redstone, a Jew.Only in America.

Supplies rose to an 87-year high of 543.4 million barrels in the last week of April.Crude production slipped by 55,000 barrels a day to 8.62 million, the lowest since September 2014, according to EIA data. U.S. output is down 10% from 9.61 million barrels a day on June 5, 2015, which was the highest in more than four decades.""Production declines in the U.S. are accelerating,"" said Joe Bozoyan, an equity portfolio manager who focuses on energy at John Hancock in Boston. ""The drop in U.S. production will eventually win out over demand concerns. I'm still looking for prices to probably trend higher over the next year.""

350,ICE,"2016 Election: Republicans seem to like nothing more than kicking one of their own when he's down. So it's not entirely surprising that dozens of Republicans decided that now is the time to declare Donald Trump unfit for office. But in doing so, they've made themselves, not Trump, look like idiots.One reason for the rise of Trump is, arguably, the anger at the fact that so many establishment Republicans refuse to attack Democrats with the same vigor as they attack their own. Now that Trump's poll numbers are slipping and his campaign is in disarray, they are at it once again.First came a blistering letter signed by 50 officials who've served in various national security capacities in past GOP administrations. ""None of us,"" they said, ""will vote for Donald Trump.""They say Trump ""lacks character, values and experience,"" has ""little understanding of America's vital national interests"" and ""lacks the temperament to be president.""Fair enough. We haven't been shy in our criticism of Trump, particularly on foreign policy matters, either.But many of the examples these erstwhile Republicans provide to back up their decision apply as much to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as to Trump.The authors complain that ""despite his lack of knowledge,"" Trump ""claims that he understands foreign affairs."" Yet it was greenhorn Obama who once bragged that ""I know more about policies on any particular issue than my policy directors.""These Republicans say Trump ""appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution ... religious tolerance, freedom of the press."" But they ignore the fact that Obama, with Hillary's full knowledge and consent, has spent almost eight years running roughshod over the Constitution, attacking religious freedom and intimidating the press.They say Trump ""persistently compliments our adversaries and threatens our allies."" We could devote thousands of words providing examples of Obama committing this sin.So where were these high-minded Republicans when Obama was running for president and seeking re-election? Where was their blistering attack as Obama's policies led to the decline of U.S. influence abroad, the rise of ISIS, an increasingly aggressive Russia and China, and a soon-to-be nuclear-armed Iran? Their silence was deafening.And how is it that all these national security experts can bring themselves to say about Hillary Clinton is that they ""have doubts"" about her?Trump has serious character flaws, to be sure, but Clinton has an actual record of failure in just about everything she did as secretary of state. And that's to say nothing of the cavalier disregard for national security with her use of an unsecured private email server while at State. Even the head of Obama's FBI admitted that Clinton's recklessness likely put classified information in the hands of our enemies.If there's anyone who, on national security grounds, is unquestionably disqualified for the highest office, it is Clinton, not Trump. Yet these spineless Republicans are either too afraid or too politically correct to say so.Next came a statement by Republicans who once headed the EPA and complain that Trump isn't sufficiency liberal when it comes to the environment.Trump ""hasn't a clue about Republicans' historic contributions to science-driven environmental policy,"" write William Ruckelshaus and William Reilly, who ran the EPA during the Nixon and George H.W. Bush administrations, respectively.""We Republicans should be shocked, outraged even, at the prospect that all this progress, this legacy will be repudiated and rolled back by Donald Trump.""This is, to put it charitably, sheer lunacy.The EPA is the most out-of-control, unaccountable, scientifically unmoored and economically hazardous agency in the federal government. Under Obama, the courts have repeatedly blocked the EPA's lawless power grabs. The latest is its alleged climate-change-fighting ""clean power"" rule, which the courts put on ice after two dozen states sued to stop it. Republicans should be uniform in calling for this agency to be reined in, not showering it with praise.Constructive criticism of any candidate is important. But there's a difference between constructive criticism and the tawdry political opportunism on display this week by Republicans who ought to know better.

351,ICE,"Hedge funds have gone all-in on lower oil prices, counting on seasonal weakness to play out again this year.Money managers increased wagers on declining crude prices to a record as futures dropped to the lowest in more than three months. U.S. crude inventories climbed for a second week as imports arrived at the fastest pace since 2012. The supply gain comes on the cusp of seasonal refinery maintenance that will curb crude demand. Futures have declined in each of the past five Septembers.""We're are entering a period of seasonal maintenance, which should put some downward pressure on prices,"" said Scott Roberts, co-head of high yield investments and manager of $2.7 billion at Invesco Advisers in Atlanta.Hedge funds increased their short position in West Texas Intermediate crude to 218,623 futures and options combined during the week ended Aug. 2, the highest in data going back to 2006, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.WTI closed 22% below its June peak on Aug. 1, meeting the common definition of a bear market. It dropped 7.9% to $39.51 a barrel in the report week. Prices were up 2.7% at $42.92 as of 11:21 a.m. on Monday.U.S. crude supplies rose to 522.5 million barrels as of July 29, the highest seasonal level in decades, Energy Information Administration data show. Imports climbed to 8.74 million barrels a day, the most since October 2012.Refineries operated at 93.3% of capacity in the week ended July 29, the highest since November. Refiners typically bolster their operations in June and July to meet peak gasoline demand before ratcheting back in August. Over the past five years, refiners' thirst for oil has dropped an average of 1.2 million barrels a day from July to October.""Refinery margins are weak, global demand growth is decelerating, and there's upcoming seasonal weakness for both crude demand and product demand,"" Mike Wittner, head of oil market research at Societe Generale SA in New York, said on Bloomberg Television last Thursday. ""To me it has a taste of the classic autumn downturn.""Technical factors are also weighing on crude prices. WTI settled below the 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages on Aug. 1 for the first time since February.The market has further to fall before hitting key support, according to Paul Ciana, a technical analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. ""We need to form a bottom in the mid-to-upper $30s before we move back towards $52.""Money managers' short position in WTI rose 38,489 futures, and options and have almost doubled in the past three weeks, CFTC data show. Longs, or bets on rising prices, increased 1.6%, while net longs dropped 28% to the lowest since January.In the Brent market, money managers trimmed bullish bets by 28,148 contracts in the week, according to data from ICE Futures Europe. Bets that prices will rise outnumbered short positions by 260,388 lots, the least since January, the London-based exchange said.In other markets, net-bearish bets on gasoline fell 20% to 4,081 contracts. Gasoline futures fell 2.5% in the report week. Net-long wagers on U.S. ultra low sulfur diesel dropped 44% to 7,163 contracts. Futures slipped 5.1%.Not everyone is on the bearish bandwagon.The influx of bearish bets from money managers may leave the market vulnerable to a rebound. The past three peaks in short bets have been followed by price gains ranging from 29% to 95%.The oil market is poised for a ""violent reversal"" upward, oil trader Andy Hall wrote to investors in his Stamford, Conn., hedge fund, Astenbeck Capital Management LLC. ""Funds have made a significant amount of money getting short oil in the last few weeks, and people will want to take some profits off the table as we approach levels which will only accelerate U.S. production declines.""

352,ICE,"A scruffy, bearded Michael Phelps swims punishing laps alone in a darkened pool as an Edith Piaf-like voice croons ""It's the last goodbye, I swear/I can't rely on a dime-a-day love that don't go anywhere.""Cue a montage of the elite swimmer lifting weights, enduring ice baths and fire-cupping therapy, staring wistfully at a leaf-strewn backyard pool as he contemplates something. Actually, it's pretty obvious what the Olympian -- who just won his 19th gold medal on Sunday -- is contemplating, even if Under Armour (UA) isn't allowed to say it explicitly in its ad.""It's what you do in the dark that puts you in the light,"" flashes on the pitch-black screen. ""Rule yourself.""Expect to see that commercial a whole lot over the next few weeks, thanks to a change to the International Olympic Committee's Rule 40 that finally allows non-Olympic sponsors to advertise athletes competing in the Games.The much-talked-about policy shift is a big positive for brands who aren't among the 11 official worldwide Olympic sponsors, like McDonald's (MCD), or any of the 28 U.S. sponsors, like Nike (NKE). But it could especially benefit Under Armour's march toward the global stage.Nike, the far-and-away leader in performance gear, still towers over Under Armour. But the littler athletic company's scrappy-underdog brand image and well-chosen endorsement deals have resonated with young people. Of the three major labels -- Nike, Adidas and Under Armour -- Under Armour is the only one that has not sponsored the quadrennial event before. But the new guidelines may mean that it doesn't have to in order to reap the benefits.""The Rule 40 change really gives (Under Armour) an opening to leverage their athletes,"" said analyst Matt Powell of the NPD Group market research company. ""Before, they were really restricted in how much they could actually (do).""Before Rio, Rule 40 meant that only companies that had plunked down major money to call themselves exclusive sponsors -- like Coca-Cola (KO) or Visa (V) -- were allowed to feature their Olympians in ads during the Games.The restriction ostensibly protected sponsor investments, but it also shut out athletes' ability to capitalize on their medal efforts after years of training, causing a kerfuffle at the 2012 London Games. Non-sponsor brands were not even allowed to tweet ""Good luck at the Olympics!"" to their qualifying athletes.They still aren't. But following the loosening of Rule 40, those that have gotten prior approval can now showcase their finest athletes in ""generic advertising,"" so long as the Olympic rings and the Games' associated verbiage -- ""Olympics,"" ""medal,"" even ""2016,"" depending on how it's used -- are nowhere to be found in the marketing material. Companies had to apply for the waiver six months ahead of the Games.Hence, Under Armour's sentimental Olympic-but-not-really-Olympic commercial that heavily alludes to Phelps' last appearance at the international event. Instead of being kept silent at the world's greatest sports stage, the Baltimore-based brand can tweet and post Facebook (FB) messages, and broadcast their heavy hitters from the rooftops.Under Armour's ode to Phelps brought the athlete to tears when he first watched it, a moment conveniently captured on film and posted on the brand's YouTube page. The reaction video has been viewed over half a million times. The ""Rule Yourself"" ad itself has attracted well over 5.8 million views, the company's second most-watched video on the site despite being posted only four months ago.
"
353,ICE,"A similar Olympic-style campaign starring top U.S. gymnasts Madison Kocian, MyKayla Skinner and Maggie Nichols also made the rounds, garnering over 3 million YouTube views in the months before the Games. (Kocian made the Olympic team, and Skinner is an alternate.)""The changes to Rule 40 allow us to fulfill our No. 1 objective, which is to support the nearly 225 Olympic athletes and Olympic hopefuls tied to the Under Armour brand during the Games,"" an Under Armour spokesperson told IBD via email.And the timing of this effort coincides with Under Armour's push to assert itself not just at home, but abroad.International revenue, as of the company's June-ended second quarter, grew 72% year over year and accounted for 15% of total revenue. That's almost double the 8% of revenue that came from sales abroad just two years ago.""Between Nike and Under Armour, this is a big incremental opportunity for Under Armour and the reason they're being so aggressive,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Dave Weiner told IBD. ""Brazil is a huge market.""The Olympics' host country in particular has been a focus of Under Armour's push to grow its global soccer franchise and sell more cleats, he said. But for all the pomp and hype, the major sporting event only comes around every four years and lasts just two weeks, meaning it's not much of a needle-mover when it comes to stock price or annual revenue.For example, Ralph Lauren (RL), the official outfitter of Team USA, has seen its overall sales fall for four consecutive quarters and is expected to continue suffering declines for the next few years.And while the appeal of Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte in a preppy navy blazer and white pants has not been lost on his fans online, it is unclear whether that will translate into sales for a clothier whose Hamptons aesthetic is increasingly losing relevance on athleisure-dominated sidewalks.For Under Armour, the potential comes from establishing presence.""What it's going to do is allow them to get on conference calls and put together marketing with more confidence that they're one of the top three global brands -- help to solidify some long-term projections by country,"" said Weiner, adding, ""These are the kinds of events where you can drive home the point.""Powell echoed that sentiment, saying that this is an ""important"" Olympics for Under Armour.""But that said, the marketing around the Olympics is not really a visceral kind of marketing,"" but more to show ""that they're authentic and (their) Olympic athletes are performing at a high level.""He said he hasn't really witnessed a case of people watching the Olympics and then hopping aboard the brand train. Still, before the Games had even begun, at least one viewer of the Michael Phelps ""Rule Yourself"" campaign was sold.""I'll buy under armour (sic) just because of this commercial,"" said YouTube commenter Kevin Cass. ""Absolutely one of the best I've ever seen ... Under Armour,....you're the best in my books now. Good luck Michael!!!""As much as Under Armour and others are benefiting from the slight breathing room to Rule 40, the restrictions are still annoying parties on all sides of the equation.Athletes still have to watch what they say.How amazing is this! It's for that thing 😉 I'm doing this summer 😉 in South America 😉 #Rule40 pic.twitter.com/nJ2cQxPlXG— Jade Lally (@JadeLallyT69) July 27, 2016Even waivered sponsors must be careful, lest they face repercussions for accidentally using the trademarked #Rio2016 hashtag or mentioning the Olympics by name on Twitter.

356,ICE,"The Supreme Court split 4-4 on whether to overturn an injunction of President Obama's 2014 immigration order that was put on hold last year by a federal judge in Texas.The divided vote, caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, who would have been expected to side with the conservatives in killing the deportation deferral program, effectively leaves the fate of the program up to 2016 voters.If Hillary Clinton becomes president, that will ensure a fifth liberal justice will sign off on the program allowing about 4.3 million unauthorized immigrants whose children are American citizens to stay and work in the U.S.A Cato Institute brief on the case noted that some granted legal status would otherwise have had to wait up to 21 years to petition for a visa and spend 10 of those years outside the U.S.""Congress explicitly rejected the exact type of expansive family-unity principle that (the deferred action program) is enacting administratively,"" the authors of the brief wrote, even though they personally back legalizing the status of the undocumented.Yet even if the immigration order is inconsistent with the law, there is a still a big question over whether states have the legal standing to sue to overturn it. Texas made the case that it had standing because it would have to expend resources needed to process driver's licenses for those who gain legal status.The divided opinion shows that the conservative justices, some of whom have previously rejected states' standing to sue the federal government, were persuaded by the argument from Texas.Another high-profile case working its way to the Supreme Court hinges on whether the House has the standing to sue the executive branch for usurping its power of the purse. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer ruled recently in House v. Burwell that the Obama administration is illegally spending billions on cost-sharing subsidies that make insurance affordable for low-income individuals using the health exchanges.The stalemate over Obama's immigration order is likely to be a focus of the election. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has said he wants to build a wall on the border with Mexico and require unauthorized immigrants to leave the U.S., though perhaps allowing some to return. Clinton has signaled that she won't deport illegal immigrants who don't have a criminal record.

357,ICE,"Brexit is sending prices in the European Union carbon market lower, and options traders expect it to get worse.Trade in options to sell permits in the world's biggest climate market surged to the highest level since Jan. 21 on Monday, according to ICE Futures Europe data compiled by Bloomberg. The cost of bearish wagers on carbon has jumped to the highest in six months relative to bullish ones, the data show.Allowances were already having a bad year before the U.K. electorate voted to leave the EU on June 23, which sent permits 19% lower through Wednesday. A Brexit raises the risk that the U.K. may be the first country to abandon the 11-year-old market, depriving it of the region's second-biggest emitter. Allowance prices slumped 45% since the end of 2015 as lawmakers grapple with a permit glut that's discouraging investment in clean technology.""The options market indicates some traders may be fearful,"" Anatoly Stolbov, an analyst at Virtuse Energy in Prague, said by phone. That reflects expected price falls if the U.K. leaves the market, a decision that could come as early as this year, he said.Put options protecting against a 10% drop in benchmark December carbon cost 8.9 points more than calls betting on a 10% rise on Friday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the widest spread since Dec. 1 for the price relationship known as skew. It was 8.6 points on Tuesday.The EU program gives away or auctions allowances to about 13,000 factories, utilities and airlines, which need the permits to match their carbon dioxide output or pay fines.There's a risk the future British decision on whether to stay in the EU market gets entangled in wider trade negotiations, said Trevor Sikorski, an analyst at Energy Aspects in London.""The U.K. could simply be left out in the cold"" if negotiations with the EU fail to reach a conclusion within two years of the start of divorce proceedings, Sikorski said Tuesday in an e-mailed note. ""That means draining the market of liquidity and pushing the EU allowance inventory held by U.K. installations back into the market.""The U.K. bought 48 million metric tons of allowances in 2014, according to an estimate by Iain Turner, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in London.""With EU exit, this demand would be removed from the emissions-trading system, which would lead to softer prices, at least until the scheme could be tightened up,"" Turner said June 24 in an e-mailed note.The volume of put options almost doubled Monday to 5.8 million tons from the previous session, ICE Futures Europe data show. This month, 23.2 million tons have changed hands, the most since January. The put option with the most open interest has a strike price of 4 euros a ton.December futures fell as much as 7.5% Wednesday to 4.34 euros ($4.82) a metric ton on ICE, the lowest intraday price since March 2014. They traded at 4.59 euros at 4:21 p.m. in London. Volume jumped 50% to 21.4 million tons, the most since Friday.""Companies, faced by material Brexit-related uncertainty, are sensibly exploring their different risk-management alternatives,"" said Louis Redshaw, founder of carbon-market consultants Redshaw Advisors in London, which trades on behalf of clients.Put options are a useful tool for U.K. companies to use to protect the value of their assets if they expect they might have an oversupply of carbon allowances, Redshaw said by e-mail. ""Recent options activity indicate that it's actually happening.""

358,ICE,"The City of London is facing the first direct threat to its role as Europe's dominant financial center, as French President Francois Hollande takes aim at a key pillar of the U.K. industry.European Union member states should prepare to take over euro-denominated clearing that will no longer be possible in the U.K., Hollande said.""The City, which could handle clearing operations in euros thanks to the U.K.'s presence in the EU, won't be able to do them anymore,"" the French head of state said after the first day of an EU summit in Brussels.Hollande is the second French leader to target London's leading role in clearing euro-denominated transactions since Britons decided last week to leave the EU. Francois Villeroy de Galhau, governor of the Bank of France and a member of the European Central Bank's Governing Council, said on Saturday that clearing cannot be located in London without following EU rules.Hollande wanted to illustrate the consequences of last week's Brexit decision, and he will make clearing a key point in exit talks with the U.K., according to French officials who asked not to be identified. The EU will seek concessions from Britain in return for continued access to the single market, the officials said.EU officials have said repeatedly that freedom of movement for workers and adhering to market regulations are conditions for access to the single market. The negotiations may determine where clearing will fit in the U.K.'s future financial relationship with the EU, one of the officials said.London's role in clearing trades in the $493 trillion derivatives market came into focus when the European Central Bank lost a court case with the U.K. last year. The ECB had sought to bring clearing under its regulatory control by shifting it to a euro-area country.The court ruling was seen at the time as reinforcing London's status as Europe's financial hub, but U.K. officials have since said that Chancellor of the Exchequer's George Osborne's victory wouldn't have been possible were the country outside the EU.Clearinghouses were embraced by regulators after the 2008 financial crisis, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers threatened to bring down other institutions. Clearing firms stand between buyers and sellers, holding collateral from both, in case a member defaults. Big trading companies are increasingly required to use them.The $384 trillion of interest-rate swaps in circulation make up the largest slice of the off-exchange derivatives market. In euros, about 70% of trading in that kind of swap takes place in the U.K., compared with 11% in France and about 7% in Germany, according to Bank for International Settlements data from 2013, the most recent data available. The U.S. traded 2%.Disentangling euro clearing from London could be a difficult task and raises other questions. The U.S., for example, clears some transactions, and likewise some trades denominated in British sterling are cleared by Frankfurt-based Eurex, a unit of Deutsche Boerse AG.Barring euro clearing from the U.K. would be a ""draconian"" measure, especially considering the years of work that have gone into ensuring clearing firms are recognized in different jurisdictions, said Hirander Misra, chief executive officer of futures platform Global Markets Exchange Group International.""Clearing is very much cross-border and also depends on confidence in the clearinghouse. That said, there's nothing stopping EU authorities from putting in pseudo-barriers to entry,"" Misra said.LCH, which is majority owned by London Stock Exchange Group, and Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange's (ICE) ICE Clear Europe are two of the biggest clearing firms in London.Hollande is not the only EU leader to make it clear that life for Britain will be different outside the club of nations. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said yesterday, ""there must be and there will be a palpable difference between a country that wants to be part of the European Union and one that doesn't.""Asked about Hollande's comments on clearing, Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi told a press conference in Brussels that the remaining EU member states would be very clear with the U.K.""It's obvious that if the U.K. leaves, and it has left, some positive elements it had will be destined to be lost,"" he said. ""In the end, I think the British will lose more than the Europeans.""Hollande took a hard line on the single market, which the U.K. still wants to access, by arguing the British government must agree to all its rules.The U.K. has turned its back on the principle of free movement of people, one of the EU's key tenets, meaning ""you lose the advantages that come with it,"" Hollande said.

U.S. crude supplies probably fell by 2.5 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey before an Energy Information Administration report Wednesday.""We're catching our breath here,"" said Gene McGillian, a senior analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn. ""A lot of the fears about the impact of the Brexit vote on the global economy have been priced in.

"
371,ICE,"In 2008, Barack Obama promised a fundamental transformation of America. Where that promise has gone unfulfilled the most is in areas of sexual and racial discrimination. What's worse is the official sanction given to such discrimination. Let's look at some of it.Visit just about any California men's prison, and you will see that one's race determines whom he cells with, the toilet and shower he uses, and what recreation areas he enjoys.Then there is sexual discrimination. Female correctional officers earn the same pay as their male counterparts. However, when it comes to extracting a dangerous inmate from his cell, it is always a five- or six-member male officer team that risks bodily injury. How fair is that? Why not have both male and female cell extraction teams?Harvard University has announced new rules that will punish students who join single-sex clubs, including fraternities and sororities. Part of that punishment will make them ineligible for college endorsement for top fellowships, such as the Rhodes and Marshall scholarships. As an aside, Rhodes scholarships should be banned; Cecil Rhodes was one of the architects of South African apartheid.Harvard University, like most other universities, is two-faced when it comes to sexual discrimination. It segregates sports teams by sex. It has women's basketball and men's basketball, women's ice hockey and men's, a women's swim team and a men's swim team.If Harvard's leaders were consistent, they would also punish students joining a single-sex sports team. Each sport should have one team on which all students, regardless of sex, are eligible to compete. Also, sports racism in college has ended -- except in men's basketball, where no college team's starting five looks anything like America.Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter has called for the elimination of the ban against women in combat, but he is keeping other forms of discrimination. Passing the Army's physical fitness test in basic training is a requirement. To pass, 17- to 21-year-old males must do 35 pushups, 47 situps and a 2-mile run in 16 minutes, 36 seconds or less. Females of the same age can pass the test with just 13 pushups, 47 situps and a 19:42 2-mile run. That's grossly unfair.As a black man, I can relate to the unfairness of different requirements. Literacy tests in some Southern states used to ask black voters, ""How many bubbles are in a bar of soap?"" and ""How many seeds are in a watermelon?"" White voters were exempt from that test -- presumably because they knew the answers. I'm wondering why men do not bring sexual discrimination lawsuits when they face different treatment based upon sex.There is one highly celebrated area of our lives that's misogynistic, vicious and cruel to women, yet goes completely ignored. It is nothing less than sadistic voyeurism. You might ask, ""Williams, what is that?"" It is the opera and its near celebration of cruelty to women. Giuseppe Verdi's ""Rigoletto"" regales us with tales of the Duke of Mantua, a licentious womanizer. From ""Aida"" and ""Carmen"" to ""Lulu"" and ""Madama Butterfly,"" opera is extravagantly cruel to its female characters.This suggests an important job for university music departments. They must either change operatic script in a way that respects women or simply ban the performance of such works. There is precedent for banning and revision in the arts and literature. Some schools have removed the offensive words from ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"" and some have banned the book outright.While in office, former Memphis Mayor A. C. Wharton was an energetic purifier. He wanted to purify his city by removing the bodies of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest and his wife from a city park. At a news briefing, he asked, ""Which African-American wants to have a picnic in the shadow of Nathan Bedford Forrest?""There is a historical precedent for the purification of America. Back in the Roman days, when the Romans wanted to erase the memory of people they deemed dishonorable, they had a practice called damnatio memoriae, Latin for ""condemnation of memory."" It was as if they had never existed.

372,ICE,"Crude settled at the lowest level in two weeks as shifting winds moved wildfires away from oil-sands facilities in Alberta, reducing concern that production cuts would make a substantial dent in U.S. oil stockpiles.Futures erased intraday gains and declined 2.7% in New York. Wildfires in Canada have led to cuts equivalent to about 40% of oil-sands production, based on IHS Energy estimates. The impact of a reduction in output may be muted due to U.S. crude stockpiles holding at the highest level since 1929. Once fires in Alberta are under control, the majority of oil sands mining projects can be back to normal production levels in about one week, Morgan Stanley said.“Without any damage, then the barrels lost are inconsequential, because we’re still at all-time record highs for U.S. storage,” Michael Hiley, head of over-the-counter energy trading at New York-based LPS Partners, said by telephone.U.S. crude inventories have climbed to 543.4 million barrels, the most since October 1929, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. Nationwide crude stocks are forecast to have increased by 750,000 barrels last week, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts before the EIA report Wednesday. Supplies at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for WTI and the nation’s biggest oil-storage hub, are near a record.West Texas Intermediate for June delivery dropped $1.22 to settle at $43.44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was 32% above the 100-day average.Brent for July settlement slipped $1.74 to end the session at $43.63 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. WTI for July was at a 40-cent premium to Brent. The last time the premium widened to more than 30 cents was in March.Assuming a 10-day ramp-up in activity, Alberta could lose about 650,000 barrels a day for three weeks, or almost 14 million barrels in total, Goldman Sachs’s analysts including Jeffrey Currie said in a report Monday. “While significant, such a disruption would have an only limited impact on overall North American crude inventories.”Suncor Energy (SU), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Husky Energy are among companies that have shut plants or reduced production in Alberta due to the wildfires. Suncor, Phillips 66 (PSX) and Statoil STA (STO) have declared force majeure -- a provision protecting companies from liability for contracts that go unfulfilled for reasons beyond their control -- on supplies from the region.Cooler temperatures are helping firefighters battle the blaze. Damage to oil-sands sites has been limited and some companies are already planning to restart facilities. Suncor said it has begun planning to resume production after moving more than 10,000 employees, families and Fort McMurray residents out of the region.Oil prices remain about 60% below their peak in mid-2014 as the global oversupply persists. While American production has dropped, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has boosted supply to more than 33 million barrels a day, underpinned by gains from Iran and Iraq.Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter, replaced its oil minister Ali al-Naimi over the weekend with the chairman of state energy company Saudi Arabian Oil, Khalid Al-Falih. Speaking in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Al-Falih indicated that Saudi Arabia plans to act vigorously to defend its market share and exports as the market rebalances.“The shake-up in Saudi Arabia confirms what was in the process of happening,” John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy, said by telephone. It’s an ""even firmer stance on their part to battle for market share and use oil to hurt the frackers and Iran and continue to oversupply this market.”

373,ICE,"Oil pared its first weekly decline in more than a month, as oil-sands disruptions in Canada and lower U.S. output offset rising stockpiles and OPEC production.A wildfire in Alberta has shut more than 1 million barrels a day of oil-sands output capacity after workers were evacuated, while production sites have so far escaped damage. U.S. crude inventories rose to the highest since 1929, while production dropped the most in eight months last week, a government report on Wednesday showed. OPEC output climbed in April amid gains from Iran and Iraq, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Prices remain about 60% below their peak in mid-2014 as the global oversupply persists. U.S. stockpiles swelled to 543.4 million barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration. Citigroup Inc. predicts inventories will expand further to a record before starting a seasonal slide. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 33.22 million barrels a day last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Iraq increased output by 160,000 barrels, while Iran boosted production by 300,000 barrels to the highest level since December 2011.“The market is internalizing how much outage it may have in Canada vs. the increases in production elsewhere,” Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas in London, said by telephone. ""In essence, you have some of these unplanned outages being offset by increases in OPEC production.""West Texas Intermediate for June delivery rose 25 cents to $44.57 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:50 p.m.Brent for July settlement rose 49 cents, or 0.6%, to $45.29 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark was at a premium of 12 cents to WTI for July.Suncor Energy (SU), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Husky Energy are among companies that shut plants or reduced output due to the ongoing wildfires in Alberta.Futures rose as much as 2.3% earlier as the dollar weakened toward an 18-month low against the yen. A report showed U.S. employers in April added the fewest workers in seven months, and the jobless rate held steady as subdued economic growth led to a more moderate pace of hiring.“I’m not surprised by the mixed action in both oil and in equities as well, because that jobs report was disappointing, clearly dollar-bearish,” Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics in Austin, Texas, said by telephone.The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the U.S. currency vs. 10 counterparts, was little changed. A weak greenback bolsters the appeal of commodities priced in the currency as a store of value.

Iran, which refused to join other nations in a push to freeze output in April, could be ready to start discussions on production quotas within one or two months, according to an official from the state oil company.“The main pricing input for today should be the fires around McMurray that are getting out of control and spreading,” Olivier Jakob, managing director of consultant Petromatrix, said in a research note. “The situation on the ground is very volatile and in constant evolution.”West Texas Intermediate for June delivery gained 96 cents, or 2.2%, to $44.74 a barrel at 12:38 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

This is “very bullish because we have been importing record levels of crude from Canada the past two years.”Oil production in the U.S. slid by 113,000 barrels a day to 8.83 million, according to a report Wednesday from the Energy Information Administration. That’s the biggest weekly drop since August 2015. Nationwide crude inventories increased by 2.8 million barrels to 543.4 million, the most since 1929.The decline in U.S output was “ignored earlier in the week mainly because the inventory numbers were bearish, but nonetheless, there’s a general view that the supply-demand fundamentals are going to start looking more like they are headed toward a balance,” Bart Melek, head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said by telephone.Oil has rebounded after slumping to the lowest since 2003 earlier this year amid signs the global glut will ease as U.S. production falls. While Iran may soon be open to discussions with other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, there isn’t currently a proposal to revive output limits at its June meeting, and delegates from the group said such action may no longer be necessary as the market improves.Iran could reach its pre-sanctions export level of 2.2 million barrels a day by the end of the summer, National Iranian Oil Co. Managing Director Rokneddin Javadi said in Tehran. Exports averaged 2.1 million barrels a day last month out of total production of 3.7 million, he said.“The oil market, as we move into the second half of the year, looks better and trends toward a balance,” Melek said. “That should propel prices toward $60.”

376,ICE,"Insurance is designed to allay our fears of worst-case financial losses, whether it's losing our cars, our homes, or even our lives.  So perhaps it was only natural that a 2014 White House Report would matter-of-factly state that ""climate policy can be thought of as 'climate insurance.' … to reduce the chances of worst-case outcomes in the future.""That report lists all sorts of potential calamities that could supposedly cause a runaway greenhouse effect – melting of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, massive releases of methane from Arctic permafrost, and so forth. But despite the various line-in-the-sand claims of impending calamity or tipping points already tipped, we're not going to wake up one morning, look out the window, and discover the earth has suddenly become Venus.The White House report also compared buying climate insurance to ""individuals and businesses (who) routinely purchase insurance to guard against various forms of risk such as fire, theft, or other loss."" Except buying ""climate insurance"" is anything but routine and really can't be compared to buying insurance for your house or car.When an insurance company sells you a policy, you know exactly what risks you're insuring against.  You know exactly what the insurance company will pay if your house burns down or your car is totaled.  And insurance companies use historic data to predict the likelihood that a customer will make a claim, which is why they charge more to insure a teenager driving a Corvette than they do a 50-year-old driving a Camry.Not so with climate ""insurance."" We don't know what risks we're insuring against.  We don't know what the costs of the potential damage might be, or if there will be any costs at all.  We don't know if the premiums we'll be forced to pay will do anything to reduce those risks.  And we ignore the very real costs that climate change policies will impose on the world's poor.Other than that, it's a great idea.With insurance you buy in the marketplace, the ""catastrophe"" is well-defined, whether a car accident or a house that has burned down.  An insurance company offers buyers a known price for a known amount of insurance against a well-defined catastrophic event.But what does ""catastrophic"" climate change actually mean?  The White House report, for example, cites studies that estimate a 4 degree Celsius increase in world temperatures above pre-industrial levels could reduce world GDP by 2% annually, or about $1.5 trillion.Even if those estimates are valid -- a big if, given the limitations of pre-industrial climate data and the arbitrariness of the models used to make such predictions -- that's hardly the end of civilization.  If the catastrophe isn't well-defined, then it's impossible to define the payoff from the insurance.And because the models that link CO2 emissions to changes in climate and world economic growth are so speculative, it's impossible to know how much buying climate insurance will reduce the risks of those future, undefined catastrophes, if at all.  After all, neither the Clean Power Plan nor the vaunted Paris Agreement will have any measurable impacts on world climate.And what about other potential catastrophic events, such as a large asteroid crashing into the earth that destroys most all life (it's happened before), or antibiotic resistant bacteria that mutate and create a ""superbug"" pandemic (such bacteria already exist)?  Some scientists even argue that artificial intelligence soon will reach a point where it improves itself at exponential rates and views human beings as the equivalent of cockroaches in the kitchen, to be met with the AI equivalent of a can of Raid.Shouldn't society also purchase insurance for these potential catastrophic events, too, especially as they would have far more sudden impacts than climate change?  And if so, then how much insurance should be purchased?  What if China is more concerned about an asteroid impact than climate change, while India believes the No. 1 priority is insuring against a pandemic?  For such global ""catastrophes,"" who makes these decisions?Finally, in our zeal to insure the well-being of future generations, there is a fairness issue that ought not be forgotten: the effects of climate policies on the poor.  Policies such as the CPP or broad-based carbon taxes will increase energy costs, and higher energy costs will mean higher prices for just about everything.Moreover, higher worldwide energy prices will reduce economic growth, which will further immiserate the millions of individuals who today lack access to clean water, basic sanitation, reliable energy supplies, health care, and education.  Who decides that their well-being must be sacrificed for the potential well-being of future generations, even if the latter may be far better off regardless?Some may remember advertisements for the insurance company that assured its customers would be in ""good hands.""  With climate insurance, all you're going to get is a finger.

381,ICE,"Immigration: The need to close America’s porous southern border was given greater urgency this week after reports that an ISIS suspect plotted to escort operatives across the border and drug cartels are helping ISIS set up a base near El Paso, Texas.Federal prosecutors say a 21-year-old Somali-American planned to open up routes to the U.S. through Mexico so ISIS terrorists based in Syria could penetrate the U.S. border and attack American cities.The jailed suspect, Guled Ali Omar, awaits trial on charges he conspired with several other Muslims in the Somali community in Minneapolis to join ISIS to fight in jihad against the West.The FBI secretly recorded Omar and his cell mate discussing several times the possibility of attacks in the U.S, as well as murdering an FBI agent. Images from the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, as well as that of Osama bin Laden, were found on Omar’s phone.Most chilling was the account of a plot to help ISIS fighters from Syria infiltrate the U.S. through Mexico, which wouldn’t be hard to do thanks to the lack of border enforcement by the Obama administration.Under Obama's loose immigration policies, which allow removable aliens to remain in the country, many illegal immigrants who commit additional crimes while in the U.S. are being ignored, even though local police have urged ICE to take control of criminals in their jails and kick them out of the country.According to newly obtained government figures, ICE last year opted not to deport but to release 19,723 criminal illegal immigrants, including 208 convicted murderers, more than 900 convicted sex offenders and 12,307 convicted drunk drivers.Overall, those released into virtually every U.S. state carried a total of 64,197 convictions among them, or an average of 3.25 convictions each, according to a Center for Immigration Studies analysis. The data also reveal that the released group committed a total of 8,234 violent crimes.It’s not known how many of these released immigrant felons are members of dangerous gangs, such as MS-13, or affiliated with terrorists groups. But many go on to commit additional crimes after they are released into the general U.S. population.And there is new evidence that drug gangs have formed alliances with terrorist groups such as ISIS.According to a Judicial Watch, a Washington-based government watchdog agency, Mexican drug traffickers are helping ISIS terrorists stationed in Mexico cross into the U.S. to explore targets for future attacks.""Among the jihadists that travel back and forth through the porous southern border is a Kuwaiti named Shaykh Mahmood Omar Khabir -- an ISIS operative who lives in the Mexican state of Chihuahua not far from El Paso,” Judicial Watch said in a new report quoting Homeland Security sources. ""Khabir trained hundreds of al-Qaida fighters in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen, and has lived in Mexico for more than a year.”He reportedly now trains thousands of men -- mostly Syrians and Yemenis -- to fight at an ISIS base near Juarez.Staking out U.S. targets is not hard for Khabir, who actually bragged in an Italian newspaper article published earlier this month that the U.S. border is so open that he “could get in with a handful of men, and kill thousands of people in Texas or in Arizona in the space of a few hours.”A top Mexican diplomat says in the article she can't understand why the Obama regime is “culpably neglecting this phenomenon,” adding that “this new wave of fundamentalism could have nasty surprises in store for the United States.”Neither can we. That wall can’t come soon enough.

382,ICE,"Environment: A report says Earth is turning greener thanks to carbon dioxide emissions. But America isn't doing its part. While other countries are pumping out more CO2, the U.S. has cut its output.Carbon dioxide is the environmentalists' bogey man. In their narrative, it is an evil gas that, when produced by man, heats the globe to intolerable levels. But CO2 is just part of nature -- even when generated by human activities -- and it is making the world greener.According to the study ""Greening of the Earth and its Drivers” that appeared in the journal Nature Climate Change, there is ""a persistent and widespread increase of growing season integrated LAI (greening) over 25% to 50% of the global vegetated area.""At the same time, less than 4% of the globe is browning.The authors, 32 of them from 24 institutions, say that ""factorial simulations with multiple global ecosystem models suggest that CO2 fertilization effects (man's emissions) explain 70% of the observed greening trend.""Isn't this what environmental activists want -- a greener Earth? Don't they want us all to ""go green""? Well, we are. Except for America. U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide here are decreasing. In 2000, America pumped out 5,868 million metric tons of CO2, then 6,001 million metric tons in 2007, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The figure fell to 5,406 in 2014.Meanwhile, total world CO2 emissions have increased from 24,780 million metric tons in 2000, to 31,261 million metric tons in 2007, to 35,890 million metric tons in 2014, says the Global Carbon Atlas.Clearly America hasn't held up its end of the greening of Earth as it should have.Despite the report about carbon dioxide emissions' beneficial effects on our world, the study's authors felt the need to adopt the environmentalists' narrative. Yes, Earth is greener thanks to CO2, they say in their news release. But they don't want the global warming contrarians to use the greening to ""argue against cuts in carbon emissions to mitigate climate change, similar to those agreed at the 21st Conference of Parties (COP) meeting in Paris last year under the U.N. Framework on Climate Change.""It's absurd. These researchers are willing to throw out all the good news so that the demonization of carbon dioxide can continue. For example, Ranga Myneni of Boston University, the study's lead author, told the BBC that the extra tree growth would not make up for global warming, rising seas, melting glaciers, ocean acidification, the loss of Arctic sea ice, and the forecasts of more severe tropical storms supposedly caused by man's CO2 emissions.Likeminded Philippe Ciais, a contributing lead author of a carbon chapter in a recent U.N. report, similarly insists that increased CO2 in the atmosphere will cause ""global warming, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and sea ice, more severe tropical storms, etc.""This being the case, then we'd expect the environmentalist left to be in favor of fracking, one of the chief contributors to falling CO2 emissions in the U.S. But fracking is one of the environmentalists' bad boys. It will never be embraced.It's truly impossible to win with these people. They say carbon dioxide emissions are unacceptable, but a method of extracting fossil fuels that actually leads to cuts in CO2 emissions is nevertheless deemed evil. Then science determines that CO2 is greening the world, but that's not enough for the environmentalists because they are already fully committed to the CO2 fraud.So what do they want? A green world entirely sanitized of fossil fuels and by extension completely barren of man-made CO2? If so, they should simply demand that every nation emulate Venezuela, where dependable energy is just a rumor. That's the future they've been hoping for.

388,ICE,"Intercontinental Exchange is lining up financing for a bid for the London Stock Exchange Group, according to people familiar with the matter, as it prepares to go head to head with Deutsche Boerse to win control of the U.K. company.Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which is working with Morgan Stanley (MS) and Moelis & Co. to explore a takeover of LSE, is in discussions with banks to fund a formal offer in the coming weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified as the deliberations are private. Talks are at an early stage, no final decision has been made on the timing or size of the bid, and ICE could still decide against an offer, they said.Deutsche Boerse and LSE on Feb. 23 announced talks to combine and create a global player worth at least 20 billion pounds ($28 billion), which could better compete with ICE as well as CME Group (CME), the world’s largest derivatives market. A formal proposal from ICE or Deutsche Boerse could spark a bidding war between the suitors, which each have until late March to make an official offer for the bourse under the U.K.’s takeover rules.Deutsche Boerse is likely to announce the details of a merger plan with LSE as early as next week, according to a different person familiar with the matter. ICE, which sees the potential to generate more cost savings with LSE than Deutsche Boerse, is likely to wait until after the Germans bid, one of the people said.CME Group is also working with advisors to assess whether it could challenge the deal, people familiar with the matter said last week.Representatives for ICE and LSE declined to comment. An official for Deutsche Boerse didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

389,ICE,"An information-rich world should make us smarter. Sometimes the deluge just muddies thinking. How to be savvy with numbers:Discern. Big Data might be a business buzzword, “but it’s actually the little data that affects and influences our lives,” said John H. Johnson.He’s a Ph.D. in econometrics, which applies statistical and mathematical theory to economics.Johnson and journalist Mike Gluck wrote “Everydata: The Misinformation Hidden in the Little Data You Consume Every Day.”Consumers should pause to consider how figures are tallied before letting numbers guide an opinion or action.“Just look at it with a critical eye,” Johnson told IBD.Dig. Cherry-picking means choosing the most favorable data, and ignoring the rest, to make a point.In 1996, Gerber made the claim that 4 out of 5 pediatricians who recommend baby food recommend Gerber.Delving into the survey revealed that Gerber asked 562 pediatricians; 408 recommended baby food, 76 recommended a specific brand, and 67 recommended Gerber.The 4-out-of-5 figure came from those last two numbers.“Looking at the fine print matters a lot,” Johnson said.Assess. Does a study of 300 lawyers speak for the 1.3 million lawyers in America?That’s a small portion, called a sample. It’s used to draw conclusions about the whole.Stop to consider if the sample is representative of the group.“The people who respond (to polls) have time or an interest in the topic or a position,” Johnson said. “It could be who’s home for phone surveys. Often, that’s the elderly.”Scientists would weigh how the sample was selected and how often the result could be repeated.Weigh. Survey takers are often asked to self-report facts, such as how many hours they sleep each night.“People are notoriously bad at estimating things,” Johnson said. “That starts to degrade the quality of the information.”Differentiate. Studies sometimes tie one act to another -- such as drinking coffee and acquiring cancer.There’s a difference between correlation and causation.“We can find lots of relationships between two variables,” said Johnson. That’s correlation.“Is there a cause and effect that truly links those two things?” he asked. That’s causation.Ice cream sales and crime rates correlate because both increase during the summer.That’s different from saying that ice cream causes crime or vice versa. “Isolating causality is really hard work,” he said.Decode. Graphs provide a quick visual to indicate trends. Before drawing a conclusion, check the basics.Look at the X and Y axis. Does it run from 0 to 100 or 45 to 55? Do the numbers go up or down?Adjusting the scale or height of the axes can change the story.De-categorize. There’s a notion that celebrity deaths happen in threes. One source is the passing of Michael Jackson, Farrah Fawcett and Ed McMahon over the span of three days in 2009.But a few days later, commercial pitchman Billy Mays died.That raises the question: “What is my definition of celebrity?” Johnson said.Beware the temptation to make trends out of arbitrary incidents. “The plural of anecdote is not data,” Johnson said.Scrutinize. When faced with numbers, take a moment to exercise your skeptic’s muscle.“Every statistical finding can be viewed through a lens of: 'Does it make sense or not?’ ” Johnson said. “This is when people’s intuition can really help them.”

390,ICE,"Science: To listen to the climate change alarmist community, one would think that Earth has never been so warm as it is now. But it's been warmer, and sea levels have been higher, facts that the leader of the movement acknowledges.James Hansen, the famed NASA scientist who stirred the climate scare when in 1988 he told a Senate committee that ""global warming"" -- yes, he used those words -- ""is already happening now,"" has never backed off his claims, despite the fact that he's been demonstrably wrong. No one this side of Al Gore has had a larger impact on trafficking in fear and trying so hard to sow panic.The narrative since that day in 1988 is that Earth is entering a dangerous warm era created by man's carbon dioxide emissions. Every heat wave, cold snap, drought, hurricane, heavy snow, torrential rain, and change in sea level has been supposedly caused by man. And all are allegedly unprecedented events.Except they're not. It's been warmer, and extreme weather has visited us before, all in a time long before man began to drive cars and operate power plants that helped move him from an almost primitive existence to a modern one.Hansen has even admitted this.""The last interglacial period, 120,000 years ago, that's the last time it was warmer than today, sea level was 6 to 9 meters higher,"" he said in an interview with online magazine Yale Environment 360.So it has been warmer, and sea levels have been higher. And those conditions were entirely natural. Yet the alarmists want us to believe that the predicted warmth of today -- which has yet to occur -- is man-caused. How do they know? And why do they never mention that we are leaving the Little Ice Age and entering another interglacial period, an era that should be warmer as we gain distance from the cold period?The Watts Up With That blog points out another hole in the narrative: While implying that we're headed for another 6-to-9-meters increase in sea level in the coming -- or just-arrived -- interglacial period, ""Hansen failed to say"" that ""paleoclimatological studies have indicated that it took a number of millennia for sea levels to rise those 6 to 9 meters when temperatures were warmer than today.""Yet we've been told until the alarmists have no more hot air to exhale that we are running out of time to act, and maybe already have.The Hansens of our world will never give in, though. He told  Yale Environment 360 that ""we conclude ... that the timescale for ice-sheet disintegration is probably a lot shorter than has been assumed in the intergovernmental discussions.""Watts Up With That blogger Bob Tisdale says nuts to that: ""Even proponents of the hypothesis of human-induced global warming found the recent Hansen study (Ice melt, sea-level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2°C global warming could be dangerous) to be nonsense. Even the title of the paper includes the oft-used weasel words 'could be.' ""Meanwhile, Anthony Watts himself says that Hansen ""seems interested in promoting alarmism at all costs. There’s been a whiff of this throughout his entire career, but this latest paper is just too much to take seriously.""Perhaps the best analysis, though, is from science blogger David Appell, who says that the canonization of the Hansen study is just more barnyard droppings, and the paper itself ""goes out on a limb that the science can't necessarily support.""Hansen has been out on that skinny limb for almost 30 years, and it keeps breaking. He just hopes no one is noticing the duct tape and paper clips he's rigged up to hide the damage.

Inventories declined by 3 million barrels last week in the U.S., according to a Bloomberg survey before a report from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) is repairing a key pipeline in Nigeria under very tight security, according to a person familiar with the operations. Earlier reports said work wasn’t proceeding on the link.Crude has surged about 90% from a 12-year low in February amid unexpected disruptions and a continuous slide in U.S. output, which is under pressure from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ policy of pumping without limits. Saudi Arabia will maintain the same level of production capacity until 2020 under a new economic reform plan approved by the government to reduce its reliance on oil.""The path of least resistance for crude is still higher and outages in Nigeria and expectations of strong EIA data tomorrow are helping the trend,"" said Clayton Rogers, an energy derivative broker at SCS Commodities in New Jersey. ""I think the real story is just how range-bound this market is.""WTI for July delivery rose 67 cents to close at $50.36 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Earlier, Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry said the company had to withdraw repair crews last week after a second attack against the 48-inch export pipeline that links onshore storage tanks with an offshore port.Gasoline futures fell amid speculation that demand for the fuel won’t meet expectations. U.S. refiners typically increase utilization this time of year after finishing maintenance as the peak-demand driving season commences. Consumption during the second and third quarters this year will average a record 9.5 million barrels a day, up from 9.48 million forecast in May, the EIA said in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook released Tuesday.""The one bearish blot out there is gasoline,"" O’Grady said. ""Refineries were expected to run at about 95% of capacity to make gasoline, which would lead to further crude inventory declines. This might have been overoptimistic.""July gasoline futures slipped 0.1% to $1.5871 a gallon, the lowest close since May 12. While the July contract declined, those for other months rose. The market is in contango, when prices for delivery today are lower than those in future months, which may signal weak near-term demand or rising supply.

394,ICE,"A battle for the bigger exchange appeared to escalate between the U.S. and the EU on Tuesday after NYSE owner Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and CME Group (CME) expressed interest in acquiring the London Stock Exchange Group.The bids under consideration would risk sabotaging Germany-based exchange operator Deutsche Boerse's plans to form a ""merger of equals"" with the London Stock Exchange Group.That deal, if it happened, would create an organization that would oversee a massive swath of the Continent's trading and cap years of wrangling for dominance between Deutsche Boerse and the LSE. It would also come at the end of a trail of failed attempts by many others to take over the London exchange.Intercontinental Exchange said, in a statement responding to media speculation, that it was ""considering making an offer for LSEG"" but has made no decision on the matter and hasn't approached the London group. ICE has until March 29 to announce its decision.CME, which deals in the huge derivatives market, was also mulling an offer, the Wall Street Journal reported. CME runs four exchanges, including the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.Shares of CME closed up 1.2% in the stock market today. Intercontinental Exchange fell 2.7%.Both ICE and CME stand to lose out if a deal goes through between the two European companies.The Wall Street Journal noted that a merger could give the NYSE and Nasdaq a run for their money, while the Financial Times said that a deal could shunt CME Group to the sidelines in Europe.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Crude supplies fell 4.94 million barrels last week, Energy Information Administration data show. A 2.85 million barrel gain was projected in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Refineries processed the most crude in three months as output and imports slipped. Diesel led gains after the report showed stockpiles of distillate fuel, which includes diesel and heating oil, tumbled on the East Coast.""This is a welcome number,"" said Scott Roberts, portfolio manager and co-head of high yield who manages $2.7 billion at Invesco Advisers Inc. in Atlanta. ""It’s always good to see a crude draw in April.""Prices also advanced after Kuwait said a deal to freeze output can be reached without Iran. Major producers have no option but to reach an agreement to cap production when they meet April 17 in Doha and this may set a price floor, Nawal al-Fezaia, Kuwait’s governor to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said Tuesday. Oil has swung between gains and losses since Friday amid speculation about whether an agreement can be reached at the meeting.West Texas intermediate for May delivery increased $1.86, or 5.2%, to settle at $37.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 0.5% Tuesday after falling 6.9% the previous two sessions. Total volume traded was 30% higher than the 100-day average.Brent for June settlement climbed $1.97, or 5.2%, to $39.84 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The front-month contract’s discount to the second month narrowed to 16 cents, the least since January, while the spread to the one-year contract slipped to the narrowest since July.U.S. crude stockpiles dropped to 529. 9 million in the week ended April 1, the EIA data show. Inventories climbed 32.9 million barrels to 534.8 million, the highest since 1930, in the prior seven weeks.

397,ICE,"Oil rose to a seven-month high in London after a U.S. crude supply decline tempered the impact of OPEC’s failure to reach an agreement for a new production ceiling.Brent closed above $50 a barrel for the first time since Nov. 3. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, had previously discussed restoring an output target scrapped in December, delegates familiar with the matter said. U.S. crude stockpiles dropped for the third time in four weeks, according to a government report.""There was no action, no surprise,"" Michael Wittner, the New York-based head of oil-market research at Societe Generale SA, said of the OPEC meeting. ""It was interesting to see that the Saudis were willing to talk about an overall ceiling, but Iran stuck to its party line and nothing came of it. The overall result is that things will be unchanged.""Oil has surged more than 85% in New York from a 12-year low earlier this year amid signs that global supply, especially U.S. shale production, is under pressure from OPEC’s strategy of sustaining production amid a glut. Prices also advanced because of disruptions to output in Canada, Nigeria and Libya.Brent for August settlement rose 32 cents to close at $50.04 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Total volume traded was 22% below the 100-day average at 3:04 p.m.West Texas intermediate for July delivery rose 16 cents to settle at $49.17 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices earlier dropped as much as $1.04 to $47.97. The August WTI contract closed at a 38-cent discount to Brent.U.S. crude stockpiles dropped 1.37 million barrels to 535.7 million last week, an Energy Information Administration report showed Thursday. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported that supplies climbed 2.35 million barrels. Inventories climbed to 543.4 million barrels in the week ended April 29, the highest since 1929.""The reaction to the inventory data just shows the market’s ability to react to the latest headline rather than giving them timely, even-handed thought,"" said Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.This marked the first OPEC meeting since Khalid Al-Falih became Saudi Arabia’s oil minister. Al-Falih is close to the kingdom’s powerful Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose plan to partly privatize the state oil company has sparked speculation it may further expand production capacity and market share, severing its ties to OPEC.""It was important because it was Khalid’s first meeting,"" said Michael D. Cohen, an analyst at Barclays Plc in New York. ""It’s more of the same from OPEC. They are setting it up where it’s shale output that will have to moderate prices in the short term.""While Saudi Arabia had shown willingness to mend divisions Thursday with cash-strapped members demanding a new group ceiling, Iran said it would only support individual country quotas that would be difficult to agree to in a single meeting.Iran has rejected any cap on production as it restores output following the removal of sanctions in January. The country’s refusal to participate in a production freeze proposed earlier this year prompted Saudi Arabia to block a deal between OPEC and Russia at a meeting in Doha in April.""Gulf producers continue to indicate desire for collaboration, but Iran’s position prevents agreement,"" said Sarah Emerson, managing director of ESAI Energy, a consulting company in Wakefield, Mass. ""The time is just not right yet. It will be at some point.""

398,ICE,"Starbucks (SBUX) is adding new chilly drinks to its menu as the coffee titan looks to expand its cold-java market share in the U.S.Last year's introduction of ""cold brew"" coffee made a big enough splash for Starbucks to notice. Its iced portfolio grew 20% in the fourth quarter, ended Sept. 27, following the introduction of cold brew earlier in 2015, said the company in Tuesday's release. Also, nitro cold brew -- made with nitrogen -- is the No. 2-selling drink at the company's artisanal roastery and tasting room in Seattle.While cold brew still accounts for only 0.4% of 2015 ready-to-drink coffee sales industrywide, retail sales of the product shot up an estimated 115% in 2015 from the year prior, according to a Mintel report from late last year.Unlike iced coffee, which is essentially hot-brewed coffee plus ice, cold brew coffee is steeped in room-temperature water for hours. According to UCLA's ""Science and Food"" blog, cold brew is smoother and sweeter than its hot-brewed brethren. Starbucks says its cold brew coffee is slow-steeped for 20 hours.Besides cold brew and regular iced coffee, the global chain's new ""cold bar"" includes cold brew with vanilla sweet cream, Doubleshot on ice and caramel iced macchiato. Nitro cold brew is getting a rollout in major metropolitan markets later in the summer, including Seattle, Portland, New York, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco.Management indicated in its most recent earnings call that cold drinks have been selling well.""In addition to our hot beverage lineup, our expanded iced beverage business is resonating with customers.,"" said Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson in late April's call, following the release of second-quarter results.Shares closed down 0.5% Tuesday as the stock continues to consolidate. The coffee giant broke support at its 50-day and 200-day lines in late April after a rare expectations miss; shares have yet to retake both key levels.Peer Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) shares lost 0.8%.

399,ICE,"Oil closed near $49 a barrel in New York as OPEC delegates said the group would be discussing the reintroduction of output ceilings at Thursday’s meeting in Vienna.West Texas Intermediate was little changed after rising 6.9% in May as supply was curbed by wildfires in Alberta and militant attacks in Nigeria. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is considering a production cap along with other proposals, and any deal would be signal of group unity but unlikely to affect actual production, delegates said.""Nobody thought they would do anything this week, so the introduction of a target is a big deal,"" said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. ""The introduction of a quota would be the first time in a year and a half that they have done anything that hints at production restraint.""Oil in New York has surged about 85% since touching the lowest level since May 2003 in February on signs the global surplus is easing. OPEC will probably stick to its policy of  squeezing out rivals by maintaining production as the price rally helps justify the group’s strategy, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.WTI crude for July delivery declined 9 cents to close at $49.01 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures briefly topped $50 Tuesday for the second time this year. Total volume traded was 13% below the 100-day average at 2:56 p.m.Brent for August settlement dropped 17 cents to $49.72 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The July contract expired Tuesday after slipping 7 cents to $49.69. The global benchmark crude closed at a 23-cent premium to WTI for August delivery.Saudi Arabia will use this week’s meeting to repair relationships with fellow producers after the failure of an April accord to freeze crude output in Doha, according to the people familiar with the matter. The kingdom’s Minister of Energy Khalid Al-Falih will reassure other members his nation won’t flood the oil market, the people said.The global oversupply that sent prices tumbling in 2014 and 2015 is correcting itself, United Arab Emirates Oil Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei said Tuesday after arriving in Vienna. ""The market will fix itself to a price that is fair,"" he said. Nigeria’s minister of state for petroleum resources, Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, also said prices are moving ""in the right direction.""""I would call it a victory lap,"" Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. OPEC ""successfully engineered a market that rebalanced on its own.""Forecasters including the International Energy Agency and Goldman Sachs agree that the crude glut is starting to dwindle as the Saudi-led approach of pressuring high-cost suppliers finally pays off. There are still signs of division within OPEC, with Venezuelan Energy Minister Eulogio Del Pino saying Wednesday the price recovery has had more to do with unexpected outages than a successful OPEC strategy.""Near term, the market should trade in the $45-to-$50 range but as we move toward the end of the year, the market should soften again,"" Currie said. The market will stay in this range due to the ""temporary disruptions that have driven the market into a deficit.""

400,ICE,"Oil capped the longest run of monthly gains in five years as a spate of disruptions curb supply before OPEC meets Thursday to discuss production policy.Futures slipped Tuesday, trimming a fourth consecutive monthly advance, as Canadian producers start to resume operations after wildfires eased. Militant attacks have cut Nigerian supply to the lowest level in more than two decades. Libya’s Petroleum Facilities Guard captured towns near the oil ports of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf after clashes with Islamic State militants.""Canadian production should come back quickly,"" said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass. ""I wonder what it will take to continue this rally above $50, especially given that we have near-record global inventories. The rally was in large part due to production disruptions and at least some are easing.""Oil has surged more than 85% since touching a 12-year low in February on signs that the global surplus is easing amid declining output. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is unlikely to reach an agreement this week in Vienna limiting production, as the group sticks with Saudi Arabia’s strategy of squeezing out rivals, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.West Texas Intermediate for July delivery fell 23 cents to close at $49.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract briefly topped $50 for the second time this year. Prices rose 6.9% in May for the longest run of monthly gains since April 2011. Total volume traded was 32% below the 100-day average at 2:53 p.m.There was no settlement on the Nymex on Monday because of the U.S. Memorial Day holiday. Trades were booked Tuesday for settlement purposes.In terms of technical analysis, the relative strength index for WTI started the session above the 70-point threshold that shows prices may have risen too quickly. It slipped below 70 as the market moved lower in late trading.""The relative strength index is chopping around 70 since May 24, which suggests that the rally is overdone,"" said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York.Brent for July settlement, which expired Tuesday, slipped 7 cents to $49.69 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Prices capped a fourth monthly increase, also the longest streak since 2011. The global benchmark closed at a 59-cent premium to WTI. The more-active August contract declined 47 cents to $49.89.The Niger Delta Avengers claimed responsibility for attacks on facilities belonging to companies including Chevron (CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Agip Oil, causing Nigerian output to tumble.

401,ICE,"The Treasury Department may have squelched drug giant Pfizer’s (PFE) bid to take over Ireland-based Allergan (AGN), but ETF investors needn't fear.The new federal rules don't ice over the broader merger market, says Sal Bruno, chief investment officer of IndexIQ, the firm behind the largest merger-focused ETF.The $160 billion Pfizer-Allergan merger deal was widely seen as another attempt by a large U.S. company to move its legal domicile overseas and avoid America's steep corporate tax rates. The new rules make these so-called corporate inversions more difficult and potentially less profitable.However, ""tax inversion deals make up a small percentage of the total merger market,"" Bruno said. Most merger deals focus on opportunities for synergies and growth, he added.The Pfizer-Allergan kibosh hurts the merger industry from an ""optics standpoint,"" according to Bruno. Tactics to dodge corporate taxes have come in for flak recently from President Barack Obama and presidential candidates on both sides of the political divide.IQ Merger Arbitrage (MNA) dumped 1.4% Tuesday following the news and extended losses on the stock market today.This exchange traded fund invests in global companies that are targets of publicly announced takeovers. It rebalances monthly and uses a liquidity-based weighting method.Allergan is a top five stock holding in this exchange traded fund, with a 7% portfolio weighting.MNA has coasted along with far less volatility than the benchmark S&P 500 in the past year. Its 2.8% gain in the first quarter came in a very volatile period for the equity market.That performance helped to cushion Tuesday's blow.MNA was still up 1.35% for the year through April 5. By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) has added 0.67%.The challenges for merger ETFs extend beyond the Pfizer-Allergan debacle.The Obama administration has taken a more aggressive stance on big mergers. It's suing to block the $35 billion merger of oil majors Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI). Staples’ (SPLS) bid for rival office supplier Office Depot (ODP) is also under scrutiny.Even more worrisome, deal activity is showing signs of cooling off after a record year for M&A in 2015.The U.S. recorded 1,007 deals cumulatively worth $241.5 billion in the first quarter, down 33% from 1,250 deals worth $361.3 billion in Q1 2015, according to intelligence service Mergermarket.Bruno believes the pace of M&A will remain brisk for the near future.Interest rates remain low, making it easier to borrow money to buy other companies. In a low-growth climate, acquisitions can add growth if a company can't generate growth on its own. And corporate balance sheets and cash flows are healthier than they have been in decades.""There's ample deal flow out there,"" Bruno said. ""We have a very positive outlook for merger-arbitrage as a whole.""Most challenging of all, perhaps, ETF investors continue to be wary of more niche products.MNA falls into the ""liquid alternative"" fund category: it aims to diversify a portfolio made up mostly of stocks and bonds. It's a category that hasn't grown tremendously in the ETF space, Bruno said.MNA debuted in 2009 and holds $127.7 million in assets. ProShares Merger (MRGR) launched in 2012 and holds $8.2 million.Despite the proliferation of thematic new products, plain-vanilla ETFs are dominant.""Investors will continue to focus most of their time and attention, as they well should, on very low-cost, broad, very well-diversified market exposures,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, said in a recent interview.However, Bruno expects liquid-alt ETFs to take off as people get more comfortable with their diversification benefits.""We will see growth going forward,"" he said.

402,ICE,"Oil advanced on speculation that a pact to freeze crude output may be reached without the participation of Iran.Futures rose from a one-month low. Oil-producing countries can come to an agreement capping crude production at January levels, even if Iran doesn’t join the move to help shore up prices, according to Kuwait’s OPEC governor. The dollar dropped to the lowest level against the yen in more than a year, bolstering the appeal of commodities priced in the U.S. currency. A government report Wednesday is projected to show that U.S. crude supplies climbed.West Texas Intermediate crude oil for May delivery increased 19 cents, or 0.5%, to settle at $35.89 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures touched $35.24, the lowest since March 4. Total volume traded was 19% below the 100-day average at 3:12 p.m.Brent North Sea crude for June settlement rose 18 cents, or 0.5%, to $37.87 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It earlier touched $37.27, also the lowest since March 4. The global benchmark closed at a 73-cent premium to WTI for June delivery.""The market has been under tremendous selling pressure,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. ""We’ve been watching the wheels come off of the plans for a freeze at the April 17 meeting. We’ll probably get another inventory build as well.""Oil’s rebound from a 12-year low has stalled amid doubts about the prospects of a proposed deal to freeze supply. Saudi Arabia will only cap production if it’s joined by other major producers including Iran, the kingdom’s deputy crown prince said last week. Russia and all OPEC members except Libya will attend the meeting in Doha.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers have no option but to reach an agreement to freeze output at the meeting in Doha, because prices are too low, Nawal al-Fezaia, Kuwait’s OPEC governor, said in a telephone interview.Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said he will attend the summit if he finds time, according to the country’s semi-official Mehr News Agency. The nation has refused any limits on crude supply as it restores oil exports after international sanctions were lifted in January.""There’s a growing realization that all of these statements are pre-meeting positioning,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. ""I wouldn’t read too much into them. It looks like the meeting will take place, and if it occurs there’s a good chance an agreement will be reached.""U.S. crude supplies rose by 2.85 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey before an Energy Information Administration report Wednesday. That gain would leave stockpiles at the highest level in more than eight decades. Gasoline stockpiles probably fell by 1.1 million barrels last week, according to the survey.U.S. demand for finished gasoline in January fell to 8.7 million barrels a day, the first year-on-year decline since November 2014, according to data from the EIA’s Petroleum Supply Monthly report. Distillate fuel demand had the biggest year-on-year decline since October 2009.
"
403,ICE,"The idea of American exceptionalism has been embedded in our collective DNA for generations. It is the faith-based belief that, as Ronald Reagan put it, America is a ""shining city on a hill.""Do modern liberals believe that?I almost never try to get into the other side's head or ascribe ill motives to those on the left. They are, I've always believed, misguided, not malign.But I'm having second thoughts after listening to Barack Obama's defense of communism/socialism when he was in Argentina. He advised young people to get behind ""what works"" economically -- as if there is some deep mystery here.Obama didn't misspeak. The modern left in America really has come to believe that communism, socialism, Marxism and totalitarianism -- or other terms for the monopolization of power into the hands of a ruling elite -- are superior to free-market capitalism.The president of the United States is supposed to be the global spokesman for free enterprise. But, instead of traveling to Cuba to point out to the world the decades of stagnation, deprivation and dehumanization at the hands of the Castros, and instead of using this moment in history to showcase the triumph of capitalism 90 miles away, Obama praises Cuba's health care and education systems.He might as well have been praising Mussolini for making the trains run on time. Even more unbelievable: The media applauded.How far the Democratic Party has fallen. Can anyone imagine Obama, Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders having the gumption or wisdom to tell Mikhail Gorbachev to ""tear down this wall""?It wasn't so long ago that leading Democrats -- JFK, Harry Truman and even the AFL CIO -- were staunch enemies of communism. Today, there is no place for such beliefs within the progressive Democratic Party. If it involves ceding power to the state, the left is all for it -- as evidenced by the rise of Bernie Sanders.But for every action, there is a reaction, and the left's lunacy has given momentum to the tumultuous uprising on the right this year. Millions of voters who support Donald Trump want our government to put America first and focus on our own mounting problems at home, then worry about Europe, Israel, the melting ice caps, AIDS in Africa and so on. If your house is burning down, you put out that fire and save your own children trapped on the second floor, before you go down the street and put the fire out at your neighbors' house.Here's just one observational data point that, admittedly, is anecdotal but speaks volumes about the left-right divide in America. At a typical Donald Trump or Ted Cruz rally, you will see American flags waving everywhere. These are patriotic gatherings. At Sanders events, you will see some flags, but not many -- because if you are a leftist, it's not cool to love America. What is much cooler is wearing a Che Guevera T-shirt.At a Republican rally, you typically meet many veterans who served our country with honor and valor. Some who protest at Trump rallies detest those who are wearing military uniforms and call them fascists and give the Nazi salute. I've seen it happen. I want to grab these brats and shout at them like Jack Nicholson did in ""A Few Good Men"": ""I would rather you just said 'thank you' and went on your way.""Trump voters see America losing both the economic and cultural wars vital to national survival. We have a $19 trillion national debt that has doubled in the past decade. We have wages flat or falling for most Americans. We have a political class that is actively trying to destroy whole industries -- coal production, oil and gas, community banks and so many others.We have a president (along with the intellectual class) pushing a radical climate change agenda that will cost the middle class millions of jobs, but won't change the global temperature by a hundredth of a degree. Trade deals seem to be drafted to benefit foreign workers and businesses over our own. America pays far more than its share for programs like the United Nations and NATO. Our public schools put teachers first, not kids, and they often don't adequately educate.We have courts overturning the will of the people in state after state on issues such as gay marriage. We have speech police. We have illegal immigrants who work here and live here and then wave the Mexican flag at rallies, as if to be intentionally offensive. (And I'm in favor of immigration.) Then they wonder why Americans want a wall.We have the TSA searching the underwear of infants but letting certain adults pass through without inspection because we wouldn't want to be accused of profiling. We have a Justice Department thinking about prosecuting people for questioning the climate change ""consensus.""This is the same crowd that seems to prefer the economic systems in Sweden and Greece and Cuba over America's. They preach human rights, but they don't seem to understand that economic freedom is a core human right.

404,ICE,"Oil dropped to a one-month low after Saudi Arabia’s deputy crown prince said his country will freeze output only if Iran follows suit, putting in doubt the prospects of a proposed deal to freeze supply.Futures slipped 3% in New York. Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman signaled in an interview with Bloomberg last week that if any country raises output, his nation will also increase sales. Producers are scheduled to meet this month to discuss an agreement on capping supplies. Iran’s oil minister said he’ll attend the gathering if he finds the time. Russian oil production reached a post-Soviet high in March.""The concept on an OPEC, non-OPEC cut or freeze is a joke,"" said Stephen Schork, president of the Schork Group in Villanova, Pa. ""The Saudis aren’t about to do anything when the Iranians continue to increase production. The Russians just announced that they’re pumping at a post-Soviet high, and they’re the ones that have been jawboning the most.""The Saudi comments have halted a rally of more than 40% in oil since mid-January. Investors have this year speculated that waning production in the U.S. would ease a glut as Saudi Arabia, Russia and others moved to cap output. Iran’s determination to increase its sales to pre-sanctions levels and the Saudis’ insistence that Iran join the freeze have put that plan in doubt.West Texas intermediate for May delivery fell $1.09 to close at $35.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It’s the lowest settlement since March 3.Brent for June settlement dropped 98 cents, or 2.5% to $37.69 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Futures ended the session at the lowest level since March 3. The global benchmark crude closed at a 66-cent premium to WTI for June delivery.Oil-producing countries are discussing a draft resolution for the Doha meeting, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters in Novokuznetsk, Russia. The meeting may lead to a decision on tools to monitor output levels, he said.The Saudi conditions ""effectively put the nail in the coffin"" on the recent price rally, BNP Paribas analysts Gareth Lewis-Davies and Harry Tchilinguirian said in an emailed note Monday. Crude prices could easily revisit the lows of the year, they said in the note.""The discipline and unity needed for a freeze is missing,"" said Gene McGillian, a senior analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn. ""Russian production in March rose to a new post-Soviet record, Iranian exports appear to be rising and the Saudis poured cold water on the idea of a freeze last week. This is not a picture that supports $40 oil.""Rigs targeting crude in the U.S. fell to 362 last week, the least since November 2009, Baker Hughes said Friday. More than 1,100 oil rigs have been parked since the start of last year as slumping prices make it uneconomical to drill. Production fell by 16,000 barrels a day to 9.02 million in the week ended March 25, the least since 2014, Energy Information Administration data show.“The market will be focusing in the short term on Saudi Arabia’s stance on capping production and Russia’s production at a new post-Soviet-era high,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. “Further down the line, the continued fall in U.S. rigs and production combined with the seasonal slowdown in inventories will add support come May.”U.S. crude inventories probably rose 3 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey conducted before an EIA report Wednesday. That would leave stockpiles at 537.8 million, the most since 1930.TransCanada (TRP) shut two segments of its Keystone pipeline after oil was found on the surface in South Dakota, company spokesman Mark Cooper said in an email. The segments were closed Saturday and will remain offline while the company finishes cleanup efforts. Keystone connects Alberta to U.S. refineries and the Gulf Coast.Oil markets will probably balance by the end of next year, with prices rising in the medium term, according to Sultan Al Jaber, the new head of Abu Dhabi National Oil said in an interview with Abu Dhabi dailies The National and Al Ittihad.  Kazakhstan has made claims of about $1.6 billion against an Eni and Royal Dutch Shell ([RDSA)]-led group developing the nation’s second-largest oil and natural gas field. The claims, relating to a dispute over “cost recovery” at the Karachaganak field, are being negotiated and the matter hasn’t gone to court, Russia’s Lukoil (LUKOY), a partner in the project, said in a statement Monday.

His idea was to develop a more transparent and efficient electronic market for over-the-counter energy trades.Three years later, Sprecher and energy-trading partners converted Continental into ICE, and the company has made a number of acquisitions since then, including the New York Board of Trade in 2007, Creditex in 2008, the Clearing Corporation in 2009, NYSE Euronext in November 2013 and the Singapore Mercantile Exchange in 2014.In December, Sprecher rolled the dice again when he acquired Interactive Data Corp., a top provider of financial data and analytics, in a $5.2 billion cash-and-stock deal. The purchase from private-equity firms Silver Lake and Warburg Pincus is part of an effort to tap into a strong growth opportunity, the company says. IDC serves the mutual fund, bank, asset management, hedge fund, securities, and financial instrument processing and administration sectors.“It's the increasing need for more information to optimize capital efficiency when you manage risk,” Sprecher said on the company's third-quarter conference call.  ""And as bank balance sheets have become constrained and as regulation requires collateral for all risk positions, we believe that there will be increasing demand for the data, information and solutions as to the cost of holding, hedging and managing risk.”Acquisitions have helped ICE log steady double-digit earnings growth and strong revenue gains. It has grown from operating an energy swaps market into a global powerhouse operating a network of 11 global exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange.ICE’s exchanges include equity and equity options exchanges, as well as futures exchanges that establish benchmark prices for interest rates, equity indexes, energy, metals and agricultural commodities. ICE also operates seven central clearing houses.Roughly 70% of IDC’s revenue comes from providing evaluated pricing of “hard-to-value, thinly traded” fixed-income securities, with the other 30% from widely distributed data and technology platforms, the company says.""Historically, energy volume from the trading business has been the core of the business,” Jefferies analyst Daniel Fannon told Investor's Business Daily. “The business has increasingly become more diverse via acquisitions and organic growth. Last year it had growth on the nontransactional side of the business. The recent acquisition of International Data Corp. gave them more exposure to data, and should help that growth going forward.""Rob Rutschow analyst for Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia told IBD: “One of the aspects of the IDC acquisition that’s nice is it has a fairly (large) recurring revenue stream, which has lower volatility than its traditional trading business. (With IDC) ICE has the opportunity to try to take share from some of the large incumbents in the (financial data services) market.”He says ICE is a smaller competitor in the market when compared to Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters (TRI) and FactSet Research Systems (FDS).“There is an opportunity for ICE to take market share,” Rutschow adds. “ICE can expand IDC’s reach and scope with their base and proprietary data and scope.”Still, Rutschow says there are probably more risks to the IDC deal “than meets the eye.”“I think the risk is they had bad timing, given IDC is fixed-income oriented and we’re starting to see big banks reduce their head counts in their fixed-income business,” he said. “I see a potential risk in the fixed-income market data business in general.”ICE expects the IDC acquisition will be more than 5% accretive to full-year 2016 earnings.Prior to the buy, ICE’s data business spanned nine asset classes across the 11 exchanges and seven clearing houses it operates. It offers benchmark and valuation services for Libor, exchange-traded funds and a range of financial derivatives.“ICE had data (services) before the IDC deal, when they acquired the New York Stock Exchange,” said Fannon. “They are now focused on (data services) as a channel of new growth. They’re looking at ways to package the various data services in a more unified way to their customers. As markets become more fragmented and globalized, the need (for data) by customers on the trading side trading is increasing.”Jefferies' Fannon adds that the IDC acquisition is “rather significant” because it gets ICE into the fixed-income market in a “significant way” and it is similar to other aspects of its business.ICE also acquired Trayport from BGC Partners (BGCP) and GFI Group for approximately $650 million in December. Trayport licenses its technology platform to serve brokers for electronic and hybrid trade execution,  primarily in the European over-the-counter utility markets.Rutschow says acquisitions helped drive revenue and earnings higher year over year in the third quarter. For that period, ICE’s adjusted earnings rose 24% to $2.91 a share and revenue rose 10% to $816 million.He estimates overall transaction and trading-related revenue was flat in 2015. Rutschow expects that market data services, now around 25% of ICE’s business, will increase to 40% of the business. He estimates that its legacy energy trading business accounts for around 25% of ICE’s business and the rest of the trading business is also around 25%.ICE will report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 4 before the opening bell.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect fourth-quarter adjusted earnings to rise 16% to $3.01 a share. They see full-year 2015 earnings rising 23% to $11.86.“Fourth-quarter trading activity has been good, and generally it was a good quarter from a volume perspective,” said Fannon.Rutschow’s outlook is mixed.“On a longer-term cyclical basis there are a lot of headwinds over the next several years, including low prices for commodities,” he said.

408,ICE,"If you have a retirement fund or pension, or you're a taxpayer, get ready to have your pockets picked.The Obama administration wants Congress to enact a bankruptcy plan for Puerto Rico, forcing holders of Puerto Rican debt (including New York City pension funds) to settle for less than they're owed.Puerto Rico is over $70 billion in debt and already defaulting. House Speaker Paul Ryan has promised action by March 31, and the Supreme Court took up the issue on Tuesday.Federal law bars Puerto Rico from going bankrupt. If Congress rewrites the rules now retroactively, it will jolt municipal bond markets. Jittery lenders will demand higher interest from states and cities that need to borrow, whacking taxpayers who foot the bill.Bankruptcy's not the answer. Congress needs to show Puerto Rico some tough love by imposing a financial control board that will curb the island's profligate spending and cut its bloated government payroll.Puerto Rico's pols have flunked civics. The island is mired in cronyism and corruption. Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., calls a control board a ""colonial power grab."" Nonsense. A control board turned around New York City in the 1970s and the District of Columbia in the 1990s without resorting to bankruptcy.Allowing the island to weasel out of its debts will encourage more irresponsibility. Last Christmas, the island's governor doled out $120 million in bonuses to employees, just before defaulting on millions in debt. The island is a socialist paradise where only 40% of adults work, but those who do are guaranteed paid vacations and other perks.Puerto Rico's publicly owned utility is $9 billion in debt but still provides free electricity to 78 municipalities, keeping local pols happy, and even powers an ice skating rink in the tropical heat. Yet on Tuesday, the utility pleaded with the Supreme Court justices to be allowed to stiff its creditors.Predictably, the Obama administration supports Puerto Rico's efforts to default, telling Ryan that a bankruptcy would ""cost taxpayers nothing."" If you believe that, I have some Puerto Rican bonds to sell you.Even liberals like New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer and Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. blasted Obama's proposal, saying that it would hurt the value of the city's pensions and ""by extension the retirement security of New York City workers."" Ditto for retirees and investors nationwide.Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., warns against Obama's plan. Investors will realize that if Congress can erase Puerto Rico's debt, ""they can do that for California and Illinois and New York,"" leading to a ""rapid escalation of borrowing costs for states."" And their taxpayers.On the legal front, Puerto Rico's lawless politicians didn't wait for a congressional bailout. In 2014, the debt-mired island passed its own local bankruptcy law -- now being challenged in the Supreme Court.Puerto Rico wanted to help its electric utility escape paying its debts in full. Trouble is, the U.S. Constitution and federal law prohibit it. The Constitution's framers barred local governments from passing bankruptcy laws, reserving that power for Congress alone. After all, if local politicians could rewrite the rules and erase debts, who would ever loan money?Ignoring the Constitution, Puerto Rico passed its law anyway. What chutzpah! But the utility's creditors challenged it in federal court and have won each step along the way. It's amazing that the Supreme Court is even hearing an appeal on this.Even worse, during oral arguments Tuesday Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor seemed sympathetic to this lawless act. With Justice Antonin Scalia deceased and Justice Samuel Alito recusing himself, the island has a shot at a 4-3 victory. It would be a defeat of the rule of law.In 2013, President Obama pushed Congress to avoid a national debt default, insisting, ""We're not some banana republic ... We don't run out on our tab."" Why is that behavior suddenly acceptable for Puerto Rico?McCaughey is a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research and author of ""Government by Choice: Inventing the United States Constitution.""

The supply surplus in the first half of this year is proving to be smaller than estimated, the International Energy Agency said last week, citing robust demand in India and other emerging nations. Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Bank of America joined Goldman Sachs in noting that supply losses are leading markets to rebalance.West Texas Intermediate for June delivery rose $1.51 to settle at $47.72 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the highest close since Nov. 3. Prices have climbed more than 80% from this year’s low.Brent for July settlement rose $1.14, or 2.4%, to $48.97 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contract also closed at the highest level since Nov. 3. The global benchmark crude ended the session at a 55 cent premium to July WTI.Fuel prices have surged with the gain in crude. Gasoline for June delivery climbed 1.1% to $1.063 a gallon, the highest close since August. June diesel advanced 2.6% to $1.4401, the highest since November.The gain in futures bolstered equities. Commodity companies accounted for 4 of the 7 biggest gainers on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The S&P 500 Oil & Gas Exploration and Production Index climbed as much as 3.6% before closing up 2.5%.“The physical rebalancing of the oil market has finally started,” Goldman analysts Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in the report dated May 15. “The market has likely shifted into deficit in May.”Goldman increased its WTI price forecasts for the second quarter through the fourth, while raising its full-year 2016 projection to $44.60 a barrel from $38.40. There’ll be a more gradual decline in inventories in the second half than previously estimated and a return to a production surplus in the first quarter of 2017, with low-cost output continuing to grow, the bank said.The global oil market will return to balance in the third quarter, Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of industry consultants IHS Inc., said on Bloomberg Television. Crude will probably trade around $50 in the second half of 2016, he said.The oil market “looks set on a course for rebalancing much faster than previously expected,” making the risk of a sharp price drop unlikely, Barclays analysts Miswin Mahesh and Kevin Norrish said in a report. Francisco Blanch, head of commodities research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, reiterated his forecast for U.S. prices to reach $54 in the fourth quarter as supply retreats.""There’s optimism about the direction of the market,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass., said by telephone. ""Between Nigeria, Libya and Canada, we’ve lost a substantial amount of output.""

""The $30 and $50 levels are more important in terms of investment decisions.""The Fed’s Wednesday decision to set a higher bar for when it may raise rates again also bolstered U.S. equities, which erased their losses for the year.

427,ICE,"While Apple (AAPL) has garnered the support of the tech industry and civil liberties groups for its stance on smartphone security, the issue appears to have been too complex or serious for most comedians to want to touch.Among the late-night comedians, only Seth Meyers of NBC's ""Late Night"" took aim at the subject of smartphone encryption and explained why it's important that consumers know about it.Meyers devoted a nearly seven-minute segment, called ""A Closer Look,"" of his show to examine Apple’s refusal to unlock iPhones for law enforcement officials.Of course, Meyers couldn't resist making some jokes at Apple's expense.“Apple is fighting back against critics and says it has no ‘sympathy for terrorists’ despite refusing FBI orders to unlock private iPhone data. In fact, Apple hates terrorists so much, it’s releasing a new U2 album just for them,” Meyers said.Meyers' late-night rivals devoted much more time to mocking Facebook’s (FB) new reaction buttons.What follows are recent jokes from America's late-night comics on issues of science and technology. In addition to Facebook, other targets of jokes included Amazon.com (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), Fitbit (FIT), LinkedIn (LNKD), and the humanoid robot Atlas developed by Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Boston Dynamics.Joining Meyers in on the fun were Jimmy Fallon, Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, James Corden and Stephen Colbert.Conan: In addition to the “like” button, Facebook has now added buttons for “love,” “wow,” “haha,” “sad” and “angry.” In other words, Facebook copied the emotional journey of any Adele album.Kimmel: Facebook today rolled out a new thing called “Reactions.” Now instead of “liking” when a friend’s dog passes away, which is weird, you can be much more thoughtful and sensitive, posting a sad emoji with a giant tear squirting out of its face.Corden: Facebook has launched new alternatives that go beyond its trademark “like” button. Basically Facebook is doing what I tried and failed at with so many women -- moving beyond just ""like.""Fallon: Some crazy tech news. I saw that a company in Boston built a 5-foot-9 robot that can open doors, and can actually get back up if it’s punched. They didn’t MEAN to test whether it can get up after being punched, but well, it’s Boston. (BOSTON) “Not so tough, are ya, Terminator?”Meyers: Engineers at Boston Dynamics have unveiled a humanoid robot that can withstand getting pushed in the chest with a hockey stick without falling over. Which is definitely the most Boston way to test a robot.Conan: In France, a robot has been programmed to develop its own taste in art. The robot’s favorite paintings? Naked robots.Conan: Chase bank ATMs are getting a new feature that will allow customers to withdraw cash without using a card. The feature is called “a crowbar.”Conan: A recent study found that bottlenose dolphins sometimes murder other dolphins. However, police say it’s easy to find the culprit because dolphins love to squeal.Fallon: This is a little controversial. I saw that Oral Roberts University is now telling students that wearing Fitbits is mandatory, and logging less than 10,000 steps a day will affect their grades. So finally, some good news for students doing the walk of shame. “12,000 steps -- zero regrets!”Meyers: President Obama posted on LinkedIn today about his first job -- scooping ice cream. He’s the first president to post on LinkedIn -- other than, of course, Abraham LinkedIn.Meyers: A recent study suggests that it’s harder to concentrate in the winter. Said researchers, “For example, this study was supposed to be about traffic accidents.”Colbert: You guys like the website Amazon.com? It’s like eBay, but the things you buy don’t arrive smelling like cigarettes.Colbert: Amazon’s always been on the cutting edge. From drone delivery, to automated warehouses, to shipping six AA batteries in a box the size of a mini fridge.Colbert: Amazon is planning to open hundreds of actual physical bookstores. That’s exciting because you don’t see those much anymore and I think this could be the start of a whole trend of online retailers going real-world. For example, Tinder could open a singles bar, where everybody walks around stating their height.

A proposal to freeze output by Saudi Arabia and Russia is achievable and prices may rise to as high as $50 a barrel by the end of the year, Nigerian Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu told CNBC.WTI for April delivery rose 97 cents to $33.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the highest close since Jan. 6. Prices advanced 0.4% in February, the first monthly gain since October.Brent for April settlement increased 87 cents, or 2.5%, before expiring at $35.97 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Brent closed at a $2.22 premium to WTI, after reaching an 11-week high of $2.86 on Feb. 26. The more-active May contract climbed 3.2% to $36.57.OPEC pumped an average 33.06 million barrels a day in February, according to the survey of oil companies, producers and analysts. Nigeria and Iraq led declines, while Iranian production climbed to the highest level in more than three years. January output was the highest in Bloomberg data going back 20 years.Gasoline and diesel futures also climbed as the February contracts expired. U.S. gasoline supplies fell 2.24 million barrels to 256.5 million in the week ended Feb. 19, the first decline since November, according to an Energy Information Administration report on Feb. 24. Demand rose 1.8% to 9.06 million barrels a day through Feb. 19, averaged over four weeks.March gasoline futures rose 3.3% to $1.0497 a gallon.  Diesel for March delivery advanced 2.4% to $1.076. The more-active April gasoline contract rose 2% to $1.0497, while April diesel climbed 2.5% to $1.0937.""Gasoline demand and falling crude output are behind the rally,"" said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York. ""The rally really took off last Wednesday when the gasoline storage number showed the first decline in 15 weeks. The gasoline supply drop seems to have put a bottom in the market.""U.S. crude production fell by 33,000 barrels a day to 9.1 million in the week ended Feb. 19, the lowest since October, EIA data show. Rigs targeting oil in the nation’s fields fell to 400 last week, the lowest since December 2009, Baker Hughes said on its website Feb. 26. Nationwide crude stockpiles rose 3.5 million barrels to 507.6 million, the most since 1930.""We should see another crude production cut this week, especially given the drop in the rig count,"" Yawger said. ""I don’t think we will see an output drop of 100,000 barrels, but if we do fall below 9 million barrels a day the impact will be huge.""Hedge funds and other speculators have increased net-long positions in WTI futures and options to the highest level since November, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Speculators’ net-long position in WTI rose by 13,385 contracts to 110,554 in the week ended Feb. 23. Shorts, or bets that prices will decline, slipped 6.7% while longs climbed 0.2%.Money managers increased their bullish stance on Brent crude to the highest in at least five years. Funds boosted net-longs in Brent by 35,416 contracts to 320,289 in the week to Feb. 23, according to data published Monday by ICE Futures Europe. That’s the highest since at least early 2011.

433,ICE,"Two of the biggest questions surrounding the debate about Puerto Rico’s fiscal and economic crises are whether there should be a fiscal control board to oversee a restructuring of the commonwealth’s finances, as was done previously with New York and Washington, D.C., and whether Puerto Rico should be granted access to Chapter 9 bankruptcy in order to reorganize portions of its debt.But perhaps the biggest unresolved question in this debate is whether Puerto Rico is actually insolvent or not. It has so far been unable to produce audited financials for fiscal 2014, despite numerous requests from Congress, while it has been warning of an impending ""humanitarian crisis"" if it is rebuffed.But this apocalyptic language was absent when the commonwealth was touting the bonds to investors from which it now wants relief. Thomas Moers Mayer, a representative of two of the largest groups of Puerto Rico bondholders, recently recalled at a forum at the American Enterprise Institute that, ""only two years ago the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico told investors that Puerto Rico could easily repay its debts, that it had one of the lowest ratios of debt per American citizen, because unlike other American citizens, Puerto Ricans are not responsible for the debt of the United States Treasury in that they don’t pay federal income taxes.""The Government Development Bank and members of the Puerto Rican government have been telling a different story as of late. Their 2015 ""Puerto Rico Fiscal and Economic Growth Plan,"" put out numbers that claimed that the commonwealth's debt service represents 40% of the general operating budget. That number was disputed in recent congressional testimony by Carlos Colon De Armas, a professor of finance at the University of Puerto Rico, who put the number closer to 16%, when the consolidated budget numbers and alternate revenues are added in.A 40% debt-service load could almost certainly be grounds for claiming insolvency, whereas debt loads of 20% or less have historically been repaid with relatively painless budget restraint. As Colon De Armas puts it, ""Utilizing bankruptcy when the debt service burden is 16% is equivalent to saying that 'we can pay our debts, but we'd rather not pay them.' ""This sentiment was further evidenced in a Feb. 1 New York Times article that revealed that Puerto Rico's troubled power utility, Prepa, had a long-held policy of providing free electricity to everything from baseball stadiums for night games to city-owned ice skating rinks that operate year-round on this tropical island.But, rather than get down to the business of putting its fiscal house in order, Puerto Rico’s current government has spent heavily on consultants and a lobbying effort that it hopes will gain it access to Chapter 9. As in the case of Detroit’s bankruptcy, Chapter 9 has proven to be the best tool that a government can have to avoid making the politically painful reforms that are necessary to return it to growth and to regain access to international credit markets.If congress truly wants to help, it should signal as early as possible that Chapter 9 is off the table, so that the reforms that are necessary to help the people of Puerto Rico will be enacted more quickly, and so that they can regain the sovereignty that comes with a government that can manage its own affairs.Perdue, a Puerto Rico resident, is an author and strategic advisor to the public policy think tank Fundacion Libertad.

Yet Toro also benefits when it snows frequently and hard.Toro's acquisition of the BOSS line of snow and ice management machines helped the century-old company's revenue grow 16% in the October-ended quarter to $480.8 million. The company strives hard to introduce new products and is laser-focused on seeing strong customer response.In December, CEO Michael Hoffman said the company's ""new product vitality index showed an increase for the year compared to fiscal 2014, and we are confident that metric will be even higher in fiscal 2016.""Sales have grown steadily each year since fiscal 2010, from $1.69 billion that year to $2.39 billion in fiscal 2015.Toro is set to report January-ended fiscal Q1 results on Thursday before the market open.

439,ICE,"Donald Trump had an amazing primary night in New Hampshire. Let me tell you. He won. Big. Very big. In fact, yugge. You’re going to be really amazed by his detailed plans to make America great again, down below. Believe me.Trump got twice as many votes as second place, which was – Wait for it – Ohio’s John Kasich. “We did it!” Kasich messaged supporters, as if he too was surprised.“Our strong finish in New Hampshire,” he said, “proved that Americans want to see a positive campaign that's focused on solutions and bringing people together.” You’ll never guess what he asked supporters to send in then.Third place went to Ted Cruz, with Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush sorting out the next spot. Or the other way around. It doesn’t matter. They’re all moving on.However, sixth place went to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who did the drive-by shooting on Rubio in Saturday’s debate. Rubio apologized to supporters for a poor performance. Didn’t turn out so well for Christie though. Rubio finished well ahead of him in the voting.And instead of moving on to South Carolina for the next primary Feb. 20, Christie said he needed to ”reassess.” In politics-speak that means he’ll be taking a long walk off a short pier on the Jersey shore.After another dismal showing Tuesday, after investing $16 million and so much time in New Hampshire, the governor canceled his trip and headed home for the fatal campaign reassessment.One more Republican candidate down, another governor, But still too many competitors for now to stop the Trumptrain. Who will get Christie’s handful of supporters?After spending chump change of a little under $4 million in New Hampshire, the billionaire New Yorker captured 34% of the record turnout, to Kasich’s 16%. Not bad for putting in only 23 days and 11 town halls there.Kasich did 62 days and talked his way through 104 town halls for half the results. If he goes on to more conservative South Carolina, Kasich will be brushed aside by the organized ground operations of all the others.More likely, he'll return to the Midwest to build an operation for those state primaries ahead.After ABC barred her and her ads from Saturday’s debate, Carly Fiorina still finished with four percent in New Hampshire. That's twice as much as Ben Carson, who was allowed on the ABC stage, though he looked lost much of the time. Fiorina has vowed to move on no matter what. Carson may need to go home for fresh clothes and his own reassessment.Only 10 days until South Carolina Republicans vote on Feb. 20, a shorter campaign than usual. Democrats will again decide between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who destroyed the former first lady in New Hampshire by an embarrassing, 60% to 39%. Democrats don’t vote in South Carolina until Feb. 27.You didn’t think they’d make it easy, did you? Then comes Nevada with Republicans caucusing on Feb. 23 and Dems on Feb. 20.Clinton, who’s now losing her presumptive nominee status for the second time, conceded to Sanders. Then she turned her remarks into what sounded like Sanders socialism, vowing to fight against big anything for the rights of every conceivable liberal interest group she could list.""Now we take this campaign to the entire country,” she said. “We are going to fight for every vote in every state. People have every right to be angry. But they are also hungry. They are hungry for solutions.” Behind her, hubby Bill clapped continuously as if she'd promised ice cream for good behavior.But for now Trump is riding high and mighty. After claiming that Cruz cheated him out of the Iowa win, Trump was energized Tuesday. He introduced his entire family, including some deceased members. Then, he laid out in trademark stream of consciousness what he regards as policy details:“The world is going to respect us again. Do we love our country? We’re going to make great trade deals. We’re going to rebuild our military. It’s going to be so strong, so powerful. Nobody is going to mess with us. We’re going to take care of our vets. We’re going to have strong, incredible borders, and people are going to come in legally. We’re going to build a wall. Believe me! It’s not that difficult to do. We’re going to repeal and replace ObamaCare. It’s a total disaster. We’re getting rid of Common Core. We’re going to educate our children locally. We’re going to preserve our very sacred Second Amendment. Not going to be any more chipping away…I am going to be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. By the way, we’re going to knock the hell out of ISIS and it’s going to be done the right way…It’s going to be so great. Our national debt is $19 trillion, soon going to be $21 trillion. What is going on? We’re going to make our country so strong…We’re going to make America so great again, maybe greater than ever before. I love you all. We’re going now to South Carolina. We’re going to win in South Carolina.”RELATED:

441,ICE,"Oil's decline and China's woes have pushed the equities market into a deep freeze.Hardly a day passes without negative stock market news that adds ice to the market chill. The S&P 500 is down nearly 8% so far this year. Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index -- a widely followed cross-section of the U.S. investment grade bond market -- is up about 1.6%.Investors fear for the health of their investment strategies in general and their retirement planning in particular.But stock investors should take heart in history. Stocks rarely lag bonds for a full calendar year.In the 25 years since 1990, stocks in the form of the S&P 500 have outperformed the Barclays Agg, as it's often referred to, in 19 calendar years prior to 2016.In those 25 year plus the beginning of this year through Feb. 1, the S&P 500 has enjoyed a 9.56% average annual gain vs. only 6.18% for the Barclays Agg, according to T. Rowe Price.If you had invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 on Dec. 31, 1990, by Feb. 2 it would have ballooned into nearly $100,000. In the Barclays Agg it would have grown less than half as much, to less than $45,000.Still, when stocks lagged during that quarter century, they tended to underperform for more than a year at a time.They lagged the Barclays Agg in the years 2000 through 2002, then again in 2007 and 2008. The also underperformed in the single calendar year of 2011.Yet even this year, while the S&P 500 is trailing the Barclays Agg, some stocks in the index are outperforming. Several are decent -- not dramatic -- dividend yielders.Newmont Mining (NEM) is up 40% for the year. Gold is serving its traditional role as a safe haven from equities while stocks are down.Newmont has a robust 89 Composite Rating from IBD. It also pays a 0.4% dividend yield. Earnings per share grew 109% and 30% for two quarters before declining 54% in the third quarter.The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and RS Ratings, with 99 being the highest.Telecom giant AT&T (T), which sports a 99 Comp Rating, is up 7% this year. Its dividend yield is 5.2%.EPS grew 11%, 14% and 25% the past three stanzas.WEC Energy Group (WEC), a utility, is up nearly 11% this year.

443,ICE,"In last week's GOP debate, illegal immigration sparked heated exchanges about ""amnesty,"" the polarizing issue at the center of any reform proposal.But as Marco Rubio pointed out, the failure of Washington politicians to solve the immigration problem over the past 30 years -- primarily their failure to staunch the flow of illegal entry -- Americans are so suspicious they will not accept any reform until the problem of illegal entry is solved conclusively.So the real issue is illegal entry. At New Hampshire town hall meetings before the debate, I asked the candidates if they would restart the deportation of illegal immigrants. Deportation constitutes enforcement of current law, for which the president would have sole power and obligation. Reform and amnesty plans require congressional action.By law, illegal immigrants who have received a ""final removal order"" are to be deported. President Obama is not doing so. Indeed, he claims authority to exempt millions from enforcement.As a result, the number of illegal residents who have been apprehended but not detained or deported has swelled to nearly 2 million, as reflected on the ""non-detained docket,"" an almost secret list maintained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. About half of those on the ICE docket have received a final removal order from an immigration court judge.I asked the candidates whether they would deport those with a final removal order.Chris Christie answered immediately. ""You have to,"" he said. ""You got to follow the law. I mean, listen, the bottom line is the reason the American people have lost confidence in the system is because no one is following the law.""Rubio responded without hesitation: ""Sure. We're going to enforce the law."" In his speech to a town hall gathering, Rubio had said, ""As the son of immigrants, I can tell you that enforcing immigration laws is not anti-immigrant.""He said the same in the debate, and went on to observe that the U.S. is the most immigrant-friendly nation on earth, admitting about one million legal immigrants every year.Ted Cruz answered succinctly: ""Yes."" When I asked Jeb Bush, ""Would you deport them,"" he replied, ""I would,"" adding ""you can create a deterrent effect."" John Kasich's staff sent a statement via email containing this reply, ""People who already have been ordered by a judge to leave should leave . . ."" Via a staff email, Ben Carson declined to answer the question.No need to ask Donald Trump, who has said he'll deport all 11 million to 12 million illegal residents. It's a ludicrous position that no other candidate supports. No one else intends a wholesale roundup.The largely unified GOP position on deportation reflects an understanding that law enforcement relies upon deterrence as much as prevention. All candidates have plans to improve prevention with enhanced border security and new policies to monitor visitors on visas.But it is impossible to prevent all illegal activity or to catch everyone who breaks any law -- from misdemeanor to capital crime. We couldn't afford the legions of law enforcement officers to do so. Nor would we want to live in the police state entailed.So, we rely upon punishment of those who are caught and convicted to deter others from committing offenses, as Bush observed. Commenting on the numbers, Bush said, ""I didn't know that they are that high.""The takeaway is twofold. First, contrary to the myth that ""rounding up millions is an impossible task,"" it is not only possible, it's already been done: Obama's ""catch and release"" policy begins with capture, right?The second is that the Obama administration has been hiding these high numbers. The most recent statistics for the non-detained docket are for 2013, released in March 2014: 1.8 million listed; 48% with a final removal order. Since then, searches of the ICE website and multiple inquiries to the ICE Office of Public Affairs have yielded nothing more current.This goes to Rubio's and Christie's points about loss of confidence in the system. Americans know the law is not being enforced, and they know the Obama administration is hiding that fact.The extent of Obama's non-enforcement is startling. In 2015, ICE carried out only 235,000 ""removals,"" including 135,000 convicted criminals (that's enforcement of criminal law) and 90,000 non-Mexicans captured by Border Patrol and turned over to ICE for removal. (That's interdiction, not deportation.) That leaves only 10,000 deported for violation of our immigration laws.Moreover, Obama has attempted to go beyond non-enforcement with executive orders formally shielding immigrants from enforcement. His latest order goes even beyond that and extends to five million illegal residents work permits and other benefits. That is the exact opposite of deterrence.Federal courts have blocked Obama's latest order. The case is now before the Supreme Court.The court will decide on Obama's executive order. The 2016 election will test whether Americans appreciate that the genuine rule of the law requires deterrence as well as prevention, that even the strictest border security can't prevent all illegal entry and that sometimes painful deportation is necessary to complete the mission.

444,ICE,"They call it stormy December, but January was  -- worse.On the heels of December's 1.58% decline in the S&P 500 and 2.80% tumble for U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, in January the broad market lost 4.96% and U.S. diversified stock funds dove 6.25%, according to Lipper Inc.It was the sixth worst January for the big-cap bogey in the past 47 years. And in that span it was the third worst opening month to a year for U.S. diversified stock funds as a group.Click Here To See List Of Top Performing Mutual Funds Past 6 MonthsThere was no mystery about the main culprits. Investors worried about stock market news that harped on China's economic slowdown and speculated about how badly it would affect the global economy -- including that of the U.S.And investors fretted about oil's declining price. Light sweet crude, for example, fell from $37.04 a barrel to $33.62 by January's end. It closed below $30 on five trading days.""China and oil are two of the reasons for the weak market in January,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. ""I would also throw into the mix the strong dollar, high inventories, weak manufacturing sector and the political cycle.""Still, the market trended higher in its final eight sessions. Why? Credit the Federal Reserve, Orlando says. On Jan. 27, the Fed signaled that its decisions regarding future rate hikes ""would be dovish, data dependent and cautious,"" Orlando said.That was in stark contrast to the Fed's quarter-percentage-point rate hike in December.Also, Japan's central bank went to negative interest rates on certain bank reserves -- a move that bolsters stocks by making them more attractive than cash.The Federal Reserve action preceded by two days the Bureau of Economic Analysis' release of its advance estimate of GDP growth in the fourth quarter: annualized 0.7% growth, lower than Q3's 2% gain and slightly below market expectations of 0.8% for Q4.So investors, who were already spooked by the five indicators that Orlando cites, were relieved by the BEA's move, which virtually wiped out the prospect of three or four rates hikes in 2016. ""And when the Fed does make its next rate hike, investors know that that will be a sign of the Fed's faith that the economy is strong enough to handle it,"" Orlando said.Orlando believes that the Fed won't lift its rate again until the U.S. sees a quarter with 2% annualized GDP growth. ""July is the earliest we might see sufficiently strong data,"" he said. ""Then September is the next time that they'd be likely to raise the rate.""A 9.03% gain made dedicated short-bias funds the best-performing mutual funds among all U.S. diversified stock funds in January.Click Here To See The Top-Performing Stock And Bond Mutual Fund CategoriesAmong just market capitalization and style categories within U.S. diversifieds, large-cap core funds did best by losing the least, 5.35% in the month. Equity-income funds gave up even less: -3.92%.Top large-cap growth managers included Frank Caruso, whose AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) fell 6.08% last month.Reflecting the flight to safe havens, commodities precious metals funds paced all sectors, gaining 2.53%.Also reflecting the flight to safety, U.S. Treasury bond funds leapt 3.45% as taxable-bond funds overall lost 0.34% in the month.Latin American funds led foreign-region stock funds by losing the least, -4.30%.Orlando expects the market blahs to continue until about midyear.""I don't think China is going into recession,"" he said. ""Consumers are doing well there, but it will take a couple of quarters for investors to figure that out. Consumers in China will offset weakness in manufacturing by midyear.""By midyear, investors should also see that the U.S. dollar has stopped strengthening altogether, or at least as fast as it has, he adds. ""That dollar stabilization will make it easier for U.S. megacaps to export, which will boost corporate earnings,"" he said.Corporate inventories are already falling, he says. ""So we might see a restocking-cycle kick off in the second half of the year, which would boost manufacturing,"" he said.The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index jumped to 55.6 in January from 42.9 in December, the highest pace of growth in a year. When that barometer tops 50, it's a sign of growth in the manufacturing sector. ""It was in contraction mode the last six months,"" Orlando said.As for politics, only once in the past 75 years has the party in power extended control of the White House to a third straight term. Concern about weak growth in jobs and wages should help swing control of the presidency to Republicans, Orlando says. And that should be good for business interests.With his eyes glued to midyear, Orlando expects that the technology, consumer-discretionary and industrial sectors to lead the breakout. That should benefit tech-hardware makers, chipmakers, automakers, homebuilders and airlines, he says.""Once the Fed starts to tighten again, then financials ought to work better,"" he said.In the meantime, his focus is on lower-beta, higher-dividend stocks. Names that he likes include Exxon Mobile (XOM) and Royal Dutch (RDSA).""In the first half of the year, we have overweights in Europe and Japan vs. the U.S.,"" he said. ""We're overweight in developed foreign markets but underweight in emerging markets.""Jeff Rottinghaus, manager of $1.6 billion T. Rowe Price Growth & Income (PRGIX) and of $203 million Large Cap (TRULX), also expects ""a pretty tough year."" To cope with slower earnings growth, he has beefed up what he calls quality and higher-yield stocks. He's also been looking for early cyclical stocks with sound fundamentals, whose prices have been beaten up.In railroads, he began to buy Kansas City Southern (KSU) late last year. ""In a recovery, it should do well,"" he said. The stock is 32% off its 52-week high. Earnings fell 6% last year and are expected to increase 1% this year and 13% next year.In financials, he likes Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). ""They take advantage of volatility,"" he said. Intercontinental provides a market for derivatives, which many investors use to hedge volatility.He also likes American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), two REITs that own wireless towers. Their long-term contracts with telecom carriers give them ""fantastic recurring revenue businesses that should do well in a more stressed economic environment,"" he said.And in consumer staples he owns CVS (CVS), PepsiCo (PEP) and Philip Morris International (PM).In fixed income, he expects bonds generally to look more appealing if the Fed is forced to pause its rate hikes. In that scenario, bond prices should stabilize rather than decline.Rottinghaus would like to find commodities stocks that have been dragged down by their sector or industry group -- more than their own fundamentals call for. ""Those companies could do well over the next couple of years,"" he said. ""But they're still not there yet.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

450,ICE,"Electric car maker Tesla Motors (TSLA) could build an electric truck after its Model S midsize mass-market vehicle that will follow up its pricey Model S sedan and Model X crossover SUV.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has intimated before that a truck's a possibility and said it again at a venture forum in Hong Kong this week.“I think it is quite likely we will do a truck in the future,” he said at InvestHK group’s StartmeupHK Festival on Tuesday. “I think it’s sort of a logical thing for us to do in the future.”With the low price of gas averaging a freewheeling $1.82 a gallon around the U.S., Americans have been buying more trucks lately, without the pressure of high gas prices deterring them as it has in some years past. The broader economy also plays a role, with businesses using pickups.""Pickup trucks and SUVs have been incredibly strong,"" Stifel analyst James Albertine said in a research note on Ford (F) Thursday. And a revised business plan by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) reflected that, as CEO Sergio Marchionne put it Wednesday, ""there has been, in our view, a permanent shift toward UVs (utility vehicles) and pickups.""Musk said at the forum that the low price of oil -- hovering around $30 a barrel lately -- will dampen demand for electric cars overall and that Tesla aims to build vehicles ""so compelling that even with low gasoline prices, it’s the car you want to buy.""The company will see increasing competition in long-range electric vehicles from General Motors (GM) (with its planned Chevrolet Bolt), several other mainstream automakers and possibly also Apple (AAPL) with its Project Titan, believed to focus on a self-driving Apple Car.Among other efforts at electric trucks, former GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz is chairman at Via Motors. The Utah-based outfit installs electric technology onto GM vehicles such as the Silverado truck and Express van. It aims to bring the platform to consumers in the next couple years. Its eREV powertrain lets larger four-wheel-drive vehicles handle the first 40 miles in all-electric mode and go up to 400 miles on a single fill-up, according to its website.Tesla stock is limping toward the company's fourth-quarter earnings report, set for Feb. 10 after the stock market close. Shares lifted 0.9% Thursday but were down 2% in after-hours trading. Tesla stock is down 21% for the year after an 8% gain in 2015, a 48% rise in 2014 and a 344% gain in 2013. The company currently gets a low IBD Composite Rating of 32 out of a possible 99.For Tesla's Q4, the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters stands at earnings per share of a dime (vs. a 13-cent loss in Q4 2014) on revenue of about $1.8 billion (up 64%). Tesla delivered 17,192 of its flagship Model S sedans in its fourth quarter, up about 75% from a year earlier, and 208 Model X SUVs, it reported on Jan. 3 in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.According to a Benzinga report Thursday, Tesla has confirmed that it will announce its Model 3 in March, and just one version of it.RELATED:Tesla CEO: Oil Price Will Slow Electric Cars; China Course Charted.Tesla Motors Earnings Scheduled: Black Ice Or Autopilot?

451,ICE,"Fraud: Ten years ago Monday, Al Gore said we had only a decade left to save the planet from global warming. But Earth has been doing just fine. Why do we listen to this man?While preening at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2006 during the premiere of his ""An Inconvenient Truth"" fib-umentary, Gore made his grand declaration. The former vice president said, in the words of the AP reporter taking down his story, that ""unless drastic measures to reduce greenhouse gases are taken within the next 10 years, the world will reach a point of no return."" In Gore's own words, he claimed we were in ""a true planetary emergency.""Ten years later, he's probably hoping that everyone has forgotten about his categorical statement.The terrible truth for Gore is that there is no planetary emergency. Not one of the dire predictions he and the rest of the alarmist community made has come to pass. In fact, there is plenty of evidence that they have been running a racket. Here's how we know:One, Earth hasn't warmed in nearly 20 years. Yes, 2015 supposedly ""smashed"" the previous temperature record. But actually it was the third-warmest year on record — or maybe ""not even close to the hottest year on record,"" says James Taylor of the Heartland Institute.The global average temperature, a devilish thing to determine anyway, depends on what temperature readings are being used and who is ""adjusting"" the data to fit their political purposes. The scientific community cannot be trusted to provide honest numbers. And 2015 was, after all, an El Nino year. Higher temperatures, with no link to man's activities, were expected.Two, predictions that climate change — the rebranding of ""global warming"" when it turned out that predicted warming wasn't happening — would cause catastrophic weather damage haven't panned out.German insurance giant Munich Re says losses from natural disasters were lower in 2015 than in 2014 and lowest since 2009. The facts are sharply at odds with Gore's 2012 claim that ""dirty weather"" caused by ""dirty fossil fuel"" has created ""extreme weather"" that ""is happening all over the world with increasing frequency.""Three, despite all the self-congratulatory international conferences and pseudo-agreements, the world has done nothing to ""fight global warming.""He cannot claim that his deadline has been extended because some governments have forced their citizens to cut carbon dioxide emissions. CO2 levels keep climbing and now exceed 401 parts per million in the atmosphere. It is simply not the dangerous greenhouse gas we've repeatedly been told it is.Four, in the mid- to late-2000s, Gore repeatedly predicted that an ice-free Arctic Ocean was coming soon. But as usual, his fortune-telling was wrong. By 2014, Arctic ice had grown thicker and covered a greater area than it did when he made his prediction.Five, Gore's movie, which somehow won an Oscar, was found by a British judge to contain nine errors. The judge said it could not be shown to students unless it included a notice pointing out the errors.Gore will never apologize for peddling deceit, never admit he was wrong. Best thing to do is ignore him.

462,ICE,"Climate Change: Alarmists have had a field day with the unusually balmy weather in the East. But as is routine, stories that counter the narrative about man-made warming are ignored. Here are three more.First is a peer-reviewed paper showing that only 36% of 1,077 geoscientists and engineers surveyed believe in the man-made global warming crisis as defined by the United Nations' Kyoto model.According to the paper, the Kyoto position expresses ""the strong belief that climate change is happening, that it is not a normal cycle of nature, and humans are the main or central cause.""Thirty-six percent is not insignificant. But it certainly is a long way from the oft-cited 97% ""consensus"" among scientists that man is causing temperatures to change.Researchers behind ""Science or Science Fiction? Professionals' Discursive Construction of Climate Change,"" which appeared in Organization Studies, also found ""the proportion of papers"" collected from a science database ""that explicitly endorsed anthropogenic climate change has fallen from 75%"" between 1993 and 2003 ""to 45% from 2004 to 2008.""The Heartland Institute's James Taylor reminds us in Forbes that ""survey results show geoscientists (also known as earth scientists) and engineers hold similar views as meteorologists. Two recent surveys of meteorologists revealed similar skepticism of alarmist global warming claims.""Missed story No. 2: Greenland, the alarmists' coal-mine canary, retained 99.7% of its ice mass in the 20th century. Yes, it reportedly lost 9,000 billion tons of ice in the same period. But as the ""Watts Up With That"" blog notes, that's ""not even a tiny nick when spread out over roughly 1.7 million square kilometers of ice surface"" — working out to a sheet five meters thick on an island where the average thickness is about 1,500 meters.Finally, we have the work of the scholars at the Cato Institute, who have confirmed that climate models that warn of warming have been wrong for decades.""If the known climate behavior cannot be well-captured by the models,"" they say, ""no case can be made for the veracity of projections, from the same models, of the future evolution of our climate.""The media don't want to report such findings, even when they are made aware of them. But ignoring them doesn't change the facts that are contained within and finally dawning on the public at large.

463,ICE,"Rep. Vicky Hartzler gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksHello, I’d like to first extend my thoughts and prayers to those affected by the catastrophic weather events of this past week. Missouri is experiencing extensive flooding as are other states.Families across the South are picking up the pieces of their lives after being devastated by tornadoes. Ice and snow have caused power outages in multiple states. It wasn't the holiday week we were expecting but there is help.If you are affected, I urge you to reach out to your U.S. Representative’s office, state and local authorities, or the federal and state emergency management agencies for resources to deal with the aftermath. While the assistance can't undo the damage, it can help get you on a path to recovery so 2016 can be a New Year with new hope.As Congress returns next week, in one of our first acts of the new year, the House will vote on a bill that would eliminate key parts of ObamaCare and stop taxpayer funding for abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood. This would be a significant step in improving our health care system.If this bill becomes law, patients will be able to choose a health insurance plan that works for them—without Washington getting in the way.That’s the problem with ObamaCare: It forces people to buy insurance that’s much more expensive than what they need.And when you force millions of people to buy expensive and unaffordable insurance, it’s not that surprising to see premiums going up. Deductibles are going up too—all while people’s choices are disappearing. They’re losing their doctors. They can’t find a good plan. Millions of people have lost the plans they had. Far too many are paying more and getting less.If we want to make health insurance more affordable, we should make insurance companies compete for your business.That means we should not force people to buy insurance. It means the exact opposite. Our bill addresses this injustice by eliminating the core of ObamaCare: It repeals the individual mandate. If this bill becomes law, you won’t have to buy insurance or face a penalty. It will be your choice.This bill also eliminates the employer mandate to offer insurance. No longer will job creators have to choose between hiring more workers or paying for coverage they can’t afford.And this bill eliminates many of the ObamaCare taxes on things like prescription drugs and medical devices. Critical medicine and medical devices are the very things that save lives. They should never have been taxed in the first place. This bill will set things right.The point of health care is to preserve and protect life. That’s why....
"
464,ICE,"....this bill stops taxpayer funding for abortion providers. The people have, for years, asked Congress to stop sending taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood, especially after we learned last year of the disturbing practices Planned Parenthood officials engage in such as harvesting and selling baby body parts.These actions—along with the hundreds of thousands of abortions they perform each year—show a blatant disregard for human life. That's why this bill places a moratorium on taxpayer funding to abortion providers and redirects that money to community health centers. These health centers serve eight times more women patients than Planned Parenthood, and they provide much more comprehensive care.We were sent to Congress to fight for the American people. They do not want their healthcare dictated to them by Washington. And they don’t want their tax dollars going to abortion providers. We have taken many votes to preserve health care choices and protect precious tax dollars in the House. If the president didn't hear the people's voices earlier, hopefully, he will through this bill. It will go directly to his desk by way of the reconciliation process, which avoids obstruction by Senate Democrats.We owe it to the American people to take our best shot at repealing ObamaCare, and that’s what we’ll do next week. As a result, President Obama will soon have a choice: Does he support the people and women’s health, or does he support Washington mandates and tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood?For the sake of the American people, I hope he makes the right choice.  Thanks for listening—Happy New Year and God Bless. ####Previous weekly party remarks are available here.RELATED:The ISIS Protocol: Rules for raping captive femalesObama: My 10 reasons that 2015 was a really swell yearThe warped world of inhabited by our delusional presidentNew data reveals Obama vacations cost taxpayers over $70 million

476,ICE,"'We're fried."" That's what Ray Kroc would say if he could speak from the grave. The father of the McDonald's hamburger empire would be referring to the recent decision by the National Labor Relations Board to modify some of its definitions.New rules will treat McDonald's and other franchising companies as ""joint employers"" of the workers in their shops.This in turn will make it easier for unions to organize employees who work for franchise units across the economy.""Fried"" is a strong adjective to describe a definitional shift. But to look back on Kroc's life is to understand the man's views on unionization.Kroc spent the first decades of adulthood moving from trade to trade, playing piano or working as a traveling salesman. Selling paper cups and milkshake mixers gave him ample time to develop a few convictions about commerce.""Scale or die"" sums up the first: Big success came only to big companies.Autonomy for managers is also key, Kroc believed. ""If you hire a man to do a job, you ought to get out of his way and let him do it,"" as he put it in his autobiography.A third Kroc principle went against the mood of his era, when many believed Big Labor and Big Business fared best when they worked together at a boardroom table.Kroc suspected organized labor could impede both scaling and autonomy. Unions could come between a man and a job.Kroc recalled that once in Miami, hungry for work, he'd been asked if he would take a piano gig. ""Is the pope Catholic?"" he replied.But union rules might stand in his way of his employment.Kroc would be permitted to take the work only ""if (the Miami musicians' union) accepted my Chicago Musician's Union card and gave me a permit to play in Miami."" He got the work, but remembered the hassle.Kroc learned much from customers, such as the McDonald brothers in San Bernardino, Calif. Observing their small chain of restaurants in the 1950s, Kroc decided he was ready to turn theory to practice.When managers owned their own restaurants, they'd keep them cleaner and serve better food, Kroc wagered. Another advantage of private ownership: Workers at privately owned restaurants would be hard to organize.Small shops would not lose productive days when workers went out on strike, as U.S. Steel did when 600,000 steel workers walked out in the summer of 1955.To achieve scale, Kroc turned to the franchise format: A parent company could sustain the brand across the country and furnish capital.In 1955, Kroc also created McDonald Systems Inc., a structure for franchises, and opened his pilot shop in Des Plaines, Ill., just north of Chicago (hamburgers, 15 cents). McDonald's flourished, and the number of stores swelled.The success of the hamburger from Chicago's north contrasted with the troubles to the city's southeast, in Gary, Ind.In 1959, a year Kroc could boast McDonald's restaurants sold more than 100 million burgers, U.S. Steel lost more than 100 million man-hours to union-driven work stoppages.Such instances make it easy to understand why some believed that circumventing unions was what franchises were for.Kroc shortly bought out the McDonald brothers.In the 1960s McDonald's continued its wild expansion, with Kroc defending the Golden Arches against union assault or increases in the minimum wage.Sometimes, Kroc even went on the offensive: ""Why is the board denying jobs to 300 of your city's youth?"" he demanded of the San Francisco board of permits when it rejected the opening of McDonald's restaurants in the Bay Area.Just as Kroc envisioned, the parent company would give the restaurants access to capital. In 1965 the Golden Arches went public at $22.50 a share. Those who bought the stock saw returns far greater than from other investments.The Shakespearean contest between U.S. Steel and McDonald's played out on the stage of the Dow industrial average. In 1985, Dow Jones gave McDonald's a spot in its coveted index. Soon thereafter it dropped USX, successor to U.S. Steel.An ocean of ink, a heaven of Internet text and many miles of film have been spent trashing McDonald's ""hamburger jobs,"" as presidential candidate Walter Mondale labeled them in 1984. Certainly the jobs paid less than those that once existed in Gary. But there were and still are enormous benefits to the McDonald's structure — for shareholders, franchisees and employees.One example of upward mobility was Ed Rensi, who started with the chain in Columbus, Ohio, in 1965 at 85 cents an hour and rose to the presidency of McDonald's USA.Eventually McDonald's employed more young men and women than the U.S. Army.Later in life, Kroc suspected McDonald's might one day begin to lose its battles.""It's true it would be hard to start a business like McDonald's today, with all the interference you'd get form the government and unions,"" Kroc ruminated in People magazine in 1975.The NLRB's action this summer represents such interference in its most direct form.This is not to say that union-less-ness was the only or even the primary factor in the McDonald's phenom, or to say that it's impossible for any business today to grow as fast as McDonald's. Money flows around unions like soda pop around ice cubes, as Kroc might have put it.But the obstacles unions place before growth are an undertold story, damage from which can range far beyond the Golden Arches. Shlaes chairs the board of the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation.

477,ICE,"National Security: President Obama flew to Alaska Monday to claim that global warming is a U.S. security threat. He would have been better off noticing the five Chinese warships and 40 Russian icebreakers off Alaska's coast.Burning thousands of gallons of fossil fuel and leaving an enormous carbon footprint, Obama jetted 4,400 miles to Alaska for three days, to talk about global warming (and sight-see). He took selfie-stick photos for his daily travelogue, danced with Alaska natives, and renamed North America's highest peak, known officially as Mount McKinley for a century, the politically correct Native American name Denali.Above all, his mission was to warn Americans about climate change, claiming rather absurdly that the late-summer melting of ice in the Alaska wilds was evidence of global warming, not the seasons.""The impacts of climate change are real, and the people of Alaska are living with them every day,"" he tweeted from the White House website. ""It's never been more important for us to address this challenge,"" he wrote, signing it ""-bo"" to let readers know he did it himself.It was just the tip of his melting glacier. Last May, he told graduating Coast Guard cadets that ""climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security, and make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country.""When a U.S. president has beliefs such as these, it's no surprise that America's challengers for global hegemony could not have chosen a better time to make show of force — just off Alaska.It wasn't merely that Russia made a show of patrolling with its 40 icebreakers, prompting Obama to say he was thinking of maybe acquiring another to add to America's fleet of ... two.China sailed around the Aleutian Islands, sending five warships — three combat vessels, one supply replenishment ship, and one amphibious landing ship — to the edge of Alaska's waters. The group might amount to a coordinated fleet maneuver that U.S. intelligence analysts have said China has not so far been able to project.We do know that the amphibious landing vessel was sent out to project the ""sea control"" power of a blue water navy, something a defensive ""sea denial"" regional coastal fleet can't.These naval exercises also come at a time of heightened Chinese militarism, exactly when the old gray men of Beijing are in what's believed to be a power struggle over an economic crisis of their own making. This week, China's military held a vast Soviet-style military parade to demonstrate its military might, as Beijing's oligarchs — quite a few who haven't been seen in awhile, such as Jiang Zemin — watched.The big show accompanies China's rising military spending, its increased modernization, and its willingness to use its growing power.China has not only threatened its Asian neighbors with that power, the parade — which wasn't open to the public so much as the television cameras for projection abroad — was to show off China's efforts to recruit allies in opposition to the U.S. Obama's new ally Castroite Cuba was one. And we noticed that Russia's Vladimir Putin was also in attendance.The same day as the parade, China announced it would be laying off 300,000 of its 2 million land-based troops. In ""Asia's Cauldron,"" Robert D. Kaplan wrote that far from being a sign of weakening, that is a sign of modernization.""Military modernization is actually about smaller but more up-to-date force structures,"" he wrote. It's a likely shift from land-based forces to sea and air power, he noted.It's quite a chilling picture from a rising Asian power and a longtime rival — right in America's northernmost state. Yet all our president could offer on this trip was his obsession with the junk-science of global warming. Monsters encircle us, and he's chasing a chimera.

478,ICE,"It began with a toy, a small helicopter their father brought home from one of his travels. It was little more than a stick with twin propellers and a rubber band.But it flew. And it unleashed the imagination of Wilbur and Orville Wright, who — despite the if-God-meant-for-man-to-fly-He'd-have-given-us-wings crowd — changed the world.On Dec. 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, N.C., the Wright brothers flew their home-made plane on the first powered human flight.Years before, they didn't seem destined for highflying feats.Neither graduated from high school nor had any engineering background. But they had a crucial trait: a proclivity for tinkering.""They had to invent an engineering process in order to invent the airplane,"" Thomas Crouch, a senior curator at the National Air & Space Museum in Washington, D.C., told IBD. ""(But) the challenge of solving difficult problems is what got them up in the morning.""The BrothersThey were two of five surviving children of Bishop and Susan Wright. Their father was an official of the United Brethren Church and traveled frequently.While growing up in Dayton, Ohio, Wilbur (1867-1912) seemed headed for a different life.According to ""The Wright Brothers,"" David McCullough's recent best-seller, Wilbur was a star athlete who achieved high grades and considered going to Yale.Then fate intervened. Playing ice hockey during his senior year of high school, Wilbur was struck in the face by a stick.It was propelled by a local bully, and it is unclear whether the blow was purposeful, but it changed Wilbur's direction — and history.He lost his front teeth, which had to be replaced. He was in tremendous pain. At the same time, his mother's health deteriorated, and he became a recluse caring for her.Darrell Collins, historian at the Wright Brothers National Memorial in Manteo, N.C., considers it ""a turning point in Wilbur's life.""Eventually, Orville lured his older brother into the world again, first as editor of a local newspaper he published and, in 1883, as partner in a bicycle shop they opened in Dayton.Wilbur was about to catch the flying bug. As he wrote in a 1900 letter to French engineer and flight pioneer Octave Chanute: ""For some years I have been afflicted with the belief that flight is possible to man. My disease has increased in severity and I feel that it will soon cost me an increased amount of money if not my life.""Said Collins: ""Wilbur was the visionary of the two brothers. He was the first to suggest tackling the problem (of) mechanical flight and in the beginning took all the risks associated with gliding.""Wilbur took a step-by-step path to solving the how-to-fly riddle.He and Orville mastered the language of aviation so they could communicate with others in the field.Terms such as ""lift,"" ""pitch"" and ""yaw"" were not normally in the vocabulary of bicycle makers.Then he studied the experiences of others. In 1899 he wrote the Smithsonian asserting that he was ""about to begin a systematic study of the subject"" of aeronautics, that he was ""an enthusiast and not a kook"" and that he hoped to ""obtain such papers as the Smithsonian Institution has published ... (and) a list of other works in print.""He read of Chanute, Samuel Langley (an aviator who led the Smithsonian) and Otto Lilienthal (who would die in an 1896 glider crash).Following the advice of Lilienthal and flight innovator Louis Pierre Mouillard, Wilbur took up bird watching. One of the problems early aviators encountered was maintaining balance once their gliders became airborne.Most relied on shifting their weight, but that proved insufficient. Wilbur soon realized that rather than shift weight, birds adjusted their wings when turning.To confirm his theory, Wilbur created a model with wings that could be warped or twisted to present different surfaces or angles to the air.Up And At 'EmIn the summer of 1899, the brothers built their first aircraft: a kite with 5-foot wings whose warping could be controlled from the ground via string.Wilbur tested it in an open field outside Dayton, and the plane/kite responded as he planned. But kite flying alone didn't cut it. He knew that building the most stable aircraft without a pilot with solid experience doomed flights. In that 1900 letter to Chanute, he wrote: ""Knowledge and skill in handling the machine are absolute essentials to flight and it is impossible to obtain them without extensive practice.""After extensive research, Wilbur settled on Kitty Hawk as the perfect setting to get that experience.It was a logical but tough choice. The area was desolate and isolated. It rained often, after which came a plague of mosquitoes.But the terrain made it worthwhile: hills from which to take off, a steady wind to hold the plane up and a soft beach on which to land.The brothers did not keep records, but apparently Wilbur took the first glider flights in October 1900, some as long as 400 feet.""He was protective of his little brother and was the driving force behind (them),"" Collins said.The experience Wilbur craved proved how much more work was in order, that the wing data — based on the work of previous aviators — were incorrect.As a result, he was gloomy on the train back to Dayton later in 1900.But the duo bounced back fast.In a leap of imagination, Orville suggested that a wing didn't need to be full size to see if it worked.Soon enough, the brothers built a wind tunnel so that they didn't have to risk life and limb to check wing configurations.High IdeasThe Wrights didn't invent the wind tunnel, but theirs was the first to measure lift and drag ""with sufficient accuracy (to allow) them to build a true wing of an airplane,"" Collins noted.Said Crouch: ""Their brilliance was to go from the abstract to the concrete, designing a little machine that would pop out the precise coefficients for lift and drag.""The Wrights also solved another puzzle piece, deciding on a hinged tail rudder to help keep stability.In 1902 they made their third trip to Kitty Hawk and made 1,000 glides, some over 600 feet.Now the challenge was to turn their glider into a real airplane, flush with motor-powered propulsion. They turned to a machinist who worked in their bicycle shop to come up with an engine.Meanwhile, the brothers worked on a design for the propeller.No one had studied the problem previously. Now, noted Collins, ""they each brought to the table highly advanced math skills and a solid understanding of physics. They both were curious and creative thinkers whose ability to work with their hands made them doers with dreams.""On Dec. 17, 1903, Orville jumped aboard and went airborne for 12 seconds. From there, they took turns, with Wilbur on the fourth and final flight of the day traveling 852 feet and staying airborne for 59 seconds. The dawn of flight had risen.Over the next couple of years, the brothers modified their craft.In September 1904 Wilbur was the first to fly a plane in a circle.The next summer, the brothers each stayed aloft for at least 30 minutes.The War Department, which had financed a failed effort by the Smithsonian's Langley, seemed uninterested in the plane. So Wilbur went to Europe, where his demonstrations in France, Germany and Italy made him a global celebrity.After Orville joined him in Europe, they returned to America and in 1909 established Wright Co. to build planes, with Wilbur as president.
"
479,ICE,"As Barack, Michelle, Malia and Sasha Obama, family, friends, pets and staff enjoy their half-month-long Hawaiian vacation, the Secret Service finally complied with a court order to release some Obama vacation expenses from two years ago.That's how eager the Obama administration is about being transparent when it comes to spending large sums of taxpayers' money on itself.As with the slow-motion releases of Hillary Clinton's emails, the idea of
"
480,ICE,"bureaucratic stalling, of course, is that the details become ""old"" news more likely
"
481,ICE,"to be ignored by media. Fortunately, we're not on vacation this week, so we can help the president out. Here goes:The new expense reports, heavily-redacted allegedly for security reasons, push the total known costs for vacations during Obama's reign to nearly $71 million -- with another full year to go. That's about $10.1 million per year in known expenses.The totals come from Judicial Watch, the dogged watchdog group that pursues such information through repeated Freedom of Information Act requests.Earlier this year Judicial Watch obtained transportation costs for a pair of the Democrat's cross-country golf weekends just in 2015. They totaled nearly $2 million, or $20,000 per hole, the Washington Examiner calculated.In February, for instance, Obama spent President's Weekend golfing with male friends in Palm Springs. At $206,000 per flight hour, that trip set taxpayers back $1.03 million. That does not include other costs such as security and transportation.Of course, even with Camp David available for free in Maryland every president goes on vacation, though none have gone so far so often as the Obamas, sometimes in separate planes.Their family trips to Hawaii, for example, require at least 18 hours of Air Force One flight time at $206,000 per flight hour. Or $3.7 million minimum.Complaints of over-spending on personal travel have dogged this first couple starting with Michelle Obama's luxury vacation with friends to Spain at the peak of the recession and subsequent family excursions during the nation's weakest economic recovery since World War II.As we reported earlier this year: The Obamas have ""traveled more than any other first family, often with Mrs. Obama's mother and her friends. By the summer of 2014 the Obamas had taken 31 international trips lasting 119 days. At the same point in his presidency, Ronald Reagan had taken 14 such trips over 73 days.""When the family visited Ireland in 2013, taxpayers were hit for just under $8 million, including a quarter-million dollars for a two-day side-trip to Dublin for the Obama women. They chose a $3,500-per-night hotel suite in addition to 29 other rooms for their traveling party at the five-star hotel.""Last year when Mrs. Obama, her mother and two daughters toured China, they stayed in a Beijing hotel suite costing $8,400 per night.""Joe Biden, currently vacationing with his wife in the Virgin Islands, hasn't exactly suffered on the road either. Two years ago an unusually large Biden entourage ran up a London hotel bill of $480,000 in one night.The next day in Paris, Biden's tab was $585,000, again for a single night.The latest expense revelations extracted from the Secret Service by Judicial Watch seem almost a bargain by comparison. They show, among other things, $92,000 for rental cars and $225,000 for lodging paid to Paradise Luxury Rentals and Cabana Girl LLC for agents during the Obamas' 2013 Hawaii holiday.""It is easy to see why the Secret Service, reeling from its own scandals, covered up these outrageous expense numbers for just one of Obama’s luxury Christmas vacations,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “The $317,000 in Secret Service expenses are only the tip of the iceberg for the true cost of Obama’s 2013 vacation in Hawaii, which has now skyrocketed to $8,098,060.""The organization has another lawsuit pending against the Department of Homeland Security for ignoring an additional 19 Freedom of Information requests.RELATED:

483,ICE,"Climate: Want to know the latest global warming news? Don't bother looking in U.S. media. They can't be bothered with stories that contradict the man-made climate change narrative. But the truth is out there.Let's start with a new paper from NASA — a distinctly American organization — that was covered by the British Express.The newspaper tells us that our space program has ""found the Earth has cooled in areas of heavy industrialization where more trees have been lost and more fossil fuel burning takes place.""This is, of course, the opposite of what we've been told for decades.The Express reports that the findings confirm that the aerosols from fossil-fuel combustion ""actually cool the local environment, at least temporarily,"" as they reflect ""solar radiation away from the planet.""A NASA official said solar radiation is similarly bounced away from Earth when ""deforestation in northern latitudes"" results in bare land that ""increases reflected sunlight.""The Express further reports that the NASA paper's lead author said the findings show the ""complexity"" involved in estimating future global temperatures.This is something we've been saying for years. While the mainstream American press can't get off its carbon-dioxide fixation, we've noted that far too many variables affect global climate to focus on a single influence.The British Daily Mail also wrote about this NASA paper, which clearly has high news value.But the U.S. press couldn't get out of bed to cover the story. As far as we can tell, the legacy media in this country ignored it entirely.The same can be said about a study conducted by the Norwegian Polar Institute, which found ""that there are probably more polar bears than the last time the bears were counted in this area in 2004, in spite of the fact that there have been many years with poor ice cover during this period."" The American press doesn't want the public to know this because it throws into doubt the story it's been feeding us since the 1980s.Remember, we have been told over and again that man-made global warming was a grave threat to polar bears, which are an endangered species.Yet here's this study telling us that ""scientists now estimate that there are around 975 polar bears in the Norwegian region, whereas they estimated a number of 685 in 2004,"" while another has found them to be in ""excellent"" condition, with some being ""as fat as pigs.""Indeed, polar bears are making ""a surprise comeback.""Finally, in an effort to deliver a public service that the mainstream media refuse to provide, we point out that the temperature data that supposedly show warming have been corrupted by poor positioning.""The majority of weather stations used by (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) to detect climate change temperature signal have been compromised by encroachment of artificial surfaces like concrete, asphalt and heat sources like air conditioner exhausts,"" says Anthony Watts, a former meteorologist who is the lead author of a study of temperature station locations.Watts believes his work ""demonstrates conclusively that this issue affects temperature trends and that NOAA's methods are not correcting for this problem, resulting in an inflated temperature trend.""As a result of this systematic error, Watt believes the U.S. temperature record needs to be revised.Nor is this problem limited to America.Watts says there's also ""evidence of this same sort of siting problem around the world at many other official weather stations, suggesting that the same upward bias on trend also manifests itself in the global temperature record.""All three of these are significant stories. But instead of doing its due journalistic diligence, the press would rather muse about the role climate change might be playing in the warm Christmas weather in the Eastern part of the country.It's all part of the liberal narrative. Science that doesn't agree with the media's agenda is treated as if it's myth.

484,ICE,"Chick Hearn elevated professional basketball to the level of world-class entertainment. Not from the court. From his perch in the TV and radio booth.His team was the Los Angeles Lakers.Their peak era was the 1980s, when the Showtime Lakers' fast break sped to legendary proportions. And five National Basketball Association titles.Hearn spread the word with such classic calls as:""Slam-dunk.""""Air ball.""""No harm, no foul.""""He put him in the popcorn machine.""Hearn received the Gowdy Award in 1991 from the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, where he was inducted posthumously in 2003. Other honors include a place in the American Sportscasters Hall of Fame, three-time National Sportscaster of the Year, three-time Golden Mike award winner, Academy of Television Arts & Sciences 50th Anniversary Award, a 1965 Emmy Award for Excellence in Basketball Coverage, and a coveted star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.Pat Riley, a Hearn sidekick before hoisting four of those trophies as Showtime's head coach, told IBD from his office as president of the Miami Heat, ""There came a time when Chick Hearn was bigger than the game itself.""Riley credits Hearn with being his mentor and lauds him as a powerful ally in Pat's playing days.""I had just been cut from the Portland Trail Blazers,"" Riley recalled. ""It was 1970, I was newly married and deeply in debt. I was coming up through the tunnel after the game, and I saw Chick. I shook his hand and he said, 'I just heard the bad news, kid. Let me make a few calls and see what I can do.' And two days later, I was playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.""Illinois RiseBorn Francis Dayle Hearn (1916-2002) in Aurora, Ill., Chick acquired his nickname as an Amateur Athletic Union basketball player, with teammates placing a dead chicken in the shoe box that he though contained new sneakers.Chick went on to call a record 3,338 straight Lakers games, starting in November 1965 and ending in the middle of the 2001-02 season because of surgery. Then, two months after the Lakers' sweep of the Nets in the NBA Finals, he died after striking his head in a fall.Testament to his keen eye, Hearn is credited with the now-common tradition of estimating the distance of shots taken — long before on-screen metrics provided these measurements. He voiced-over 42 seasons, highlighted by nine Los Angeles titles and 33 victories in a row in its first title run of 1971-72.His razor-sharp yet folksy play-by-play was heard on the radio as well as via TV broadcasts. ""Chick taught Los Angeles about basketball,"" said Bob Ryan, retired sports columnist for the Boston Globe and frequent ESPN contributor, ""and he became part of the inner circle during those years when the Lakers were unstoppable.""Hearn calls became vintage.• On L.A. center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: ""Kareem's yo-yoing into the popcorn machine! The salt's out of the shaker on that one!""• If a player displayed showy but unproductive moves: ""Too much mustard on the hot dog.""• Traveling in the lane: ""A bunny-hop in the pea patch.""• Shots awry: ""Can't throw a pea in the ocean"" or ""Marge (his wife of almost 64 years) coulda made that shot"" or ""That guy couldn't beat the Sisters of Mercy.""• A minor bump that drew a whistle: ""Ticky-tack foul.""• A player nailed for deliberately reaching in: ""Caught with his hand in the cookie jar.""• The suavely suited Riley, who chewed hard when the action got hot: ""There goes GQ Riles, workin' the Wrigleys. It's nervous time.""Amid Showtime, owner Jerry Buss featured the lissome Laker Girls and a live band at the Fabulous Forum, and Tinseltown A-listers such as Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty and Dyan Cannon at courtside made a home game the hottest ticket in town.Still, Hearn retained his Midwestern authenticity and never went Hollywood, anchored by a stubborn work ethic.Hearn refused to call in sick until December 2001, when he went under the knife for a blocked aortic valve. Other than that, he missed only two games before his historic streak — once for weather, once for a conflicting assignment.Even when his greatest asset — his voice — was temporarily on ice with laryngitis on a few occasions, he announced the first half of the game and sat out the second.""Chick was the MVP of that team,"" said John Beyrooty who worked for Buss as director of public relations for Forum Boxing, broadcasting alongside Hearn at ring events in the mid-1980s. ""He treated the building janitor the same as he treated a CEO.""Eric Pincus, who writes about basketball for the Los Angeles Times, said: ""Oddly, it wasn't the television simulcast, but his radio broadcast that captured my imagination. He had a way of capturing the action in words, at his lightning pace, that both educated and entertained.""Riley recalls Hearn as ""one tough Irishman. After I retired, or thought I had retired, Chick called me on the phone and said, 'Get off the beach and go back to work!'""Magic TouchHearn clearly kept a soft spot for the purple and gold. Soon after his death at age 85, Showtime great Magic Johnson told ESPN: ""When I talked to Chick, a lot of times it was hardly about basketball. He was always so proud of me. I would get little notes from him. That would make me feel so good.""He could also dish out tough love. Pat Riley remarked on ESPN that Hearn ""was the man who taught me about discipline.""Mike Bresnahan, another writer for the Times, said of Chick: ""He was more than a homer or a booster, because he was never afraid to speak his mind. Looking back, you can just see the letdown in Magic's puppy-dog eyes when Chick called a bad play. Chick had far-reaching influence, and those players had to earn his respect.""Riley, who spent 2-1/2 years with Hearn in the broadcast booth before becoming L.A.'s coach, recalls the first time he saw Hearn lose his cool. The reason: Riley showed up an hour and half late at the Forum.""He was furious,"" Riley said. ""I never made him wait again.""Hearn didn't mess around. When they shared the booth, he made Riley arrive at 4 p.m. (""that seemed a little early to me,"" says Pat) to prepare for the 7 p.m. tipoff.To prepare, Hearn meticulously reviewed lettered cards identifying key statistics and other details that he had created with colored markers. Still before game time, ""We would call imaginary plays looking out over the empty court,"" Riley said. ""We would do fake interviews with each other to practice and warm up. Then he made me start writing up the cards, which were essentially blueprints of the teams.""Hearn Still HeardJeremy Treatman, the founder of Play By Play Sports Broadcasting Camps, where kids attend summer sessions in 10 cities to learn the trade, said: ""I always use Chick as an inspirational model for our campers. He had a fluid command of all the facts, yet he was original and always sounded like himself. And he filled in the spaces with natural storytelling.""After graduating from Bradley University in 1938, Hearn served in the Army in the South Pacific during World War II, then returned to Illinois as a sportscaster, doing play-by-play for an Amateur Athletic Union basketball team.Hearn arrived in Los Angeles in 1956, initially broadcasting USC football and basketball for CBS radio and NBC TV.By March 1961, he was broadcasting for the Lakers amid their first season in Los Angeles, shortly after the team relocated from Minneapolis. He married Marge that year, and they would have two children.The versatile Hearn also called bowling and golf events — plus did voice-over work for movies and voiced himself while calling a Lakers game for an episode of ""The Simpsons.""Hearn's presence continues to be felt in multiple ways throughout Los Angeles. When the Lakers moved from the Forum to the Staples Center in 1999, the press room was named in his honor, and nearby West 11th Street was renamed Chick Hearn Court. The adjacent Metro Blue Line rail station is called Pico-Chick Hearn depot, and his bronze likeness stands at Star Plaza outside Staples Center.Each year, the USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism awards two broadcast journalism students the Chick Hearn Memorial Scholarship.He was simply ""the best of the best,"" said Riley.Bresnahan noted: ""The end of Lakers ball was as much about Chick as Kareem, Magic and Riley. And as for Chick Hearn, he's an impossible act to follow. Who comes after Sinatra?""

491,ICE,"Striving to maintain some political relevance as the nation's focus shifts to choosing his successor, Barack Obama is using a brief visit to Alaska to portray America -- indeed, the entire planet -- in imminent, disastrous danger from global warming.The Democrat has long touted global warming as a serious threat. In May, he told military academy graduates that climate change is the greatest threat to U.S. national security. The president's analysis differs drastically from military leaders, who list Russia, North Korea, China and ISIS as the worst security threats facing the U.S. as Obama draws down its military forces.Even as Russia annexes Crimea, foments rebellion in Ukraine, sells arms to Iran and aggressively develops Arctic commerce and energy, Obama sees no developing confrontation. Obama did note in Alaska that Russia in recent years has built a fleet of 40 heavy icebreakers. The United States has one in service. Obama suggests building another.The president said addressing climate change is urgent and dismissed fears that more environmental controls and regulations would hurt the stumbling economy and jobs.The pattern of talking up a crisis as a means to control the nation's political agenda and provide a distraction from other news has been very familiar during these interminable 2,416 days of Obama's White House occupancy. Even if, in the end, little useful action ever ensues on such issues.But Obama's remarks in Alaska this week were by far his most apocalyptic to date. A sampling:

How sad nothing's changed since her death, and lawsuits are all citizens have left.After enduring a round of crocodile tears and flapdoodle from city officials — and a noticeable silence from the White House — it was obvious to the family of Kathryn Steinle, the 32-year-old woman gunned down in broad daylight by a five-times-deported illegal, that the powers that be in the sanctuary city of San Francisco and in the federal government would try to ignore the death of their daughter.After all, the San Francisco and federal governments encouraged the non-enforcement of immigration laws and were banking on the public forgetting how illegal aliens are committing heinous crimes with impunity against Americans, shielded by sanctuary city policies.Business as usual could go on. Or so they hoped.Except that the Steinles have decided not to let this one go. On Tuesday, they filed a lawsuit against the city of San Francisco, its sheriff Ross Mirkarimi, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and the Bureau of Land Management, whose insufficiently secured gun became the illegal's murder weapon.""We're frustrated,"" said Brad Steinle, the dead woman's brother, at a news conference on the steps of City Hall on Tuesday. ""Because the system failed our sister. And at this point, nobody has taken responsibility, accountability. And nothing has changed.""""We're here not only for Kate, we're here for every citizen of this country who comes to San Francisco,"" said her father, Jim Steinle. ""If you think this can't happen to you, think again.""He recalled how, strolling in broad daylight on a tourist pier in San Francisco last July, he watched as Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, with a long criminal career behind him, gunned his daughter down.The illegal later admitted to investigators that he was attracted to San Francisco for its sanctuary city policies.It's hard to argue with that. The Los Angeles Times excuses inaction on illegals committing crimes against Americans by hand-wringing about the ""the complexity"" of immigration laws.And in Congress, little has been done, even after this summer's testimony from the many victims of illegals.A no-brainer bill called ""Kate's Law,"" barring sanctuary cities from new federal grants and increasing penalties for already-deported illegals who re-enter the U.S., was passed in the House in late July.But it still awaits action in the Senate, amid pessimism that the president will sign it even if it passes.Already the measure shows a knee-jerk, party-line divide despite widespread public support for deportation of criminal illegals. Leftist commentators such as Univision's Jorge Ramos are now whipping up opposition to the bill, calling it ""unfair to immigrants.""Presumably they include the likes of Lopez-Sanchez.But as nothing gets done, an IBD-TIPP poll of 913 adults taken last week shows massive, bipartisan support for the mandatory deportation of illegals from the U.S. Some 59% of adults overall support it, including 64% of independents, 55% of moderates and even 40% of Hispanics among those numbers.The government's indifference can lead only to anger and resentment. The Steinle case is powerful, and officials know it. The state has an obligation to enforce its laws and defend its citizens, or its legitimacy is null.The Steinle case has so much merit that the counties surrounding San Francisco — Contra Costa, San Mateo and two others — have de facto dropped their sanctuary city policies for criminal illegals. They're now calling up ICE deportation teams whenever an illegal is about to be released from prison.That San Francisco hasn't done the same shows just how extremist — and out of touch — its position is.Apparently, only a lawsuit from a little guy can teach them. What a sorry state of affairs that immigration enforcement can be done now only by lawsuit. But we hope it's a lesson that they never forget.

493,ICE,"President Obama's weekly remarksHi, everybody. This Monday, I’m heading to Alaska for a three-day tour of the state.I’ve been looking forward to this for a long time. Not only because Alaska is one of the most beautiful places in a country that’s full of beautiful places — but because I’ll have several opportunities to meet with everyday Alaskans about what’s going on in their lives. I’ll travel throughout the state, meeting with Alaskans who live above the Arctic Circle, with Alaska natives, and with folks who earn their livelihoods through fishing and tourism. And I expect to learn a lot.One thing I’ve learned so far is that a lot of these conversations begin with climate change. And that’s because Alaskans are already living with its effects. More frequent and extensive wildfires. Bigger storm surges as sea ice melts faster. Some of the swiftest shoreline erosion in the world — in some places, more than three feet a year.Alaska’s glaciers are melting faster too, threatening tourism and adding to rising seas. And if we do nothing, Alaskan temperatures are projected to rise between six and twelve degrees by the end of the century, changing all sorts of industries forever.This is all real. This is happening to our fellow Americans right now. In fact, Alaska’s governor recently told me that four villages are in “imminent danger” and have to be relocated. Already, rising sea levels are beginning to swallow one island community.Think about that. If another country threatened to wipe out an American town, we’d do everything in our power to protect ourselves. Climate change poses the same threat, right now.That’s why one of the things I’ll do while I’m in Alaska is to convene other nations to meet this threat. Several Arctic nations have already committed to action. Since the United States and China worked together to set ambitious climate targets last year, leading by example, many of the world’s biggest emitters have come forward with new climate plans of their own. And that’s a good sign as we approach this December’s global climate negotiations in Paris.Now, one of the ways America is leading is by transitioning away from dirty energy sources that threaten our health and our environment, and by going all-in on clean, renewable energy sources like wind and solar. And Alaska has the natural resources to be a global leader in this effort.Now even as we accelerate this transition, our economy still has to rely on oil and gas. As long as that’s the case, I believe we should rely more on domestic production than on foreign imports, and we should demand the highest safety standards in the industry — our own. Still, I know there are Americans who are concerned about oil companies drilling in environmentally sensitive waters. Some are also concerned with my administration’s decision to approve Shell’s application to drill a well off the Alaskan coast, using leases they purchased before I took office. I share people’s concerns about offshore drilling. I remember the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico all too well.That’s precisely why my administration has worked to make sure that our oil exploration conducted under these leases is done at the highest standards possible, with requirements specifically tailored to the risks of drilling off Alaska. We don’t rubber-stamp permits. We made it clear that Shell has to meet our high standards in how they conduct their operations — and it's a testament to how rigorous we've applied those standards that Shell has delayed and limited its exploration off Alaska while trying to meet them. The bottom line is, safety has been and will continue to be my administration’s top priority when it comes to oil and gas exploration off America’s precious coasts — even as we push our economy and the world to ultimately transition off of fossil fuels. So I’m looking forward to talking with Alaskans about how we can work together to make America the global leader on climate change around the globe. And we’re going to offer unique and engaging ways for you to join me on this trip all week at WhiteHouse.gov/Alaska. Because what’s happening in Alaska is happening to us. It’s our wakeup call. And as long as I’m President, America will lead the world to meet the threat of climate change before it’s too late. Thanks, and have a great weekend. ####Previous weekly party remarks are available here.RELATED:Joe Biden: Will he or won't he?History predicts the 2016 GOP ticketIf the GOP picks Trump, kiss those Hispanic votes adiosCNN's methodology may deny Carly Fiorina a main stage podium

528,ICE,"Growth stock investors, take note: The future of some market winners may be driven by China's rapidly growing middle class. This section of the most populous country in the world is expected to offer big opportunities to companies able to tap into rising demand for a wide range of goods, from clothes to food to electronic gadgets.Jack Ma, the founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA), said in the company's annual report in October that China's middle-class population — now close to 300 million, or nearly the size of the entire U.S. — will grow to 500 million in the next decade.""China has an awesome consumer story,"" according to a post in May on the website of consulting firm McKinsey & Co. ""The reality is that Chinese consumers are going to continue to increase in wealth and complexity,"" said the report's authors, Jeffrey Towson, managing partner of investment firm Towson Capital, and Jonathan Woetzel, a director in McKinsey's Shanghai office.They added that Chinese consumers ""dwarf"" developing economies in nations such as Brazil, Russia and India in terms of household income.All of these countries get coverage in IBD's ""Global Leaders,"" today on Page B10.Retail Sales RisingHere's another fact to keep in mind: Ma says the level of consumption among the middle class is ""still well below their income level.""Chinese people tend to save much of what they earn because they lack retirement and health care safety nets.Nevertheless, retail sales jumped 11% in October from a year earlier to $445 billion, the biggest increase this year, according to the latest official data. Sales so far this year are running nearly 11% above last year's pace, led by a 35% jump in online sales.Ma has urged small and midsize Western companies to set up shop in China as the nation shifts from being an exporter to an importer that relies more on domestic consumption to fuel growth.Much of that consumption will be conducted online, which stands to benefit Alibaba and other online malls, such as JD.com (JD) and 58.com (WUBA).EMarketer, which tracks online commerce, says China is the world's biggest retail e-commerce market, estimating that it will account for just over 40% of global retail e-commerce sales this year.On Nov. 11 alone, Alibaba raked in $14.3 billion in the online shopping frenzy known as Singles' Day, an Alibaba creation that has far surpassed Cyber Monday as the world's biggest online shopping event.Costco Wholesale (COST) and Macy's (M) are among U.S. companies already selling to Chinese consumers through Alibaba. Other goods — such as apples from Washington state, seafood from Alaska and Ben & Jerry's ice cream — have also fared well in trials on Alibaba's TMall.com, according to news reports.Big OpportunitiesGoldman Sachs, in a 2015 report entitled ""The Rise of China's New Consumer Class,"" said only 11% of China's population has reached the middle class.""As their ranks swell, so will their effect on the global economy,"" Goldman said, adding, ""There will be huge opportunities for the entertainment, food service, technology and other industries"" able to understand Chinese consumer tastes and align pricing and product offerings accordingly.Cross-border purchases by China's online shoppers rose from less than $2 billion in 2010 to more than $20 billion in 2014, with the U.S. the destination of choice for clothing, personal care items and baby products, Bloomberg said April 21, citing eMarketer.Most Chinese consumers who engaged in cross-border shopping did so because they thought foreign merchants could assure better quality amid concerns about counterfeit goods on Chinese websites, eMarketer said on Sept. 22, citing the China Internet Network and Information Center.Alibaba itself has been hit by accusations that it hosts merchants selling fake goods, which prompted Ma to promise to eliminate counterfeits from the site.

531,ICE,"Immigration: During 2014's border surge, ICE handed over unaccompanied kids to what it claimed were ""relatives."" Turns out many ended up as slaves in human-trafficking dens. Is this a U.S.-subsidized smuggling racket?It certainly looks that way, seeing how the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement handed over a group of Guatemalan teenagers, entrusted to them by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to Arodolo Rigoberto Castillo-Serrano. He's an illegal alien who pleaded guilty Monday to falsely claiming to be a relative of the boys and easily gaining custody of them for his slave-labor egg farm in Marion, Ohio.Apparently, no one checked his claims about being related to the minors. Word got around to the human-trafficking community that it was open season for free slave labor as kids await their hearings in backlogged courts.It was a great deal for the smugglers and a policy victory for the Obama administration. But it was a terrible deal for the boys and an outrage for ordinary Americans who already know that border surges and enabling governments are ready-made for such criminality.The story came to light during last year's summer protests in Murrieta, Calif. Federal officials stated repeatedly that the illegal immigrants they were importing into that community without its consent were all going bus-bound for stays with ""relatives"" around the country. Official data later claimed that 90% of the 53,000 they released were placed with these ""relatives.""Turns out that quite a few were being handed off to the criminal syndicates that specialize in human slavery, based on claims of being relatives.How many? Well, the State Department admits that the border surge of 2014 was the result of a ""marketing campaign"" carried out by human-trafficking syndicates in Central America. Would-be illegals were advised that a loophole in immigration law being exploited by the Obama White House was to immediately deport Mexicans caught crossing our border illegally but not ""Other Than Mexicans,"" including Central Americans.The border surge then began, and the human-trafficking organizations raked in the profits.A 2003 estimate by professor Douglas S. Massey of the University of Pennsylvania put the profits from that illicit business at about $5 billion. At current prices, the profits could easily be $10 billion, and that's not counting the money earned from the subsequent slave labor once the immigrants are hauled off to the egg farms.What's more, human trafficking has expanded significantly since Obama stopped enforcing U.S. border laws. In the State Department's newly released ""Trafficking In Persons Report,"" which came out in late July, a chart shows that human trafficking has basically doubled from 2008 to 2014.Did most of the young, unaccompanied illegals fall into these human-trafficking rackets? The evidence suggests yes: A study by the Center for American Progress points out more than half of the unaccompanied minors were teenage boys, and less than a third were looking to reunite with relatives. The study suggests that the traffickers' false promises of (non-slave) work lured them.ICE, the State Department and other government agencies must have known that these scams were coming but did nothing — not because they didn't want to but because the White House has put winning the Latino vote for the Democrats above any other policy.A Reuters investigation released earlier this month pointed out that the State Department's list of human-trafficking violators was heavily manipulated for policy reasons — meaning, specifically, that Cuba and Mexico were removed from lists of nations that support smuggling networks.So political machinations have endangered the safety of these border-surge children, who are being lured by some of the most evil people on earth.

"
542,ICE,"Tudor (1783-1864) was the third son of a wealthy Boston lawyer and his wife. Frederic's older brother William would become a leading literary figure, founding the North American Review and dubbing Boston the Athens of America.
"
543,ICE,"Frederic took another path. He refused a chance to go to Harvard, and at 13 he became an apprentice at a store. He and another older brother, John, also made money exporting furniture to Havana.
"
544,ICE,"At 17, Frederic accompanied John on a voyage to Cuba, thinking that John's injured knee would heal in the tropical sun.
"
545,ICE,"What Frederic soon noticed was the lack of iced drinks. His family had an ice house back in Boston and chipped away at blocks to make ice cream. He began thinking of a way to bring ice to the tropics.
"
546,ICE,"When the boys returned to America, their father set Frederic up with friends at an import-export house, which helped the young man launch his wildly ambitious dream.
"
547,ICE,"In November 1805, Frederic sent William and a cousin to scout Caribbean entrepreneurs who might want to buy exclusive rights to the use of ice. But when Frederic arrived a few months later with 80 tons that had survived the voyage, none of the prospects would pay what he wanted, so he held out for better offers until it melted away.
"
548,ICE,"""The overwhelming majority of humans living in equatorial climes in 1800 would have literally never once experienced anything cold,"" wrote Steven Johnson in ""How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World."" ""The idea of frozen water would have been as fanciful to the residents of Martinique as an iPhone.""
"
549,ICE,"Johnson added, ""(Tudor) assumed the absolute novelty of ice would be a point in his favor. ... Instead, (it) received blank stares. ... The bleak pattern of the Martinique voyage would repeat itself in the years to come, with ever more catastrophic results. ... For most of his early adulthood, he was an abject failure, albeit one with remarkable tenacity.""
"
550,ICE,"In 1812, the Tudor family lost most of its assets thanks to the patriarch's bad investments and extravagant living. Frederic was sent to jail in March until he paid down some debt a month later. By June, the War of 1812 with Britain had begun, cutting off trade. Suddenly Frederic's plan of prospering in the Caribbean was put on ice.
"
551,ICE,"""At 26, after seven years of struggle, when he tallied up his gains and losses, Frederic found his assets, including properties, came to $28,400, but his liabilities amounted to $38,772, owed to a variety of people, including his blacksmith and tailor,"" wrote Carl Seaburg and Stanley Paterson in ""The Ice King."" ""Although he wasn't able to ship, his busy brain was not still at all. Turning around the ship design conventions of the time, Frederic modeled a shallow, rounded hull deepest at the bow, with a pronounced keel at the stern.
"
552,ICE,"""In maritime Boston, however, Frederic's novel concept attracted attention. ... By the spring of 1813, a new ship in his design had been constructed.""
"
553,ICE,"But trouble kept following him.
"
554,ICE,"As he was about to do a test sailing of what he called the Black Swan, Tudor was arrested for not paying a $300 debt. After posting bail, he took the ship on its maiden voyage, only to find that it wasn't likely to withstand the high seas.
"
555,ICE,"He spent the war years experimenting with:
"
556,ICE," Caskets that could keep ice frozen during voyages.

560,ICE,"Peace And Opportunity
"
561,ICE,"When the war ended in 1815, Tudor was able to negotiate cheap shipping rates; the barren soil of New England produced nothing of value to send to the tropics, leaving outbound vessels empty.
"
562,ICE,"""Most of the trade in natural goods involves material that thrives in high-energy environments,"" wrote Johnson. ""Sugar cane, coffee, tea, cotton — all these staples of 18th- and 19th-century commerce were dependent on the blistering heat of tropical and subtropical climates. ... The cash crops of the tropics caused populations to swell in climates that could be unforgivably hot, which in turn created a market for a product that allowed you to escape the heat. ... That was Tudor's great insight.""
"
563,ICE,"Underlying Tudor's challenge were the massive problems of slow transportation and communication, as well as the lack of financial liquidity and easy borrowing in the pre-20th century economy.
"
564,ICE,"From 1816 to 1824, the Ice King had dramatic ups and downs:
"
565,ICE," Tried to ship tropical fruit back under ice, but most of it rotted.
"
566,ICE," Didn't have enough money to bribe every Cuban official necessary to build storage depots and kept having to start over.
"
567,ICE," Set up partnerships with family friends in Charleston, S.C., and Savannah, Ga.
"
568,ICE," Withstood customer deaths when yellow fever periodically raged through warm regions.
"
569,ICE," Saw his ships full of ice sink.
"
570,ICE," Employed incompetent workers and crooked agents.
"
571,ICE," Had to hire someone in a warm New England winter to go to Labrador, Canada, to cut up an iceberg and haul it to Martinique.
"
572,ICE," Suffered through an economic depression in 1818-19 that dried up credit and customers.

"
578,ICE,"Railroads sped up ice delivery. One track ran near Concord, Mass.; in 1847, Tudor's men cut ice out of Walden Pond and disturbed Henry David Thoreau as he conducted his experiment in self-sufficiency.
"
579,ICE,"By 1850, Tudor and his competitors were shipping 100,000 tons of ice a year. In the 1860s, two-thirds of homes in Boston and New York got daily ice deliveries.

582,ICE,"""Tudor changed the very nature of American consumer culture by altering not only what people ate and drank, but when they did,"" said Schweikart.Frederic Tudor knew the world would crave cold drinks if he could deliver ice during hot weather. But in the early 19th century, there was no easy way to cut ice out of ponds in winter and keep it frozen for fast delivery to warm areas.Tudor was undaunted.At 23, he bought a brig (a two-masted, square-rigged ship) to carry ice from Boston to the Caribbean. Insulating the ship with straw and wood shavings, he arrived to find no one interested.Tudor lost $4,500 (equivalent to $90,000 today), and his next several tries were even worse disasters.Over the next 15 years, he was repeatedly arrested for debt, paid bail and stayed one step ahead of creditors until he became one of the richest men of the era.""No one had thought of harvesting New England wintertime ice and marketing it as a table necessity,"" Salvatore Basile, author of ""Cool: How Air Conditioning Changed Everything,"" told IBD.

610,ICE,"Islamic terrorists have maimed and murdered hundreds of people in Paris, dozens in Mali, thousands in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. is next, they promise.Unwelcome in Arab countries, Middle East refugees are streaming to Europe and America, where high tax rates, over-regulation and rising prices for unreliable renewable energy are fueling debt and impacting jobs, industries, economic growth, government revenues and efforts to accommodate the migrants.But still President Obama insists that climate change poses the gravest threat to our planet, national security and future generations. He led a 500-person entourage to Paris, joining 40,000 political leaders, bureaucrats, activists and journalists. The president wants binding emission reductions, far beyond what his Environmental Protection Agency and other factors have already achieved in the U.S.Paris conferees say further greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions are essential to hold global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius (3.5 F) and prevent climate and weather disasters resulting from fossil fuel use. But these cataclysms exist only in computer models, press releases and treaty discussions.In the real world, global temperatures haven't risen in 19 years; no category 3-5 hurricane has struck the U.S. in a record 10 years; sea levels are rising at barely 7 inches per century; and Greenland and Antarctic ice are at record levels.Earth's climate changes regularly, but recent trends and events are in line with historic experience, and many scientists believe the sun and other powerful natural forces may soon usher in a new era of colder temperatures.Fossil fuels facilitated successive industrial revolutions and enabled billions to live better than royalty did a century ago, average incomes to increase elevenfold, and average global life expectancy to climb from less than 30 in 1870 to 71 today.Carbon and hydrocarbon energy still provide 81% of world energy, and support $70 trillion per year in world GDP. They will supply 75%-80% of global energy for decades to come, studies by the Energy Information Administration, International Energy Agency and others forecast.More than 2,400 coal-fired power plants are under construction or planned around the world. China and India will not consider reducing GHG emissions until 2030. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels will continue to climb, greening the planet and spurring faster crop, forest and grassland growth.As they discuss binding vs. voluntary emission targets and how to compel developed nations to contribute to a $100-billion-per-year Green Climate Fund, the Paris treaty talks largely ignore these inconvenient realities — and whitewash the adverse consequences of anti-hydrocarbon policies.For example, news stories often say the proposed climate treaty seeks GHG reductions of 80% below predicted emission levels for 2050. The true target is 80% below actual 1990 levels.That means they require carbon dioxide (and fossil fuel energy) reductions of 96% below currently forecasted 2050 levels, based on projected increases in world populations, economic growth and living standards.Because there is a strong causal relationship between GDP and fossil energy consumption, eliminating that much energy would reduce 2050 world per capita GDP to less than what Americans ""enjoyed"" in 1830! Modern technologies would still exist, but few would be able to afford them.Moreover, current 2050 forecasts already assume and incorporate significant energy efficiency and de-carbonization over the next three decades. They are not ""business as usual"" or extrapolations of past trends. Further CO2 reductions beyond those already incorporated into the forecasts would thus be increasingly difficult, expensive and indeed impossible to achieve.In fact, attempting to reach U.N.-recommended GHG and energy reductions by 2050 would be catastrophic. What is being promoted in Paris would be destructive to jobs, health and welfare in developed countries — and lethal to millions in poor nations, who would be denied the blessings of electricity and fossil fuels for decades to come. That is indefensible, inhumane and immoral.The EPA's own analyses suggest that its fully implemented Clean Power Plan would bring an undetectable, irrelevant reduction of perhaps 0.05 degrees F in average global temperatures 85 years from now — assuming that carbon dioxide actually does drive climate change.What's being discussed in Paris would have similarly minimal effects. But it would let unelected, unaccountable activists and bureaucrats decide which industries, companies, workers and families win the Climate Hustle game — and which ones lose.Congress must send a clear message to the Paris delegates — now, during the COP21 conference.It must say the U.S. will reject and not be legally bound by any ""accord"" that Obama might sign, that some might argue obligates the U.S. to slash its energy use and transfer billions of taxpayer dollars annually to dictators, bureaucrats and crony industrialists in poor countries.• Bezdek is an energy analyst and president of Management Information Services Inc. in Washington, D.C.• Driessen is senior policy analyst for the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow and author of ""Eco-Imperialism: Green Power — Black Death.""

"
614,ICE,"In announcing EPA's new so-called ""Clean Power Plan"" regulations, President Obama repeatedly told us that by restricting power plant emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the plan would ""cut carbon pollution."" But that repeated phrase ""carbon pollution"" reveals fundamental, disqualifying ignorance.Carbon dioxide is a naturally present, trace gas (0.04% of the atmosphere) essential to the survival of all life on the planet. It promotes photosynthesis in plants, which is the foundation of the food chain for all plant and animal life. Without CO2, plants would die, and consequently so would all animal life, including humans. So CO2 cannot conceivably in any sense be called ""pollution.""""Scientists have known since the 1800s that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide trap heat, and that burning fossil fuels releases those gases,"" Obama says. ""But in the late 1950s, the National Weather Service began measuring the levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere ... and what they've found, year after year, is that the levels of carbon pollution in our atmosphere have increased dramatically.""But what the president does not tell you is that the U.S. government also has satellites circling the Earth that measure the global temperature of the atmosphere 24/7. And what that incorruptible satellite temperature record shows is that there's been no increase in global atmospheric temperatures for almost 19 years now.Soon that period of no global warming will be longer than the period of actual global warming, due to natural causes, which lasted only 20 years, from the late 1970s to the late 1990s. Before that was 30 years of global cooling.Bottom line: Increased CO2 does have some warming effect. But experience shows it is not nearly as powerful in raising global temperatures as the alarmists have claimedThe only documented significant effect of higher CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is increased agricultural production worldwide, as increased CO2 causes plants to grow faster. That is why sharply higher CO2 concentrations are pumped into actual greenhouses. More CO2 in the air is literally causing a new greening of the planet.Obama told supporters in 2008 that ""under my (climate change) plan, electricity costs will necessarily skyrocket."" If you want to build a new coal-fired power plant you still can, he explained. But under the costs of his regulatory sanctions against America's coal industry, you'll go bankrupt.John Holdren, Obama's White House science adviser, elaborated: ""We need to de-develop the United States to bring our economic system into line with the realities of ecology and the global resource situation."" The EPA's new Clean Power Plan is well designed to accomplish precisely that.America is blessed with the world's largest natural supply of coal, an estimated 300 years' worth. Coal is also the cheapest means of producing electricity (except when the much vilified technological breakthrough of ""fracking"" produces such vast supplies of natural gas that the price of that falls effectively close to zero).So if Obama's regulatory sanctions against U.S. energy are to force abandonment of carbon-based ""fossil fuels,"" the costs of our energy and electricity will necessarily skyrocket.But skyrocketing costs for energy and electricity will have a ""disparate impact"" on precisely the poor and low-income blacks and Hispanics, as those increased costs will constitute a higher percentage of their lower incomes. Which under the civil rights theories of Obama's own Justice Department, would mean his EPA Clean Power Plan constitutes illegal discrimination.As a new report from the National Black Chamber of Commerce documents, EPA's new regulatory requirements will result in estimated job losses reaching 7 million for blacks and 12 million for Hispanics, with the poverty rate increasing by more than 23% for blacks and 26% for Hispanics.That's because the rules will ultimately more than double the cost of natural gas and electricity, adding over $1 trillion to family and business energy bills.""A lot of people on the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum are going to die,"" says Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V. African-American author Dineen Borelli calls EPA's overregulation ""the green movement's new Jim Crow."" National Black Chamber of Commerce President Harry Alford calls the EPA's regulatory overkill ""a slap in the face to poor and minority families.""As for global warming, growing published literature worldwide indicates based on patterns of sunspot activity that the Earth is approaching a period of sustained global cooling comparable to the Little Ice Age that prevailed for hundreds of years between roughly 1350 to 1850 A.D. Ferrara is a senior fellow at the Heartland Institute.

623,ICE,"War on Cops: Even as violent crime spreads like wildfire across U.S. cities, President Obama advises police to ""de-escalate"" encounters with suspects and find ""alternatives to arrest."" Spoken like a man with a protective detail.Not to mention a radical agenda impervious to reality.On Tuesday, the president spoke to the International Association of Chiefs of Police in Chicago. There, he and his attorney general handed out a guidebook published by his Task Force on 21st Century Policing. The 30-page guide, titled ""Moving from Recommendations to Action,"" is designed to help local police departments implement his ""criminal justice reforms.""Under the section, ""Changing the Culture of Policing,"" the document recommends that cops give more ""voice"" to minority suspects, treating them with ""dignity and respect,"" while checking their own ""implicit"" cultural and racial biases. In other words, more listening and less cuffing.""Agencies should acknowledge the role of policing in past and present injustice and discrimination, and how it is a hurdle to the promotion of community trust,"" the White House pamphlet strongly advises.To help build that trust, Obama earlier this week proposed that cops drive ice cream trucks into high-crime areas and hand out free ice cream cones to suspected drug dealers.Apparently, they have started doing it in riot-torn Baltimore, and the president really liked the idea.""I do want all the chiefs to look at the task force recommendations we've put forward post-Ferguson,"" Obama said. ""There are some real problems in certain jurisdictions that we've seen.""That's a not-so-veiled threat. His Justice Department already has launched investigations of two dozen allegedly racist police forces. Other departments are falling in line, also adopting more lenient policies.But Obama is pushing for more of what his own FBI director — and even his former chief of staff — complain is causing record high murders to break out in inner cities across the country.FBI chief James Comey said that cops are so worried about offending minority suspects and triggering a complaint that could get them disciplined by brass — or worse, investigated by civil-rights prosecutors — that they are ""reluctant to get out of their cars to do the work that controls violent crime.""Police, he says, are no longer questioning the thugs with guns standing on the street corner at 1 a.m., even though ""lives are saved when those potential killers are confronted by a strong police presence.""""A chill wind"" is blowing, Comey said, ""and that wind is surely changing (police) behavior"" on the street.His concerns echo those of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who complained that Chicago cops are curtailing arrests and heightening racial sensitivity to avoid post-Ferguson investigations. And it's resulting in under-policing and alarming spikes in homicides.""They have pulled back,"" he said in a meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch that he thought was closed to the press. ""They don't want their career ended early.""Emanuel then implored Lynch to back the nation's police officers.But she and her boss aren't listening.That's because Obama is pursuing an agenda broader than policing police for bias.He is trying to federalize policing through new restrictions on investigating and apprehending suspects. His real goal is to reduce the level of incarcerations nationwide.Make no mistake, this de-incarceration policy was in the works long before Michael Brown's death. Ferguson was just a convenient pretext for putting Obama's agenda in high gear. It dates back to his days as an Illinois state senator, when he led efforts to ban criminal profiling.This is a recipe for the national crime wave that we predicted on Jan. 12, 2009 (""The Coming Crime Wave""), as Obama was about to be sworn in. Then, we editorialized, ""Obama may have to deal with a crime wave the likes of which we haven't seen in decades,"" thanks to his soft-on-crime urban policies.Regrettably, crime was an issue left undebated during the last two presidential races. It should move front and center this campaign.

644,ICE,"The divergence theme in currency markets that we've been discussing was in full swing over the last couple of weeks. The People's Bank of China (PBoC) delivered a fresh round of stimulus, the European Central Bank (ECB) all but guaranteed more <href=""#quantitative%20easing%20%28qe%29"">quantitative easing in December, and the Federal Reserve (Fed) narrowed the markets' sights to its December 17 meeting for the first <href=""#rate%20hike"">rate hike. On November 6, the Fed's view was corroborated by an extremely strong labor report that showed a 271,000 increase in payrolls. With other major central banks easing and the Fed looking to hike rates, the U.S. dollar strengthened broadly. In fact, the <href=""#bloomberg%20dollar%20spot%20index%20%28bbdxy%29"">Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index (BBDXY) recently powered through the previous cycle highs of March 2015. With the trend in dollar appreciation potentially resuming, where are markets likely to head next?Your Dollar Index MattersAn interesting development in recent weeks is that signals from the <href=""#ice%20u.s.%20dollar%20index%20%28dxy%29"">ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) and the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index are pointing toward different conclusions. Unlike BBDXY, DXY remains nearly 2% below its previous peak.1 As we have argued previously, DXY is, for all intents and purposes, a measure of the yen and the euro. While this concentrated bet led to a strong performance in 2014, when we attempt to assess the standing of the dollar in the global economy (and investor portfolios), it is likely much more intuitive to look not only at the developed world, but emerging markets as well.Through our partnership with Bloomberg we believe our approach, provides a more intuitive measure of the dollar for today's global economy. By focusing not only on global currency <href=""#liquidity"">liquidity, but also basing our methodology on the amount of trade between the U.S. and these foreign countries, we believe our approach helps answer the question of the U.S. dollar's actual value.What Currencies Are Driving the Rally?With BBDXY reaching fresh highs and DXY still consolidating, it is important to understand what currencies are ultimately driving performance. As illustrated below, since the previous index highs were set in March 2015, the euro, the British pound, and the Swiss franc are currently all trading above their cycle lows.2 While the euro and the yen may be poised to fall further on the back of increases in QE, weakness in commodity currencies has been the primary contributor to BBDXY's relative outperformance. Leading currencies lower was the Brazilian real, which fell by over 16%. Similarly, the Mexican peso and the Australian dollar both declined by 8.1% and 7.2%, respectively. Given that DXY does not have exposure to these currencies, this is the primary driver of performance deviation over the last eight months. Among the majors, zero foreign currencies have appreciated against the U.S. dollar year-to-date.U.S. Dollar vs. Major CurrenciesWhile short-term performance deviations can occur, we thought it would also be interesting to understand the net impact of dollar strength since the dollar bottomed on July 26, 2011. Since then, BBDXY strengthened by 34.4%, compared to a 34.3% gain for DXY. Over that period, the Chinese yuan (+0.7%) has been the only foreign currency to strengthen against the U.S. dollar. Among the losers, commodity currencies generally fell faster than others, with the exception of the Japanese yen. While commodity prices have recently shown some signs of stabilization, greater comfort with the growth outlook for China may be an equally important determinant of the future path of these currencies. In response to signaling from the ECB and the Fed, Goldman Sachs recently reiterated its call that the euro could fall to parity with the U.S. dollar by the end of 2015.3 Should this occur, we believe BBDXY could rise another 3% to 5% by the end of the year.In our view, divergence in <href=""#monetary%20policy"">monetary policy remains the principal driver in our outlook for dollar strength heading into 2016. As a result, investors could consider currency-hedged equity strategies or outright long-dollar positions via bullish U.S. dollar strategies.1As of 10/31/15, BBDXY had the following 10 exposures: EUR 31.6%, JPY 18.8%, CAD 11.5%, GBP 9.5%, MXN 9.7%, AUD 6.1%, CHF 4.3%, KRW 3.4%, CNH 3.0%, BRL 2.2%; DXY had the following 6 exposures: EUR 57.6%, JPY 13.6%, GBP 11.9%, CAD 9.1%, SEK 4.2%, CHF 3.6%.

650,ICE,"Justice: Another murder of an American by an illegal, another shrug from our nation's leaders. A local police chief was right to see a ""trail of blood"" from the latest killing and those who made the killer's spree possible.Speaking to Fox News' Greta van Susteren, Santa Maria, Calif., police chief Ralph Martin denounced the rape, torture and murder of Marilyn Pharis in her bed by an undeported illegal alien with a long record of violent crime, saying, ""I am not remiss to say that, from Washington, D.C., to Sacramento, there is a blood trail into the bedroom of Marilyn Pharis.""Martin pointed out that the ""brutal and vicious attack"" of the 64-year-old Air Force veteran in her home was the result of federal and state governments that work almost as a tag team. Each uses the other's laws as reasons for refusing to act against criminal illegals, and both sides write off the inevitable crimes that result as just a case of a criminal ""falling through the cracks.""As a result, hundreds of Americans are being killed by hardened criminals who should not be in this country, with no effort to halt them. If the broad-daylight killing of 32-year-old Kate Steinle as she strolled with her father on a tourist pier in San Francisco wasn't sickening enough, the alleged rape, torture and murder by Victor Aureliano Martinez-Ramirez may be more horrific.Martinez-Ramirez had been let out of jail just a few days earlier on a drug and violence offense, with no detainer issued by the Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He'd been arrested six times for similar offenses in the last 15 months in Santa Maria alone, and an unknown number of times elsewhere.Sadly, he was protected by Santa Maria's sanctuary city laws, shielded by state laws blocking the Feds. Like others, he was eligible for free education and college tuition, could get a driver's license and subsidized health care, and no matter what he did, his immigration status provided protection.Combine it with the White House's refusal to enforce immigration laws, even against violent criminals — some 30,000 have been released in the U.S. to prey on citizens — and it's no surprise he concluded that he could do what he wanted with total impunity.""We can all point fingers locally at each other,"" said Martin. ""ICE can point the finger at the sheriff, they can point it everywhere else, but the reality is it starts at the very top, and it's not going to get fixed until it gets started at the very top and reached the local levels.""That's where the trail of blood leads, and it's time to hold the White House accountable.

683,ICE,"Climate Change: Looking at the list of projected outcomes of global warming is a journey into the absurd. And with every addition, the loopiness grows. Now they tell us climate change means less sexual activity.'Climate Change,"" a Bloomberg headline screamed Monday, ""Kills The Mood.""The report goes on to say that a National Bureau of Economic Research paper claims ""hot weather leads to diminished 'coital frequency.' """"Three economists studied 80 years of U.S. fertility and temperature data and found that when it's hotter than 80 degrees Fahrenheit, a large decline in births follows within 10 months,"" says Bloomberg.Global warming — it's a scourge that knows no bounds. What other problems will it cause?Well, there's going to be worse traffic in Los Angeles, with all those immigrants moving north to escape the heat, and more UFO sightings in the United Kingdom.But these are just mild problems compared to other issues that forecasters say will be caused by climate change, such as cow infertility, confused migrating birds, severe acne and beer that tastes different.Of course no list of global warming problems is complete with the contradictory consequences: bigger harvests and smaller harvests, shrinking forests and expanding forests, more fog and less fog in San Francisco, increased and decreased ocean salinity, growing Antarctic ice and receding Antarctic ice, and increased snowfall and decreased snowfall.Finally, there are the happy things that global warming is predicted to bring: the Loch Ness monster will die,new islands will emerge, the pirate population will fall, and seals will mate more.Of all these, the death of the Loch Ness monster is the most appealing. In the meantime, the other myth we want to die is the one that says we're burning up our planet through carbon-dioxide emissions.
"
684,ICE,"Weather: Activists are warning that the upcoming United Nations climate conference is the last chance to save the world. Fair enough. So if no deal is reached at the meeting, can we please stop hearing about global warming?The 21st session of the Conference of Parties to the U.N.'s Framework Convention on Climate Change starts Nov. 30 and will ponderously drag on until Dec. 11. Call it the ""Last Chance in Paris,"" because that's what the fearmongers, from the Vatican to Prince Charles, believe it is.Of course we've heard all this before.It seems as if every time there's a U.N. climate conference, we hear the warnings: It's the final opportunity to save Earth, the ""last chance."" Consider these caveats: In 2001, Time magazine said the U.N.'s Bonn conference was ""a global warming treaty's last chance."" Four years later, activist Mark Lynas wrote in an open letter that the Montreal climate summit represented ""a last chance for action."" Before the 2007 meeting in Bali, Tony Juniper of Friends of the Earth declared that the conference ""could be the last chance to avoid the worst effect of global warming."" Australian environmental scientist Tim Flannery said in 2008 that the Poland ""round of negotiations is likely to be our last chance as a species to deal with the problem."" Then before Copenhagen in 2009, European Union Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said that conference was ""the world's last chance to stop climate change before it passes the point of no return.""We could go on. The warnings have continued every year since without fail. So it's unlikely we've heard the last of the ""last chance"" warnings, even if no agreement is reached in Paris.But we should have.There's a growing stack of evidence that contradicts the alarmists' warnings and refutes the scientific ""consensus"" that man is overheating his planet with carbon-dioxide emissions.Start with NASA's recent finding that Antarctica is actually gaining ice, not losing it, and the fact that the North Pole has not been ice-free in any summer although climate extremist Al Gore claimed it would be by now.Then move on to the global warming models used to predict climate calamity. They have been about as accurate as wild guesses.Why has this happened? Maybe because, as Australian electrical engineer David Evans discovered through mathematical calculation, CO2 is not as strong of a greenhouse gas as the U.N. says it is.Evans found that it's about ""a fifth or 10th"" of what activists claim it is, having ""caused less than 20% of global warming in the last few decades.""Related to the flawed models is the measured reality that Earth hasn't warmed in 16 to 18 years.Other events and circumstances that hurt the warming narrative include: doctored data used by alarmists; admissions by former activists that they either overestimated temperature increases or were simply altogether wrong; and the work of credible scientists that goes hard against the warming claims.None of these counter-examples will move the activists from their position. They will continue to agitate for government-enforced limits on CO2 emissions and lecture us about how we live.Their last chance should have come long ago, but now it looks as if they will never run out of them.
"
685,ICE,"As he drove across Nebraska in the bitter winter of 1962, Bob Devaney tried not to panic. Only months before, he had been lured from Wyoming to rebuild the University of Nebraska's crumbling football team.
"
686,ICE,"Now, on his first swing through the state, he questioned his move.
"
687,ICE,"""I thought I'd made a mistake,"" he said years later.
"
688,ICE,"The Cornhuskers had lost 125 games in the previous 20 years — second most in the country.
"
689,ICE,"They hadn't won a conference championship in 21 years and had appeared in just two bowl games in their long history — both losses.
"
690,ICE,"Money was an even bigger problem. The university car that Devaney drove that day was like an ice box, and funds were so low, he and assistant coach Cletus Fischer had to share a motel room.
"
691,ICE,"""I was wondering why I left Wyoming,"" Devaney said. ""At least there I had a car with heat and a radio in it. And Clete snored.""
"
692,ICE,"Overcoming his doubts, Devaney quickly got down to the business of building a football dynasty.
"
693,ICE,"In 11 remarkable seasons, his teams went 101-20-2, won eight Big Eight titles, six bowl games and two national championships.
"
694,ICE,"In the process, he turned the state into a legendary football hotbed.
"
695,ICE,"Packing 'Em In
"
696,ICE,"Before Devaney, Memorial Stadium in Lincoln seated 38,000 and was rarely sold out.
"
697,ICE,"When he stepped aside in 1972 for his hand-picked successor, Tom Osborne, the stadium held 72,000; it now seats 87,000.
"
698,ICE,"""You hate to say college football defines a state. Some people would chafe at that,"" Mike Babcock, a longtime Nebraska sportswriter and author or editor of 11 books on the Huskers, told IBD. ""But Bob Devaney had a lot to do with how this state got its identity.""
"
699,ICE,"Devaney didn't slip into the shadows after being replaced by Osborne. As athletic director, he used his charm and influence to modernize the athletic department, creating a model plant on campus.
"
700,ICE,"""The buildings were terrible,"" Devaney said in the 1990s. ""Now we've got some of the best facilities ... in the country.
"
701,ICE,"""We've got a sports center because I got the legislature to pass a three-quarters of a cent tax on cigarettes. I used to lobby those guys. I used to play cards with them and drink with them. I got the legislature to pass it over a veto.""
"
702,ICE,"Born in Saginaw, Mich., Devaney (1915-97) worked three years in a foundry to earn tuition to nearby Alma College, where he captained the football team in the late 1930s.
"
703,ICE,"For 14 seasons, he coached football at four Michigan high schools. At 37, unable to land a college job, he gave serious thought to quitting.
"
704,ICE,"""I had made up my mind that if a break didn't come before I was 40, I was going to go back and get my master's degree and take a boring administrative job somewhere,"" he said in his 1981 book, ""Devaney.""
"
705,ICE,"Then Michigan State saved the day. It hired him as an assistant coach, and Devaney helped guide the Spartans from 1953 to 1956.
"
706,ICE,"From there it was on to Wyoming, where as head coach from 1957 to 1961, he steered the Cowboys to a 35-10-5 record while dominating the Skyline Conference.
"
707,ICE,"Meanwhile, losses and fan indifference were mounting in Nebraska, where even the coach had a grim view of the future.
"
708,ICE,"""I've been watching things closely,"" Bill Jennings told an Omaha business crowd in 1960, ""and I don't think this state can ever be great in anything — there are so few people.""
"
709,ICE,"Devaney quickly dashed that theory when he took the helm in 1962. An upset triumph at Big Ten power Michigan in Week 2 put Nebraska in national play.
"
710,ICE,"""He knew that game could give Nebraska instant credibility — beating a Big Ten team at their place,"" Babcock said. ""He and his coaches focused on that game. They knew Michigan wasn't a very good team that year.""
"
711,ICE,"A few weeks later, Nebraska sold out a home game with Missouri. The Cornhuskers lost that one, but it kicked off a sellout streak that continues today.
"
712,ICE,"With a 36-34 victory over Miami in the Gotham Bowl, Devaney finished his first season 9-2, Nebraska's best record since 1905.
"
713,ICE,"The Huskers then pieced together four Big Eight titles, meeting Alabama for a national championship after the 1965 season. A 39-28 loss to the Crimson Tide did little to dent Devaney's rising national reputation — or celebrated charisma.
"
714,ICE,"""He was an extremely engaging person with a great sense of humor,"" Babcock said. ""He was a great speaker, very comfortable in public and a tremendous ambassador for the program.
"
715,ICE,"""Bob was just a down-home guy. He lived in the same house from the time he got here to the time he went into a care facility. It wasn't an ostentatious house, nothing like it. You could walk up to the front door and ring the doorbell.""
"
716,ICE,"Between Devaney's steamroller teams and live-wire personality, Memorial Stadium became the place to be on Saturday afternoons, forcing the university to expand one end zone in 1964, the other one in 1965, and finally to enclose the entire stadium two years later.
"
717,ICE,"Fiery Fandom

728,ICE,"Nebraska won nine games in 1969 and crowned the season with a 45-6 rout of Georgia in the Sun Bowl.
"
729,ICE,"By 1970, Devaney's Huskers were ready to stand atop all of college football. They went 11-0-1, and — after top-ranked Texas fell to Notre Dame on New Year's Day — finished atop the AP poll.
"
730,ICE,"Nebraska opened the 1971 season ranked No. 2, climbed to No. 1 after swamping Oregon in the opener, and edged No. 2 Oklahoma 35-31 in what many called the Game of the Century, starring Johnny Rodgers with a 72-yard punt return for a touchdown.

"
739,ICE,"""Duffy Daugherty (the former Michigan State coach) used to call my dad the Pied Piper, and I think that's what he was,"" Mike Devaney — one of two children Bob and Phyllis had — said at the unveiling. ""He could sit down and talk to anybody. He could be singing Irish songs in a pub with his friends, or he could be in a kid's home singing hymns with his mom. Dad always seemed to know what to do at the right time.""As he drove across Nebraska in the bitter winter of 1962, Bob Devaney tried not to panic. Only months before, he had been lured from Wyoming to rebuild the University of Nebraska's crumbling football team.Now, on his first swing through the state, he questioned his move.""I thought I'd made a mistake,"" he said years later.The Cornhuskers had lost 125 games in the previous 20 years — second most in the country.They hadn't won a conference championship in 21 years and had appeared in just two bowl games in their long history — both losses.Money was an even bigger problem. The university car that Devaney drove that day was like an ice box, and funds were so low, he and assistant coach Cletus Fischer had to share a motel room.""I was wondering why I left Wyoming,"" Devaney said. ""At least there I had a car with heat and a radio in it. And Clete snored.""Overcoming his doubts, Devaney quickly got down to the business of building a football dynasty.In 11 remarkable seasons, his teams went 101-20-2, won eight Big Eight titles, six bowl games and two national championships.In the process, he turned the state into a legendary football hotbed.Packing 'Em InBefore Devaney, Memorial Stadium in Lincoln seated 38,000 and was rarely sold out.When he stepped aside in 1972 for his hand-picked successor, Tom Osborne, the stadium held 72,000; it now seats 87,000.""You hate to say college football defines a state. Some people would chafe at that,"" Mike Babcock, a longtime Nebraska sportswriter and author or editor of 11 books on the Huskers, told IBD. ""But Bob Devaney had a lot to do with how this state got its identity.""Devaney didn't slip into the shadows after being replaced by Osborne. As athletic director, he used his charm and influence to modernize the athletic department, creating a model plant on campus.""The buildings were terrible,"" Devaney said in the 1990s. ""Now we've got some of the best facilities ... in the country.""We've got a sports center because I got the legislature to pass a three-quarters of a cent tax on cigarettes. I used to lobby those guys. I used to play cards with them and drink with them. I got the legislature to pass it over a veto.""Born in Saginaw, Mich., Devaney (1915-97) worked three years in a foundry to earn tuition to nearby Alma College, where he captained the football team in the late 1930s.For 14 seasons, he coached football at four Michigan high schools. At 37, unable to land a college job, he gave serious thought to quitting.""I had made up my mind that if a break didn't come before I was 40, I was going to go back and get my master's degree and take a boring administrative job somewhere,"" he said in his 1981 book, ""Devaney.""Then Michigan State saved the day. It hired him as an assistant coach, and Devaney helped guide the Spartans from 1953 to 1956.From there it was on to Wyoming, where as head coach from 1957 to 1961, he steered the Cowboys to a 35-10-5 record while dominating the Skyline Conference.Meanwhile, losses and fan indifference were mounting in Nebraska, where even the coach had a grim view of the future.""I've been watching things closely,"" Bill Jennings told an Omaha business crowd in 1960, ""and I don't think this state can ever be great in anything — there are so few people.""Devaney quickly dashed that theory when he took the helm in 1962. An upset triumph at Big Ten power Michigan in Week 2 put Nebraska in national play.""He knew that game could give Nebraska instant credibility — beating a Big Ten team at their place,"" Babcock said. ""He and his coaches focused on that game. They knew Michigan wasn't a very good team that year.""A few weeks later, Nebraska sold out a home game with Missouri. The Cornhuskers lost that one, but it kicked off a sellout streak that continues today.With a 36-34 victory over Miami in the Gotham Bowl, Devaney finished his first season 9-2, Nebraska's best record since 1905.The Huskers then pieced together four Big Eight titles, meeting Alabama for a national championship after the 1965 season. A 39-28 loss to the Crimson Tide did little to dent Devaney's rising national reputation — or celebrated charisma.""He was an extremely engaging person with a great sense of humor,"" Babcock said. ""He was a great speaker, very comfortable in public and a tremendous ambassador for the program.""Bob was just a down-home guy. He lived in the same house from the time he got here to the time he went into a care facility. It wasn't an ostentatious house, nothing like it. You could walk up to the front door and ring the doorbell.""Between Devaney's steamroller teams and live-wire personality, Memorial Stadium became the place to be on Saturday afternoons, forcing the university to expand one end zone in 1964, the other one in 1965, and finally to enclose the entire stadium two years later.Fiery Fandom""At one point, there was talk of building a stadium between Lincoln and Omaha that would seat 100,000,"" Babcock said.

767,ICE,"Border: Recent busts of murderous MS-13 gangsters put the lie to President Obama's sympathetic amnesty narrative of illegal immigrants as ""workers who mow our lawns, make our beds (and) clean out bedpans.""Authorities Wednesday rounded up 37 MS-13 gang members in Charlotte, N.C., on racketeering conspiracy charges, along with charges of murder, attempted murder and firearms violations. All of them are illegal aliens from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Several are round-trippers — illegals who broke in once, committed crimes, got deported and broke back into the U.S. — proving that our border is porous and unsecured.Charlotte police discovered the rat's nest of foreign gangsters after some of them started shooting up local nightclubs and bars.Reading the indictment, much of the money these immigrant hoods raise from illegal gang activity is wired back to El Salvador to arrange for even more gangsters to come across the border.The funds are wired back to Central America through remittances that Obama has made cheaper and easier for illegals to send through new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rules on banks.""The alleged MS-13 gang members have committed numerous violent crimes, including armed robberies, assaults, and murders, for the benefit of the criminal enterprise,"" prosecutors said in a statement.The catalog of their alleged crimes runs 17 pages in the indictment. Several pages list suspected gang members charged with ""illegal re-entry by an aggravated felon,"" or entering the U.S. illegally after they had already been deported.It's not immediately clear if any of the suspects had been given amnesty under Obama's DACA executive order for younger illegal immigrants.But the busts come on the heels of the deferred deportation the Obama administration granted to vicious Charlotte gangster Emmanuel Jesus Rangel-Hernandez.Rangel-Hernandez, 19, was placed in the removal process in March 2012, following drug charges, but was shielded from removal by the administration even though it knew of his gang membership. He is now charged with the murders of four Charlotte residents, including former ""America's Next Top Model"" contestant Mirjana Puhar.Meanwhile, authorities busted a reputed MS-13 gang member wanted for execution-style murders in New York. Police in Atlanta on Tuesday arrested 22-year-old Arnolvin Umanzor Velasquez, charging him and two co-defendants — Edwin Acosta-Martinez and Sergio Cerna — with three murders, four attempted murders and multiple racketeering offenses.All three suspects were members of MS-13.These same illegal immigrant thugs are terrorizing Los Angeles, Chicago and even the nation's capital. Hundreds have been arrested in Los Angeles within the last two years. MS-13 originated in Los Angeles and has spread to states across the country.There are more than 6,000 already in the U.S. illegally, and dozens more are coming across the border daily. And though they routinely commit crimes, immigration officers don't kick them out of the country. That's because our president has told ICE to stand down.Arrests of immigrant gang members under Obama peaked in 2012, then dropped by more than 25% in 2013 and continued to decline in 2014, according to arrest records released by ICE in response to a Center for Immigration Studies FOIA request.Clearly, even violent gang members are not a high priority for enforcement. These are the beneficiaries of Obama's executive amnesty program.Obama makes it seem as if all illegals in the U.S. are hard-working and honest laborers seeking a better life, when in fact many of them are murderous thugs who are building a criminal network spanning both coasts.His rationale for granting them amnesty is a terrible falsehood and a threat to homeland security.

If that were still the case, an additional 2.25 million would be working today.U.S. private-sector job growth downshifted to the slowest pace in more than three years as the labor force participation rate sank to a 38-year low, the Labor Department reported Friday.The unexpectedly soft job growth and flat wages in September lowered the odds that the Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates in December.Stock indexes opened sharply lower on concerns that global weakness is hurting the U.S. more than was thought, but the prospect of a more patient Fed seemed to raise spirits. The S&P 500 turned a 1.6% drop into a 1.4% gain. The 10-year Treasury yield still settled at 1.99%, the lowest close since April.The private sector added 118,000 jobs in September after August's downwardly revised 100,000 rise, the worst two months since the spring of 2012. Private hiring averaged 205,000 over the first seven months of the year and 254,000 in 2014.Government added 24,000 jobs in September, lifting total payrolls by 142,000, well below the 206,000 expected.The jobless rate held at 5.1%, the lowest since 2008, but only because 350,000 people stopped looking for work, pushing labor force participation to 62.4%, the lowest since October 1977.IHS Global Insight Chief Economist Nariman Behravesh blamed the tepid job growth on ""weakness outside the U.S. hitting exports and volatility in the stock market,"" which led firms to slow hiring and capital spending.

787,ICE,"Past success doesn't guarantee future prosperity. Vitality lessons from longstanding firms: Aim for stars. John Mahdessian had big ideas when he took over Madame Paulette, the high-end New York City dry cleaner his great uncle opened in 1959, which his father ran until 1987.About that time, Mahdessian's father fell ill, and John redirected his Wall Street ambitions to the family business.The 56-year-old firm is now the dry cleaner of the jet set, including musician Jay Z and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.""I took the whole industry to another level. I made it sexy,"" Mahdessian told IBD. Earn that shine. Such a reputation requires ingenuity and elbow grease. The breakthrough for Mahdessian came in bags of water-damaged and mildewed gowns a socialite wanted saved. ""Every night for almost a year I took on these challenges,"" he said. ""I had to take apart each and every piece.""Mahdessian experimented with chemicals to clean the fabrics.A year later, 90 of the original 100 garments were saved.""We are now the final authority on what can be and cannot be restored,"" Mahdessian said. Demonstrate hustle.  When an Armani boutique owner brought in an ink-stained shirt, Mahdessian left an indelible impression.After quickly rendering it spotless, ""I had it delivered back to Madison Avenue before the guy got back to the boutique,"" he said.Bend-over-backward service establishes a reputation.""I've always catered to the most demanding clients in the world,"" Mahdessian said. ""I don't like disappointing people in general."" Embrace the past. Walking around 103-year-old M.S. Rau Antiques leaves this impression on shoppers: ""It's like a museum, but you can take things home,"" said Bill Rau. His grandfather opened the store in New Orleans, and his father and uncle ran it before Rau became CEO in 1995.""I believe it's very easy to constantly evolve but keep true to who you are,"" he said. ""Any business that doesn't try to grow dies. You can't stay stagnant."" Push ahead. Rau admired his grandfather's eye for valuable items and honed his own ability to anticipate consumer shifts. ""Markets and tastes and moods change faster than ever before,"" he said.What's hot today can be ice cold tomorrow.""It's like the water from a tap — it just stops,"" Rau said. ""You have to stay on top of the market changes."" Solidify your foundation. Style drives Nemo Tile. The New York City store opened in 1921 and grew into a mass distributor of floor tile.""We have to be above what everyone else is doing in the market,"" said Matt Karlin. ""We buy materials all over the globe."" Retain spirit. The third generation running the operation, Nemo Tile's Karlin took this lesson from his grandfather:""Having cash available is king. I'm constantly watching my overhead, watching my cash balance.""From his father, Karlin learned to keep tabs on customers.""I like to be in the showroom,"" he said. ""I'm here and I get to listen to what people are saying."" Strengthen structure. After taking the president's chair in 2012, Karlin addressed the business' lack of management structure.The company now had clearly delineated executive roles beyond sales.He also hired marketing experts to strengthen the brand and opened a showroom in Philadelphia last spring.""It's our first real step outside our comfort zone,"" Karlin said.

812,ICE,"Get ready. 2015 is going to be the year when everything comes together to kick the American economy into high gear.Wait, you've heard that before?Some skepticism is understandable. The U.S. has been out of a recession for 5-1/2 years, nearly all of them characterized by economic false starts and head fakes. But while Q1's harsh winter chilled full-year growth, U.S. GDP rose at a 5% annual rate in Q3, the best since 2003.Internal forces have firmed enough that activity and hiring will only accelerate from here, economists say, while global shifts will help boost the U.S. stock market even higher.The economy looks healthy enough that the Federal Reserve, which ended bond buying in 2014, may start to raise interest rates, even as other central banks ease policy.""I'm quite bullish on the economy next year,"" said David Rosenberg, chief economist for Toronto-based Gluskin Sheff.Years ago, as chief economist for Merrill Lynch, Rosenberg was among the first to predict the housing crash and recession that started in 2007, tagging him as an uberbear.Investor's Best BetRosenberg sees the booming 1990s when he looks at today's economy. He points to a job market that's tightening fast, wage gains that finally are picking up and still-low interest rates capped by worldwide low flation. Just as in the late '90s, he says, the U.S. market will be an investor's best bet as developed economies around the world, from Japan to the eurozone, stumble, the dollar strengthens and emerging markets are buffeted by outflow.Rosenberg isn't the only one with high hopes. Consumer-friendly energy costs alone could boost 2015 GDP growth by as much as a full point, said David Kotok, chairman of Cumberland Advisors, who calls himself ""so bullish I can't stand myself.""While plunging oil prices could hit the domestic energy industry's hiring and capital spending, Kotok and others think the overall boost is more important. He forecasts 3.5% GDP growth for the U.S. next year.""There is no recession in the U.S. on the horizon, and the growth rate is going to trend above 3%,"" he added. ""Fabulous! It's the biggest tailwind in this country in many, many years.""Hiring Like It's 1999Payroll gains have been much faster than the Fed and most analysts expected. Employers have already added more jobs in 2014 than in any year since, fittingly, 1999. And despite the central bank's worst fears, the labor market has started to tighten enough that some of those who've been on the sidelines, like the long-term unemployed, are rejoining.Rosenberg thinks job gains will accelerate next year to a monthly average of 250,000-300,000 from 2014's 240,000. He's among the more optimistic; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, expects an average of 194,300.Most economists believe 2015 is the year the Fed agrees that the job market has healed enough and the economy can handle interest-rate increases.As disinflationary pressures swirl around the globe, Swonk thinks the Fed may delay liftoff until the latter half of the year.""The Fed will be acting as if they're treading on thin ice even as the ground firms,"" she said. ""I worry about inflation being too cool even outside of oil. The Fed does not want to cause a disorderly effect on markets. This is their chance to allow wages to accelerate a bit.""But Kotok thinks markets are making peace with the idea that rates will inevitably rise.""The market was not afraid of the Fed changing its language. The market celebrated with 1247 points on the Dow,"" he said. ""The market has a pretty good handle: They're going to be gradual, it's going to change sometime in 2015, at a mild pace, and they're going to focus on the data.""Central Bank DivergentRosenberg takes another view.

"
814,ICE,"Wait, you've heard that before?
"
815,ICE,"Some skepticism is understandable. The U.S. has been out of a recession for 5-1/2 years, nearly all of them characterized by economic false starts and head fakes. But while Q1's harsh winter chilled full-year growth, U.S. GDP rose at a 5% annual rate in Q3, the best since 2003.
"
816,ICE,"Internal forces have firmed enough that activity and hiring will only accelerate from here, economists say, while global shifts will help boost the U.S. stock market even higher.

"
818,ICE,"""I'm quite bullish on the economy next year,"" said David Rosenberg, chief economist for Toronto-based Gluskin Sheff.
"
819,ICE,"Years ago, as chief economist for Merrill Lynch, Rosenberg was among the first to predict the housing crash and recession that started in 2007, tagging him as an uberbear.
"
820,ICE,"Investor's Best Bet
"
821,ICE,"Rosenberg sees the booming 1990s when he looks at today's economy. He points to a job market that's tightening fast, wage gains that finally are picking up and still-low interest rates capped by worldwide low flation. Just as in the late '90s, he says, the U.S. market will be an investor's best bet as developed economies around the world, from Japan to the eurozone, stumble, the dollar strengthens and emerging markets are buffeted by outflow.
"
822,ICE,"Rosenberg isn't the only one with high hopes. Consumer-friendly energy costs alone could boost 2015 GDP growth by as much as a full point, said David Kotok, chairman of Cumberland Advisors, who calls himself ""so bullish I can't stand myself.""
"
823,ICE,"While plunging oil prices could hit the domestic energy industry's hiring and capital spending, Kotok and others think the overall boost is more important. He forecasts 3.5% GDP growth for the U.S. next year.
"
824,ICE,"""There is no recession in the U.S. on the horizon, and the growth rate is going to trend above 3%,"" he added. ""Fabulous! It's the biggest tailwind in this country in many, many years.""
"
825,ICE,"Hiring Like It's 1999
"
826,ICE,"Payroll gains have been much faster than the Fed and most analysts expected. Employers have already added more jobs in 2014 than in any year since, fittingly, 1999. And despite the central bank's worst fears, the labor market has started to tighten enough that some of those who've been on the sidelines, like the long-term unemployed, are rejoining.
"
827,ICE,"Rosenberg thinks job gains will accelerate next year to a monthly average of 250,000-300,000 from 2014's 240,000. He's among the more optimistic; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, expects an average of 194,300.
"
828,ICE,"Most economists believe 2015 is the year the Fed agrees that the job market has healed enough and the economy can handle interest-rate increases.
"
829,ICE,"As disinflationary pressures swirl around the globe, Swonk thinks the Fed may delay liftoff until the latter half of the year.
"
830,ICE,"""The Fed will be acting as if they're treading on thin ice even as the ground firms,"" she said. ""I worry about inflation being too cool even outside of oil. The Fed does not want to cause a disorderly effect on markets. This is their chance to allow wages to accelerate a bit.""
"
831,ICE,"But Kotok thinks markets are making peace with the idea that rates will inevitably rise.
"
832,ICE,"""The market was not afraid of the Fed changing its language. The market celebrated with 1247 points on the Dow,"" he said. ""The market has a pretty good handle: They're going to be gradual, it's going to change sometime in 2015, at a mild pace, and they're going to focus on the data.""
"
833,ICE,"Central Bank Divergent
"
834,ICE,"Rosenberg takes another view. ""I still wouldn't bet the farm on the Fed hiking rates in 2015. Like we saw in 1997, what the central bank says and what it ultimately does can often be two different things. If things were more normal globally, the Fed would start to raise rates. But we don't have normal circumstances.""
"
835,ICE,"While most investors think the Fed at least is moving in the direction of normalizing policy, central banks in Europe, China and Japan are likely to keep easing.
"
836,ICE,"This monetary divergence could keep financial markets volatile.

852,ICE,"Russia is in the news again. NATO ministers continue to discuss how to upgrade their response capabilities to contain Russia, an increasingly unpredictable neighbor. Pentagon officials advise Congress that Russia is a top military threat. Meanwhile, President Putin ramps up his military modernization.Could this finally be the end of strong Russia-U.S. cooperation in the one region where our interests have aligned since the end of the Cold War: the Arctic?One hopes that the answer is no.There are recent examples of cooperation. In 2011, when both countries recognized that linkages of Arctic natural resources to global markets meant increased marine traffic and, thus, greater maritime risks, they came together and co-led negotiations that resulted in the Arctic Search and Rescue (SAR) Agreement.In 2013, to protect the region's fragile ecosystems, Russia, Norway and the U.S. led the preparation of the Arctic Oil Spill Preparedness and Response Agreement, also signed by the eight Arctic states.Just last month Russian officials participated in an Arctic Coast Guard Forum, meeting with experts in Washington. The U.S. welcomes strong Russian participation in the development of a highly cooperative Arctic Coast Guard Forum. This month, as the U.S. assumes the chairmanship of the Arctic Council — an intergovernmental forum for Arctic governments and peoples — Russia-U.S. cooperation in the Arctic must continue.Consensus Is KeyWhile it is impossible for Russia's military operations in Ukraine not to influence U.S.-Russia relationships, the U.S. must remember that maritime safety, environmental stewardship, research and economic development in the Arctic are important areas of mutual interest and benefit. The two nations need to cooperate closely, as all decisions of the Arctic Council must have the consensus of Russia, the U.S. and six other states.There are four major reasons to urge cooperation with Russia in the Arctic.First, the SAR and Oil Response Agreements that have been hailed as a success of Arctic cooperation will be a true success only if the Arctic nations, including Russia, also cooperate on implementation.Rescue and environmental response both require the presence of infrastructure and assets throughout the Arctic. Russia has been developing a chain of 10 SAR stations along its Northern Sea Route — and also military facilities that worry some U.S. military officials.Unless both Russia, the U.S., and the six other Arctic states invest in the necessary facilities, manpower, navigational aids and satellite and communications technology, the extensive cooperation that went into negotiating the SAR and Oil Response Agreements will be lost.Second, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has negotiated a mandatory Polar Code to govern shipping standards for the polar regions. The code will enter into force on Jan. 1, 2017, but implementing the code — and enforcing its standards — will require strong support from both the U.S. and Russia.To lead the international maritime community, the two nations must be seen to implement the new code in their own territorial waters and across the Bering Strait region.Third, the Arctic Ocean is a tightly interconnected marine environment, and as the Arctic nations start or ramp up oil and gas exploration, only uniform and cooperative environmental protection standards will ensure appropriate environmental safety.Environmental ProtectionsRussian companies are eager to develop their vast oil and gas offshore resources but face challenges operating in Arctic conditions. These challenges provide the U.S. an opportunity to work with Russian companies, and commercial firms across the Arctic, to develop environmental protection standards for prevention and liability mechanisms in response to a spill.Fourth, the U.S. and Russia share a border. Their cooperation will be required across the entire Arctic, but it is particularly important in the Bering Strait region. The strait, 46 nautical miles wide, has historically seen little international traffic. But with longer seasons of navigation in the Arctic Ocean, that trend is changing.Although seasonal ice cover, risky waters and uncertain economics may mean that Arctic waterways never rival the Panama or Suez routes, increased traffic in the Bering Strait poses significant safety and environmental concerns.Without question, strong U.S. leadership in the Arctic coupled with Russian engagement will be needed to make meaningful progress in ensuring maritime safety, improving navigational support and establishing voluntary routing schemes.And there are new areas for collaboration. The U.S. agenda for its Arctic Council chairmanship includes a desire to promote Arctic research, and there is potential for a new binding agreement among the Arctic states to be signed during 2015-2017.Although it is impossible for either nation to ignore the challenges and conflicts that they face elsewhere in the world, Russia and the U.S. both have key roles to play in preserving a peaceful Arctic and exhibiting to the world that Arctic cooperation will continue. This is the enduring challenge for the U.S. in its upcoming role as Arctic Council chair. Slayton is research fellow, co-chair and executive director of the Arctic Security Initiative at Stanford's Hoover Institution. Brigham is distinguished professor of geography and Arctic policy at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and a fellow at the Coast Guard Academy's Center for Arctic Study & Policy.

865,ICE,"Russia: Moscow has completed a massive permanent military base a few hundred miles from the North Pole. Unlike U.S. environmentalists, Russia sees hundreds of billions of barrels of oil in its future.The Franz Josef Land archipelago, where 20 degrees is a heat wave, is not the most desirable destination.Even so, Vladimir Putin has built a new military installation on one of its large islands, where 150 troops can live for 18 months, for clear geopolitical and economic purposes.With 41 government and industry-owned icebreaker vessels, and 11 more planned, Moscow has clear superiority over the U.S. on the Arctic surface.Sure, America outclasses Russia in subs. But Russia's icebreakers could open far more passages for Russian warships through those icy waters than the Pentagon could for our own fleet.Putin's government has filed a claim with the United Nations over the North Pole itself and the vast adjoining region, and it has conducted military exercises in parts of the claimed territory. It's serious about control.The new base supplements an already-existing Russian military installation on Kotelny Island in the East Siberian Sea to the south, reflecting the priorities of Moscow's Naval Doctrine, which was updated in July and cites the Arctic's mineral resources and strategic significance. Is Washington paying attention?Under that same doctrine, Russian naval forces will more frequently patrol the Mediterranean and establish new ports there in a return to Soviet-era practices. Expanding the small facility at Tartus on the Syrian coast into a naval base is part and parcel of what is obviously a global military strategy.North Cyprus, Egypt, Libya and maybe even Greece and Italy are other possibilities to accommodate a strengthened Russian navy.A quarter of the world's untapped fossil fuel reserves, including about 1.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, with a value far exceeding $15 trillion, is estimated to be in the Arctic region that Russia is eyeing, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.The government-owned firms of Rosneft in Russia and Statoil in Norway have undertaken exploratory missions there. In March, Moscow mobilized hundreds of aircraft, dozens of warships, over a dozen submarines and tens of thousands of troops in Arctic exercises. And it has flown drones there since May.Interviewed by CNBC last month, Heather Conley, an Arctic policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that over the last year to year and a half, Moscow has held ""a different posture focusing on their strategic nuclear deterrent, unannounced military exercises, a lot of opening of new bases and positioning of military personnel and equipment.""She called it ""an important evolution in Russia's militarization of the Arctic, and that needs to be assessed by the other Arctic states for sure.""Of the U.S. response, Conley said: ""Everyone agrees that there's rapid change; everyone agrees that we need to monitor, assess, evaluate. But when it comes to the significant budget needs for a deep-water port in the American Arctic — or ice-breaking capability or aviation assets or satellite communications — everyone kind of looks at the floor and says, 'Not my budget, thank you very much.' ""In that context, according to Conley, ""if we have a major incident in the Arctic, it's going to demonstrate our limited capabilities. . .. It's going to be an education we all don't want.""With all eyes on Putin's unexpected new moves in the hottest region of the world, the Middle East, it's sobering to consider his long-term plans in the cold environs of the far north — another oil-rich locale.Somehow, Russia doesn't seem to think oil and gas are archaic energy sources of the past, as President Obama continually tells us.

866,ICE,"Politics: The White House has vowed to veto a Senate bill cracking down on sanctuary cities in the name of, incredibly, enforcing immigration law. How does succoring lawbreakers indicate seriousness about the rule of law?The Stop Sanctuary Policies And Protect Americans Act (S. 2146) is a common-sense immigration bill from the Senate sponsored by David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican.The measure is a natural outcome of the immigration debate that started in earnest this summer when Donald Trump criticized unchecked illegal immigration and then 32-year-old Kate Steinle was murdered in broad daylight on a San Francisco tourist pier by Francisco Sanchez, a five-times-deported alien felon who said he was there thanks to the city's sanctuary laws.Steinle's death called attention to the fact that sanctuary laws — now in place in 340 jurisdictions, according to the Center for Immigration Studies — are as illegal as Sanchez.City ordinances do not supercede federal laws, not anywhere in the country or in any other context. But the Obama administration has made an exception for this illegal phenomenon because he believes that each illegal represents a potential Democratic vote. So never mind the federal law that he's sworn to uphold.The bill destined for the president's wastebasket addresses the problem by cutting off federal funds to cities that actively obstruct federal immigration law. More specifically, the bill would deny funds for three programs and community development block grants to jurisdictions that shelter illegals from federal lawmen.All in all, pretty mild stuff, given that the city officials involved could and should be arrested as lawbreakers. But to hear the White House talk, you'd think that the problem was not in the cities' nullification of federal law but the cutoff of cash for bureaucrats to spend.Late Tuesday, Senate Democrats blocked the Vitter bill on a near-party-line vote, with Minority Leader Harry Reid calling it ""vile."" What's really vile, however, is the White House's claim that the bill will actually obstruct immigration enforcement.A statement on the Office of Management and Budget website argues that the legislation ""undermines current Administration efforts to remove the most dangerous convicted criminals and to work collaboratively with State and local law enforcement agencies.""Hear that? They really do want to enforce the law, but shutting down sanctuary cities will stymie efforts to deport criminal illegals. They also call for ""comprehensive reforms"" — that is, amnesty — for those who break immigration law. By their logic, the amnesty would include Sanchez.President Obama is currently releasing 6,000 convicted felony-level criminals from federal prisons, a third of whom are illegals who by even Obama's lax enforcement standards should be deported.The 6,000 are just the first wave of 40,000 who are going to be let out, 13,200 of whom will be illegal alien criminals and the supposed first priority for deportation, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. In 2014, sanctuaries released 9,295 alien offenders that ICE was seeking to deport.This is the whole problem with the Obama administration. It insists that its priority is to ""deport felons, not families,"" but when it gets a chance to deport a felon, it blocks itself, nullifying its own right to power as the federal government in a bid to succor the illegals.The dishonesty of the administration's ""immigration priorities"" is reaching a boiling point. The public is fed up and wants something done about the illegal criminals who are flooding into our cities, sheltered from federal law as legal citizens are not.The president's threat to veto Vitter's bill makes clear that he doesn't want to enforce any immigration laws under any circumstances, not even when doing so would rightfully restore his executive power.

878,ICE,"Immigration: Border surgers have won another. A federal judge has ruled that ICE can't hold illegals in federal detention centers, meaning they must be let out. So it's down to this: Either open the borders or seal them up.Judge Dolly M. Gee ruled that the Obama administration's detention centers for 3,500 mothers and children caught illegally crossing the border was a violation of a 1997 court settlement about the care and treatment of illegals. Her ruling was immediately hailed as a major victory for the open borders lobby.The three detention centers — two in Texas and one in Pennsylvania — have been denounced as ""prison-like"" by various activist groups. Seems that all the millions spent on house plants and other comforts seen in past news reports for these lawbreakers were for nothing.Unless the Feds can come up with an effective appeal by Aug. 3, the 3,500 illegals being held in these facilities are likely to be released will then be able to apply for political asylum, which is being handed out liberally to Central American immigrants.But the judge's ruling had a clarifying effect. It ultimately questioned what all these intermediate actions, which amount to baby-sitting illegals, were really about.If judges and left-wing lawyers can only be satisfied by big, taxpayer-paid luxury-spa vacations for illegals, such as one lavish facility planned in Texas last year, and ICE can only furnish more spartan facilities, then the real issue is whether illegals will be granted de facto amnesty or be stopped at the border before they get in.Breitbart last summer reported that the big detention centers such as the renovated spa in Texas were really about no-bid contracts and the rewarding of political cronies for Democratic politicians. The politicians, in turn, benefit from reciprocal campaign donations.And, according to a report Monday in Fusion, a Latino-oriented news site, the detention centers served as political cover for Democrats, who could keep border surgers out of sight to tamp public outrage down and keep heat off Democrats in the run-up to elections.Now that illegals will be free to move about the country, Republicans have but one option when it comes to illegal immigration: Stop it before it starts.If illegals who make it past the border guards can no longer be detained and must be set free, then the only way to check unrestricted illegal immigration is by strictly controlling the border.Congress should act now to cinch up our border, before it's too late. Our porous, unenforced border isn't a mere inconvenience. It's a threat to our nation.
"
879,ICE,"Regulation: Cures for cancer and Ebola having been found, the federal ubernannies have decreed that sprinkles should no longer adorn kids' ice cream because they contain the trans fat that liberal groups once pushed for.Come the New Year, the Food and Drug Administration, ignoring the principle that in most cases it's the dose that defines the poison, will issue new regulations designed to remove even trace amounts of hydrogenate oils, commonly known as trans fats, from our diets.Trans fats have been in our foods since the 1950s to increase shelf life and improve taste. A small amount appears naturally in some foods, but research has determined that large quantities of trans fats in one's diet can be dangerous for long-term health.But so can large quantities of bacon, and no one has proposed banning bacon, at least not yet, but we're sure that thought has occurred to those who want 16-ounce soft drinks banned while forcing our children to eat cardboard school lunches.Each American consumes a mere 1.3 grams of trans fats per day. That's roughly 0.6% of our total daily calories, and no research suggests that this poses a health risk. But that's not enough to dissuade the federal nannies from regulating even the most minute aspect of our daily lives.The irony here is that trans fats were once pushed by liberal groups such as the Center for Science in the Public Interest. This poster child for the food police in 1988 published a book titled ""Saturate Fat Attack"" that condemned the use of saturated and polyunsaturated fats then in vogue. Food companies soon switched to trans fats, a move for which CSPI proudly took credit.In its Nutrition Action Newsletter on March 1, 1988, CSPI not only downplayed health risks associated with trans fats but promoted them as a health benefit. It even cited a study that found a ""significant positive correlation"" between trans fats in animal fats and cancer rates.The nanny state that tells us what cars we should drive, what energy we must use and what health insurance we must buy has told mothers what they can put in their children's school lunches and even whether they can take mom-made lunches to school at all. Slurpees and now sprinkles are a health hazard, according to those who mysteriously know what's good for us.We'd suggest that freer societies are healthier societies, and that government can have our sprinkle-covered cupcakes when they can pry them from our cold, dead, frosting-stained hands.
"
880,ICE,"In 1980, America nabbed six gold medals at the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y.One gold famously went to the hockey team after its miraculous defeat of the Soviet powerhouse.The rest of the gilded bounty?Claimed by a bashful, burly 21-year-old with flowing hair: speed skater Eric Heiden, the most successful Olympian from a single edition of the Winter Games.He earned a gold medal in all five of his events. Long races. Short races. Everything in between.He won by staying mentally and physically razor sharp.The 500-meter? Done. The 1,000? Check. Ditto for 1,500, 5,000 and 10,000 meters.Though he slipped in a crack in the ice during the 1,500, he regained his rhythm for the win.He overslept on the morning of the 10,000, then got so far behind in the race that he didn't think he'd catch up. Yet he kish-kished into the lead during the second half for gold and a world record.No matter what, Heiden's swift blades managed to dice the competition steadily.Heiden set 15 world speed skating records in his career.On Top""To this day, he is considered by many to be the best skater the world has ever seen,"" wrote Geoff Drake, former editor of Bicycling magazine, in ""Team 7-Eleven: How an Unsung Band of American Cyclists Took on the World — and Won.""Yet Heiden had much more in his vault than skating. He was also headed for golden moments in biking and medicine.He won the 1985 U.S. pro cycling championship, raced throughout Europe and was inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in 1999.Today, Heiden is a top orthopedic surgeon who specializes in mending knees and shoulders.The 56-year-old considers medicine his life's work.""If you want to be a leader,"" Heiden told IBD from his medical practice outside Salt Lake City, ""you have to have a love and a passion for it. You might be physically gifted, mentally gifted, but I don't think you have the ability to push yourself and discover your limits unless you have a passion and desire for whatever that pursuit is.""Heiden was born in Madison, Wis. His dad, Jack, was a surgeon. His mom, Nancy, stayed home to tend to Heiden and his younger sister, Beth, who also became an Olympic speed skater.The household motto: Move.""Sports was always a part of our family activity. Some families play music, some dance; we did sports — playing sports, not observing,"" Heiden wrote in his 2008 book, ""Faster, Better, Stronger."" ""I started skating at age 2.""Eric and Beth were regulars at the local rink. He played hockey, and she was a figure skater. Then they shifted into higher gear, taking speedskating in their teens.""I remember when I was 14 years old, really having an epiphany what I would do,"" Heiden said.First, he wanted to win on the ice track. Next, he wanted to be a doctor. He made America's team for the Junior World Championships in 1972. Four years later, he whirred into his first Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria.In 1977, Heiden swept 500-meter races at world meets, a feat he repeated in 1978.Heiden was training five hours a day, year-round, in Madison, constantly refining his technique.""While most elite skaters used 16 strokes on the straights,"" Drake explained, ""Heiden used just 12.""""You can't deny his dedication. You can't deny his focus. You can't deny his training,"" said author Joe Garner, who featured Heiden in ""And the Fans Roared.""Brain boosting was top of mind for Heiden. ""To be world class in any sport,"" he said, ""you've got to have the right frame of mind. There are a lot of people with the right tools, but they just don't have the drive. I had the drive to pursue speedskating, and I found a sport that I was good at.""Frozen FocusDreaming big made a big difference a couple of years before the 1980 Olympics.Heiden's enthusiasm for frozen feats had waned. What changed that? He came up with a superhero-sized objective for Lake Placid.He aimed to win every single one of his events. The sheer gutsiness of that idea shifted his mindset.It was unheard of: For this tall, bulky slugger to win all those races, he'd nearly have to defy gravity.""It would be a little like a 200-meter track runner taking gold in the Olympic marathon,"" Drake explained. ""It was a Hail Mary of colossal proportions.""Heiden stayed focused, mixing short-term targets into his plan.""Goals,"" he wrote, ""aren't necessarily for the good days but for the bad days. Any one of a number of goals might be the trigger that gets you out the door.""Heiden was in top shape for those February Games 34 years ago.It seemed pretty easy — at first.Heiden, coated in a gold Lycra suit, landed a picture-perfect inner turn to finish the 500-meter event well in the lead for gold.Next, he duked his way, mightily, through the 5,000- and the 1,000-meter events.The 1,500-meter race wasn't as graceful. Heiden slipped halfway through and had to reach deep for the win. The night before his last and most daunting event, the 10,000-meter, he went to see the U.S. hockey team beat the Soviet Union. That semifinal verdict lives on as the Miracle On Ice.The Comeback""He was too excited to sleep,"" Garner said. ""He tossed and turned. And then he overslept. He only had a chance of a few slices of bread for breakfast. He didn't have time to warm up. But in spite of that, he came back and killed it.""To win, Heiden had to beat the U.S.S.R.'s Viktor Leskin, who took off madly in the 6.2-mile race.Halfway through, Heiden wondered if he'd catch Leskin. He steadily closed in for victory.Heiden says having a good prerace routine helped him get in the zone, and that was critical at times when his focus was shaken.The doc still relies on well-thought-out routines to help him stay sharp. ""There is clinic time, and there is surgery time,"" he said. ""It's split half and half.""In sports, he switched to bicycling and the 7-Eleven team after he finished skating to maintain his fitness when he wasn't studying for a medical career. ""If you talk to some of my teammates, they will laugh. They remember me traveling with books so I could pass the MCAT and physiology and physics,"" he said.His piston legs landed him on the cycling podium. But he liked medicine best and looked to that, post-Olympics, instead of athletic endorsement deals, to build wealth.Smart move. Orthopedic surgeons bank, on average, a half-million dollars a year.A nice bonus: ""Usually, in orthopedics, you can make people better,"" Heiden said.In 1997, the Stanford-trained physician moved to California's capital to practice surgery and become team physician for the Sacramento Kings and the U.S. speedskating team. He moved to Salt Lake City, a winter sports mecca, in 2006.A champ's heart still beats in the chest of this mild-mannered bone doctor, whose flowing Olympian hair is now close-cropped and graying. Heiden demands excellence in his operating room. He refers to himself as captain of the ship when he's doing surgery.It's important, he explained, for everyone to take responsibility for details: ""I get very frustrated when people make the same mistakes twice. There are no short cuts to success. You have to put in the time, effort and sweat equity.""

908,ICE,"Border Policy: President Obama vowed to veto a House bill to pull cash from cities that flout federal immigration laws. He's given a lot of odd excuses, but in the end he's siding with criminal illegals who now plague the U.S.
"
909,ICE,"There was the wrenching testimony of Jim Steinle, who just this month was walking down a San Francisco tourist pier with his daughter Kate in broad daylight as she was gunned down at his side by a five-times-deported illegal alien.The gunman, Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, told investigators that he lived in the city because its sanctuary city policies shielded him from being deported. Steinle is just one of many Americans who have been victims of the crime plague of those here illegally.Worse still, San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi crowed proudly about releasing Lopez-Sanchez from jail before he killed Steinle. He was repudiated by his own deputies' union for not allowing them to so much as talk to federal authorities about it.As a result, on a bipartisan basis, the House last week passed a bill to cut funding for some federal law-enforcement aid programs to sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities.It's not exactly Armageddon for the sanctuary movement, but it is a reasonable check on cities' unrestrained flouting of immigration law that makes killers like Lopez-Sanchez possible. Sponsored by Rep. Duncan Hunter, Jr., a San Diego Republican, the bill drew votes from six Democrats who up until now had voted as a party bloc. And no wonder: Polls show that the public wants an end to the plague of crimes by illegals.With such support, it would seem to be a no-brainer for the president to show his support too. But no such luck. A White House spokesman said that the president would veto the measure.The justification was surreal. The White House said that the bill ""undermines current administration efforts to remove the most dangerous convicted criminals"" and failed to enact ""comprehensive immigration reform"" — a code phrase for amnesty.Is the White House talking about Lopez-Sanchez? Because that's the guy who wasn't deported, despite Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests, from the city of San Francisco due to its sanctuary city policies.And, fact is, more than 30,558 criminal illegals were released onto the streets in 2014 alone, according to ICE data.Two new reports show that the story is actually worse than it seems.A report from the left-leaning Migration Policy Institute has unwittingly admitted that there are 820,000 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions, including 690,000 convicted of felonies or ""serious"" misdemeanors, according to a report from Breitbart News.Meanwhile, J. Christian Adams, a former Justice Department official, reported at Pajamas Media that an unreleased internal report from the Texas Department of Public Safety shows that illegals have committed 611,234 crimes in Texas alone from 2008 to 2014, including 3,000 murders.With data like that, it's clear that there is a broken immigration system, and it's not from a lack of amnesty or havens. It's the result of a president who refuses to obey the law and has a positively Alice-in-Wonderland view of keeping Americans safe by dumping illegal foreign criminals among them.If not lunacy, it's profound dishonesty. Given the president's devotion to his open borders lobby, we'll go with the latter.

929,ICE,"The odds seemed to be stacked against Ralph Hart when he left western Canada to carve out an international business career. He dropped out of school in eighth grade.His first business collapsed in the Great Depression.And his first job was bound to raise eyebrows for those reading his resume: selling gopher pelts in Alberta.But Hart (1904-95) was no rube.As CEO of Heublein Inc. in the 1960s, he made the Hartford, Conn.-based food, wine and spirits producer a global power, expanding to 34 countries.He helped turn vodka into America's most popular spirit and was one of the first in the industry to take advantage of the shift to sweeter alcoholic drinks.Under his direction, Heublein also became known for innovative marketing campaigns involving some of the era's top celebrities.As a result of Hart's savvy leadership, Heublein boosted revenue 400% from 1960 to 1968, from $100 million to $500 million, a record that prompted Harvard Business School to name Hart one of the 20th century's premier leaders.""Hart was largely responsible, if not wholly responsible, for taking Heublein's products and selling them internationally,'' Jeffrey Pogash, a media and marketing representative for the Cocktail Guru website and author of two books on the industry, told IBD. ""They were very innovative, very creative in a lot of areas.""Montana StartRaised on a ranch near Great Falls, Mont., Hart attended a one-room school until he was 10.When his father died, his mother remarried and moved the family to a farm in Alberta.Hart quit school after eighth grade to help on the farm and trap gophers, selling the tails for a penny. Soon he learned that muskrat trapping was more profitable.At 21, he joined the Royal Bank of Canada as a junior ledger-keeper at $500 (worth $6,700 now) a year.To supplement his meager salary, he worked as a janitor and played semipro baseball. Five years later, Hart talked his way into his first full-time sales job, selling typewriters for Standard Typewriter.With no training, he boarded a train to Red Deer, Alberta, to make his first sales call.""I didn't have nerve enough to go into a store. I walked around all day,"" he recalled in a book on leadership years later.Hart was just as nervous the next day before finally mustering the courage to enter Best Furniture Store minutes before closing time.""The store owner started asking me questions, and I kept on saying, 'I don't know, but I'll find out.' Finally the owner agreed to purchase an adding machine. I was mystified, and asked him why he finally relented. He replied, 'Anyone who has a salesman as honest as you are must have a good product.' That was one of the greatest things that ever happened to me. It's something that I never forgot — be honest and tell the truth,"" he said.Hart turned into a top salesman, making enough money in the next few years to buy the company.Investments in the stock market added to his net worth near the end of the decade. When the market collapsed in 1929, however, Hart lost $300,000 (worth $4 million now).Instead of declaring bankruptcy, he sold the rights to his company in return for a job selling products for Safeguard Checkwriting .So it was back to the grind.""Hard work is the answer to most of life's problems,"" he said in a Hartford Courant interview.During a sales call to Colgate-Palmolive in 1933, an executive vice president offered Hart a job selling toothpaste in Canada. During a training session for the American multinational consumer products company, a moderator asked each new employee to stand and state his name and college.""Some were saying Stanford or William & Mary, and I didn't know whether to lie or what,'' Hart recalled. ""So when it was my turn, I stood and said, 'Eighth grade.'""Hart quickly earned a series of promotions and, within a year, the company sent him to India to supervise an unprofitable operation.Hart, who had a flair for organization, hired Indian salesmen, rearranged territories, delegated management responsibilities and reversed the firm's fortunes there.During his tenure with Colgate, he also worked in Toronto, Sidney and Paris, and was named president of Colgate-Palmolive International and, in 1951, vice president of the parent company.Hart's broad experience and success in developing international business attracted the attention of Heublein in the late 1950s.He joined the privately held company in 1961.""We may be in the liquor business, but we're a merchandising company ... and there really isn't much difference among consumer goods,"" he said. ""You have to have a good product, good distribution, and then good advertising and promotion.""Before he could decorate his new office, Hart was already planning the company's global expansion.Smirnoff ShotHe sent an emissary to find Tatiana Smirnov, the widow and heir of Vladimir, and to buy the worldwide rights for Smirnoff Vodka. Two years later he bought the French brand of Smirnoff — the last of the ones founded by Smirnov family members, assuring Heublein global rights to the name.Licensing agreements were signed in Mexico, Spain and Italy.Hart also was quick to recognize trends in American drinking habits, including the shift from drinking at bars to home in the 1960s.""People were doing more entertaining at home,"" Pogash said. ""The economy was booming and Americans were more affluent. Businessmen were coming home every day and having a drink.""Hart's unflagging promotional efforts were instrumental in turning vodka into America's most popular spirit. Woody Allen promoted it with ads appearing in major magazines and on billboards across the country. Vodka's image as a stylish drink was further enhanced in the 1967 film ""Casino Royale,"" when James Bond instructed a barman to bring him ""three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice cold, then add a large slice of lemon peel. Got it?""With It""They were trying to make vodka into a hip drink,"" Pogash said. ""Until the 1950s, Americans were not that familiar with vodka.""Heublein's earnings soared to $115 million in 1963 — four times the number in 1959.Nearly 75% of Heublein's sales volume came from vodka.Determined to reduce the company's reliance on the distilled drink, Hart bought the Arrow liqueur line and several food products, plus acquired the importing and distribution rights for foreign products such as Perrier mineral water, Harveys sherry, Rose's lime juice, Irish Mist liqueur, Guinness stout and Jose Cuervo tequila.These acquisitions and a large advertising budget led to sales of $384 million in 1968 — a 337% increase from 1963.Realizing early that women and younger Americans were becoming a bigger chunk of the market, Hart focused on lighter liquor in the late 1960s. He expanded Heublein's line of premixed alcoholic cocktails and in 1969 began selling some of these cocktails in 8-ounce cans.Hart rose to CEO in 1964 and became chairman in 1966. In four years, Heublein's annual sales hit $600 million and in the next 20 years grew to $2 billon annually.After retiring in 1970, Hart remained on Heublein's board and was a consultant until 1982.He and his wife, Laura, moved in 1990 to Delray Beach, Fla, where he lived the rest of his life. The couple had one child.Heublein was sold in 1982 to R.J. Reynolds, the cigarette maker, and five years later RJR sold Heublein to Grand Metropolitan, a British liquor company.In 1997 Grand Metropolitan merged with Guinness, and the Heublein name was officially retired as a corporate entity.In 1994, Hart was among the honorees on an NBC telecast, ""The 47th Annual Horatio Alger Awards."" The awards go to people who rose from humble beginnings to achieve distinguished careers.Looking back, Hart said boyhood poverty spurred his ambition.""I had to make something out of my life,"" he told the New York Times. ""It really wasn't that difficult. I would go to town and see others dressed in nice clothes, and I would have on patches.""

934,ICE,"While Donald Trump blathered on today about a tax plan he knows would never get through Congress and President Obama mouthed dedication to universal human rights at the United Nations, NASA delivered a less-noticed announcement.A U.S. satellite, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, has found evidence there of water, the foundation of life. Actually, flowing water from as recently as a year ago.Observers, of course, have known of vast quantities of water locked within Mars' polar ice caps. But water elsewhere? Flowing? On a surface ranging from about 80 degrees to minus 190?Some seasonal streaks on the surface of Mars have implied long-ago moving water. In fact, more than a century ago Italian astronomers noted markings which they described as ""canalis."" This was mistranslated into English from the accurate ""channels"" into ""canals,"" implying construction by someone or something. This added credence to theories about life there.But these newest findings of recent water movement in sufficient volumes to flow suggest a more dynamic Martian environment than the previous image of a barren, gritty wasteland ravaged by dust storms.Mars is only about 11% the size of Earth with but 38% of the gravity. The planet circles the Sun about once every two Earth years due to its elliptical orbit ranging from 128 million to 155 million miles out.That immense difference (Earth's average 93 million miles distance from the Sun varies by only 1.6 million miles) produces much more climate extremes on Mars.And its atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide. Get on it, EPA!Mars has long captured an inordinate story-telling, mythological and scientific curiosity among Earthlings, not just due to its red color. In fact, Hollywood will deliver yet another Martian tale next month when (Spoiler Alert) it reveals Matt Damon has somehow set up shop there.Scientists, being scientists, are most intrigued by what they don't know. Slowly, thanks to Mars rovers and more sophisticated instrumentation circling above that can penetrate the surface, they are seeking to piece together an ancient history that could presage Earth's future.Evidence indicates the past presence of at least one vast Atlantic-size ocean, possibly a billion or more years ago. But where did all that water go? And why? If water is flowing intermittently on Mars now, where does it come from? If it flows in that cold, it must be salt water. Soil salts absorbing moisture from the atmosphere? Soil salts drawing up subterranean water?On Earth in the United States, we've now entered the Silly Season of political fictions. It's somehow humbling -- and comforting -- to know there remains so much science non-fiction that not even a know-it-all president or candidate have the slightest clue about.RELATED:They're shoveling it on Mars tooObama hails Obama for his historic steps to save the planetSleepless in space, a NASA satellite captures the entire Earth at nightAs Obama tightens sanctions, Russia notes it controls US space access

946,ICE,"Despite all the flashy dry lightning of last weekend's last gasp of the current Congress, this might seem like a quiet time in the nation's politics. But don't be deceived by the looming holiday hiatus.Yes, the increasingly irrelevant President Obama, his family and cronies are leaving behind their 26 White House Christmas trees on Friday to make the December multi-million-dollar migration to Hawaii for golf, workouts at the Marine base and dinners at fancy restaurants. Don't worry, there will be a shaved ice photo-op with the girls, too.Congressional members are heading home for the holidays, which for most actually means the suburbs of D.C. And the Washington political media is left with an empty city to scrounge up stories to justify their paychecks. Sydney sieges will only get you through a day or two. And God forbid they venture into real America.Thus, you can anticipate a spate of coverage about ""new"" things that are handy in Washington. Prepare for loving looks at Elizabeth Warren, the liberal Pocahontas who wants to be the nation's nagging auntie. Already reports circulate that 300 Obama-bots have lined up behind her, which isn't surprising as they'll all need work in 765 days or less.The Warren story has the advantage of seeming to create a ""race"" with Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democrat nomination.Warren probably will ""challenge"" Clinton, especially if the Emcee of Benghazi stumbles more early next year. Not because Warren has a progressive's prayer of defeating the former first lady in 2016. But because a 2015 feint will raise the ambitious Warren's national political profile and expand her donor list for a later bid to become the first Native American president.In comparison to Wild Warren, Hillary will seem less scary. And then, of course, there's Joe Biden.The upcoming presidential race is shaping up as a political switcheroo from recent contests. This time Democrat Hillary as 2008's second-place finisher is her party's nomination heir-apparent, as John McCain was for Republicans after George W. Bush and Mitt Romney after McCain.This time it's the Republican field that's wide open, as Democrats were in 2007-08. Not by coincidence, Jeb Bush has found reason to pass through Washington in these slower news cycles which, as planned, generated more ""Is He Or Isn't He?"" stories.Be wary of predictions about anything, however, at this point of premature speculation. Running for president has become such a massive economic, political and organizational undertaking now that Bush, Rick Perry, Rand Paul and any of the other wannabes started planning even before this year just so they can make a realistic Go-No Go decision down the road.Here are some early observations:The Republican Party's bench is far deeper and accomplished than its opposition. Each has individual strengths and weaknesses. As appealing as conservative doctrine is to the faithful in the last two midterms, to capture 270 electoral votes in a presidential contest the GOP nominee must have broad appeal beyond primary participants.Besides Bush, Perry, Paul and Romney, there's Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, Marco Rubio, even Ted Cruz.There's John Kasich and inevitably the sermonizing Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee. Maybe Paul Ryan, although Americans have not been drawn to House members as national leaders. Which is why Mike Pence left Capitol Hill to construct a conservative executive resume as governor back home again in Indiana.These and others to be named should make for a spirited, if at first cumbersome contest. Party chair Reince Priebus vows fewer, more controlled primary debates to prevent circular firing squads. Strangely enough, tough competition will help a GOP nominee coming out of the mid-summer convention in Cleveland against, most likely, a Clinton cruising to easy nomination, quite possibly also in Ohio.Our guess is after these last several years, the country is and will be starving for an adult chief executive who appears principled, poised and experienced. Solid on economic, job and fiscal concerns, steady on national security and foreign affairs. There's a whole lot of fence-mending to do abroad. And as a people, we're so tired of worrying. An optimistic someone with a fresh face and the courage and candor to sometimes say what we don't want to hear instead of what's too good to be true. And usually isn't.And our hope would be that as a nation we've outgrown our D.C. media-driven crushes on first-term members of Congress, who hold themselves in higher esteem than they do the country they are chosen to serve.RELATED:Elected twice, but Obama still sees U.S. mired in racism John Boehner: Keeping abiding faith with our vets and votersNews Flash for Feinstein: Americans are good with CIA tacticsMajor shift: American majority now supports gun rights over limits

947,ICE,"Immigration: From illegals to angry GOP lawmakers, President Obama reassures all that his lax policies are about priorities, conserving resources to focus on deporting criminals. So why are so many crooks allowed to stay?Caught between an angry public dead set against amnesty for illegal immigrants, and an open-border lobby that holds out the carrot of more votes for Democrats, President Obama has seemingly come up with the perfect answer for all sides: selective enforcement, or what he calls ""prioritizing"" immigration enforcement resources to target criminals instead of toddlers.The federal government has to ""make sure that we prioritize those folks who are most dangerous and we should acknowledge what everybody has already acknowledged through their actions — and Congress acknowledges through their budget — which is we're not in the business of deporting millions of people or breaking up families,"" the president told George Stephanopoulos on Nov. 23 after questions about his decision to give temporary work papers to 5 million illegals.Sounds good, because criminals aren't popular. And Obama's claimed focus on directing enforcement resources on just criminals suggests he's a careful steward of government resources, not a spendthrift.But a draft Immigration and Customs Enforcement report released last week doesn't support his claim.According to the report, 30,862 illegal immigrant criminals were released into the U.S. instead of being deported back to their home countries. Now they're free to commit more crimes against Americans.That's close to par with the 36,007 illegal aliens with criminal records who were released into America in 2013. Those criminals, by the way, shared 88,000 crimes among themselves, including murder, sexual assault, kidnapping, aggravated assault, major drug crimes and auto theft, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. They're not exactly the petty thieves and graffiti taggers that ICE classifies as category 3, or low-level, criminals who supposedly are deprioritized.The Center also found 167,000 illegals with criminal records who should be deported but who are at large.Now that Obama has released ICE from having to enforce the law against all 11 million illegals, the question remains why they are here. Why isn't someone being fired for not enforcing the priorities?Combine these fugitive illegals with the last two years' worth of illegal criminals the authorities have released at presidential direction, and it's a very large number of criminals with no business being here and whom Americans shouldn't have to tolerate, no matter how many Democratic votes it brings for Obama.It goes hand in hand with the 14% fall in overall deportations in 2014 (see chart), part of a broader trend. The screams of dreamers to the contrary, Obama is no ""deporter in chief."" Internal deportations — that is, deportations of those who've been in the U.S. awhile — have plunged 34%, according to ICE.So much for ""priorities."" The ugly reality is that immigration laws aren't being enforced at all, as Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions has charged.With little chance of being deported, it's little wonder there's been a 60,000-plus surge of unaccompanied children from Central America crossing the Texas border, along with 240,000 other illegals this year alone, as word gets out.That, appallingly enough, isn't an accident. It seems to be the real Obama priority.

949,ICE,"Interrogation: California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's long, overblown ""report"" on how we got tough with terrorist detainees after 9/11 misses the crucial point: Hundreds, if not thousands, of lives were saved.With Republicans taking over next month, the Democratic-controlled Senate is saying goodbye to America by condemning those who worked tirelessly to foil further Islamist terrorist plots on the homeland.What is disgracefully being called the ""Senate Torture Report"" is an attempt to return our national security policy to the 1970s' Frank Church era, when that Idaho senator's committee emasculated our intelligence agencies as his fellow Democrats cut off funds to South Vietnam and gave America a Cold War defeat.Feinstein claims that five years of poring over more than 6 million pages of CIA documents brings the ""overwhelming and incontrovertible"" conclusion that the U.S. tortured terrorists. She cites ""confinement"" and ""conditioning techniques"" as examples.Maybe we should have put up Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others dedicated to killing innocent Americans in five-star hotels. Then again, we did when it came to many of them. It was called Guantanamo Bay.The so-called ""Senate Report"" is actually a Democrat report; there is nothing bipartisan about it because no Republican senator signed on to it. Its attacks on enhanced interrogation echo exactly the rhetoric of the 2008 Obama presidential campaign.So no wonder George Tenet, who headed the CIA under Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and Porter Goss and Michael Hayden, two of his successors, as well as ex-deputies in the agency, notably the highly regarded Stephen Kappes, are blasting the report.Their main objection is the absurd charge that enhanced interrogation did not save lives by gleaning key information from detainees. Indeed, high-ranking al-Qaida terrorists were captured because of information obtained through enhanced interrogation, which also revealed how al-Qaida worked.Information from both KSM and Abu Zubaydah came because of the tough treatment. Among those captured because of such interrogation was Riduan Isamuddin, who was behind the Bali bombing in Indonesia in 2002, which killed hundreds of innocents.As the former CIA chiefs wrote in the Wall Street Journal, ""More than one quarter of the nearly 1,700 footnotes in the highly regarded 9/11 Commission Report in 2004"" came as a direct result of the interrogations.Getting ice water baths and being forced to go without sleep are perfectly legitimate tools if they save the lives of thousands of Americans, and they did.Also, consider that Secretary of State John Kerry tried to get Feinstein to delay the report, because it could put Americans at risk abroad. And that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel put U.S. military forces on ""high alert everywhere in the world"" because of the report's release.What Feinstein and Senate Democrats have done is have America commit another act of self-flagellation, apologizing for defending ourselves.It is sure to encourage jihadists around the world in the short and long term.
"
950,ICE,"Border Security: President Obama's executive amnesty doesn't just spare the illegals who ""mow our lawns"" and ""make our beds."" It also springs from local jails criminals held for deportation, putting them back on the street.In a just-released fact sheet, the White House describes Obama's ""immigration accountability executive action"" as ""cracking down on illegal immigration."" The president's actions, it intones, ""will help secure the border"" and increase the chances that illegals ""will be caught and sent back.""In fact, Obamanesty increases the chances they'll commit dangerous crimes in our cities.According to a new memo from Department of Homeland Security chief Jeh Johnson to ICE officials, the administration is gutting an immigration enforcement program — Secure Communities — responsible for identifying and deporting tens of thousands of dangerous criminals who are in the country illegally and already in police custody for other crimes.Didn't hear about that during the president's speech? That's because he doesn't want you to know about it.""I am directing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to discontinue Secure Communities,"" Johnson wrote in his three-page memo. This is a bad omen for public safety and national security. Secure Communities links ICE with sheriffs' offices across the country and is one of the main ways criminal immigrants are ID'd and deported.Last year, more than eight in 10 illegal immigrants kicked out of the U.S. had been convicted of crimes committed in the U.S. And most of them were ID'd through the Secure Communities program, which was started under the Bush administration.Now that Obama's scrapping it, what's left of immigration enforcement? Answer: not much.The program was so effective that pro-illegal immigration activist groups, led by La Raza and Acorn clones, had lobbied the White House for years to kill it. In fact, they recently met in the Roosevelt Room with Obama as he was crafting his amnesty plan. ""The program has attracted a great deal of criticism,"" Johnson explained to stunned ICE officials.Besides scrapping Secure Communities, Johnson advised that DHS will now monitor ""biased policing"" by sheriffs' offices who continue to hold criminals who are here illegally. ""I direct the Office of Civil Rights to develop and implement a plan to monitor state and local law enforcement agencies,"" he wrote in his memo.The Center for Immigration Studies says ICE will begin releasing hundreds of aliens in custody as early as next week — most of whom are convicted criminals.A recent government report found that when illegal immigrants caught under Secure Communities are released back onto the streets, public safety suffers.According to the Congressional Research Service, the more than 26,000 illegals already released under the Obama regime's priority enforcement scheme between 2009 and 2011 went on to commit 58,000 new crimes. Among them: 59 murders, 21 attempted murders and more than 5,000 major or violent criminal offenses.The released aliens also committed more than 6,000 drug crimes and more than 8,000 DUI violations, some of which also involved manslaughter charges. Stories of drunk illegal immigrants killing or injuring American families are legion.DHS now will look the other way at repeat violators who game the immigration system, those who fail to appear at immigration hearings, and fugitives who have already been ordered removed by immigration judges. Crimes like ID theft or ID fraud also get a pass.Removing even serious criminal aliens also got harder. ICE agents now must consider ""extenuating circumstances"" such as the criminal's ""family or community ties in the United States,"" the length of time since he committed a crime, and ""humanitarian factors such as poor health, age, pregnancy, a young child or a seriously ill relative.""Effectively identifying and removing criminals in state and local jails is a critical part of immigration enforcement. But this president has just eliminated it with the swipe of his pen.

956,ICE,"When the New York area was hit in 2012 by the misnamed Sandy — it was only a Category 2 hurricane when it made landfall in the U.S. and it became known as a ""superstorm"" for political reasons — we were told that climate change was going to cause more intense and more frequent hurricanes. Since those alarms were sounded, the U.S. has not been hit by a single major hurricane.In fact, we are experiencing the quietest major hurricane period on record. It has been 117 months since a Category 3 or higher storm made landfall in the U.S., says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This is the longest gap since the government began keeping track in 1851.And it's been quite a break. The next longest gap was eight years, and it came between 1860 and 1869.Much more recently, Al Gore, who would like to take us back to live an 1860s existence, was heard saying that Sandy was a ""disturbing sign of things to come."" On his website he warned that ""we must heed this warning and act quickly to solve the climate crisis.""That was almost two years ago.Things are not going well for the end-of-the-worlders such as Gore. They've been predicting global warming disaster for decades now, yet the disasters have not materialized.This is something we reminded readers of just after last Christmas, when we pointed out that ""the number of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, typhoons, monsoons, earthquakes, floods, freezes and so on is not on the rise, according to the best scientific evidence available.""Things could be even worse for those who've sown fear of global warming if we are indeed headed for a ""mini ice age"" in the 2030s, as a story that has generated a lot of Internet attention recently is suggesting. They could find themselves huddled over a trash-can fire on some street corner, hoping no one will notice that they are the madmen who just a few years earlier were warning that we were burning ourselves up.But no one knows what's going to happen in the 2030s. It might be warmer. It might be colder. Could be nothing changes.What we do know is the models that have predicted warming have been wrong. That alone says more than anything else.

"
1051,ICE,"Global Warming: No matter what happens, the alarmists blame man for changing the climate. In their minds, there are no other explanations. In reality, there can be many, with melting in Antarctica as one example.Indeed, a massive glacier in East Antarctica that holds vast amounts of water is melting. Should it thaw completely, the water it releases could contribute to a rise in sea levels. The question, of course, is why is the Totten Glacier, which is about 75 miles long and roughly 20 miles wide, melting?And while we ponder that, let's not forget that a complete meltdown of Totten would likely take centuries, not months or even years. New York and Los Angeles won't be underwater by the end of the summer.Research published online Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience concludes that Totten's retreat might be caused by a valley or trough of warm water flowing beneath the glacier, melting it from the bottom up.""Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin's Institute for Geophysics in the Jackson School of Geosciences,"" says a March 16 news release from the school, ""have discovered two seafloor gateways that could allow warm ocean water to reach the base of Totten Glacier, East Antarctica's largest and most rapidly thinning glacier.""Media reports scrupulously avoid saying this is man's fault, though it's clear they desperately want to say it is. The alarmist community can't let the narrative fade. But any honest reading of the school's summary will lead the reader to strongly infer that the warm water is an entirely natural event not caused by man.Which is not to say the scary scenarios aren't there. ""The ice flowing through Totten Glacier alone,"" the report says, ""is sufficient to raise global sea level by at least 11 feet, equivalent to the contribution of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet if it were to completely collapse.""Meanwhile, a Washington Post handwringer says that the Australian government's Antarctic Division believes the glacier is losing an amount of ice ""equivalent to 100 times the volume of Sydney Harbor every year.""But again, is this the fault of humans? The researchers can't say that, but one tried to place guilt by innuendo. He told the media, ""The last IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report said that if this kind of thing happens, it's going to add several tens of centimeters of sea level rise to their estimate of one meter.""He didn't distinguish, however, the sizable difference between an IPCC prediction that says man will cause sea levels to rise and a rise of entirely natural causes. The thought he wanted to plant in the public's mind is that everything is happening the way the IPCC said.We get the same from a report co-authored by Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. ""This is another example of how human-induced climate change could be triggering major changes with knock-on impacts that will be felt globally,"" he said.""Could be"" also means ""might not be."" Which means that scientists don't know. Yet quite a few of them and the entire political left want to spend hundreds of billions that would choke Western economies, and authorize governments to regiment ostensibly free societies, because of some ""could be"" notion.To rational thinkers, this doesn't make sense. But to true believers in the global warming faith, to researchers who are deeply invested in the narrative and to anti-capitalists who want to use global warming as justification for forcing everyone into statist systems, it does.But sincerity in their beliefs can't turn guesswork into fact. It only muddles the debate and confuses the issue. It's not too hard to believe that's their goal.

1109,ICE,"Junk Science: The high priests of the climate change religion decree in a recipe for global poverty that renewable energy must generate most of the world's electricity, with fossil fuels purged by the end of this century.In a report released in Copenhagen on Sunday that Secretary of State John Kerry has called ""another canary in a coal mine,"" the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has recycled its prophecies of doom. The document is titled ""Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report.""The ""synthesis"" refers to the report's being essentially the ""greatest hits"" of prior climate assessment reports that have been published since 1990, as if the falsehoods become truth in the retelling.These claims have been roundly and soundly debunked based on empirical evidence gathered by satellites and other actual observations, as well as the actual history of earth's climate, not the edited version from climate zealots that ignores inconvenient truths such as the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warm Period.The report, IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri said in a statement, demonstrates that ""we have the means to limit climate change.""Pachauri did not fully explain his prior failed predictions, such as the report that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035, a call based on unsubstantiated student theses and anecdotes from a magazine for mountain climbers.Rather than a canary in a coal mine, this report is a talking parrot with a megaphone.""Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions,"" the report claims, have led to ""atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide that are unprecedented in the last 800,000 years.""The report says that so-called renewable energy sources such as wind and solar must become 80% of the power sector by 2050 or the world will face ""severe, pervasive and irreversible damage.""Never mind that wind doesn't always blow and wind turbines carve up birds, including endangered species.Or that solar doesn't work all that well on cloudy days and requires immense amounts of sometimes-scarce water to clean the panel farms.The report states that fossil-fuel power generation without carbon capture and storage technology must be ""phased out almost entirely by 2100.""Yet a paper published recently in the journal Global Environmental Change found that carbon dioxide emissions are essentially self-regulating and that after countries reach a higher GDP level, CO2 emissions either stabilize or even decline, without the need for carbon taxes or carbon capture technology.Here in the U.S., the fracking revolution has released from our vast shale formations vast natural-gas deposits that have done more to reduce carbon emissions than any IPCC report.A study published late last year by the Energy Information Administration reported that the ""carbon intensity"" of the electricity produced in the U.S. actually fell by 13% from 2007 to 2012.British climate-change skeptic Lord Christopher Monckton recently pointed out at Marc Morano's Climate Depot that the ""Great Pause"" in global temperatures — now at 18 years and counting — has occurred even as carbon dioxide concentrations have risen.This 18-year period constitutes roughly half the satellite observation period that began in 1979.Physicist Gordon Fulks of the Cascade Policy Institute notes that the warming pause since 1997 has occurred while atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased 25%.""CO2 is responsible for global warming that is not occurring, for accelerated sea-level rise that is not occurring ... and for increasing extreme weather that is not occurring,"" he states.Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant but the source of all plant and animal life. Even if emissions were a threat, and they are not, it's prosperity and the technology that comes with it, such as fracking, that reduce overall emissions in the atmosphere.Natural gas is a fossil fuel, and we need more of it and the technology that produces it, not less.

Now that a San Francisco woman has been killed by a five-time deported illegal, that hardly seems believable.The coverage of the brazen, daylight shooting of 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle as she strolled with her father on San Francisco's touristy Pier 14 near the Bay Bridge last Friday started strangely, with TV reporters getting robbed of their cameras.The story got stranger. Steinle's killer was not ""a Texas man"" as first reported, but a politically inconvenient illegal alien with seven felonies on his record and five deportations to Mexico. Not two. Not three. Five.Immigration and Customs Enforcement had asked to deport him a sixth time after his release from jail last April through an immigration detainer, something done only for the very worst under federal policy.But San Francisco's 1989 ""sanctuary city"" law thwarted that. The sheriff's office later said it would have nabbed him if ICE had issued a warrant. Really?Fact is, many city, state and federal officials' hands are stained with blood. An unguarded border that lets in any felon, terrorist or killer — multiple times, as Sanchez showed — is a crisis, with law-abiding citizens such as Steinle paying the price.Problem one is the White House, which won't enforce immigration laws. As tens of thousands of Central Americans, including children, cross our border to join illegals that number at least 11 million, the administration refuses to deport them.Bowing to the open border lobby and vote-hungry Democrats, the White House pretends to focus on ""felons, not families."" The Steinle murder by illegal alien Francisco Sanchez puts the lie to that.Nobody worries about deportation these days. The Obama administration favors illegals, using executive orders to protect them. In 2014, Obama ordered the Department of Homeland Security to release 30,558 illegals with criminal records onto U.S. streets, after releasing 36,007 illegals in 2013.And in the past three years, these same illegals murdered 131 Americans, not counting Steinle or the El Paso woman murdered by an illegal with a hammer last weekend. How big a problem is the illegal crime wave? A 2011 Government Accountability Office report says some 300,000 inmates of federal prisons are illegals.At the state level, California Gov. Jerry Brown is complicit, too. Besides telling illegals ""you're all welcome here"" — a quarter of the nation's illegals now call California home — Brown signed off on the 2013 ""Trust Act,"" which makes it almost impossible for federal lawmen to deport illegals after they've served time for crimes.There's the city of San Francisco. Sanchez admitted to a TV reporter Monday that its 1989 sanctuary law is why he committed his crime there. He knew that whatever he did, he'd face no deportation threat.Why are American officials doing this?At the federal and state levels, it's a hunt for Democratic votes. At the city level, it's a hunt for federal funds to finance activist groups and nongovernment organizations that ""serve"" illegals and convicts. In San Francisco, for instance, glossy social service offices sit near prime tourist areas, such as where Steinle was killed.All these government actors have blood on their hands for coddling criminal illegals. Yet debate about illegals is silenced, and any talk about their breaking of more laws than other citizens, as author Ann Coulter has pointed out, is a good way to become a pariah. Just ask Donald Trump — who just happens to be rising in the polls for saying things other candidates won't.Killings such as Steinle's point to a refusal to enforce the law in order to appease left-wing special interests. Now the Obama administration blames Republicans for not passing ""comprehensive immigration reform,"" as if giving Sanchez amnesty would have prevented Steinle's murder.The administration is also trying to make it a gun-control issue, rather than an open-border issue. Will the White House ever make good on its promise to enforce the law on criminal illegals, something it demanded in exchange for ignoring noncriminal illegals? Not likely.

1134,ICE,"George Washington had only a few decisive battlefield victories. But he soared as a strategist. ""Strategic military planning starts with a clear vision of desired goals, to achieve the reasons for which a nation goes to war,"" Dave Palmer, author of ""George Washington's Military Genius,"" told IBD. ""Strategists must consider key factors influencing operations, such as tactics, weapons, geography and the quality of their forces. But the foremost factor is a full consideration of the enemy — his aims, strengths, weaknesses and capabilities. Perhaps the best example of strategic military leadership in American history is Washington.""Palmer, a retired Army three-star general and former West Point superintendent, says few histories of the American Revolution recognize its four phases and how Washington reacted correctly to each: From April 1775 to mid-1776, Americans had superior forces, and he was bold. Mid-1776 through 1777, the British army was larger and better, and he was cautious. 1778-81, bolstered by French military and naval forces, he sought decisive battle. 1782-83, with war weariness sweeping the land, he generated the will to persevere.Against daunting odds, he led Americans to independence.Virginia RiseWashington (1732-99) was born to wealthy tobacco planters near present-day Colonial Beach, Va., but his father died when he was 11.Receiving the equivalent of an elementary school education, he was a big reader the rest of his life.At 17, he was appointed to a well-paid position as county surveyor that let him buy 1,500 acres over the next two years.In 1752, Washington rose to major in the Virginia militia. As relations between France and Britain heated up, the governor sent him on a dangerous mission to the Ohio Valley to tell French troops to leave, but they refused.Two years later, Washington led Colonial troops at the start of the French and Indian War.By 1755, Lt. Col. Washington was an aide to British Gen. Edward Braddock during a 1,300-man expedition to the Ohio.They were ambushed and 465 were killed, including Braddock. Washington displayed bravery leading the retreat, as two horses were shot from under him and musket balls pierced his clothing. The governor made him a colonel and chief of the Virginia Regiment.""Unique among the founders of the U.S., Washington's primary education came from living life in its rawest form, deep in the woods, often with death a nearby companion,"" wrote Alonzo McDonald in ""Character Counts,"" edited by Os Guinness. ""The endless physical hardships he endured tested him in every way, and he survived by indomitable willpower, hardened to ridicule, failure and paucity of resources.""Washington retired to Virginia's Mount Vernon in 1758 at the end of the war and married a widow, Martha Custis, in 1759. Their land made them wealthy, though they were cash poor, and Washington diversified their crops and investments to pay debts.The expense of the war caused London's Parliament to tax the Colonies, starting with the Stamp Act in 1765. Protests led to the shots heard around the world at Lexington and Concord in April 1775.The next month, Washington was a delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia and accepted command of the Continental Army.He forced the British out of Boston in March 1776. But in August, 20,000 redcoats landed on Long Island, N.Y., and crushed the 9,000 Colonials.The Americans suffered more defeats until Washington crossed the Delaware River from New Jersey to Pennsylvania in early December, taking the only boats with them so the British couldn't maneuver. With the weather worsening, the Brits set up winter quarters while many of their Hessian mercenaries were in Trenton.""It was the darkest hour of the Revolution, with Washington losing 90% of the Army to battle, disease, desertion and enlistments that were up at the end of the month,"" said Gregory Aldrete, author of the Great Courses' audiovisual program ""The Decisive Battles of World History."" ""He knew he had to do something dramatic and planned an attack before dawn the day after Christmas at Trenton, knowing that the 1,500 Hessians would be hung over.""Washington's 2,400 men embarked as the darkness, sleet, snow and river ice made the crossing dire. Still, they surprised the enemy, killing or wounding 116 and capturing 950; the rest fled.On Jan. 2, 1777, after convincing some of his men to re-enlist and recruiting from the countryside, he returned with 1,400 against 1,000 British regulars at Princeton, inflicting 100 casualties and taking 200 prisoners. ""By a series of daring maneuvers, Washington's twin victories restored the confidence of the Army and saved the Revolution,"" said Aldrete.Here Came The FrenchIn October 1777 came a significant American victory, with Gen. Horatio Gates beating the redcoats at Saratoga, N.Y.The victory convinced France to become America's ally.Then came the winter at Valley Forge, Pa., where 2,500 of Washington's men died from cold, disease and malnutrition.Washington's winter camp of 1778-79 was again at Valley Forge, where an effort by some officers to replace him failed. ""Washington's influence over his officers would have been limited had his integrity been an abstract virtue,"" wrote Caroline Cox in ""The Art of Command,"" edited by Harry Laver and Jeffrey Matthews.The winter of 1779-80 was brutal, with the American soldiers ready to revolt. ""With powers bordering on the mystical at times, Washington was able to calm the mutineers, appealing to them not to discard the 'time, blood and treasure' they had invested in the war,"" wrote Harlow Unger in ""'Mr. President': George Washington and the Making of the Nation's Highest Office.""On New Year's Day, 1781, 1,500 Pennsylvania veterans near the end of their enlistments marched toward Congress in Philadelphia.""Washington desperately needed their manpower and wrote to the notoriously hot-headed Brig. Gen. Anthony Wayne to avoid a reaction that could drive them into the arms of the British,"" said Stephen Brumwell, author of ""George Washington: Gentleman Warrior."" ""He told him to find out their grievances and address them. His counsel to talk, not intimidate, defused the crisis, as most of the mutineers re-enlisted.""The End Was NighIn the spring of 1781, British Gen. Charles Cornwallis headed for Yorktown on the Virginia coast to get more men and supplies from the British navy.In September that year, Washington marched south with 9,000 Americans and 7,800 French to corner the 8,000 redcoats.With French ships driving off the royal navy, Washington oversaw an artillery bombardment of the British field fort. It led to Cornwallis surrendering and the British sailing home in mid-October.It was the last major battle, but a peace treaty was two years off. The delay meant that Washington had to keep his Army in the field.""He knew he commanded the love and respect of his troops, serving without pay and remaining with them in camp through the most severe winters,"" said Unger. ""Most officers in the world's armies routinely left their men in winter quarters and returned to the comforts of their homes or rented quarters.""Washington retired to Mount Vernon after war's end. But the Articles of Confederation, which set up a weak government, made paying the veterans impossible.After the ratification of the U.S. Constitution brought a more powerful central government, Washington served as president from 1789 to 1797, sometimes threatening military action to quash anti-tax rebellions.""Fearing anarchy, disunion and an end to American freedom if he failed to act decisively, he transformed the presidency from being a relatively impotent figurehead position to one with immense powers,"" said Unger.Two years after stepping down, Washington died at 67.""The outcome of the Revolution was the result of many factors, but at the head of the list must stand the strategic acumen of the American commander in chief,"" said Palmer. ""He won for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was he out-generaled all his opponents.""

"
1137,ICE,"Sugar dropped to the lowest since May 2010 on Tuesday, and coffee plunged more than 6% to post the biggest loss in more than four years. Showers across most of Brazil's growing regions last month helped replenish soil parched by dry weather in January. The brighter production outlook comes as India is poised to export more sugar and farmers gather larger coffee crops in Latin America.Brazil's weaker currency is adding to supply woes as exporters race to sell more commodities that fetch dollars in return. The real fell for six straight months against the greenback. Orange-juice futures slumped more than 7% in New York Tuesday. The South American country is also the biggest citrus grower.""The real keeps pounding coffee, sugar and orange juice prices,"" Jack Scoville, a vice president at Price Futures Group in Chicago said in a telephone interview. ""The weather continues to show potential for more rains, and that could improve the chances for production.""On ICE Futures U.S., raw sugar for May delivery fell 1.4% to settle at 13.45 cents a pound at 1 p.m. ET. The price touched 13.38 cents, the lowest since May 7, 2010.Above-average rains in Brazil's Center South, the main sugar region, mean the cane crop will be as much as 2.6% bigger than last year, according to Julio Maria Borges, a partner at consultant JOB Economia e Planejamento.
"
1138,ICE,"Leaders of dozens of Third World and post-communist countries have called on Hernando de Soto for help in freeing their economies and improving the lot of their poor.He was praised by nearly every president of the late 20th century, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, who called him ""the world's greatest living economist.""Time magazine named de Soto one of the world's 100 most influential people in 2004.Maybe the greatest praise for him came from the communist Shining Path guerrilla fighters of his native Peru. They viewed his work as such a serious threat to their Maoist revolution, they tried to assassinate him on July 20, 1992.Not only did de Soto survive their car-bomb attack on his offices (three people were killed), but also he went on to prove them right.His economic improvement, embraced by Peru's government, helped lift millions of fellow citizens out of economic limbo. This in turn undermined the guerrillas' popular support and led to the collapse of their terrorist movement, which had killed tens of thousands.Getting The Word OutFor all of this progress, de Soto admits to one enduring frustration — explaining himself to Americans.""I consider myself a total failure,"" de Soto, 73, told IBD, ""at trying to explain to the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world what informality is all about.""Informality is a central concept in de Soto's work on poverty.It describes the realm to which the Third World's poorest are relegated — banished from their nations' official economies to what he has called ""the grubby basement of the precapitalist world.""He argues that their exclusion — the product of a lack of enforceable property rights — holds back them and the entire world economy.It's why capitalism, despite its triumph over communism and its wealth generation in America and Western Europe, has failed elsewhere.Nicholas Eberstadt, an American Enterprise Institute expert on economic development, lauds de Soto for demonstrating how property rights — often disparaged by left-leaning intellectuals as an instrument of the privileged — help the poor: ""He has helped explain to convincible readers how radically egalitarian the rule of law and property rights are. Plutocrats, strongmen — they have their muscle. They can take what they choose in lawless situations. But the poor and weak are protected by the rule of law and property rights.""Americans struggle to understand the plight of the Third World's poor, de Soto says, because they take for granted the robust U.S. legal system that makes their prosperity possible.The anarchic Wild West America of squatters and gold rushers gave way long ago to a nation where: Ownership is uniformly documented and insured. Trustworthy records of transactions are easily accessible. People have fixed addresses and recorded credit histories. Property titles are sacrosanct. Convenient legal instruments exist to limit business liability.Any American can be easily found and held accountable for his bills, meaning credit can be extended and commerce conducted with great confidence.For those enjoying this rich, complex legal system and its intangible protections, it is hard to imagine a universe without it. But that is the macrocosm in which much of the world lives. In his 2000 book, ""The Mystery of Capital,"" de Soto tries to explain this universe. Utility companies in Third World countries, he notes, must skimp on investing in service or accept having 30% to 50% of their service stolen.Many neighborhoods and entire regions in poor nations lack street addresses. There are no legal records of many residents' birth or existence, let alone reliable documentation of anyone's financial or credit history. There is no legally recognized claim to ownership of many of the homes they live in.In such a low-information environment, where a utility company cannot expect its bills to be honored, investments such as small-business loans are hard to imagine.This is, after all, an atmosphere where cash is stuffed into mattresses and whose inhabitants live like illegal aliens in their own countries.De Soto was born in Arequipa, in southern Peru, in 1941. But he spent much of his youth and received his education in Europe, where his father fled after Peru's 1948 military coup.Upon his return to the South American country in 1979, de Soto found that his study of economics and his experience in both sides of the universe helped him understand how they were different.""When you step out of the door of the Nile Hilton,"" he wrote, ""what you are leaving behind is not the high-technology world of fax machines and ice makers, television and antibiotics. The people of Cairo have access to all those things. What you are really leaving behind is the world of legally enforceable transactions on property rights.""How They RiseDuring the 1990s, de Soto and a large team of assistants hit the streets of five major Third World cities to study how poor people in diverse locations cope with exclusion from the formal economy. Nowhere did the poor resemble Karl Marx's proletariat. ""In the Third World,"" de Soto says, ""the proles are actually entrepreneurs.""A large share survived through small-scale entrepreneurship — cottage industries such as the production of native art and trinkets.They exhibited all the ingenuity one would expect of entrepreneurs in dealing with informality. Everywhere he went, de Soto found that people developed their own extralegal, informal customs for establishing ownership, for imposing personal integrity in transactions.Even so, this coping mechanism is a poor substitute for a formal legal system. Local conventions are not only informal, but they also vary, making commerce with outsiders risky. This limits the scale on which even the most successful small businesses can operate.Governments are of little help to these excluded entrepreneurs, offering them cold indifference.As an experiment, de Soto tried to start a business legally in Lima — a garment shop employing one person. It took him and his team $1,200 (at that time 31 times the monthly minimum wage) and 289 six-hour days filling out forms and waiting in lines at government offices.The red tape can be even thicker when it comes to real property.In some Third World countries — the Philippines, Egypt, Haiti — de Soto found that it can take more than a decade and hundreds of visits to government offices just to establish legal title to one's home.Not So BadDe Soto wrote that these Third World entrepreneurs ""do not so much break the law as the law breaks them, and they opt out of the system,"" remaining in the shadows of the informal economy.That's the bad news. The good news, as de Soto also found in his research, is that the poor already possess the entrepreneurial spirit and the capital they need to thrive.At the turn of the century, based on his survey of five countries, de Soto estimated that all of the world's poor hold informal possession of $9.3 trillion in real estate alone — a sum that dwarfs all of the foreign aid ever granted by all the world's governments combined.With its current informal status, however, this capital is nearly useless to its possessors. It cannot be sold or traded or borrowed against. The homes informally held by the world's poor are good for keeping out the rain, and little else.That can change, but de Soto acknowledges no quick fix exists.Bringing this dead capital to life is an arduous project, one in which de Soto often participates.He recently provided economic reform plans for Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and is involved in a campaign to protect small miners' claims from being wiped out by Peru's regulations.Even so, de Soto has frequently argued that this process is not just something the economically excluded deserve — it is also something Third World governments cannot afford to withhold.He says that the recent Arab Spring was not the result of Islamists toiling and killing people for years in a fruitless effort to topple authoritarian governments. Rather, it began when a frustrated Tunisian merchant, operating in the informal economy, set himself on fire to protest the expropriation of his goods by corrupt officials.Over 60 other Middle Eastern entrepreneurs followed his example, with most surviving their burns.""The ones that died, and that made everyone else flock to the streets, they were entrepreneurs,"" de Soto said. ""They all complained that they had been expropriated of their capital.""Soon governments fell, and the 23-year reign of Tunisia's president was over by January 2011.

1139,ICE,"Immigration: If President Obama, who has warned ICE agents of consequences if they do their job, had a son, he might look like Jamiel Shaw Jr., a young African-American killed by an illegal alien who shouldn't have been here.Shaw was a Los Angeles high school star dreaming of a good life ahead when he was gunned down on March 2, 2008, while walking home. He was picked at random, police said, possibly as part of a gang loyalty test for the illegal alien who shot him.Charged with the crime was Pedro Espinoza, who'd been released just hours earlier from Los Angeles County Jail where he spent four months for brandishing a firearm and resisting arrest. Espinoza is an illegal alien.Some will say, well, that was on President George W. Bush's watch. True, but it also occurred in Los Angeles, a sanctuary city where policy is not to cooperate with federal authorities on enforcing immigration laws or aid in deporting illegal aliens.The sanctuary policies that led to the murder of Shaw are now full-blown federal policies under Obama. ""We're not in the business of deporting millions of people or of breaking up families,"" he says. We're also not in the business of deporting criminal illegal aliens.More than 36,007 aliens with criminal records and 88,000 crimes on their rap sheets were released back onto American streets by the administration in 2013.In a letter sent to Obama last August, Donald Rosenberg, a self-described ""lifelong, very liberal Democrat,"" said his 25-year-old son Drew, run over and killed by an illegal in 2010, would still be alive if Washington consistently deported illegals who have conflicts with law enforcement.On Wednesday, Jamiel Shaw Sr. gave moving testimony before a House Oversight and Government reform subcommittee hearing about the consequences of open borders, not deporting criminal illegal aliens and not enforcing existing immigration laws""My son, Jamiel Shaw II, was murdered while walking on his own street, three houses down from his home. An illegal alien on his first gun charge was visiting a neighbor when my son was coming home,"" Shaw testified. ""He shot my son in the stomach and then in the head, killing him.""Shaw then asked an obvious question: ""Do black lives really matter? Or does it matter only if you are shot by a white person or white policeman?""Also on Wednesday, President Obama was telling employees at Immigration and Customs Enforcement that they had better enforce his executive amnesty orders or else.Speaking at a Miami town hall meeting sponsored by MSNBC and Telemundo, Obama said ""there may be (an) ICE official or Border Patrol agent not paying attention to our new directives. If somebody's working for ICE . . . and they don't follow the policy, there's going to be consequences to it.""He compared it to the military where soldiers ""are expected to follow"" orders given by their superiors. He forgot that soldiers are not obligated to follow an illegal order, that the legality and constitutionality of his executive amnesty is being challenged by 26 states and that a federal judge has temporarily halted its implementation.The grief voiced by Jamiel Shaw Sr. and Donald Rosenberg is shared by too many. If ICE follows Obama's illegal orders to not enforce existing immigration laws, other American families will suffer the consequences of his actions.

1153,ICE,"In the March 2010 issue of Foreign Affairs Journal, Harvard history professor Niall Ferguson published a terrific article (IMHO) outlining the complexity of systems and the interaction of forces as it relates to the rise and fall of great societies throughout history. In it he described how large empires could be defined as complex systems that are ""asymmetrically organized,"" meaning their construction more resembles a termite hill than an Egyptian pyramid. As complex systems, these societies tended to share certain observable and ubiquitous features. These included the interaction of many dispersed agents, multiple levels of organization, sometimes a lack of central control, continual adaptation, incessant creation of new niches and the absence of uniformity. The author went on to describe how these systems operated somewhere between order and disorder—on ""the edge of chaos"" as he suggested—appearing quite stable for long periods and seemingly in a state of equilibrium. Eventually, however, this observable equilibrium would be disrupted. Very often it would be an ostensibly small event or action, a ""tipping point,"" that would trigger a meaningful disruption. 
"
1154,ICE,"Scientists define this notion of ""edge of chaos"" as being in a ""critical state"" or near ""phase transition,"" such as the moments prior to water turning to steam or ice, or just before a nuclear reaction. This concept is not exclusive to the academic halls of science, however, nor is it restricted to applications related to states of matter and energy. These ""tipping points"" leading to ""phase transitions""—sometimes insignificant and sometimes world changing—surround us every day in the interactions and activities of our collective experience. They are at work in the earth's crust when shifting tectonic plates lead to an earthquake in California, in society when the courageous decision of a heroic black woman to no longer sit unjustly at the back of a bus leads to a paradigm shift in civil rights and cultural thinking, and of course in stock markets where home foreclosures in Nevada end with the bankruptcy of one of the most staid and iconic financial institutions on Wall Street. 
"
1155,ICE,"Tipping points and phase transitions are everywhere and always, and could happen upon us at any moment in any circumstance. In terms of the markets, our world could easily be assessed as one that is perpetually on the brink of phase transition, or as described by economist John Mauldin in a ""state of stable disequilibrium."" That is to say that participants from all over the world are connected inextricably together in a complex and layered loom of investments, debt, trade, globalization, international business, finance, currency and banks. All operate in a critical yet stable state, in between periods of market rest (low volatility and bull runs) and reaction (high volatility and bears).

While not directly addressing investments, the book does provide some insight and understanding as to why financial markets can seemingly advance for long periods relatively smoothly, sometimes years, until a sudden onset of chaos or Nassim Taleb's ""Black Swan""-type of events emerge, triggering market corrections or crashes. 
"
1159,ICE,"The book describes the work of three physicists studying in 1987 at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. The physicists, Per Bak, Chao Tang, and Kurt Wiesenfeld, used a computer program to create a virtual sand pile. The program was designed to stack one virtual grain of sand at a time and monitor the results, with an eye toward studying ""non-equilibrium systems,"" i.e., the crazy world that surrounds all of us every day—Wall Street notwithstanding. Over the course of their experiment the physicists learned some really interesting things. One might assume that they would have been able to observe some sort of pattern-like behavior in the sand pile, such as a typical size or number of grains required before a collapse, but this was not the case. On the contrary, each time the experiment was run the results were completely chaotic in their unpredictability. After a large number of tests with millions of grains of sand, they observed no patterns, no typical number required to trigger a system collapse. Sometimes it was a single grain, others 10, 100 or 5,000. Still others involved massive mountains of sand incorporating millions of grains that would collapse in a single and seemingly random onset of failure. In other words literally anything, at any time, might be just about to occur. Perpetually on the brink of phase transition. 
"
1160,ICE,"This kind of stuff sticks with me when I think of the markets … and positioning portfolios. 
"
1161,ICE,"In an attempt to gain some insight into the cause of such unpredictability in their sand pile game—or in an effort to assign some order to the disorder they observed—the scientists pushed their experiment further. Now they looked at the virtual sand pile from above, and they color coded its regions according to steepness, with relatively flat areas green and steeper sections red. 
"
1162,ICE,"In the beginning the pile was mostly green of course (though it still would collapse periodically) but as the game progressed more red areas began to infiltrate, until eventually a dense skeleton of random red danger spots coursed through the sand like tributaries in the Mekong Delta. This offered some insight into the peculiar behavior (though no real predictability), as a grain of sand falling on a red spot could, by domino-like action, cause a sliding at other nearby red spots. 
"
1163,ICE,"If the red network was sparse and all trouble spots were well isolated, then a single grain would likely have only limited repercussions if any; again, the triggering was random. But as the red spots began to grow and interconnect the impact of the next grain would become fiendishly unpredictable. Sometimes it fell innocuously and did nothing to the pile, sometimes a few grains tumbled, and every so often it set off a cataclysmic reaction sending walls of sand cascading down the entire pile. 
"
1164,ICE,"Tributaries of Uncertainty 
"
1165,ICE,"The author defines these as fingers of instability, but I prefer to consider them tributaries of uncertainty, and not for any copyright infringement risk or pride of authorship, but because ""instability"" implies, in a way, that an avalanche is imminent, when in fact the experiment showed there is no rhyme or reason. Things can happen just as easily as they cannot. The point being that we are always uncertain, and so we must always be prepared and sheltered appropriately for living in the uncertain world, investment portfolios notwithstanding. 
"
1166,ICE,"If we did learn anything from the sand pile experiment it is that while we cannot predict what grain of sand may trigger the next phase transition, we can get a sense of the potential size and scope of any imminent disruption to the pile by looking at the steepness and the interconnectedness of the tributaries. 
"
1167,ICE,"In terms of steepness of the market sand pile, there are ample data that we can observe that illustrates—both literally and figuratively—there is much surrounding us today. That said, we can observe that a significant number of tributaries of uncertainty throughout the pile appear quite extended. 
"
1168,ICE,"So what about market interconnectedness, the other factor in the sand experiment? Unfortunately quantifying market interconnectedness is a bit more difficult from a data analysis standpoint. If there is a resonant lesson from periods of chaos such as 2008, 1987, etc., however, it is the understanding that things that do not correlate in normal conditions can and often do when sand castles crumble. That much we can be certain of. 
"
1169,ICE,"The bottom line is that, while I cannot see the future, I do not believe the global marketplace is going to experience a major crash anytime soon (ideally never). Indeed, I am actually optimistic about prospects for equities this year. Nonetheless, I feel markets getting more fragile and volatile as the years move on. On some days it just feels spooky, and certainly not the time to be a full-on bull across the board. The markets today are like nothing they were even 10 years ago. That is not to say they are riskier, because again that is such an abstract and immeasurable quantity to gauge in aggregate that no one could ever know. But it is fair to say they are more complex, even by 2008 standards. The number of participants, assets under management, trading strategies, number of tradable instruments, the light-speed at which information is moved and processed … all of these are grains of sand building the pile. When things go wrong in a complex system, the scale of disruption is nearly impossible to anticipate. There is no such thing as a typical or average forest fire, for example. To use the jargon of modern physics, a forest before a fire is in a state of ""self-organized criticality"": it is teetering on the verge of a breakdown pending a spark, but the size of the breakdown is always unknown. 
"
1170,ICE,"I do not know if the divergence we see among central banks in the world will continue. I have no idea if commodity prices will continue to collapse or if a rapid gain in US dollars versus foreign currencies will spark further deflation and contagion. Are 30-year lows in bond market yields hinting at an economic sinkhole?

1176,ICE,"What Are the Risks? 
"
1177,ICE,"All investments involve risk, including possible loss of principal. The value of investments can go down as well as up, and investors may not get back the full amount invested. Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against risk of loss. For long periods of time, the markets can advance relatively smoothly until a sudden onset of chaos occurs, a ""tipping point"" that quickly changes the picture. Some might say the recent drop in oil would be a case in point. Brooks Ritchey, senior managing director at K2 Advisors, Franklin Templeton Solutions, explores the tipping points that trigger dramatic market turns, and ponders whether he thinks global equities may be teetering on the edge of one today. J. Brooks Ritchey Senior Managing Director at K2 Advisors, Franklin Templeton Solutions In the March 2010 issue of Foreign Affairs Journal, Harvard history professor Niall Ferguson published a terrific article (IMHO) outlining the complexity of systems and the interaction of forces as it relates to the rise and fall of great societies throughout history. In it he described how large empires could be defined as complex systems that are ""asymmetrically organized,"" meaning their construction more resembles a termite hill than an Egyptian pyramid. As complex systems, these societies tended to share certain observable and ubiquitous features. These included the interaction of many dispersed agents, multiple levels of organization, sometimes a lack of central control, continual adaptation, incessant creation of new niches and the absence of uniformity. The author went on to describe how these systems operated somewhere between order and disorder—on ""the edge of chaos"" as he suggested—appearing quite stable for long periods and seemingly in a state of equilibrium. Eventually, however, this observable equilibrium would be disrupted. Very often it would be an ostensibly small event or action, a ""tipping point,"" that would trigger a meaningful disruption. Scientists define this notion of ""edge of chaos"" as being in a ""critical state"" or near ""phase transition,"" such as the moments prior to water turning to steam or ice, or just before a nuclear reaction. This concept is not exclusive to the academic halls of science, however, nor is it restricted to applications related to states of matter and energy. These ""tipping points"" leading to ""phase transitions""—sometimes insignificant and sometimes world changing—surround us every day in the interactions and activities of our collective experience. They are at work in the earth's crust when shifting tectonic plates lead to an earthquake in California, in society when the courageous decision of a heroic black woman to no longer sit unjustly at the back of a bus leads to a paradigm shift in civil rights and cultural thinking, and of course in stock markets where home foreclosures in Nevada end with the bankruptcy of one of the most staid and iconic financial institutions on Wall Street. Tipping points and phase transitions are everywhere and always, and could happen upon us at any moment in any circumstance. In terms of the markets, our world could easily be assessed as one that is perpetually on the brink of phase transition, or as described by economist John Mauldin in a ""state of stable disequilibrium."" That is to say that participants from all over the world are connected inextricably together in a complex and layered loom of investments, debt, trade, globalization, international business, finance, currency and banks. All operate in a critical yet stable state, in between periods of market rest (low volatility and bull runs) and reaction (high volatility and bears). So this then begs the question, what are the sorts of tipping points that may trigger a market phase transition? Are they observable? Can they be monitored and anticipated? Sand Piles In the book Ubiquity: Why Catastrophes Happen (Crown Publishing, 2002) social scientist Mark Buchanan explores the concepts of complexity theory, chaos theory and critical states.

1212,ICE,"Propaganda: Global warming alarmists are fond of saying they have science on their side, while global warming skeptics are anti-science. So who actually knows more about climate science? You guessed it.The difference isn't huge, but the findings of a study show that global warming skeptics score better on climate science questions than those who believe man is causing the planet to warm through the combustion of fossil fuels.A paper that will appear in the journal Advances in Political Psychology says that, on average, skeptics got 4.5 questions right while the followers of the faith averaged four correct answers. This doesn't mean skeptics are more informed; it just means they're not poorly informed, which is what alarmists want us all to believe.The paper was written by Yale Law School professor Dan Kahan, not a skeptic looking for a particular outcome. He quizzed about 2,000 people with nine questions, asking about such issues as melting North Pole ice and skin cancer risk in a supposedly warming world.Some warm-mongers won't like what Kahan found. They like to ridicule those who don't buy into the popular narrative, portraying them as unscientific rubes. Or as Kahan told Fox News, the believers are often ""screaming"" in skeptics' faces and telling them that they and everyone they identify with ""rejects science.""He followed that Wednesday with a blog post saying ""I don't think it is useful at all to characterize as 'anti-science' the 50% of U.S. general population who, using exactly the same forms of reasoning as those who conclude that best evidence supports belief in AGW, conclude that the best evidence doesn't support it.""The skeptic in us marvels that the publication of Kahan's study comes about the same time as the postponement of a fossil fuel protest at his school. Seems it was too cold and snowy for members of Fossil Free Yale to leave the comfort of their homes — homes, by the way, that are almost certainly warmed by fossil fuel.The alarmists tell us that global warming is, well, not actually warming but ""climate change,"" and it will bring the extreme weather we've seen this winter.We get the rebranding effort. When reality refuted the notion that man was warming the planet, when the cold and snow never stopped, and as winter kept coming each year, something had to be done or the movement was finished.So it marches on, though with a limp and stripped of its claim that skeptics think the Earth is flat.

1236,ICE,"So far in the 2016 presidential race -- and we are not yet very far into it -- Jeb Bush has been the key player. His December announcement of interest completely changed the timetable of the entire field of wannabes. He's already ahead in some key state polls like New Hampshire, even before announcing a candidacy.And his fundraising prowess is apparently off-and-running, though actual numbers won't be available until mid-July's report.And while many candidates must plead with news media for coverage, the free publicity that is any campaign's lifeblood, reporters and cameras flock to every Jeb Bush appearance. That kind of independent scrutiny can, of course, be dangerous, witness Scott Walker's flub on evolution in London and the vaccination stumbles of Chris Christie and Rand Paul.Wednesday Bush spoke in Chicago at the Council on Global Affairs offering some of his opening foreign policy thoughts, much as he did last month in Detroit on the economy. ""The great irony of the Obama presidency is this,"" Bush said. ""Someone who came to office promising greater engagement with the world has left America less influential in the world.""But the Chicago speech also revealed the trickiest
"

"
1239,ICE,"the family name while setting himself apart as an individual? Inevitably, media and primary competition will ask how Jeb will be different from GW, who was acclaimed after 9/11 but left office in 2009 battered by the economy and Iraq war?Jeb started that separation process in Chicago. ""I have been fortunate to have a father and a brother who both have shaped America’s foreign policy from the Oval Office,"" Bush told his attentive audience. ""I recognize that as a result, my views will often be held up in comparison to theirs, sometimes in contrast to theirs. I love my father and my brother. I admire their service to the nation and the difficult decisions they had to make. But I am my own man. And my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experiences.""You will hear the capsule explanation many, many times in coming months.Back in the 1990's when his two political sons became active in top-level state governments, the first President Bush wrote his boys an identical letter, freeing them from any fears about criticizing him or his policies in their own careers.With its appetite for something new every day, the media portray primary campaigns as daily horse races or arm-wrestles. He charged. He replied.As one result, American primary campaigns are often seen by news consumers as grinding, tedious affairs, especially in New Hampshire living rooms and Iowa cafes. Those two dozen-plus GOP debates in 2012 made the NFL pre-season seem like playoffs.Primary campaigns are indeed tedious -- to watch. But they are also absolutely essential educational and tempering experiences for candidates and their staffs to live and endure--18-hour days, different hotels every night, on their toes every second for news elsewhere, attacks, damage control. Don't get out any violins for them. No one made them do this. It's exciting. And they're not complaining.How quickly can each team learn countless local issues like ethanol in Iowa or school boards in New Hampshire, digest their substance and form replies that are responsive, coherent, yet not so radical that they detract from the campaign's major themes and message of the day?Unlike freshman senators, Jeb Bush is a campaign and media veteran from his father's campaigns, his brother's campaigns, helping allies in other states and his own two successful statewide gubernatorial races.But his growing brigade of 2016 advisers has an awful lot of familiar names from previous Bush teams that will avoid many rookie mistakes but may complicate Jeb's effort to claim he's a different Bush.On the other side, Hillary Clinton's congealing campaign is rife with names from Obama's assault troops and even her hubby's posse from the last century.In the Bush family, Jeb was always seen as the best politician. While George W. was intense, even impatient, Jeb looks relaxed and comfortable among crowds he's never seen before and will never see again. Posing for cellphone photos. Patting small children on the head while talking with their parents.The best pols on the national level like Bill Clinton and Jeb seem present to everyone they talk with, even in the simple act of shaking hands. Looking them in the eye, acknowledging their comments.Others like Rick Santorum are idly shaking one hand while already looking ahead to the next greeter. After some long days, these candidates must ice their sore right-hand, like baseball pitchers after a game.Hillary was dogged and aggressive against the Chicagoan in 2007-08. But if, as expected, she cruises through the Democrat primary season unchallenged, she will not have that essential tempering experience. Her 2014 book tour revealed a clear stump rustiness.And how will she differentiate herself from the White House incumbent without seeming disloyal or, worse, like a third term of the over-promising, under-delivering, finger-pointer?In 1988, Vice President Bush was happy to run as a third term of the popular Reagan. Not likely this time.Jeb Bush has problems with the GOP primary base--Common Core and immigration reform, among them. But he also has a substantive conservative governing record as a chief executive for two terms in Florida. The extent to which within the distracting media cacophony he can highlight those achievements while differentiating himself from Dad and brother will determine his fate.This week he launched that long process.RELATED:Hillary's poll numbers collapseObama reveals that sinister 'flexibility' he promised RussiaAs Egypt, Jordan bomb ISIS, Obama sets two speeches on extremismObama equating ISIS of 2015 with Crusades of 1096 A.D. draws disbelief

1246,ICE,"Climate Change: The president's science czar, who once said there are too many people and advocated sterilizing people through drinking water, says at least human activity is preventing the ice age that we'd been warned about.A tenet of global warming theology, now dubbed ""climate change"" to cover everything that used to be called weather, is that man is warming the Earth by manufacturing and exhaling carbon dioxide and that one of the consequences, and the theme of the science-fiction movie ""Day After Tomorrow,"" is that said warming could trigger a new ice age.John Holdren, who holds the title of assistant to the president for science and technology, shares this view as well.But in a recent online question-and-answer session in which he fielded queries from the public, he let slip the seeming contradiction that without the influence of man and his industrial activities, the Earth would probably be slipping into a cyclical ice age all on its own, just like the last one.""While the climate of the Earth has changed over millennia as a result of natural factors — principally changes in the tilt and orientation of the Earth's axis and rotation, and in the shape of its orbit around the sun — those changes occur far too gradually to have noticeable effects over a period of mere decades,"" Holdren said on a video obtained by MRC-TV.""In their current phases, moreover, they would be gradually cooling the Earth — taking us to another ice age — if they weren't being more than offset by human-caused warming.""Wait, what? Human-caused warming is preventing another ice age?Isn't this a good thing? Why would we want to stop it and return to an age of roughly 20,000 years ago when glaciers were carving out the Great Lakes and leaving Chicago under a mile-thick sheet of ice?We admit we're a little confused here, seeing that anthropogenic global warming, according to climate zealots, is supposed to bring on an ice age that Holdren says it's preventing.But then, climate theology is full of contradictions, and if it's too wet or too dry, too cold or too warm, it's all blamed on global warming.Still, Holdren's statement is not likely to sit well with the high priests of climate change.We are reminded of an article in the June 24, 1974, issue of Time entitled ""Another Ice Age?"" It told of how, ""when meteorologists take an average of temperatures around the globe, they find that the atmosphere has been gradually cooler for the past three decades.""Time spoke then of a ""global climatic upheaval"" and ""climatological Cassandras who are becoming increasingly apprehensive, for the weather aberrations they are studying may be the harbinger of another ice age.""A 1977 Time cover advised us on ""How To Survive The Coming Ice Age.""Reputable scientists using satellites and other observations have noted another cooling period underway since 1998, as global temperatures have virtually flat-lined. Declining solar activity in the current cycle correlates with other cool periods in Earth's history. It ties in perfectly with climate history that shows the warming and cooling of Earth is a natural and cyclical process.We tend to side with those who believe that when compared to the ""natural factors"" Holdren spoke of — such as the influence of that giant thermonuclear furnace called the sun that we orbit, ocean currents, etc. — the contribution of man to the mix is rather tiny.To the extent it might in fact be extending the current interglacial period we are in, well, that's fine with us.

1271,ICE,"Climate Change: A startling claim has been made by the European Space Agency. It says that loss of ice in the West Antarctic has caused a shift in Earth's gravity. So are polar bears about to drown or fly off into space?To the list of things caused by global warming, including rising seas, fiercer and more frequent storms, forest fires and widespread disease, we can now add a weakening of gravity due to melting ice.Based on measurements from a European Space Agency's satellite, researchers have said that so much ice loss has occurred in West Antarctica that there's been a decline in Earth's gravitational pull in the region.Although the researchers assure us the gravity's loss from November 2009 to June 2012 is too small to actually cause things to levitate into space, it's cited as one more example of the impact of so-called man-made global warming.Climate-change zealots seem obsessed with the West Antarctic ice sheet, which holds less than 10% of the continent's ice . The 2004 science fiction movie ""The Day After Tomorrow"" opened with a portion of the sheet shearing off as a prelude to planetary doom.But on Sept. 25, 2013, the Washington Post reported that Antarctic sea ice had grown to a record extent for the second straight year — some 19.51 million square kilometers. In June of this year, the Post noted a possible new record ice extent is ""part of a puzzling 33-year trend in increasing sea ice around Antarctica.""Meanwhile, Dr. Don J. Easterbrook, a geology professor at Western Washington University, has pointed out that the East Antarctic sheet, which holds about 90% of the world's fresh water, is not melting, but expanding.We're reminded of the ironic plight of the Russian-flagged research vessel, which, filled with climate scientists, got stuck in an Antarctic ice sheet so thick that early attempts at breaking through the ice to free them failed. In a statement only climate-change diehards could make, the researchers said ""sea ice is disappearing due to climate change, but here ice is building up.""Gravity, like global temperatures and sea ice, is not really a constant but varies across the globe. And it is not in jeopardy either.Among the other problems recently blamed on global warming is the rise of the Islamic State. This was explained in ""How Climate Change Helped ISIS,"" published in September in the Huffington Post.So climate change is now responsible for gravity loss and terrorism. We are awaiting word on Ebola.

1291,ICE,"Veteran Neglect: A Navy and Marine Corps veteran asks a House panel why an administration that says it leaves no one behind has let a soldier with post-traumatic stress disorder sit in a Mexican jail for six months.From the famous ""latte salute"" to the Marine holding the presidential umbrella, President Obama's respect for our men in uniform has been open to question. Unless, of course, they desert their post in Afghanistan to try to join the Taliban, like Bowe Bergdahl. Then you have the parents to the White House and trade the Taliban general staff to obtain their release. After all, we leave no one behind.Except, maybe, for Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi.Jill Tahmooressi, Andrew's mother, has never been invited to stand by the president on the White House lawn. Nor has she ever received a phone call from President Obama, as she testified Wednesday before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee. Presidential calls of support are reserved for basketball players like Jason Collins, whom Obama called to say ""he was impressed by his courage,"" according to a White House spokesperson, for announcing that he was gay.For our part, we are impressed by the courage of Sgt. Tahmooressi, who served two tours of duty fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, and his mother. Her son fought the enemy instead of trying to join them. And for making a wrong turn into Mexico while carrying legal American firearms in his trunk as he journeyed to San Diego for treatment of his PTSD, he now sits in a Mexican jail ignored by the country he risked his life for.When asked why Obama hadn't picked up his phone or pen to call or write the president of Mexico about Tahmooressi, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that the matter was being handled through State Department channels.The administration seems in agreement with what Mexico's consul general in San Francisco recently told Breitbart News: ""We have to respect the judicial system in Mexico as in the States. We have to respect what the judge will actually do.""We beg to differ, as does California State Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, who told Breitbart, ""When the Mexican military crosses the border with fully automatic assault weapons, we don't arrest them even though they are in violation of California law. We give them GPSes and send them back where they came from.""Is Sgt. Tahmooressi being made an example and being punished by the Mexican government in retaliation for Operation Fast and Furious, the Obama administration's gun-walking program that resulted in thousands of weapons winding up in the hands of Mexican drug cartels? Those weapons have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Mexican nationals as well as Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and ICE Agent Jaime Zapata.Sgt. Tahmooressi was not walking guns into Mexico, and the Mexican government surely must know it. So why the unwarranted incarceration for a traumatized American combat veteran who should be in a U.S. hospital getting treatment rather than in a Mexican jail getting ignored by his commander-in-chief?Also testifying at Wednesday's hearing was former TV talk show host and 22-year veteran of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Montel Williams. He has fought valiantly against the mistreatment of veterans in the VA scandal and considers Tahmooressi's mistreatment as another example of veteran neglect.There are indications that Tahmooressi may soon be released in the face of mounting pressure on humanitarian grounds. But the Obama administration barely lifted a finger to make it happen.""To me, this is an abomination,"" Williams testified regarding the administration's tepid response to Tahmooressi's imprisonment. ""He didn't hesitate to say, 'Aye, aye, sir,' to go off and serve. How dare we! How dare we, as a nation, hesitate to get that young man back?""How dare we indeed.

ICE Special Agent Jaime Zapata was also a Fast and Furious casualty.""I do not find it a coincidence that Eric Holder chose now to resign after Judge Bates denied the request from the DOJ to delay the release of the Fast and Furious documents,"" Terry-Willis told Katie Pavlich of Townhall.com.""I personally think Eric Holder was really hoping that the documents would never be made public to my family and to the American people,"" she said.That would be U.S. District Judge John D. Bates, and the documents would be those Fast and Furious documents withheld from Rep. Darrell Issa's House Oversight Committee despite a subpoena and from the people despite a Freedom of Information Act request.They were withheld under the guise of executive privilege, the same excuse used by the Nixon administration to withhold the Watergate tapes that would eventually bring it down.""Seventy-five days, plus another 21, based in part on Judiciary (sic) Watch's consent, is enough time for the government to prepare the index (justifying the withholding) that this court has ordered, given that this matter has been pending for over two years,"" Bates wrote in his ruling.Agreeing with Terry-Willis' assessment and Bates' ruling is Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.The AG's exit, he said, ""is past-due accountability for Holder's Fast and Furious lies, and I hope it brings some solace to the family of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and the hundreds of innocent Mexicans likely killed thanks to the Holder Justice Department's scheme that armed the murderous Mexican drug cartels.""We hope so, too, as we watch the welcome departure of a scandal-ridden attorney general who in June 2012 was held in civil and criminal contempt of Congress for withholding these documents relating to DOJ, according to testimony by ATF agents.As a result of his Fast and Furious misconduct, Holder has been accused of knowingly allowing and facilitating the illegal trafficking of some 2,500 weapons to Mexican cartels.""Will we ever get the accountability for my brother, Brian, Jaime Zapata, and every other person who lost their lives to the guns from this horrific scandal?"" Terry-Willis asks.We may be about to, with justice for Brian Terry and the others being delayed but no longer denied.

Deadly weather caused more than $8 billion in property damage in 2013 and resulted in 440 weather-related fatalities, according to a National Weather Service report.The hit for businesses? One-in-four affected by weather disasters never reopen. That finding comes from the Insurance Information Institute, which stressed the importance of disaster planning and business interruption coverage in the wake of 2012's Hurricane Sandy.• Respond fast.

""These things happen in business, and you have to have a plan in place."" The firm's priority? ""Minimal, if any, disruption to our clients.""• Begin simply. Crafting strategies to deal with wide-ranging catastrophes can feel like a daunting undertaking. ""Start by trying to handle the most likely events first,"" Campbell said, like fire or regional weather events.• Keep it alive. Plans should evolve and periodically be reviewed, fine-tuned and practiced. ""It's always a work in progress,"" Campbell said. ""You can't forget about it. It's just like a fire drill.""• Commit. Many firms have an emergency plan, but only 30% of small-business decision-makers report having a formal business continuity plan, according to the Travelers Business Risk Index.Company chiefs should prioritize such preparation, which protects that bottom line. ""This isn't just a safety function. This is a business operational function,"" said Ken Katz, risk control property director with insurance firm Travelers (TRV).• Cover bases. Travelers' step-by-step approach, called ABC-Go, includes assessing risks, performing a business impact analysis, developing controls for prevention and mitigation, and testing the plan.

""You need that breadth of experience,"" Katz said.• Add accountability.  Formalize the process by setting goals and deadlines. Some companies include disaster preparation as a responsibility within job descriptions. ""Now there's an incentive to keeping that going,"" Katz said.• Run through it. Test that plan. ""There's nothing like doing it"" for finding blind spots, said Katz.

""It's going to be a slow process of probably going down until there's an increase in demand.""Cotton for December delivery dropped 2% to settle at 61.57 cents a pound at 2:20 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, after touching 61.02 cents, the lowest for a most-active contract since Oct. 5, 2009.Hanesbrands typically hedges its cotton position six to nine months ahead of delivery, and the decline in prices will probably be seen in the company's balance sheet by about the second quarter of 2015, Richard Moss, the chief financial officer, said on an earnings call in July.

1307,ICE,"The military salute is a simple hand gesture but loaded with tradition, honor, symbolism and packed with respect, both given and returned. It began in the days of chivalry when knights would raise their right hand approaching other knights to show they had no weapon unsheathed.The salute seems often to confound civilians without military experience, who see it as somewhat akin to a fraternity hand sign. Every modern president since Truman has had military (and saluting) experience -- except two Democrats.And both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have had trouble with the salute. Clinton because his first-term salutes were sloppy and awkward. And Obama because preoccupied with himself he has on occasion neglected to return the salutes offered by presidential Marine guards as a sign of respect for the office, not the individual.Tuesday Obama stepped in it again when deplaning from Marine One in New York. At the foot of the short stairs the Marine sergeant and corporal offered snappy Corps salutes. You can see in the video above Obama's whatever response. If either Marine ever saluted as diffidently as that, they would be severely reprimanded.Obama's relations with the military have been testy at times. With Pancho Biden urging suspicion of all generals, Obama has often rejected their advice (arm Syrian moderates years ago, surge 40,000 troops into Afghanistan, keep at least 10,000 in Iraq).And there are widespread doubts among troops and officers alike -- no doubt fed by this incident -- that while Obama reads the right words about the volunteer force (scroll down for recent examples), he's said a lot of things over time it turns out he didn't really mean.It wasn't like the president's hands were full of nuclear launch codes. He could simply have switched the cup to his left hand.By definition, all presidential gestures -- physical or verbal -- are loaded with extra significance. George Washington, for instance, refused to shake hands as beneath his dignity. Thomas Jefferson thought such gestures a welcome sign of democracy among countrymen.Today, American politicians shake so many hands, they must at times soak theirs in ice to stem the swelling. Chief executives use their gestures to advantage, waving or pointing into crowds where hundreds will recall the gesture was directed at them.At an ObamaCare event last spring Obama thanked a score of people for their dedication and hard work. But when he neglected to mention HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius, sitting directly in front, that gesture accurately foretold her imminent cabinet departure.Technically as civilians, presidents are not entitled to salute. And the first 39 never did, even ex-generals. In 1981, however, former Navy officer Ronald Reagan said he felt uncomfortable not acknowledging Marines' salutes in kind. The Marine Commandant suggested no one would ever complain about getting a commander-in-chief's salute.So, Reagan began the tradition, continued by his four successors -- with some embarrassing mistakes along the way.Remarks to Troops at MacDill Air Force Base, Sept. 17, 2014:""I want to thank all of you for your service; I want to thank all of you for your sacrifice....As your Commander-in-Chief, I could not be more proud of each and every one of you.""Remarks at Camp Pendleton:""Now, I've got to tell you the truth, I’ve been looking forward to this visit because -- and this is a little tricky to say this -- but my family and I, we've got a special place in our hearts for the Marine Corps. Now, part of it is because every day at the White House, we’re surrounded by Marines....""And then, of course, every time I need kind of a hop, skip and a jump somewhere, every time I get on Marine One, I rely on some of the best aviators in the world. I’ve seen your Honor; I've seen your Courage; I've seen your Commitment....""After all you’ve given our nation, you have to know your nation will always be faithful to you. As your Commander-in-Chief, that’s my commitment to you.""Medal of Honor ceremony, July 21, 2014:""It is remarkable that we have young men and women serving in our military who, day in, day out, are able to perform with so much integrity, so much humility, and so much courage.""Weekly Address, May 24, 2013:""At a time when only about one percent of the American people bear the burden of our defense, the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform isn’t always readily apparent. That’s partly because our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and coast guardsmen are so skilled at what they do.""It’s also because those who serve tend to do so quietly. They don’t seek the limelight. They don’t serve for our admiration, or even our gratitude.""Medal of Honor ceremony, Sept. 15, 2014:""May God keep safe those who wear our country's uniform.""RELATED:From the halls of Montezuma to Obama servantObama rids America's military of yet another top general'The surest path to danger is always weakness, indecision'--RomneyObama offers a fainting crowd advice on how to stand listening to him

1373,ICE,"Global Warming: The White House's climate report predictably forecasts doom — unless, of course, we spend a lot of money. The alarmists never quit. They have too much invested in the hysteria they've whipped up.The Council of Economic Advisers' report, released Tuesday, says the U.S. has to act now to dampen the effects of man-made climate change or face painful expenses in dealing with it later.""What this report makes clear is first of all, we know way more than enough to justify acting today,"" said Jason Furman, who chairs President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.""Delaying action will increase the cost.""As we've noted many times, most recently on Friday, the climate change scare is not about saving the environment. It's about eliminating capitalism — or for the Obama government, at least getting a tight grip around its throat.How the administration can make such an argument is beyond us. It wants to ""insure"" the country from the ill effects of a warming planet, but there is no way to know what those effects will be nor is their severity an established fact.What is fact is that climate alarmism has been with us a long time and it has whipsawed back and forth from terrifying stories of a coming ice age to pumped-up anxiety of an overheated planet since at least 1895.Website butnowyouknow.net documented this pattern a few years ago. The fretting begins with a February 1895 New York Times story headlined ""Geologists Think the World May Be Frozen Up Again.""Seven years later, the scaremongers were busy with warming theories that produced this Los Angeles Times headline: ""Disappearing Glaciers ... deteriorating slowly, with a persistency that means their final annihilation ... scientific fact ... surely disappearing.""From 1912 to 1924, dread of an ice age had returned, only to be replaced with a long, nearly uninterrupted run of warming panics through the late 1960s, early 1970s.Next came the era of the new ice age warnings. But when those predictions failed to become reality, it was time in 1981 to make another flip-flop. That year, the New York Times wrote ""of an almost unprecedented magnitude"" of warming.The fear-of-warming phase has run relentlessly since, propped up by political, scientific and social bullying, and a complicit media that takes any and every position that increases government and promotes the redistribution of wealth — either from high earners to those on the low (or no) side, or to politically connected cronies from everyone else.All too often those politically connected cronies got rich off of green schemes funded by taxpayers and investors who bought into the scam because of its environmental cred. And all too often those projects either did nothing to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions, or they simply went bust.So we have already been spending money to ""stem climate change,"" if we may borrow a phrase from the title of the report. But we've yet to see any of the alarmists point to the money that's been spent and the regulations that have been imposed, and say they are the reason Earth hasn't warmed in the last 16 to 17 years.In fact, they won't even admit that there hasn't been any warming, a point that should be recalled 10 years from now when they want to spend even more to ""stem climate change.""In the alarmists' world, the planet is constantly growing warmer due to man's modern activities and the money being spent to do something about it is never enough.But that's no surprise. For them to acknowledge anything else, such as reality, would be admitting defeat.

1374,ICE,"Environment: Polar bears are at risk, we've been told repeatedly, because man-made global warming is causing sea ice to disappear. But too much ice is also a problem, as some Alaskan polar bears might soon find out.Polar bears, those cute and cuddly poster creatures for the climate change alarmists — recall the fraud behind the famous photograph of that unfortunate polar bear floating on an ice floe? — need sea ice. They use it to hunt for meals and to breed. In short, polar bears spend much of their lives on sea ice.That life-giving bond, though, is allegedly in jeopardy. Since 2008, polar bears have been listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, a decision that was based — of course! — on the specious assumption that man-made global warming is reducing sea ice.Given that polar bears depend on sea ice, it would seem that more of it in a world without global warming would be better.But apparently not.An evolutionary biologist who has studied polar bears during her 35-year career says that thicker ice in the Southern Beaufort Sea along Alaska's Arctic coast is a threat to the big carnivores.The additional ice can force the seals that polar bears feed on to move elsewhere because it's too deep for them to burrow breathing holes through.""When those bears come out of their dens in the spring, they need to find seals right away because they will have gone six months without eating,"" biologist Susan J. Crockford told CNS News.""If there are no seals, they have to go further out, where there's thinner ice.""Similar thick sea ice in 2004 and 2006 thinned the polar bear population in those years and resulted in low bear counts, said Crockford. It turns out that this thick spring ice condition that's so in conflict with global warming was ""one of the pieces of evidence used to have the bears listed as 'threatened' in the U.S.""Truth has been the first casualty in the war to save the planet and the environmentalists' tale of polar bear woe has become a featured, though fallacious, argument.But the myth was drilled so deeply into Americans' minds that the actual facts — which the media simply refuse to cover — get little traction.Meanwhile, some observers are arguing that polar bear populations are thriving, not declining. That's debatable, but no more so than the entire global warming/climate change claim.

1376,ICE,"Environment: The joke in Washington is that climate change alarmists in the White House care more about ice than ISIS. But it's no joke.The world is aflame in violence and barbaric acts of terrorism, and Secretary of State John Kerry is running around warning one of the biggest problems facing the planet — ranking ""right up there"" with ""terrorism, epidemics, poverty (and) the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction"" — is global warming. Good thing almost no voters agree with him.Politico's latest poll shows just 2% of likely voters in competitive House and Senate races listed the ""environment"" as the issue that ""concerns you most."" Not surprisingly, top-ranked concerns among likely voters were ""the economy"" and ""jobs,"" combined at 25%, and ""national security"" and ""terrorism,"" at 19%.The survey was no outlier. Gallup found that just 1% of Americans rank energy and ""environment/pollution"" as the ""top problem,"" while CNN found all of 4% think ""energy and environmental policies"" are a big concern.The obvious message is that voters want to save their jobs and living standards more than they want to save the prairie chicken. They're less concerned about rising oceans than lengthening unemployment lines.To anyone not wearing Sierra Club green eye shades, the findings are hardly a shock. The economic growth rate in this recovery has been a piddling 2%, a far cry from the close to 4% average of other post-1960 upturns.We're $2 trillion in GDP behind where we were at this stage of the Reagan recovery, and Americans are feeling it smack in the pocketbook. Wages and salaries in real terms are barely keeping pace with inflation.Yet it seems from White House actions that the green issues that Americans rank lowest rank highest with President Obama. He tried to hoodwink the nation with the claim that his radical environmental agenda would create millions of green jobs — a win-win for nature and the economy. But those jobs never materialized.Now we're getting new EPA carbon emission standards that could decapitate our coal industry and halt the oil and gas revolution — the sector of the economy that leads the nation in hiring. Obama often insists that ""jobs are my No. 1 priority,"" but such crippling regulations expose this as a hollow political sound bite.Reasons for the economy's underperformance in the past six years are many. But one is a president fixated on schemes to ""fundamentally transform America"" and save the planet from eco-apocalypse. The green agenda Americans want is the one they can put in their wallets.

"
1437,ICE,"Employment: You might want to recork that bottle of champagne that you planned to open after another big jobs report. Reality has intervened, with jobs rising a disappointing 142,000 in August. The weakness is no fluke.Many economists and politicians treated the six-month string of 200,000-plus job gains as a major achievement. But in fact it was merely a slight pickup in the pace of what has been an unusually slow recovery in the U.S. since the recession ended in June 2009.The August jobs report is an example. Unemployment edged down to 6.1% from 6.2% — ""good"" news until you realize it fell only because more Americans stopped looking for jobs. A record 92.3 million adults are now ""out of the workforce.""Economists note that previous August job reports have tended to be revised upward — and that this report will be, too.Fair enough. And, as we've said before, one month does not a trend make. But when you have 62 months, which is how long it's been since the last recession ended, you can see some clear trends: For all recoveries since World War II, cumulative job growth has averaged 12.5% (see chart). This time, job growth is just 6.2%, the worst on record. Based on this, we would need 8.19 million more jobs just to reach ""average."" That's not a real job recovery at all. The labor force shrank 64,000 in the most recent month, pushing the participation rate to 62.8%. The last time it was that low, Jimmy Carter was president. A new report says 1-in-3 workers today is a ""freelance"" — that means 53 million workers without a regular job to go to. This is what qualifies as ""employment"" in the job-barren Age of Obamanomics. In August, the number of hours worked — a proxy for GDP growth — and average hourly wages both rose 2.1% from last year. That only barely beats the current inflation rate of 2%. Not much growth there. New data from the Fed show that only the top 10% of American earners have seen their incomes rise under Obama. The rest of us have taken a pay cut.The purpose of this exercise isn't to bash President Obama. But it's curious that someone whose policies have so clearly failed would double down on his mistakes, prolonging America's economic misery.Despite 0% interest rates, $7 trillion in added debt, more than $1.5 trillion in stimulus, and the Fed creating more than $4.5 trillion in new money out of thin air, our economy just stumbles along.Those hoping for a sudden burst of job-creating growth aren't likely to see it until there's a change in Washington. Until then, keep the champagne on ice.

"
1439,ICE,"Since nothing that goes wrong can ever be Barack Obama's fault, he has taken this year of inaction to blaming most everything on Congress in general and the Republican House specifically.He says a radical wing of the opposition party has hijacked the GOP and is causing gridlock in the nation's capital where he was once going to end the harsh partisan divide. Obama says House Republicans refuse to vote on the Senate's immigration bill.Speaker John Boehner notes that the House has sent more than 200 pieces of legislation to the Senate where it all gets blocked by an irascible old Nevada guy, who does not have a black accent.The Hill, the authoritative Capitol newspaper, published a recent study showing this Congress is one of the least productive in modern times. And, as usual, Capitol Hill has the low poll approval numbers to prove it.Not counting ceremonial junk, the 113th Congress has passed only 99 measures of real substance, compared to 144 bills, 105 of them significant, in the last session.Yes, Obama is in way over his head. He knows nothing of real leadership, pulling people together to decipher what they have in common and starting from there. He has no plan for anything, except his next set of speeches blaming Congress and a deli or ice cream stand visit where he can cut in line and do a photo-op.So, how did we get to this gridlocked democracy? And is it so bad really, given the lackluster results of what did get passed when the White House and Democrats controlled both chambers?Democrats seized control of both houses in 2006 in George W. Bush's second midterm elections. Historically, no president in modern times has seen his party gain seats in Congress then. After six years, voters are tired of the same guy in the Oval Office.No president, that is, except Bill Clinton in 1998, when Republicans in Congress over-played their hand with Monica and impeachment. Voters spanked them and Speaker Newt Gingrich was forced to resign.Obama's second midterm comes up Nov. 4. Right now, the

"
1444,ICE,"among other problems, Obama seems to be doing everything he can to hurt
"
1445,ICE,"his own
"
1446,ICE,"party.The one thing he's been diligent at is fundraising, even at unseemly times such as after a Fort Hood memorial service or before the bodies of four Americans killed in Benghazi were cold. For someone who professes to dislike fundraising, Obama has attended a record number, 393 since taking office; that's 55% more than Bush at the same point in his presidency.The Democrat blames Congress for not working with him.But he's given no evidence of working with Congress, as all presidents have done with that equal branch of government. As in any cooperative human interaction, this requires socializing, phoning, lobbying.Obama didn't sit down to talk with the GOP's Senate leader until 542 days into his presidency, 539 days longer than Bush took to have Senate Democrat leaders over for coffee and conversation.Indeed, Obama hasn't even informed Congress in timely fashion of many actions--launching the Libyan war, for instance, or trading five Taliban leaders for one American soldier. And the House is about to go to court charging the constitutional law lecturer with unconstitutionally altering legislation after congressional passage.Obama's imperial reaction: ""So, sue me!"" Not the kumbaya words of someone keen on teamwork.This attitude was foretold in the early months of Obama's presidency when Democrats controlled both houses. He needed no consensus then, With little presidential involvement, Obama got what became nearly one trillion dollars of stimulus spending that resulted in little economic stimulus.Most famously, this president rammed his immense ObamaCare legislation through Capitol Hill with not a single Republican vote. In the 2010 midterms, voters responded by electing a divided Congress, shaving the Democrat Senate majority and producing a House turnover to the GOP of historic proportions. Afterwards, Obama called it a ""shellacking.""It could have been punishment for partisan high-handedness or, more likely, a collective decision by voters in 435 House districts to divide legislative powers
"
1447,ICE,"as a cautious counter to Obama. Better to have nothing that an unpredictable new.When Bill Clinton lost both houses of Congress in 1994, he veered from the left toward the political center, earning himself resounding reelection two years later.Obama, of course, faces no future election. And his political personna seems unsuited for sudden conversion to cooperation. Even if Democrats manage to cling to tenuous Senate control this fall, the outlook at the moment is that voters are fine with a continuing stalemate for what is now the 919 days remaining in the Obama Era.

1451,ICE,"After years of overabundance, a brewing global shortfall in coffee could heat up prices as much as sevenfold over the next decade.That's according to Shawn Hackett, founder of Hackett Financial Advisors in Boynton Beach, Fla., who says technicals, fundamentals and money flows suggest coffee prices have formed a long-term bottom.Hackett believes a shortage of Robusta beans, primarily grown in Vietnam, is triggering a bull market in coffee just as Brazil's Arabica shortage in 2010 sparked a yearlong uptrend. A drought in Vietnam last winter led to smaller-than-normal sized beans, which reduced the yield per tree.Some 80% of crops have been harvested since the season began in late October, while London stockpiles have nearly evaporated.""This is a sign of huge Robusta deficits and that London certified stocks have been the only means to keep the market from running out,"" Hackett wrote in the Dec. 15 issue of The Hackett Money Flow Report.As a result, buyers are being forced to switch from Robusta to Arabica, but Brazil's low-quality Arabica is also in short supply. Brazilian farmers switched to growing Robusta over the past few years, while Roya leaf rust, a deadly fungus, destroyed much of Central America's output. IntercontinentalExchange Group's (ICE) stockpile of certified coffee has started falling. Meanwhile, coffee demand climbs to new records every year.Shortage Through Spring""When I run the numbers, we are looking at a sizable Arabica deficit between now and the spring of 2014,"" Hackett wrote.Trading reports show that commercial traders — the so-called smart-money investors— started buying coffee again in November near the multiyear low.Global coffee exports in October and November, the first two months of the 2013-14 growing year, fell 11% from the year-ago period, according to the International Coffee Organization.On the stock market, IPath DJ-UBS Coffee ETN (JO) dripped 33% lower in 2013 as Arabica coffee prices fell to their lowest level in nearly seven years. They'd already plunged 55% two years prior. JO has slumped about 75% from its May 2011 peak to a November 2013 trough amid record production in Vietnam and Brazil as farmers boosted planting acreage and grew higher-yielding plants. But the ETN has shot 14% off its all-time low to a three-month high this week.Silver, down 37%, and coffee, off 31%, plunged the hardest last year among the 22 commodities tracked in the DJ-UBS Commodity Index. The index fell 10% in 2013 with only eight components posting gains.""Commodities in general and gold specifically were pressured by a government shutdown, a strengthening economy, lower-than-expected inflation and concerns over the growth in the Chinese economy,"" S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a commodities report issued Monday.Commodities prices will likely fall further in the first quarter owing to slowdown in global industrial production growth, Credit Suisse wrote in a ""Commodities Forecast"" released Tuesday.Assets invested in commodity ETFs plunged 25% in 2013, according to Morningstar. Outflow totaled $29.5 billion in 2013, a sharp reversal after absorbing $10 billion in new money in 2012. Precious metals funds accounted for $28 billion of the total outflow.

1457,ICE,"It was February 1964, and Irvine Robbins was stumped.
"
1458,ICE,"A reporter from the Washington Post was on the phone asking how Robbins' firm, the Baskin-Robbins ice-cream chain, would celebrate the Beatles' arrival in a few days.
"
1459,ICE,"Problem was, Robbins had never heard of the Beatles.
"
1460,ICE,"But he thought fast and devised a new flavor: Beatle Nut.
"
1461,ICE,"It combined pistachio, chocolate and walnuts and was ready in days, according to a corporate history at BaskinRobbins.com.
"
1462,ICE,"From its humble beginnings as a handful of stores in Southern California to its current perch as a part of the global behemoth Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), Baskin-Robbins' hold on American culture has endured thanks to Robbins' vision and creativity.
"
1463,ICE,"He is remembered and revered by Dunkin' executives, including Bill Mitchell, currently the president of Baskin-Robbins U.S. and Canada. ""Irv created many of the company practices and values still in play today,"" Mitchell told IBD.
"
1464,ICE,"His special talent, Mitchell said, was coming up with imaginative ways to use pop culture and current events to sell ice cream. Beyond the Beatles, examples included Lunar Cheesecake for the first moon landing of 1969 and Baseball Nut, which celebrated the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles in 1958.
"
1465,ICE,"""He was famous for saying, and we quote him often, 'We don't just sell ice cream; we sell fun,'"" said Mitchell.
"
1466,ICE,"Canadian Start
"
1467,ICE,"Robbins (1917-2008) was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. When he was five, his father, a Russian immigrant named Aaron, moved the family to Tacoma, Wash., and opened an ice-cream shop, where Irv worked as a young man. He then attended the University of Washington and joined the Army during World War II, serving as a staff sergeant in California.
"
1468,ICE,"When he left the service, Robbins aimed to go into business for himself and replicate the fun atmosphere of his father's store.
"
1469,ICE,"So he opened a shop called Snowbird in Glendale, Calif.
"
1470,ICE,"Ice cream had been delighting people for centuries before Robbins made it his mission.
"
1471,ICE,"Laura Weiss' book ""Ice Cream: A Global History"" traces the dessert from a liquidlike sherbet created by Arabs in medieval times to the frozen sorbetto beloved by Italians in the 17th century.
"
1472,ICE,"American colonists were familiar with ice cream, and Thomas Jefferson had a particular taste for it.
"
1473,ICE,"In 1852, a Philadelphia woman named Nancy Johnson received a patent for a mechanical ice cream maker, and a decade later Baltimore native Jacob Fussell became the first to produce ice cream on a big scale, with factories scattered along the East Coast.
"
1474,ICE,"Americans continued to push the ice-cream envelope, coming up with cones, sundaes and frozen novelties, such as ice cream sandwiches.
"
1475,ICE,"But some things didn't change, Weiss wrote, despite the effort of Howard Johnson. The entrepreneur glumly told the New York Times that he'd developed ""scores of flavors, and yet most people still say, 'I'll take vanilla.'""
"
1476,ICE,"Robbins, who wanted to change that, offered 21 flavors at Snowbird. He then teamed up with Burt Baskin, who'd married Irv's sister Shirley. Baskin owned Burton's Ice Cream Shop in Pasadena.
"
1477,ICE,"By 1949, they had over 40 stores between them and four years later changed the company title to Baskin-Robbins. The name order was determined by a coin flip.
"
1478,ICE,"With the help of advertising agency Carson/Roberts, they devised an image full of color — brown and pink for chocolate and cherries — and polka dots that evoked the circus. A 31 was added to the logo to remind customers they could choose one unique flavor for every day of the month. The marketing of Baskin-Robbins ""connected ice cream with happiness. It reinforced the message that ice cream was all about pleasure and fun,"" said Weiss.
"
1479,ICE,"Baskin-Robbins tapped into several trends in American society, Weiss added: After World War II, customers had ""bottled-up demand"" for ice cream. During the war, ice cream had been reserved for troops. Once the shooting stopped, sales of the treat, along with cones and novelties, went ""through the roof.""
"
1480,ICE,"As the company grew, Robbins was one of the first to recognize how powerful a tool franchising could be, Mitchell said.
"
1481,ICE,"""Sure, they were focused on the fun, but they approached it with an attitude of 'The more ice cream we sell, the more money we make,' "" he said. ""That was the message to the franchisees.""
"
1482,ICE,"Baskin-Robbins wasn't the first restaurant chain to franchise. But the firm's success with the model inspired others, including Ray Kroc of McDonald's (MCD).
"
1483,ICE,"Robbins brought his own touch to the method by signing agreements with dairy providers such as Alpenrose Dairy in the Northwest and Klinke Bros. Ice Cream Co. in the South. The pacts governed such details as the delivery-truck temperatures and the thickness of the truck walls, which Robbins would personally inspect, Mitchell says.
"
1484,ICE,"On Top Of It
"
1485,ICE,"Robbins is lauded for his creativity with flavors, Mitchell notes, but his obsession with quality, especially for suppliers, was also paramount.
"
1486,ICE,"One such supplier, John Klinke, was a Tennessee dairyman in the 1960s when a friend told him about a cool company called Baskin-Robbins. It was Robbins' personality and drive that convinced Klinke, then a part of a buying group called Dixie's Dairy, to sign on.
"
1487,ICE,"Robbins grasped that the only way Baskin-Robbins could make it big was to bolster the franchises, Klinke told IBD. ""The main thing was to take care of every franchisee and see that they're profitable,"" he said.
"
1488,ICE,"The supplier Klinke Bros. and franchisees have stuck for decades with Baskin-Robbins, whose stores are 100% owned by their operators, says Mitchell.
"
1489,ICE,"Robbins believed that local franchises helped customers develop a personal connection to the stores, just as coming up with of-the-moment flavors connected the ice cream to what was going on in their lives. And franchisees' stake in the success of their stores flowed back to the corporation.
"
1490,ICE,"Many of them were motivated by work ethic at the top, said Mitchell. Robbins was an example of ""that interesting breed of having a passion for what you do, and you don't look at the watch to get it done.""
"
1491,ICE,"Applause
"
1492,ICE,"Entrepreneur magazine has frequently put Baskin-Robbins on its list of the top franchises in America.
"
1493,ICE,"Robbins exhibited another trait that kept franchisees loyal: integrity. Said Klinke: ""He was just so honest, and he was just a really good man. He was happy doing what he was doing, making people happy. I'm proud to have known him.""
"
1494,ICE,"In a 1976 profile in People magazine, Robbins downplayed his feats: ""If I've done anything to be successful, it's that I had the ability to listen to the right people.""
"
1495,ICE,"By 1967, when Robbins and Baskin decided to sell the chain to United Fruit for $12 million, they had 500 stores. Being part of a global corporation let Baskin-Robbins go international, and in 1970 stores opened in Japan, Saudi Arabia, Korea and Australia.
"
1496,ICE,"Today, Baskin-Robbins has more than 6,700 locations around the world, according to the corporate website.
"
1497,ICE,"Burt Baskin died just months after the partners sold the chain. Robbins remained an active part of Baskin-Robbins for many years. He was chairman of the board in the 1970s and continued to help develop and test flavors.
"
1498,ICE,"Some duds came along the way, but that'll happen when you develop 1,200 flavors, notes Mitchell.
"
1499,ICE,"In 1979, Robbins told the San Francisco Chronicle that people chased after him, even when he was driving, to pitch flavor ideas. His license plate read ""31 BR.""
"
1500,ICE,"Robbins, who was married with three children, died at age 90.
"
1501,ICE,"Another of Baskin-Robbins' accomplishments was paving the way for other iconic ice cream brands, like Ben & Jerry's, says Weiss. Robbins and Baskin were savvy businessmen in the thick of a postwar full of Americans with extra discretionary money, leisure time and booming baby births.

1505,ICE,"Immigration: A federal employment ad posted in January showing that 65,000 unaccompanied minors will enter the U.S. illegally shows that the administration expected this cross-border child abuse and encouraged it.Concrete evidence has shown up proving our earlier assertion: The breach of our border by waves of unaccompanied alien children was orchestrated by the administration based on a strategy straight out of the playbook President Obama studied as a community organizer. His goal is to get his way on immigration reform by overwhelming the U.S. Border Patrol and collapsing an already weakened system.The evidence comes in the form a government contract solicited in January by the Department of Homeland Security. The listing asked for ""Escort Services for Unaccompanied Alien Children"" in expectation of the arrival of 65,000 minors on our southern border without their parents or guardians.The operative language in the listing is the statement by DHS/Immigration and Customs Enforcement that they expect there ""will be approximately 65,000"" alien minors requiring assistance. This is a significant increase from the 5,000 minors who are detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement annually. It also strongly suggests not only advance knowledge of the human catastrophe about to unfold but a lack of any effort to stop it.Not only have the numbers vastly increased, but the points of origin have changed. No longer are we talking about just poor Mexican families seeking a better life from an ""act of love,"" as one possible 2016 presidential candidate put it. Hondurans, Salvadorans and Guatemalans now make up about 75% of illegals caught in South Texas.The number of children traveling without parents has overwhelmed Border Patrol detention centers along the Texas border, prompting officials to ship them to converted warehouses and military bases as far away as California. The situation is so bad that there is fear we would have no place to put American citizen refugees if another Hurricane Katrina occurs. Some have even called this alien-children invasion Obama's Katrina.This is no act of love, as children are transported by cartels and other human traffickers from Central America and then through 1,800 miles of difficult Mexican roads. They are subjected to the worst abuse along the way, then dumped across the border, where they huddle on warehouse floors in conditions ideal for the spread of infectious diseases.Such a journey is made on the expectation that these children will not be turned away. At a House Homeland Security Committee hearing this week, committee Republicans noted three causes for this influx: Obama executive actions such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program; lax enforcement policies; and talk on both sides of the aisle of comprehensive immigration reform indistinguishable from amnesty.As committee Chairman Rep. Michael McCaul noted in his opening statement:""Newspapers in El Salvador and Honduras seem to be encouraging youth to head to the United States based on these policies. And recent internal DHS surveys of these children reveal that more than 70% believe they are going to stay in the country.""This is a human tragedy of the administration's making. ICE union boss Chris Crane testified last year at a House Judiciary Committee hearing, lodging complaints about the lawlessness behind the ""nation's broken immigration system.""""ICE has essentially prohibited its agents from enforcing"" immigration law, Crane said. ""What message do ICE practices send to the world? The message is: 'We don't enforce our laws, come on over, and if you do get caught, just lie to us. Lie about the day and year you entered, lie about going to high school, you won't be required to prove anything.'""This is a humanitarian disaster as well a political outrage, and the Obama White House wanted it to happen.

The company's gross-profit margin rose to 52% compared with 51.8% in the year-earlier quarter.A tough winter season contributed to higher industrywide sales of replacement parts, and AutoZone is not alone in its growth. Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) also had quarterly earnings that beat projections. Advance Auto Parts' EPS jumped 36.4% and O'Reilly's rose 18.4% in their latest reports.AutoZone's same-store sales climbed 4% in the quarter. It opened 30 new stores in the U.S. and seven new stores in Mexico, bringing its tally to 5,279 stores total.""I would say that our sales performed a little bit better in the third quarter than our expectations, particularly when the winter subsided and the taxes refunds were flowing, we had some tremendous weeks in that period of time,"" said CEO Bill Rhodes in a post-earnings conference call with analysts. ""It rebounded quicker, and we've been encouraged by the deferrable maintenance categories and how they've continued to perform within the quarter.""As detailed in an IBD Industry Snapshot, the demand for replacement batteries, starters and alternators rises seasonally as snow and ice affect driving conditions. While sales of new cars are rising slowly, consumers are reluctant to sell, with the average age of light vehicles at 11.4 years, according to research firm Polk.JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers said in a research note that ""today's AZO report reinforces the view that the category remains strong as the lag effect of the winter on pent-up maintenance drives demand.""While shares rose initially in the morning, AutoZone dropped 2% in the stock market today.Advance Auto Parts and O'Reilly each fell about 1%.

"
1520,ICE,"""We're stuck in our own experiment,"" the Australasian Antarctic Expedition said in a statement. ""We came to Antarctica to study how one of the biggest icebergs in the world has altered the system by trapping ice. We ... are now ourselves trapped by ice surrounding our ship.""

1536,ICE,"These explorers are not only trapped in Antarctic sea ice, but in a climate myth of their own making. Al Gore, call your office.Cold Climate: In an event chock-full of bitterly cold irony, perhaps even Al Gore has noticed that multiple icebreakers couldn't free a boat stuck in Antarctic ice that global warming was supposed to have melted.Few of the media reports on the plight of the Russian-flagged research vessel MV Akademik Schokalskiy have noted the irony of a ship full of climate scientists getting stuck in an Antarctic ice sheet so thick that early attempts at breaking through the ice to free them were failures.""We're stuck in our own experiment,"" the Australasian Antarctic Expedition said in a statement. ""We came to Antarctica to study how one of the biggest icebergs in the world has altered the system by trapping ice. We ... are now ourselves trapped by ice surrounding our ship.""In a statement only climate-change die-hards could make, the group said, ""Sea ice is disappearing due to climate change, but here ice is building up.""A Chinese icebreaker was unable to reach the ship, and another vessel, the Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis, got within 10 nautical miles of the stranded ship but couldn't see it through a driving blizzard and had to turn back to open water, Fox News reported.A makeshift helicopter pad on the ice sheet was being readied for a helicopter rescue.""A decision has been reached to evacuate 52 passengers and four crew members by helicopter from China's Xue Long ship, should the weather allow,"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement which did not note whether it was solar-powered or not.Expedition leader Chris Turney, a professor of climate change at Australia's University of New South Wales, dismissed the irony of their situation, claiming the ice they were trapped in was old ice likely formed from an iceberg that broke away years ago, and proves nothing.But Titanic-like icebergs have been forming since long before the Industrial Revolution, and in our view an inconvenient truth is that ice is ice.The 2004 science fiction movie ""The Day After Tomorrow"" — and the operative word here is ""fiction"" — opened with a portion of the West Antarctic ice sheet shearing off as a prelude to planetary doom.But as we recently noted, while the global-warming alarmists obsess about ice sheets breaking off, Antarctic sea ice has grown to a record-large extent for a second straight year.A review of the Icesat satellite data from 1992 to 2008 showed a net gain in ice mass in Antarctica — not a decline.In 2013, the ice reached 19.51 million square kilometers, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center website.That number topped the record-high level set in 2012 of 19.48 million square kilometers. The Australasian Antarctic Expedition has now found itself trapped in some of that ice as its leaders try to explain away the ice's presence.Dr. Don J.

1585,ICE,"Leroy Grumman was an unlikely player in a game dominated by barnstormers and daredevils, the jaunty young men with pencil mustaches who built America's aviation industry right after World War I.Stoop-shouldered and soft-spoken, Grumman was as shy as he was inseparable from the briar pipe he seemed to hide behind.His experience as a military pilot had left no apparent mark. ""He was very, very reticent,"" his flight instructor said. ""Most of the guys became tougher than hell after they learned to fly. Grumman didn't.""No matter. Grumman had partners who mastered swagger. He focused on designing aircraft so reliable that many models flew largely unchanged through their life span, winning his Long Island plant the nickname Grumman Iron Works.As Vice Adm. John McCain Sr. put it during World War II: ""The name Grumman on a plane is like sterling on silver.""BoomOver four decades, Grumman would build his firm from 16 employees into one of the nation's largest defense contractors, with divisions that manufactured prop planes, jet aircraft, rockets, even canoes and delivery trucks.On July 21, 1969, the world watched tensely as his aeronautic magnum opus delivered Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the moon.Northrop Grumman (NOC) is still on the rise, with $24.4 billion in sales last year and a stock that has taken flight by 290% since 2009.Leroy Randle Grumman (1895-1982) was born in Huntington, N.Y., the son of a carriage-shop owner. Roy, as he preferred to be called, had a clear interest in the infant aviation industry by the time he finished high school, telling classmates, ""the final perfection of the airplane"" would be one of man's greatest triumphs.Grumman graduated with an engineering degree from Cornell University in 1916 and applied to the U.S. Navy flight program just as America entered World War I.He served as a flight instructor and test pilot, and, at war's end in 1918, took a job at aviation pioneer Grover Loening's New York City factory.Grumman became fast friends with another Loening employee, Jake Swirbul, an organizational whiz with whom he shared a work ethic and love of flight.When the Loening operation announced a move to Pennsylvania in 1929, the pals took off on their own. Grumman Aeronautical Engineering opened in a former car dealership in the Long Island hamlet of Baldwin on Jan. 2, 1930, with Grumman as chairman and president.Initially, the firm specialized in repairing Loening aircraft, but Grumman soon used his military contacts to land work building pontoons for Navy planes and then a contract for a bi-winged fighter, the first with retractable landing gear.Still, times were tough. The company ran out of cash one week and sent workers home without pay.Scraping ByEarly on, the firm could afford test-flight insurance only by the hour, and company lore suggests employees were encouraged to lug in scrap metal from the roadside.While other companies invested in sophisticated inventory systems, Grumman piled parts into spent oil drums, each marked with a red line a few inches from the bottom. ""When it gets to here,"" a sign advised workers, ""call Joe.""But it was just the kind of company Grumman wanted: small, paternalistic and, if all went well, profitable. In that order.Despite its founder's misgivings, the firm grew steadily, moving to larger quarters in 1931, then again the next year and once more in 1937. Grumman still insisted that the firm should be kept lean and nimble, with no more than 250 workers. An accountant was finally dispatched to tell the boss that the staff had reached 256.Even so, Grumman ruled in a folksy, feet-on-the-desk, door-always-open style, although Swirbul did most of what he called the ""mollycoddling"" of employees.As a result, workers referred to Swirbul as Jake, but Grumman was always Mr. Grumman.Production soared in 1939 as France and England placed orders for Grumman's F-4F Wildcat, a stubby, teardrop-shaped fighter that could reach 330 mph.By 1943, with America in the WWII fight, the Grumman workforce had ballooned from a prewar 700 to more than 25,000, and the company was the primary supplier of aircraft to the Allies.Giving 'Em HellThe firm's next fighter model, the faster F-6 Hellcat, would rule the skies in the Pacific theater, where it was credited with destroying two-thirds of all Japanese planes.The plane's speed and maneuverability were part of the success story, but sheer quantity played an important role as well. At peak production, the company was cranking out over 600 aircraft a month, and Grumman's unique folding wing design, which he'd worked out using an eraser and two paper clips, let U.S. aircraft carriers double the number of planes on board.With Grumman stationed at the drafting table, Swirbul took over the morale effort, organizing activities for workers such as ice-cream socials, band performances and pingpong tournaments. At one point, the firm had over 40 softball teams, with Grumman and other executives playing alongside the most junior riveters.""Grumman was like Michelangelo, and Swirbul was the guy who cut the marble for him,"" one executive said. ""Jake knew how to give the schmaltz to the people.""Sales jumped from $4 million in 1940 to $400 million in 1943, with a percentage going to workers as bonuses. As a result, the company's labor turnover was half that of other wartime manufacturers, and its profit more than double.As World War II ended in 1945, Grumman faced one of his greatest engineering challenges — reducing the staff by 20,000, of which only 126 had expressed any interest in leaving. His solution: Fire everyone, then rehire 5,000 of the most talented and longest tenured. The company pulled it off in 10 days.Grumman stepped down as president in 1946 after losing much of his eyesight from an allergic reaction to a penicillin shot. But he continued on as chairman for 20 more years, pushing the firm into civilian products that included aluminum canoes, delivery vans and Gulfstream prop planes and jets.Government work remained the firm's mainstay, with Grumman winning contracts to produce Navy jets and reconnaissance planes, Postal Service vans and, in 1962, NASA's lunar excursion module.""None of the industry founders got in it for the military business, but none ever turned away from weaponry,"" Wayne Biddle , a Johns Hopkins professor and author of ""Barons of the Sky,"" told IBD. ""They all cherished a necessarily primitive dream of civilian aviation — an airplane in every garage — that turned out to be technically and economically infeasible. So the government became their most reliable customer, with commercial aviation a perennial roller coaster.""Swirbul died from colon cancer in 1960, and Grumman went it alone for an additional six years before relinquishing the chairman's seat, although he remained a director until 1972. The Grumman workforce at that point had swelled to 35,000, surpassing World War II levels and making the company easily Long Island's largest employer.""Everyone talks about Grumman being a big family, and it was,"" said Mike Lisa, a 37-year company veteran. ""There were the top executives, of course, but from the vice presidents down, it was like everyone was an equal on the same playing field. That changed after Leroy retired and passed, but in those days it was a fantastic place to work. Just a great, great place.""Grumman split his retirement between Florida and New York with his wife, Rose, whom he'd married in 1921. They had four children. Grumman's eyesight continued to fail, however, and by 1980, he was blind.Two years later, after what was described as a long illness, he died at age 87.Grumman missed having to witness the decline of the firm he founded, which struggled amid Pentagon cutbacks after the Cold War and sold out to Northrop in 1994, a merger that many defense experts believed should have yielded a Grumman Northrop.It was the confirmation of Grumman's greatest fear, according to his widow. Roy's company, Rose Grumman said, had simply ""got too big.""Said Biddle: ""The lucrative products that epitomized the industry after Leroy Grumman left it would have disgusted him, I think.

1661,ICE,"Lawlessness: The federal government let nearly 68,000 illegal aliens with criminal records go free in 2013. When it's law and order vs. future votes for Democrats, we all know which wins under this administration.A new study from Washington's Center For Immigration Studies (CIS) found that the Obama administration in 2013 released 67,879 illegal aliens who had been convicted of a criminal offense — 35% of the total number of the aliens with criminal convictions encountered by law enforcement.The vast majority, the CIS report said, were due to ""the Obama administration's prosecutorial discretion policies, not because the aliens were not deportable.""So much for President Obama's claim last June that ""today, deportation of criminals is at its highest level ever"" because ""we focused our enforcement efforts on criminals who are here illegally and who are endangering our communities.""Illegal alien advocacy groups even lambast Obama as ""deporter in chief."" But as The Blaze's Washington correspondent, Fred Lucas, reported last month, the administration's claims are purposely misleading, based on ""the strictest legal definition of deportation.""Moreover, ""the administration in 2009 changed the metric for measuring even that legal definition.""Homeland Security plays a statistical shell game of ""removals"" vs. ""returns,"" said Jessica Vaughn, author of the Center's study. If you actually ""count the number of people sent out of the country, it's not even close to a record. It's the lowest since the 1970s.""How low? There were 229,968 returns in 2012 vs. 1.6 million returns in 2000, the last full year of the Clinton administration. Homeland Security defines a ""return"" — which is how deportations were previously measured — as ""the confirmed movement of an inadmissible or deportable alien out of the United States not based on an order of removal.""The administration itself even admits this, if you look hard enough. ""In 2012, 229,968 aliens were returned to their home countries without an order of removal, a decline of 29% from 2011 and the lowest number since 1969,"" Homeland Security's Office of Immigration Statistics says in a statement buried deep in its report on enforcement actions for 2012.When your policy is intentionally hostile toward deportation, naturally you're not going to be fussy about deporting criminals. So it shouldn't be surprising that the CIS found that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ""charged only 195,000, or 25%, out of 722,000 potentially deportable aliens they encountered,"" most of whom came to the federal agency's attention after a local arrest and incarceration.It is also no surprise that ICE reports there are over 870,000 aliens who have been ordered removed, but who remain within the country in defiance of our laws.How can our government let so many criminals go instead of deporting them, as the law demands?""Eleven million people living in the shadows, I believe, are already American citizens,"" Vice President Joseph Biden told the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.And the repeat crimes so many of these illegals with criminal records will commit against Americans is a perfectly acceptable price to pay, apparently, to win millions of new Democratic votes Obama's aggressive, lawless open-door immigration policies in the years ahead.So the next time you read about an illegal alien committing a violent crime, remember: The victim of that crime is a martyr for a future socialistic America.

1723,ICE,"Junk Science: The climate change lobby wants us all to know that this winter's ongoing record cold streak and snowstorms in the Midwest and Northeast in no way refute what Barack Obama now calls the scientific ""fact"" of global warming.The greens have even had a field day lampooning Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, who recently merely suggested the cold spell ""has to make everyone question ... whether global warming was ever real."" The Washington Post pounced on that statement and protested that the ""global warming deniers"" are ""cherry-picking the data"" to refute the heating of the planet.Of course, global warming alarmists would never cherry-pick data to make their point, would they?We ask because we keep hearing news reports of how the terrible drought in California is another flashing alarm of a warming planet. The drought is ""why it's important for us to take climate change seriously,"" U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack sermonizes.So let's get this logic straight: The cold spell doesn't refute global warming, but the drought confirms it. Hmmm.The left is guilty of such logical gyrations all the time. A year and a half ago, when Superstorm Sandy wreaked its devastation on coastal Northeastern states, the link between that killer storm and global climate change was said to be nearly unassailable.No less a climate expert than New York Gov. Mario Cuomo remarked that ""anyone who says there's not a dramatic change in weather patterns I think is denying reality."" What does he think about the weather now?The day after Sandy's nearly $100 billion damage to homes, stores and infrastructure, Rep. Henry Waxman of California lashed out at his Republican House colleagues who have ""pretended that climate change is not happening"" and that ""the consequences can be dismissed without concern.""Environmental groups started peddling the idea that from now on we should name hurricanes and superstorms after prominent global warming ""deniers"" — Hurricane Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry and so on.Except hurricanes have been on the decline for the last several years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Not one hit the coastal U.S. in 2009, 2010 or 2013. Tornadoes are also no more severe than usual. New research suggests that the polar ice caps may be growing, not shrinking, after several years of melting — good news for polar bears.What does all this prove about global climate change? Not much. One week or one month or even 50 years of weather patterns are the blink of an eye in terms of the Earth's temperature.Perhaps one reason global-warming skeptics are growing in number is precisely because the left engages in such flimsy science based on short-term trends to prove the apocalypse is irrefutable and imminent. Instead of engaging in scientific debate and countering the hefty contrary evidence, they speak with the unwarranted and absolute certainty of zealots.What we do know is that the Earth's climate is changing — as it has for millions of years. And let's show some humility: We don't really know how much it is changing or why. And it's a pretty good bet that governments that can't balance their budgets, can't deliver the mail without losing money and run failing schools are the last place to look for solutions.For now we'll simply advise Americans up north and in the Midwest to bundle up, stay out of the cold and hope for a warming trend.

""If you want to keep your creative reflexes sharp, you've got to work them out regularly,"" Charlie Tercek, executive creative director at communications firm GolinHarris, told IBD.""Play the guitar. Draw cartoons. Write poetry. I do all three every day — poorly, but avidly.""• Break that ice. Meetings can drag. Tercek livens things up with activities that hatchet dullness: ""I'll pair people off and have them draw each other's portraits in 30 seconds, or have everyone create a short story together. These exercises are goofy, but they loosen everyone up and help us approach our work a little more creatively.""• Mingle the mind. ""I made a personal commitment to speak to at least two new individuals per day and ask each of them at least two questions not related directly to my line of business,"" said Eugene Borukhovich, chief questioning officer of Q!, a new social search application.• Scan. To shake loose a few new approaches, try mentally fast-forwarding the world around you.Think: Where will my customers be in six months? A year? How will I greet them?Adele Cehrs, CEO of corporate communications firm Epic Public Relations, takes this tactic to social media engagement. She urges executives to think like news hounds.Example: If you're a sporting goods manufacturer, the Winter Olympics make this a good time to reach out to the public. When executives anticipate such seasons, they soar.""Instead of yelling into their own noise, marketers should focus on when their target client is thinking about them, not when their marketing department is scheduled to make an announcement, launch a new product or say something witty,"" Cehrs said.• Drift. Try this mind-wandering method from Robert Epstein, senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research:""The Taking The Lid Off technique is one of several I use to help people generate daydreams on demand,"" he said. ""With eyes closed, one simply looks around at the color patterns on the inside of one's eyelids and then zooms in on portions of the pattern that make sense — in other words, that look like something real. This is an easy way to kick off a daydream.""• Rethink it. Here's another trick Epstein uses to dent mental boxes: ""In Word Whirring, one starts with an already-written paragraph about the topic of professional interest, then chops up and randomizes the words.""You can sit down with paper and scissors and create a word whir. Or you can take the effort online with Word It Out, a site that does it for you electronically.Ready for a free aha? Fodder for brainstorming? Plug in your firm's mission statement or problem and see what happens.• Odd couples? Blend outside interests with your day-to-day concerns. Example: Business coach Vik Rubenfeld likes fantasy stories, so he'll often tap them to rev up his inspiration.Here's a Rubenfeld example, drawing on ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"": ""Just as Frodo has the goal of saving the world from Sauron, and Luke Skywalker has the goal of saving Princess Leia, you can add excitement and inspiration to your life by picking a goal that is hard to achieve. Not the simple, not the obvious, but the challenge that excites you.""

1795,ICE,"Olympians overcome seemingly insuperable obstacles on their way to the Games. Their dogged pursuit:• Be a persuader. Lindsey Van's sport — women's ski jumping — has never been in the Olympics. That didn't stop the perennial national champion from trying to sway the International Olympic Committee, which resisted due to the sport's small number of competitors. Her approach: She simply wouldn't go away.So says William Kerig, whose 2012 documentary ""Ready to Fly"" details Van's push to win an Olympic slot for women's ski jumping. ""Most of the time Lindsey felt like: 'I'm not going to win this, but I have to fight,'"" he told IBD. ""I just got completely hooked on her strength of character.""Van led her ski-jumping cohorts in petitioning the IOC constantly before prevailing for the Games in Sochi, Russia, that run to Feb. 23.• Pay your way. Lindsey Van is sometimes confused with downhill skiing champ Lindsey Vonn, whose knee injury blew her 2014 Olympic hopes. ""Lindsey Van is also a world champion, and they are both at the pinnacle of their sports,"" Kerig said.A key difference?Vonn has made an estimated $3 million in endorsement deals.""Until very recently, Lindsey Van was working part time in Park City (Utah) as a physical therapy assistant for $10 an hour,"" Kerig said.She took up the financial challenge most Olympic hopefuls face — coming up with cash to cover training expenses.• Innovate: While individual sports' governing bodies pay some facility and coaching fees, travel can run $85,000 to $250,000 a year. For that, ""the athletes are on the hook,"" Kerig said. ""It's a full-time job that pays you nothing toward rent, gas in your car or food on your table.""To help Van and others like her, Kerig launched the crowdfunding site RallyMe.com in November 2012 specifically for athletes.It's helped more than 400 competitors and teams, including 38 Olympians, and has tallied more than $1 million in donations.• Excite: Fans get a buzz watching a competitor they've supported with a contribution.It goes both ways.""A lot of athletes feel a renewed conviction because there are these people behind them,"" Kerig said.• Get up. Kelly Gunther, a speed skater on the RallyMe.com site, is defying the odds to compete in the 1,000-meter event in Sochi.Four years ago, she faced the possibility of amputation after an accident during a 500-meter race left her foot dangling from a broken ankle. The self-described rink rat calmed herself in the moment by reminding herself that someone, somewhere was worse off — and resolving to fight her way back.Years of surgery, rehabilitation and grit will culminate Feb. 13 when Gunther competes for the gold. ""It taught me to never give up, and that's why I'm back on the ice,"" she said.• Build a dream. Tucker West's dad, Brett, went bigger than the backyard treehouse. After watching the 2002 Winter Olympics with his son — and marveling at the luge event — Brett constructed a sledding track on steroids.The 32-foot-high, 750-foot-long wooden contraption became the youngster's obsession. The proud pop timed Tucker's runs and installed a PA system so he could carry on competition-style commentary.When a friend beat Tucker's best time, the future Olympian kept sliding until he'd gone faster.Now 18, Tucker West will compete in Sochi as the youngest member of the U.S. luge team.

1805,ICE,"The worst sound at work? Silence. How to keep corporate wheels turning:• See the unexpected. What if a nuclear submarine severs the offshore cable delivering phone and Internet access to your firm? That happened to residents of San Juan Island, off the coast of Washington state, last November. Some locals called on business continuity specialist Agility Recovery, which swooped in with satellite dishes and routers to restore service. ""That's the kind of stuff we respond to on a daily basis,"" CEO Bob Boyd told IBD.• Anticipate. Agility Recovery specializes in saving the day when any of its 20,000-plus clients face calamity. During 2012's Hurricane Sandy in the Northeast, Boyd's team trucked in diesel fuel to generator-dependent firms. ""In 60% of recoveries, power is an issue,"" he said. The pre-emptive approach: Hire an electrician to determine generator needs before the storm, and have a plan in place.To avoid the reactive scramble — figuring out those logistics after the damage is done — Boyd recommends PrepareMyBusiness.org.• Look down the line. The mid-February ice storm that slickened Charlotte, N.C., sent its airport into a tailspin. A supplier ran out of de-icing fluid. ""For 24 hours, no planes left the airport,"" Boyd said. ""That would have been so easy to prevent."" Savvy firms ask vendors about their disaster plans. If one seems ill-equipped, ""then you go find a backup to them.""• Find high ground. Preparedness is a competitive plus. Instead of being caught short, make sure ""you are the retailer with product on hand,"" said Shivan Subramaniam, CEO of insurance giant FM Global. ""Supply chain today has become significantly more important.""• Get ready. FM Global encourages its clients to make disaster mitigation a priority. ""Insurance should be the last step in your risk process,"" Subramaniam said.Taking steps to prevent loss should be the first. In the case of a catastrophic event, ""there's absolutely no way an insurance policy is going to make you whole,"" he said.• Drill. Practice for disasters. ""Testing on a regular basis is absolutely mandatory,"" Subramaniam said. ""People need to react without thinking too much.""• Beware surges. The perfect digital storm? A rush of customers crashes a business website or app.Yet three of four apps are never tested for big upticks in traffic, according to Tom Lounibos, CEO of Soasta. His team developed a load-testing platform using cloud technology. ""We take a six-week process and do it in minutes. So there's no real excuse for running out of time,"" he said.Clients include NASA, TurboTax and the International Olympic Committee. One bootstrapping entrepreneur tapped Soasta before appearing on the TV show ""Shark Tank"" to ensure his website could handle a flood of visits spurred by the appearance.""He was smart enough to get in front of that,"" Lounibos said.• Spark a solution. A 30-year software entrepreneur, Lounibos experienced the load-testing issue firsthand after building a loan origination application for his previous firm, Dorado Corp. A banking client asked him what would happen if a mortgage rate drop drove scads of traffic to its website. ""I had to answer: 'I don't know,' "" he said. ""It's a much better business decision to have facts versus guessing.""• Stay steps ahead. Retailers know this: Consumers are just one annoying delay away from clicking over to someone else's site to buy a product. ""Performance matters more today than it ever did in the past,"" Lounibos said. ""If your site is slow, you lose revenue or you lose brand.""

1848,ICE,"Want to get outside the box? Give your time. That's what attorney Rebecca Fayed did. As associate general counsel and privacy officer at Advisory Board (ABCO), a Washington, D.C.-based consultancy, Fayed eyes regulations shaken up by breakthrough thinking.Fayed sharpened her planning smarts while doing pro bono work at Wonders Child Care, a nonprofit day care serving D.C. and Maryland. She crunched a corporate vision statement for Wonders. She studied the kiddie care competition. She floated ideas for new offerings. Then she joined the tots as they played with water.""I am always thinking with a lawyer's eyes,"" Fayed told IBD. ""But volunteering gives you an opportunity to do something different, using a different thought process.""Think about how you can leverage good works at your firm.• Get smart. Working for free on nonprofit boards increases brainpower. It's a great way for professionals to test out their skills.""Corporate volunteer programs are giving companies the competitive advantage,"" said Jackie Norris, executive director of Points of Light , a volunteer advisory firm.• See it again. Empathy is a powerful innovation engine. Bonus: It isn't tough to boost it. Spending time at different establishments can change how you view the world. That builds better ideas.Norris tells about designers who volunteered at a disability association, then returned to work and cranked out a revolutionary refrigerator. ""Their whole design was different,"" she said. ""They asked questions like, 'If you are in a wheelchair, can you access the ice maker?'""• Commit. Make volunteer work a key part of your company's long-term strategy. At Fayed's Advisory Board, staffers are offered 10 hours of paid time off each month to serve at area nonprofit outfits.Of those 2,500 workers, many view the program as an employee benefit. The business gets a great boon from it, too. Turnover has dropped since its emphasis on volunteer service. And workers who do outside pro-bono projects are likelier than their peers to land promotions. ""We are a high-growth, dynamic, changing company,"" CEO Robert Musslewhite said. ""This is part of that dynamism.""• Top down. Service programs pack more punch than vague innovation initiatives that remind workers to carve out time to pursue their own creative aims, contends Musslewhite.It was largely his idea for the firm to go for 100% participation in its volunteer program.""This is one of our priorities,"" he said. ""There is real good that comes back to the business from doing this, as well as real good for the community.""• Worthy cause? Charities are often looking for help, but not all of them are prepared to take on an army of professionals.A brand-new foundation with a staff of three might crash if a corporate marketing team showed up.""The buzzword around the service sector is nonprofit readiness,"" Norris explained. ""Managing pro bono and managing volunteers is difficult for nonprofits. They don't always have the bandwidth.""To find a good firm, ask nonprofit experts to play matchmaker.• Care. Find a charity that aligns with your company's interests, Fayed advised: ""The more passionate you feel about what you are doing, the likelier you are to be engaged and to have a different impact on the organization.""• More than a check. Nonprofits hunger for help from money-wise executives. ""Don't just give your grant,"" Norris said. ""Give your board members. Give your support.""

1852,ICE,"President Obama's weekly remarksHi, everybody. This week, I traveled to New England, where I was joined by four governors who are working to raise the minimum wage in each of their states. And they’ve also joined me in calling on Congress to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour. Because it would give nearly 800,000 Americans in their states a raise — and lift wages for about 28 million across the country.So these governors aren’t waiting for Congress to make up its mind.And in my State of the Union Address, I asked America’s business leaders to go ahead and do what they could to raise their employees’ wages, too. And increasingly, it’s not just large companies like Costco or the Gap that choose to pay their employees higher starting wages. It’s smaller businesses like Jaxson’s, a family-owned ice cream parlor in South Florida. They answered the call and raised their wages so that more than 70 employees would earn at least $10.10 an hour, without cutting back on hiring.And two weeks ago, an Atlanta small business owner named Darien Southerland [SUTH-er-lind] wrote me to share a lesson his grandmother taught him — that if you treat your employees right, they’ll treat you right. And Vice President Biden paid him a visit this week.I agree with these business owners, which is why I issued an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay their employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. It’s good for our bottom line. And working Americans have struggled through stagnant wages for far too long.A clear majority of Americans support raising the minimum wage, because we believe that nobody who works full-time should have to live in poverty. About half of all Republicans support raising the minimum wage, too. It’s just too bad they don’t serve in Congress. Because the Republicans who do serve in Congress don’t want to vote on the minimum wage at all. Some even want to get rid of it completely. Seriously.That’s why what business leaders and everyday Americans are doing to raise wages is so important. Because change doesn’t come from Washington — change comes to Washington. I’ve always believed that, and it’s true in this case, too.Outside Washington, Americans are ready to put aside old political arguments and move this country forward. The American people are way ahead of Congress on this issue, and we’ve just got to let Congress know that. It’s time for “ten-ten.” It’s time to give America a raise. And it’s time to restore opportunity for all. Thanks, and have a great weekend. ####

The glut is helping to cut costs for Starbucks and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.Arabica coffee for March delivery fell 3.5% to settle at $1.107 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, the biggest drop for a most-active contract since Nov. 22. This year, the price tumbled 23%, the third straight annual decline. The commodity plunged 54% since the end of 2010.Global production, including the robusta variety that accounts for about 42% of supply, will exceed demand by 6.04 million bags in the 2013-14 season, compared with a surplus of 11.06 million a year earlier, the USDA said this month.Inventories will reach 36.33 million bags, the highest since the 2008-09 season.

1912,ICE,"President Obama, who's been on vacation since earlier last year, is finally back in the White House today, as is Joe Biden, who's also been idling on a warm island.Michelle Obama opted to fly home separately this year, taking extra sunny days in Hawaii with friends celebrating her 50th birthday on Jan. 17.Not that the president cares, but he confronts a chilly public this month, matching the frigid winter conditions gripping much of the country. Faced with a stubbornly sluggish job market and soaring costs for ObamaCare's health insurance, including fully 18 new taxes, mandates and penalties, a whopping majority of Americans sees their country going down the wrong track.Last year at this point 36% of likely voters felt the United States was headed in the right direction under Obama's ""leadership."" Having just reelected Obama with millions fewer votes than 2008, 57% of Americans said the nation was headed in the wrong direction.Now, according to a new Rasmussen Reports poll, Right Direction has sunk six points to 30% while Wrong Direction has jumped six points to 63%. Maybe not the best time for Obama to hit up loyal supporters for more campaign money, but he did anyway.Judging by his taped weekly remarks last Saturday, Obama has no plans to work with Congress for a change. Instead, he intends to campaign against both houses this month to extend the so-called emergency unemployment benefits that just expired. They now last for 100 weeks, three times their original tenure.Obama's argument ignores the negative economic impact of his policies and regulations and hinges on being considerate for the unemployed. From his Hawaii beach house, Obama vowed to address job creation again this year.Then he criticized Congress for not extending unemployment benefits: ""Instead of punishing these families who can least afford it — especially now — Congress should first restore that lifeline immediately, then put their (sic) entire focus on creating more good jobs that pay good wages.""A growing number of economists, however, suggest the result of endless retroactive extensions is to turn what used to be a temporary safety net during job hunts into a permanent entitlement, actually abetting the chronically-unemployed situation. As we noted here recently that actually appears to help Obama's economic optics:""Millions of discouraged job-seekers are no longer looking for work. Which means they are no longer counted as unemployed, allowing the unemployment rate to artificially dip to 7%. If the U.S. labor force had the same participation rate today as it did when the country's top-ranking shaved-ice aficionado was elected, George Will calculates the genuine unemployment rate now would be 11.3%.""An extension seems likely anyway in an election year that looks grim for Obama's party, with Republicans eager to avoid any struggle distracting voters from festering unhappiness with Obama's ongoing ObamaCare debacle.But Obama also faces other challenges, corroding his already-weak ability to influence D.C. political events. His youth support is waning, even among Democrats. A significant majority want to delay ObamaCare a year and a majority want to repeal it.Worse, Obama's credibility was severely damaged by scandals he claimed to be unaware of and by his repeated deceits over Americans keeping their doctor and health plan under his scheme. Trust is a very hard trait to rebuild in both public and private life.If Obama's not careful, one of these days many someones are going to notice that the Democrat is now in the fourth year of promising to pivot to creating new jobs. To no real visible effect, except to convince sufficient voters to let him keep his until Jan. 20, 2017.RELATED:2014: How bad for Obama?ObamaCare rips off young people

1913,ICE,"In 1901, Stephen Birch took the business trip of his dreams.A mining engineer just out of school, Birch had heard reports of a copper ore discovery in Alaska's remote Wrangell Mountains.So he packed his supplies on a horse and traveled through some of North America's harshest landscape to the edge of a glacier, where the future founder of Kennecott Copper Co. spotted what he'd come for — and then some.""It was incredible. I don't think any (deposit) has ever been richer (than Kennecott),"" Charles Hawley, an Alaskan geologist and author of the forthcoming book ""A Kennecott Story,"" told IBD. ""The first trainload assayed at more than 70% copper. Nobody had ever done that before.""Birch quickly bought out the claims and, with the financial backing of J.P. Morgan and Dan Guggenheim, formed the Alaska Syndicate, forerunner of Kennecott Copper Co., which eventually owned copper mines in the western U.S. and South America. Under Birch's leadership, the Alaska mines produced $200 million worth of copper from 1911 to 1938, and Kennecott became the leading copper producer in the country, with 15% of the world's copper resources, according to the National Mining Hall of Fame & Museum in Leadville, Colo.But it almost didn't happen.It was one thing to identify an immensely rich copper deposit.It was quite another to unearth it and get it to market.Mountainous TaskFirst, Birch had to build a railroad from Alaska's southeast coast to the mountain, a construction that many engineers said couldn't be done.He had to haul equipment by dog sled to begin digging the mine, recruit hundreds of employees to one of the most secluded corners of North America and build a town from scratch for them.The railroad alone ended up costing $23 million — worth $573 million today — by the time it was completed in 1911. But Americans hungered for copper for telephones, electrical lights and other new inventions, and Birch knew it.So he plowed on, insisting he was on the right track.""He was the visionary,"" said Geoffrey Bleakley, a cultural resource specialist for many years for southeast Alaska's Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, site of the mine. ""He was the driving force.""Copper was the mineral of the moment. It was necessary for everything — all the changes coming in American life at the turn of the century. Edison was electrifying the country. Birch basically found and developed the greatest deposit in the world at the perfect time.""Birch (1872-1940) was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., the second of six children. His father was a former Civil War Union sergeant who died when he was young.When he was 13, his mother moved the family to New Jersey, where a neighbor, Theodore Haverman, took an interest in Stephen.""The Havermans were extremely wealthy. They got him to college and subsidized his degree (at Columbia University's School of Mines),"" Hawley said.After surveying for the New York subway system, Birch made his move for riches — in the thick of Alaska's 1898 Klondike Gold Rush.Although his friends and family questioned his decision, the Havermans paid his way to Valdez in southeast Alaska, where he joined an Army expedition as a horse packer. ""Birch was their scout,"" Hawley said. ""He was up there looking for a deposit, with their backing.""In 1900, a couple of guys named Clarence Warner and ""Tarantula"" Jack Smith stumbled on a massive copper deposit high up in the Wrangells, exposed at the surface.Lacking the financial resources and connections to develop the deposit, they returned to Valdez, where they sold a claim for what they called their Bonanza Ridge to Birch, who paid $275,000 (worth $7.8 million now) in all with the help of the Havermans and their wealthy friends.""After that, he got up there pretty quickly,"" Hawley said. ""He looked at the deposit, spent several months up there sampling, making sure it was big enough.""Birch then headed to New York, where the Havermans introduced him to Morgan and Guggenheim.""There weren't any drawings,"" Hawley said. ""There wasn't any tunneling. They could've lost their shirts. It was extreme speculation.""But they trusted Birch. It was his determination, his stick-to-it-iveness, his belief that 'You just march forward.'""Added Hawley: ""Birch was shy and introverted. With larger groups, he tended to clam up. But with a group of young engineers he was just fine. Some of the young engineers who worked for him revered him.""All AboardBack in Alaska, Birch's biggest gamble — his railroad — was yet to come.""The smart money said you'd never be able to develop a copper property a couple hundred miles from tidewater,"" Hawley said.The 196-mile railway route had to cross surging rivers, snake along the bottom of canyon floors and squeeze between towering peaks.The key to the project was the gap between two glaciers bordering the Copper River. If they couldn't span it with a bridge, the railroad was doomed.""Most people considered it impossible,"" Hawley said. ""Both glaciers were advancing on the river. People said, 'You can't do this.'""Construction began in 1907, in the dead of winter, when the temperature drops to 60 degrees below zero and daylight lasts a handful of hours. Gangs of laborers drove hundreds of wood pilings into 7 feet of ice as temporary supports for the bridge spans.Due to the area's conditions, the bridge had to be one of the strongest ever built. If not, building-size icebergs caused by melting glaciers could destroy it.Birch beat the deadline.His glacier bridge was in place by the following winter.The entire railway was completed in less than four years.Rail And River""It was an amazing engineering feat,"" Bleakley said. ""Fifteen percent of the entire railroad was built on trestles. With enough technology you can do almost anything, but they didn't have any technology. They were making it up as they went along.""Meanwhile, Birch was moving men and machines into place to start mining once the railroad was finished. Early on, his men carted an entire steamship, piece by piece, over the mountains, then reassembled it along the Copper River. From there, they hauled equipment to the mountain by steamship and dog sled.""Most of the important buildings were built there before the railroad got there,"" Bleakley said. ""Birch was waiting for the train when it came in. The ore was so rich in the early years, it ran something like 70% copper. If the big mines in the Lower 48 have ore with a couple percent copper, that's all they need to make money.""In its first year of operation, the mine produced more than $20 million in copper. By 1916, the copper ore mined there was worth $32.4 million — worth $700 million in today's money.From 1911 to 1938, the Wrangell mountain yielded more than 200 million tons of copper.In 1915, with profit pouring in, Birch gained full control of the syndicate and became president of the reorganized Kennecott Copper Co.The next year he married Mary Rand. They had two children.Birch resigned as Kennecott president in 1933. By the time he died, the corporation had grown into one of the largest mineral companies in the world, with 28,872 employees and sales of $177 million, worth $3 billion today.For most of the 20th century, Kennecott continued to be a world leader in copper output. Then in 1997, the company was absorbed into Rio Tinto (RIO), a British metal and mining company, that the next year proceeded on a 215% stock run into 2008.It was part of a story that began at the turn of the century starring Birch, a shy, adventurous New Yorker who rose in 20 years to control a major share of the world's copper production. ""He was a very focused man,"" Hawley said.

1928,ICE,"Environment: For every scary piece of data held up by alarmists as proof of man-made global warming, it seems a bit of contrary evidence is uncovered — and, of course, is ignored. Let's see what Antarctica is telling us.The professional fearmongers are predicting that Arctic sea ice will soon be gone during the warmer months of the year. This is supposed to worry us into action that ""fights"" global warming.But then there's the fact, which we noted last week, that the Arctic's sea ice gain from the record low of summer 2012 is a record of its own.We reported that we're in only the third winter in history in which more than 10 million square kilometers of new ice has formed in the Arctic.We also mentioned that the Antarctic is nearing 450 days of uninterrupted above-normal ice.That was last week. And this is this week: Antarctic sea ice is on an upward slope. Real Science, a science website, says it ""has been increasing at a rate of half a million square kilometers per year.""If this alarming trend continues, the planet will be completely covered with Antarctic ice in 1,000 years,"" said Real Science, using University of Illinois data to map out the trend and reach its conclusion. ""The Australian coral reefs will freeze to death in less than 300 years.""We don't think Real Science expects Earth to be fully covered with Antarctic ice in 1,000 years. But it is a fine, though maybe somewhat snarky, response to Al Gore wildly claiming in his movie ""An Inconvenient Truth"" that sea levels will rise 20 feet due to global warming.The point is, a lot of data look extreme if their trend lines are projected to go unbroken for decades and centuries, and no room is allowed for reversals.As Antarctica was re-icing itself, America's new Secretary of State John Kerry was making his first foreign policy speech in which he addressed — yes, climate change. The silliness would be mildly amusing if the government weren't in the hands of such unserious people, effetes striving to be relevant by fixating on trendy issues rather than substantive ones.But that really epitomizes the entire global warming fright-fest and green movement, doesn't it?Facts contradictory to the popular narrative don't matter.

Not just 435 House seats are up. But 36 of 50 governor's offices, of which the GOP now controls 29. A myriad of state and local races.And probably most importantly, 36 of the Senate's 100 seats. Republicans need only add six more to make Happy Harry Reid an unhappy former majority leader. Now, you know why Harry and Barack chose the nuclear option this past fall to jam through as many of the White House's judicial and other nominations as possible on a simple majority vote. Although Obama probably cannot claim further credit for killing Osama bin Laden, other things can go wrong.But barring a major macfunkerlee by D.C.

While visiting Vietnam over the weekend, the Massachusetts Democrat noted the differences he saw in the Mekong River Delta since he had patrolled the waters in his Swift boat during the war in the late 1960s. He identified the delta as a victim of climate change and asked that ""all of us"" ""work together and focus in on these issues.""This is one of the two or three most potentially impacted areas in the world with respect to the effects of climate change,"" he said, adding a moment later that ""Vietnam is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world when it comes to climate change.""As if he hadn't already acted foolishly enough, Kerry, according to the Associated Press, pledged $17 million to ""a program that will help the region's rice producers, shrimp and crab farmers and fisherman adapt to potential changes caused by higher sea levels that bring salt water into the delicate ecosystem.""That $17 million, we might add, was not withdrawn from one of Kerry's bank accounts. It was ""contributed"" by U.S. taxpayers.It would be bad form for us to ask our secretary of state — who's so well versed in world affairs that he apparently doesn't know North Korea is a nuclear power — to shut up about climate change, though, if he did, it would be a welcome event.But we will point him to a few recent print and Web headlines that should make him think a bit harder about what he says. Here are 10 reasons Kerry should find something else to focus on: ""Record low temperature recorded in Antarctica: scientists"" — Chicago Tribune, Dec. 9 ""National Weather Service says stretch of Arctic temperatures coldest since 1972"" — Minneapolis Star Tribune, Monday ""Al Gore wasn't even warm about the disappearance of Arctic ice"" — New Jersey Star-Ledger, Sept. 16 ""Scientists: Antarctic set record cold temperatures"" — examiner.com, Dec. 10 ""Study: Earth was warmer in Roman, Medieval times"" — Daily Caller, Friday ""Global warming? Satellite data shows Arctic sea ice coverage up 50 percent!"" — Daily Caller, Monday ""Cairo Witnesses First Snowfall in 112 Years"" — Pakistan Tribune, Sunday ""Over half the USA covered in snow, the most in 11 years"" — wattsupwiththat.com, Monday ""Are tornadoes getting stronger? No"" — wattsupwiththat.com, Sunday ""Fire And Ice — Volcanoes, Not CO2, Melt West Antarctic"" — IBD, Dec. 11Before it was climate change, it was global warming. We were all supposed to be terrified that greenhouse gas emissions were trapping heat near the surface and the subsequent warming was going to bring cataclysm.Somehow the greenhouse effect that was going to burn us up was also responsible for colder and snowier weather in the winter.Eventually, the alarmists decided that any weather that looked like it was outside the normal range was caused by man. They couldn't lose. But they have. Just look at the headlines.

1997,ICE,"Event attendees double their efforts — tapping the Twitterverse while working the room. How to connect twice over:• Get onboard. Participating in social media ""is key to maximizing your networking experience and putting your brand front of mind.""So says Ben Farkas, U.S. managing director of Synthesio . The global social media monitoring firm helps clients listen to and engage with consumers.His advice? Prepare to tweet.Conferences and individual sessions have their own Twitter hashtags — phrases used to group comments on the social media site. Research them, and speakers' Twitter handles, and keep them handy for tweeting during the conference.• Attribute it. Compose a take-away thought from a presentation, and include the speaker's Twitter handle and event and session hashtags. ""This a great way to connect with the speakers and grab their attention by mentioning them,"" Farkas told IBD.• Add value. Such tweets shouldn't be verbatim repeats. ""Remember, the aim of the game is to share valuable insights from the speakers (with) attendees at the event, not a transcript,"" Farkas said.• Accept imperfection. Proofread for tweet typos. ""If you do make a slip-up, just correct yourself, maybe make a light joke of it, and move on,"" Farkas said. Also, pay attention to those hashtags, ""as sometimes the official hashtag isn't as obvious as you think.""• Keep it real. ""Use Twitter as a way to break the ice, and engage with other people using the event hashtag — then take it offline,"" Farkas said. ""Nothing beats face-to-face communication.""• Zero in. Congested conferences can clog the senses.""You just see a room full of people and name tags. You don't know who is relevant to you,"" said Bizzabo co-founder Alon Alroy.His team created the mobile networking tool to help event attendees make connections.The app incorporates speaker profiles, presentation schedules and attendee lists with LinkedIn (LNKD) profiles, Facebook (FB) pages, and Twitter handles and hashtags.The app also lets users see what events others are attending, and what LinkedIn contacts you have in common. ""We integrate all of these into a product that makes it easier,"" Alroy said.• Find stars. A frequent conference attendee, Alroy has this tried-and-true trick for mixing with influential people: ""Focus on the super connectors,"" he said.There's always someone who seems to know everyone.When Alroy chats with people, ""I ask them who they know here."" If the same name keeps coming up, that's the pro to meet.• Reach out. Cympel CEO Jesse Hultgren attended TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco in September with a mission to expand his network outside the Midwest.His startup created a digital advertising platform — think banner ads that let shoppers make purchases without navigating away from the page where the ad appeared.Hultgren calls social media an equalizer for breaking into a new crowd. ""We absolutely made some connections due to the Twitter platform,"" he said. ""It's a great real-time discovery tool.""• Grab 'em. Hultgren's team also made the most of its booth time, pitching to investors, media and potential clients.""We took an aggressive approach and reached out to everyone who walked by,"" Hultgren said.A Microsoft (MSFT) executive nearly walked past Cympel's booth, but Hultgren extended his hand.After a chat, ""he thanked me for stopping him. That was a great moment for me.""

1998,ICE,"Some see necessity as the mother of invention.Yet without proper production values and marketing techniques, an invention can go nowhere.Consider Howard Johnson, who didn't invent ice cream, but recognized its value, mass-produced it and made 28 flavors the cornerstone of his restaurant empire.Consider Richard Sears and Alvah Roebuck, who didn't invent the direct-market catalog, but built the largest catalog sales company in America.William Hoover, like Johnson, Sears and Roebuck, stands as an entrepreneurial giant.A Winning GripHoover (1849-1932) didn't invent the electric suction sweeper, but recognized its utility and used his production and marketing wits to transform it into a trusted and desirable product — the Hoover Vacuum Cleaner — as well as found the global Hoover Co.""The idea for a new invention or enterprise doesn't have to always spring from the mind of the entrepreneur,"" Fordham University business professor Robert Hurley, an expert on innovation and marketing, told IBD. ""But for entrepreneurs to be successful, there needs to be someone on the team — like William H. Hoover — who is able to notice big ideas and make sure they get executed fast and well.""Ahead of Hoover's climb were the 1907 doings of an aspiring inventor named James Spangler, who cleaned floors for a living in a Canton, Ohio, department store.Spangler used a clumsy, heavy, inefficient carpet sweeper that kicked up dust. That worsened his asthma, so he had to act: Quit his job or figure out how to craft a dustless electric suction sweeper.Rather than quit work, he developed the prototype for what would be the Hoover vacuum cleaner.Spangler patented his invention in 1908 and began selling it door-to-door in the Canton area.In ""Entrepreneurs: The Men and Women Behind Famous Brand Names and How They Made It,"" authors Joseph and Suzy Fucini recounted how Hoover discovered the new contraption:""One of the first sales that Spangler made was to his cousin, Susan Hoover, the wife of a prosperous Ohio saddle maker. ... When Susan's husband, William H. Hoover, saw her new sweeper, he was impressed. A former railroad president and the first elected mayor of New Berlin, Ohio, Hoover had a well-deserved reputation for being an astute businessman.""Although the car had yet to make its mark on the nation, Hoover believed that it would replace the horse and buggy. So he figured his days as a prosperous saddle maker were numbered.That gave him the impetus to grab the vacuum. All it needed was motor improvement and some marketing, and it was a lock to be a reliable electric household appliance.Spangler may have hatched the idea, but Hoover's financial heft, production and marketing know-how made the vacuum hum.In 1908, Hoover bought the patent for the sweeper from Spangler. What he paid is unknown.""What we do know is Hoover, apart from buying the patent, also paid off Spangler's debts and provided him the job opportunity to perfect his invention,"" said Ann Haines, operations coordinator at the Hoover Historical Center in North Canton (formerly New Berlin), Ohio.Patent in hand, Hoover founded Electric Suction Sweeper Co. and named himself president and treasurer. Spangler got the title of superintendent.Soon Hoover had six employees assembling six units a day in a corner of his New Berlin saddle shop.Hoover then spent $207 — or $5,300 in today's money — for ads in the Saturday Evening Post that offered a 10-day free trial of an electric suction sweeper, according to Hoover.com .All InThe Fucinis note that hundreds of homemakers responded.Hoover's marketing twist was not to send the sweeper directly to the customer. Instead, he chose a reputable store in each city where shoppers could pick up the sweeper for the trial, then let outlet managers keep the sales commission.After that, store managers could become dealers in Hoover vacuums. This tact laid the groundwork for a national dealer network that continues as a channel of distribution for Hoover products.Yet Hoover determined soon after his 1908 Saturday Evening Post ad that selling vacuums through dealerships didn't yield enough sales.He figured that many women were wary of the new machine, and the ""only sure way to overcome their doubts would be to take the vacuum into their homes and demonstrate their effectiveness on their living room carpets,"" wrote the Fucinis.So around 1909, Hoover sent an army of eager young men all over America for in-home demonstrations — and the move was a winner.According to Haines, Americans bought 330,000 of his vacuums in 1939 after a start of 372 machines sold in 1908 — when his Model O with attachments went for $75, worth almost $2,000 today. Today's Hoover upright vacuums go for $100 to $200.New Name, New LookMeanwhile, Hoover renamed the firm Hoover Co. in 1922.And kept improving his vacuum cleaners, developing innovative designs and additional attachments to make his product more appealing to consumers.He came up with disposable paper bags for vacuums as well as steam cleaners and self-propelled vacuums, according to Haines.Another noteworthy innovation was the beater bar, introduced in 1926, that was the basis for the advertising slogan, ""It beats, as it sweeps, as it cleans.""Aided by suction, the metal bar tapped the carpet to loosen embedded dirt while a bristle brush swept dirt up and out of the carpet.Since then, the beater bar has gone through many tweaks and refinements and is still used in most Hoover vacuums today.Other Hoover firsts included the vacuum cleaner headlight and the side-mounted hose feature.Hoover also thought globally. He opened a factory in Canada in 1911 and another in England in 1919.A century later, many in England refer to vacuuming as ""hoovering.""In 2007, Techtronic Industries, based in Hong Kong, bought the Hoover floor care business from Whirlpool (WHR) for $107 million, reported the Wall Street Journal.During World War II, Hoover switched from producing vacuum cleaners to items such as helmet liners and bomb fuses. Vacuum production resumed postwar.The Hoover Historical Center — his Victorian boyhood home — recounts the Hoover legacy. Which is: W.H. Hoover, living in northern Ohio at the turn of the 20th century, invested in a rough-hewn idea he believed in, turned it into a reliable cleaning solution, brilliantly sold it and continually improved it.He died at age 82, producing more than machines. He had six children, all of whom were involved in the family business.Colleen Olson, a 68-year-old educator, remembers how her Midwest family relied on Hoover vacuums. ""Where I come from,"" she said, ""the Hoover name resonates with quality and dependability.""

"
2031,ICE,"Two truths rule the relationship between a president and the White House media in modern times.1) The media will always want more access, no matter how much they get.2) Presidents and their image-makers, especially those chief executives in the most trouble with the least confidence, will always seek to control the flow of news. Particularly images of the chief executive, which last far longer than mere words.What makes the current festering feud between the press corps and Jay Carney of news interest is the now-familiar disparity between Obama's over-blown promises and his chronically underwhelming delivery on those vows.Sentient Americans will remember Obama's vow that his would be the most transparent presidential administration in history. Yeah, right. Remember how ObamaCare was going to be written wide-open on C-SPAN? Uh-huh.Obama even appointed someone in full-time charge of pushing transparency everywhere. That worked so well that when Joe Biden met with him to check on progress, the meeting was closed to the media. Twice.A problem with Obama's rhetorical reality, often enabled by a complicit media since 2009, is that when the president says something, as far as he's concerned, it is The Truth. You know, like keeping your doctor and health insurance if you like them. ""Period."" Dozens of times. The Chicagoan is so surrounded by sycophants and access czar Valerie Jarrett that no one has the chutzpah to describe the discordant reality to The Boss. According to Obama's own defensive testimony, he's so unaware of so much like the IRS scandal or the ObamaCare 404 implosion, that dozens of his aides are behind in their IRS tax payments for several years running. And no one does anything about it. Talk about chutzpah for a guy who hasn't met any government levy he wouldn't mind increasing on others after they finance his next fundraiser.The current argument centers on Obama's White House photographer, Pete Souza and his staff. Like most presidential photographers, Souza came from the media (Chicago Tribune). He has a professional's sharp eye for composition and seemingly unfettered access to Obama's official and backstage activities. Remember the Situation Room shot during Osama bin Laden's assassination? Hillary Clinton's shocked face. Obama crouching in the corner. Souza has also captured POTUS with his feet on Oval Office furniture, with a haughty nose in the air awaiting a grand entrance somewhere and even admiring himself in a mirror.Souza's coveted access places him where former press colleagues can only wish to go. But that's not what's new.What's new are the image delivery systems. These include Twitter, Flickr and Instagram accounts and the White House blog and website, which unlike the ObamaCare site actually works. These allow Obama to claim a kind of public transparency, giving individuals sanitized access to hidden moments with what are, in effect, mere photo news releases.But the unspoken flip-side is these systems also allow Obama's strategists to release selective photographs directly to the public, showing Marian Robinson's son-in-law in the most favorable possible light, shaping the president's image free of any filtering or controls by an independent press corps.

2037,ICE,"Rule Of Law: A federal judge rules that border agents can proceed with a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of DHS directives ordering the agents to break the law — or have their careers threatened.When those charged with enforcing existing federal law on immigration have to sue their bosses to be allowed to do their jobs, it doesn't say much for the prospects of immigration reform being hammered out in Congress, allegedly a legislative priority of a president who picks when, how and if he'll enforce the law.On Friday, Federal Judge Reed O'Conner ruled that 10 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and officers do have standing to challenge in federal court the so-called Morton Memo on prosecutorial discretion and the Dream directive on deferred action.The ICE agents filed their lawsuit in October following a memo issued in June by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano offering deferred action and employment authorization to illegal aliens under age 31 who meet certain criteria similar to those outlined in the Dream Act, which had failed to pass Congress on three occasions.With a stroke of the pen, and contrary to the laws passed by and the intent of Congress, Napolitano granted de facto amnesty to 800,000 people.Prosecutorial discretion is something that applies to a given individual in a given court case, not to a class of people subject to federal law. No one has the ""discretion"" not to enforce a federal law passed by Congress.The agents were also responding to a memo on prosecutorial discretion from ICE Director John Morton, who gutted immigration enforcement by, in effect, prohibiting ICE agents and officers from arresting or removing any but the most violent criminal aliens.Under Morton's stated policy, most of the 12 million or so illegal aliens that the administration wants to legalize are currently safe from deportation.Back in late 2010, President Obama asked Congress to pass the Dream Act, which offered a path to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of young illegal immigrants.When Congress refused, he responded to pressure from Hispanic groups to proceed via executive order by saying that it would be illegal to do so.""Now, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own. ... But that's not how our system works. That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written,"" said the president, who invokes the Constitution or ignores it depending on what suits his purpose at the moment.Faced with re-election and needing the Hispanic vote, he decided to buy it by bypassing Congress, ignoring the Constitution and changing the laws on his own.President Obama has no more respect for the law or the Constitution than the border security he pretends to enforce.ICE special agent Christopher Crane, president of the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, the union representing America's more than 7,000 ICE agents and personnel, and Border Patrol agent George McCubbin, president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing America's more than 17,000 border agents and personnel, both blasted President Barack Obama's de facto Dream Act and the actions of superiors at their respective agencies.""The administration claims it has diligently enforced immigration law and that the border is 'more secure than ever.' But those on the front lines know this to be untrue. They see the violence, chaos and lawlessness. They have lost confidence in the leadership of their agencies,"" Crane said.If the American people could be assured that the border was secure and no more illegals could come, they would ask all of the 11 million or 12 million already here to raise their right hand tomorrow and be sworn in as citizens.But if you think the border will be more secure and the immigration problem resolved under any new law the president will selectively enforce, if at all, dream on.

The Nasdaq dropped 1.7%, the S&P 500 1.5%, the Dow Jones industrial average 1.3%. Alcoa (AA) lost 3% and hit a two-year low. Bank of America (BAC) and American Express (AXP) were also hard-hit.

Refineries operated at the highest rate…
"
2168,ICE,"West Texas Intermediate crude surged high after TransCanada said it will begin operating the southern leg of its Keystone XL pipeline to the Gulf Coast in January.
"
2169,ICE,"January WTI increased $2.05, or 2.2%, to $95.88 a barrel at 12:54 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, they touched $96.04, the highest since Nov. 1.January Brent gained $1.13, or 1%, to $112.58 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange after rising to $112.70, the highest intraday level since Sept. 13. The European benchmark's premium over WTI narrowed to as little as $16.16 from $17.63 Monday.TransCanada plans to start deliveries Jan. 3 to Port Arthur, Texas, via the segment of the Keystone expansion project from Cushing, Oklahoma, according to a government filing Monday. Cushing is the delivery point for WTI futures.""With the pipeline up and running, you are going to see drops in Cushing inventories,"" said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass. ""It drives up WTI prices far more than Brent. You are going to see a narrowing of the Brent-WTI differential.""Plans for the southern pipeline segment show it will be able to move 700,000 barrels a day of crude to Port Arthur, home to 6.1% of U.S. refining capacity. Motiva Enterprises, Valero Energy and Total all operate plants there.The proposed northern portion of Keystone XL, which would stretch from Alberta's oil sands to Nebraska, is being held up because it requires a presidential permit.
"
2170,ICE,"Managers of $1.2 billion Neuberger Berman Guardian Fund think of themselves as people looking to buy businesses.
"
2171,ICE,"When they find prospects, they kick the tires. ""We evaluate business plans and try to find plans that are best positioned for secular growth,"" said senior manager Arthur Moretti. Lately that process has brought the fund back to its winning way.
"
2172,ICE,"The fund was up 18.08% for the 12 months ended April 30. That outperformed 96% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar.
"
2173,ICE,"Over the past three and 10 years the fund ranks in the top 42% and 23% of its peer group.
"
2174,ICE,"This is a rebound from 2011 and 2012 when the fund topped only 42% and 24% of its direct rivals.
"
2175,ICE,"Moretti, 49 years old and senior helmsman of the fund since Dec. 31, 2002, talked shop with IBD from his office in Manhattan.
"
2176,ICE,"IBD: What are you doing differently than you did in 2011 and 2012?
"
2177,ICE,"Moretti: When you peel back the layers of the onion, it was the fourth quarters in those years, not the whole calendar years, that gave us trouble. There was dramatic risk-off trading, driven by events that had nothing to do with stock fundamentals.
"
2178,ICE,"In Q3 2011, we had the budget crisis in the U.S. Then people worried about European banks. So in Q4 investors went toward yield. High-dividend-paying stocks did well.
"
2179,ICE,"Our yield then and now is less than the market's. The free cash flow of our portfolio is above the market's, so our companies can pay but they choose not to. They invest their money in mergers and acquisitions or in plants or equipment. But the market didn't care. It wanted safety, yield.
"
2180,ICE,"The other thing was that in 2012 we did not have Apple (AAPL). Apple took off. It became a phenomenon. It was a driver of the index because of its size. And not owning Apple was a head wind for us.
"
2181,ICE,"We missed Apple five years ago. But by 2012 we felt the opportunity was overplayed and we didn't change our stripes.
"
2182,ICE,"We've done well since late last year because the market started to focus more on company-specific fundamentals.
"
2183,ICE,"IBD: What do you think about Apple now?
"
2184,ICE,"Moretti: I have an aversion toward boxes in tech. A lot of the intellectual property that drives disruptive change in the tech space does not come from boxes in the long run. There may be some innovation at that level. But the box gets commoditized. The box does not drive innovation. It gets copied and the value proposition of its innovator gets diminished.
"
2185,ICE,"The innovator gets a premium price for its innovation. But to maintain that premium, it has to keep innovating at a level that is as disruptive as its initial historic innovation. Otherwise it starts to see price compression.
"
2186,ICE,"We saw it with Digital Equipment, with Nokia (NOK), Compaq, Research in Motion, now BlackBerry (BBRY) and all the router companies that existed in the late 1990s. We saw it with the mainframe, the super computer, the mini.
"
2187,ICE,"Apple has other things going for it, but now they're the big incumbent. It might be a good trade at these prices. But the challenges they face in the near term probably have some box-maker elements (of failing to maintain disruptive innovation) I talked about.
"
2188,ICE,"IBD: Describe your overall approach, please.
"
2189,ICE,"Moretti: We try to think like owners of businesses. We are inherently long-term in focus. We evaluate business plans and try to find attractive secular growth characteristics. In each sector we own what we see as the industry leader and the company in the best position to grow at a premium to its peer group.
"
2190,ICE,"IBD: That pickiness is reflected in your concentrated approach, right? You usually have 30 to 40 names?
"
2191,ICE,"Moretti: Yes. We try to find industry leaders positioned to outgrow peers. If you have conviction around their earnings power, we try to buy them when they're statistically cheap.
"
2192,ICE,"IBD: You don't apply one discount to fair market value, do you? You look for various discounts in different sectors and situations, right?
"
2193,ICE,"Moretti: Right. Our value bias depends on revenue stream, type of business and so on.
"
2194,ICE,"IBD: Do you look for fallen angels?
"
2195,ICE,"Moretti: As we go through our process, we know the name we want to own. We just don't know when the risk-reward for the stock will make sense.
"
2196,ICE,"What happens typically is that there may be a valuation event. News or some dislocation. Once it makes sense from a risk-reward perspective, we introduce it to the portfolio.
"
2197,ICE,"We're not contrarian. We know the names we want. But we want to be valuation sensitive about when to buy.
"
2198,ICE,"IBD: Are all of your buys on the heels of some dislocation?
"
2199,ICE,"Moretti: It's probably 40-60. Forty percent of the time there's some dislocation and we react. Sixty percent of the time our research gives us a different perspective of what a company's earnings potential can be. It looks steeper to us, so we buy.
"
2200,ICE,"IBD: Do you play macro trends?
"
2201,ICE,"Moretti: We look for key risks a company may face in executing its business plan. The way macro factors impact our process comes from how we think macro risks may keep a company from executing its strategy.
"
2202,ICE,"IBD: So what types of stocks are you avoiding these days?
"
2203,ICE,"Moretti: The thing that's unique about the period we live in is that the globe has a debt problem. It's of a scale no one has seen before. And it's primarily focused in developed nations. It creates a head wind for growth.
"
2204,ICE,"It makes businesses cautious about spending and hiring. It makes consumers deleverage and cautious about spending.
"
2205,ICE,"IBD: So what are you avoiding?
"
2206,ICE,"Moretti: We don't want businesses that depend on the capital markets for funding and growth. Those markets have closed several times in the past four years.
"
2207,ICE,"We don't want companies with a lot of debt or negative free cash flow. For example, utilities don't generate free cash. They have to access the capital markets to fund their businesses and to grow. They pay high dividends and many perceive them as stable and safe. They have large regulated revenue streams. But the fact they can be shut out of capital markets makes them riskier now than they have been historically.
"
2208,ICE,"Or say we get inflation. A utility has no control over its revenue. It must go to a regulatory body for a rate increase. And sometimes that decision is politically driven.
"
2209,ICE,"IBD: What's another industry you're avoiding?
"
2210,ICE,"Moretti: Money center banks and brokerages. They need regular access to capital markets.
"
2211,ICE,"They also face regulatory risk. Dodd-Frank is law, but the implementation rules are still being written. So those financial institutions don't know how much capital they must hold and which businesses they can be in. Because of that, we don't know their long-term earnings potential.
"
2212,ICE,"IBD: Yet financials were your largest sector at 24% of assets as of Feb. 28. What do you have besides banks and brokerages?
"
2213,ICE,"Moretti: Those risks create opportunities for businesses such as exchanges. We own CME (CME) and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE). Both are beneficiaries of a changing regulatory backdrop. Since the financial crisis, the thrust of regulatory reform has been around higher capital standards and transparency. Broker-dealers make markets upstairs, away from exchanges, in derivatives and things that weren't exchange-traded like exchange swaps. People didn't know where the risk is.
"
2214,ICE,"In the new world, regulators want to centralize transactions, measure them and control risk. So, much activity previously done upstairs is being compelled to be done on an exchange, where things are centrally cleared, measured and monitored. The exchanges benefit from that.
"
2215,ICE,"IBD: Yet you've got BlackRock (BLK). What do you like about the giant asset manager?
"
2216,ICE,"Moretti: When we first got involved, asset managers were under a lot of pressure. We first purchased in the fall of 2010 when PNC (PNC) and Bank of America (BAC) opted to materially reduce their positions to raise capital. BlackRock stock had underperformed in the market's rally off its 2009 low. The share price pressure created by these two sellers set up an attractive risk-reward in BlackRock stock.
"
2217,ICE,"And they have a set of active equity products and a set of passive strategies. So they are somewhat uniquely positioned to grow their assets regardless of which way investors' preferences go.
"
2218,ICE,"IBD: You've also got insurers. Why do you like them?
"
2219,ICE,"Moretti: Auto insurance is like advertising. It's not something everyone thinks would be an inflation hedge. But policies are written for (a set time period). If they're not profitable, the insurer stops writing that business. It writes new policies with higher rates that give them a good return on their investment. We own Progressive (PGR), which we think is the most innovative. We own Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), which owns Geico.
"
2220,ICE,"IBD: What else do you like about Berkshire?
"
2221,ICE,"Moretti: We bought Berkshire late last year. About 70% of its value was driven by its industrial businesses. Many are the best in their class. We like that. They own Burlington Northern (BNSF Railway), for example.
"
2222,ICE,"IBD: Why do you like names such as that?
"
2223,ICE,"Moretti: We see head winds to growth. So we want financially strong businesses, with strong free cash flow and strong balance sheets, which can fund their own growth.
"
2224,ICE,"And we want companies that can protect our purchasing power if we get policy-induced inflation down the road. Companies that have big distribution, logistics elements to them inherently let you pass through price increases.
"
2225,ICE,"One example is things like railroads — Burlington Northern. They also benefit from the industrial renaissance being fueled by growing U.S. oil and gas supplies.
"
2226,ICE,"Other examples are less obvious, like advertising. Ads are a form of distribution model. We own Scripps (SNI) and Google (GOOG), which make money from ads.
"
2227,ICE,"Only some consumer staples fit this (distribution model) as well. We never owned consumer staples through 2008. We started to buy ones with strong brands that grew earnings in the worst environment ever. We think those companies have already been tested.
"
2228,ICE,"IBD: What are some examples?
"
2229,ICE,"Moretti: Ecolab (ECL) and Praxair (PX).
"
2230,ICE,"Ecolab provides things consumers would recognize in public bathrooms, such as soap and soap dispensers, disinfectants, cleaning supplies. And they provide services. They not only sell branded goods, but they deliver the goods to restaurants, office buildings, commercial and industrial establishments. They also bring them inside and install them.
"
2231,ICE,"One of their growth drivers comes from their 2011 purchase of Nalco, a water purification and treatment business.
"
2232,ICE,"Praxair sells industrial gases for consumer and manufacturing applications. Their industrial gases make industrial processes more energy efficient and they cut emissions. They typically have a facility on-site at a large customer. They also have the capacity to package industrial gases to other customers in the area from that facility. They pass wholesale costs for natural gas and electricity through in their price. They get good secular growth even in a slow-growth world.Managers of $1.2 billion Neuberger Berman Guardian Fund think of themselves as people looking to buy businesses.When they find prospects, they kick the tires. ""We evaluate business plans and try to find plans that are best positioned for secular growth,"" said senior manager Arthur Moretti.

We started to buy ones with strong brands that grew earnings in the worst environment ever. We think those companies have already been tested.IBD: What are some examples?Moretti: Ecolab (ECL) and Praxair (PX).Ecolab provides things consumers would recognize in public bathrooms, such as soap and soap dispensers, disinfectants, cleaning supplies. And they provide services. They not only sell branded goods, but they deliver the goods to restaurants, office buildings, commercial and industrial establishments. They also bring them inside and install them.One of their growth drivers comes from their 2011 purchase of Nalco, a water purification and treatment business.Praxair sells industrial gases for consumer and manufacturing applications. Their industrial gases make industrial processes more energy efficient and they cut emissions. They typically have a facility on-site at a large customer. They also have the capacity to package industrial gases to other customers in the area from that facility. They pass wholesale costs for natural gas and electricity through in their price. They get good secular growth even in a slow-growth world.

2233,ICE,"West Texas intermediate fell as crude inventories increased to the highest level in three months in the U.S., the world's biggest oil-consuming country. December contract December WTI crude oil fell $1.43 to $99.68.The Energy Information Administration said supplies rose 4 million barrels to 374.5 million in the week ended Oct. 11, the most since June 28.

2234,ICE,"Now that about three-quarters of S&P 500 companies have reported, Michael Kors (KORS), Priceline.com (PCLN) and Stratasys (SSYS) represent the few remaining chances to buy or sell an IBD 50 stock ahead of their quarterly results — if you can stomach the potential ups and downs that earnings season often brings.Continental Resources (CLR), Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) and Sturm Ruger (RGR) are also scheduled to report in the coming week, rounding out a list of big names in their respective industries.Michael Kors (No. 49 on the latest IBD 50 list) is expected to grow earnings per share 39% to 68 cents when it reports Nov. 5 before the market open.That would be the lowest quarterly growth since the seller of luxury apparel and accessories went public in December 2011, during which time its shares have surged more than 275%. Analysts forecast sales will rise 36%, also its slowest gain since its IPO.The former ""Project Runway"" judge's namesake company has taken the fashion world by storm. A recent Piper Jaffray survey of teens showed Michael Kors handbags were the second-most preferred by that age group — just behind old guard Coach (COH) — and rapidly taking market share.Kors also will be joining the S&P 500 soon, once Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and NYSE Euronext (NYX) complete their merger, which was expected to close Nov. 4 but was delayed.Wall Street analysts think Jazz Pharma (No. 7) will post a 29% jump in Q3 EPS to $1.67 a share, the Irish company's lowest quarterly growth rate in years. Sales are expected to rise 58%, lighter than the past six quarters.Jazz's EPS Rating is a highest-possible 99, as is its Composite Rating, which combines five key fundamental gauges with stock-price performance. The stock has rallied 70% this year.FBR Capital began covering the specialty drugmaker recently with an outperform rating.Sturm Ruger (No. 19) also announces results Nov. 5 after hours. Analysts expect the gunmaker to report a 38% profit increase to $1.21 a share, which would be its lightest growth in eight quarters. Sales are seen growing 31%, also the slowest since Q2.The Southport, Conn.-based company scores a 99 EPS Rating, the highest possible.Shares fell 6% Oct. 24 after retailer Cabela's (CAB) cited a ""significant deceleration"" in firearms and ammunition sales as it missed its profit and sales targets. But Sturm Ruger has nearly recovered all those losses and is 4% off its 52-week high.Energy company Continental Resources (No. 33) is on tap for Nov. 6 and has been riding the North American shale energy boom that drilling techniques like hydraulic fracturing have unlocked.It is the largest landholder in the lucrative Bakken Shale, and analysts expect it to earn $1.48 a share, up 70% from a year earlier. Revenue is seen surging 53% to $970.67.Consensus estimates call for a 5% EPS gain when Stratasys (No. 15) reports Thursday before the opening bell. That's a sharp slowdown for the 3D printer maker, after 14 quarters of 29% or better growth. Analysts expect sales to surge 136%, its highest level in years.Stratasys boasts a 99 Composite Rating. Rival 3D Systems (DDD) last month reported better-than-expected Q3 earnings but cut its full-year forecast as it spends more to boost expansion.Priceline.com (No. 12) rounds out the top five IBD 50 leaders reporting this week. The online travel booking site, which gives results Thursday after the close, is expected to grow Q3 profit 31% to $16.22, an acceleration from Q2's 24% gain.Revenue growth is estimated to be 30%, which would be higher than the past six quarters. Priceline's share price has soared 69% this year. And its stock isn't the only highflier. It has a 99 for its EPS and Composite ratings.Among other IBD 50 leaders also reporting this week, MercadoLibre (MELI) (No. 34) is on tap for after hours Nov. 5. Analysts expect a 24% earnings increase to 73 cents a share.

"
2236,ICE,"Hundreds of thousands of cancellation letters went out to people who had been assured a dozen times by the president that ""if you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan. Period.""
"
2237,ICE,"The cancellations lay bare three pillars of ObamaCare: (1) mendacity, (2) paternalism and (3) subterfuge.

2298,ICE,"Scandal: A deadly battle involving grenades between a drug cartel and Mexican police has added to the toll of lives taken with weapons trafficked by suspects that U.S. officials watched but did not stop.
"
2299,ICE,"The same Obama administration officials responsible for letting thousands of weapons walk into Mexico and right into the hands of drug cartels in Operation Fast and Furious also passed on several opportunities to arrest and prosecute an arms smuggler who was busy supplying the cartels with hand grenades.
"
2300,ICE,"This according to a report by Sharyl Attkisson of CBS News, the one reporter who has taken the time to expose the deadliest of the administration's ""phony"" scandals.
"
2301,ICE,"Attkisson, whose yeoman work exposed much of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' Fast and Furious operation, acquired a Justice Department ""Significant Incident Report"" filed last Tuesday. It details a deadly drug-cartel shootout with Mexican police in Guadalajara last week that killed three policemen and four cartel members and in which at least 10 hand grenades were used.
"
2302,ICE,"Grenades have been a weapon of choice for the Mexican cartels. A cartel attack on Aug. 25, 2011, in a Monterrey casino killed 53 people. One of those used in last week's battle with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel has been linked to Jean Baptiste Kingery, an alleged firearms trafficker U.S. officials allowed to operate for years without arresting despite significant evidence that he was supplying the cartels with massive amounts of grenade parts and ammunition.
"
2303,ICE,"Kingery's smuggling is not directly part of Fast and Furious. But, as Attkisson reports, the Kingery case was overseen by the same U.S. attorney in Arizona and ATF office in Phoenix that let suspects traffic thousands of weapons to drug cartels in the operation that resulted in the deaths of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry and ICE agent Jaime Zapata.
"
2304,ICE,"The Fast and Furious pattern of failing to interdict the weapons flow or arrest those involved in a timely manner is once again apparent. In 2009, ATF learned that Kingery, already under suspicion for running AK-47s into Mexico, was also dealing in grenades.
"
2305,ICE,"""Documents show they (ATF) developed a secret plan to let him smuggle parts to Mexico in early 2010 and follow him to his factory. Some ATF agents vehemently objected, worried that Kingery would disappear once he crossed the border into Mexico. That's exactly what happened,"" Attkisson reports.
"
2306,ICE,"Kingery resurfaced in January 2010 and was again under ATF surveillance after he bought about 50 grenade ""bodies"" and headed to Mexico. Six months later, Kingery was caught leaving the U.S. for Mexico with 114 disassembled grenades in a tire.
"
2307,ICE,"Kingery, who in addition to his gun-running is suspected of smuggling parts for as many as 2,000 grenades into Mexico, could have been prosecuted in the U.S. at least twice for violating export control laws. But each time, prosecutors in Arizona refused to make a case.
"
2308,ICE,"The U.S. attorney for Arizona at the time was Dennis Burke, a onetime Obama campaign donor who oversaw Fast and Furious and helped convert it from a gun-interdiction to a gun-walking program, and who resigned shortly after Brian Terry's murder made the scandalous operation public.
"
2309,ICE,"Burke's assistant, Emory Hurley, has been transferred. Sources say Hurley is the one who let Kingery go, saying grenade parts are ""novelty items"" and the case ""lacked jury appeal."" There's no way to know how many died as a result of the decision to let Kingery walk repeatedly and continue his murderous smuggling.

But how does he explain record sea ice in the Antarctic?The summer of 2012 was a scorcher for many across the country. Naturally the global warming alarmists couldn't contain themselves.James Hansen, whose politicized ravings are primarily responsible for the climate change scare, wrote in August that the summer was ""the kind of future that climate change would bring to us and our planet.""Gore lamented the ""dirty weather"" created by ""dirty energy"" and declared on his web site that ""a lot of people are saying out loud, 'I'm too hot!'""In case anyone wondered just how people felt.Richard Muller, a physics professor at the University of California at Berkeley, fed the hysteria machine when he supposedly converted this summer from a skeptic to a believer, though there is reasonable doubt he was ever a true skeptic.Lost in all the feverish I-told-you-sos was the fact that on one single day in the last week of June, 46 U.S. cities set or tied record lows.No, they were not all in Alaska. Some were in the Deep South, where even mild summers can be blistering hot.Now we find ourselves at the end of the broiling summer and what do we learn?That, according to James Taylor writing in Forbes, ""Antarctic sea ice set another record this past week, with the most amount of ice ever recorded on day 256 of the calendar year (Sept. 12 of this leap year).""Taylor also reports that ""Antarctic sea ice has been growing since satellites first began measuring the ice 33 years ago and the sea ice has been above the 33-year average throughout 2012."" He also informs readers that ice on the continent itself is growing, too.Meanwhile, at the other pole, Arctic sea ice, which the media call a ""critical climate indicator,"" is at its lowest point in the last 11 years. But earlier in 2012, it was higher than in eight of the years since 2002.Was it also a ""critical climate indicator"" then?Is Antarctic sea ice a ""critical climate indicator"" now?The real crisis is not the heating of the global climate but a fear campaign coming unglued.

"
2387,ICE,"Is it a true connection, one that will endure and spell opportunity, or will another fleeting, sugary distraction replace it the next day?
"
2388,ICE,"A century before YouTube or Twitter or Facebook (FB), an unassuming Midwesterner launched his own connection economy, in a way that has brought lasting results to those in the fold.
"
2389,ICE,"He was Ralph Smedley, the founder of Toastmasters International, who may — even still — have a wider influence than social media. After all, TI members have met in an ice cave in Antarctica.
"
2390,ICE,"Toastmasters, headquartered in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif., is a global nonprofit that delivers education for speaking and leadership skills.
"
2391,ICE,"Its success — with 14,350 clubs, a 33% jump in revenue to $32 million in 2012 and 20 straight years of positive growth — is due to the bedrock principles Smedley (1878-1965) instituted from the beginning.
"
2392,ICE,"""It's a culture of politeness, respect and professionalism,"" Daniel Rex, CEO of Toastmasters International, told IBD.
"
2393,ICE,"The idea first took shape in 1903, when Smedley, a recent college graduate, was starting his career as the educational director at the YMCA in Bloomington, Ill.
"
2394,ICE,"Boosting Boys
"
2395,ICE,"Recognizing that the young men in his charge needed to build confidence and speaking skills, he designed a club where they could take turns presiding and presenting short speeches.
"
2396,ICE,"Smedley provided evaluations of these speeches and, perceptively, encouraged the boys' peers to do the same, always with a spirit of helpfulness and consideration.
"
2397,ICE,"They agreed to call the group Toastmasters because the setup was like a banquet with after-dinner speeches.
"
2398,ICE,"When he was promoted to general secretary of the YMCA in Rock Island, Ill., Smedley started another club there, and it ballooned to a membership of 75.
"
2399,ICE,"To his dismay, the first club in Bloomington dissolved after his departure, as did the Rock Island group, despite its popularity, and another club he started, in 1906, in Freeport, Ill.
"
2400,ICE,"With his every rise up the ranks of the YMCA, and every transfer to a new city, the Toastmasters clubs he left behind faltered and died.
"
2401,ICE,"Perhaps others were not as sold on the idea as he was.
"
2402,ICE,"In ""The Story of Toastmasters: Reminiscences of the Founder,"" Smedley wrote, in his typically understated fashion, ""I observed a tendency among my fellow secretaries at the YMCA to regard the Toastmasters clubs as a sort of peculiarity, an idiosyncrasy, of mine.""
"
2403,ICE,"Undeterred, Smedley introduced his idea on the West Coast after a career move to San Jose, Calif., in 1919. Although the failure pattern continued — launch, move, dissolve — so did Smedley.
"
2404,ICE,"He persisted with his vision until finally, in Santa Ana in 1924, nearly 20 years after his first attempt, one group took root. Toastmasters International was born.
"
2405,ICE,"That chapter, the Smedley No. 1 Club, still meets every first and third Tuesday.
"
2406,ICE,"By the time his idea was germinating in California, it had expanded beyond a confidence-building experiment for YMCA youth.
"
2407,ICE,"Business professionals saw that Smedley's approach could boost their ability to communicate — and to lead. ""That's the secret of Toastmasters,"" said Paul Clark, an Orange County, Calif., historian who carries the title Distinguished Toastmaster. ""Everyone thinks, 'Oh, I'll go there and learn how to speak.' But suddenly you're not only learning how to speak; you're learning how to be a leader.""
"
2408,ICE,"Said Rex: ""At first that started as a byproduct of the program, but very soon Smedley realized that communication is a necessary part of leadership. You can be a good speaker without being a good leader. But you can't be a great leader without being a great communicator.""
"
2409,ICE,"Public speaking is regularly cited as everyone's No. 1 fear. Three of four people rank it even more powerful than the fear of dying.
"
2410,ICE,"As Jerry Seinfeld says, ""That means that the average person at a funeral would rather be in the casket than doing the eulogy.""
"
2411,ICE,"In Smedley's philosophy, that fear turns into opportunity. Since strangers represent a threat (according to our biology), he simply transformed strangers into members of a tribe. They would convey support, cooperation, attention and help in a relaxed atmosphere, and everyone involved would benefit from the experience.
"
2412,ICE,"""We learn best in moments of enjoyment,"" as Smedley put it.
"
2413,ICE,"The ideal delivery, he found, was a conversational one — nothing bombastic or overly staged.
"
2414,ICE,"Presidential Pitch
"
2415,ICE,"He cited the fireside chats of Franklin Roosevelt and the folksy charm of Will Rogers as superior speechmaking, since they spoke to millions just as though they were speaking with a friend.
"
2416,ICE,"Toastmasters is a laboratory where members experiment with voice inflection, body language and words to see what works.
"
2417,ICE,"""The culture of collaboration is just ingrained,"" Rex said. ""It is supportive enough to get someone to return to give another speech, but constructive enough to provide the value to help them improve over time. I've been to meetings in Dubai and Malaysia and Australia, and they all function nearly exactly the same as Toastmasters did back in the 1930s and 1940s.""
"
2418,ICE,"On the eve of Toastmasters' 90th anniversary, the connection economy that Smedley created is still working because the product is ongoing skill development.
"
2419,ICE,"""Education is our business. It has been so from the beginning,"" he said.
"
2420,ICE,"Using a learn-by-doing approach, Toastmasters teaches its members how to engage — through strong presentation skills and by honing listening skills.
"
2421,ICE,"Link To The Present
"
2422,ICE,"That ability to engage remains the primary asset in business relationships, especially in a digital world. Technology has so expanded the marketplace that consumers can select where they will put their attention.

"
2424,ICE,"Answer: those with a strong narrative and those we can trust.
"
2425,ICE,"That's what Smedley aimed to develop.
"
2426,ICE,"In the 1920s he banded the assorted clubs in Southern California into a federation. Along the way he published manuals that still stand as the organization's guidelines.
"
2427,ICE,"With consistency in methods established, the organization incorporated in 1930, qualifying as international because of one club in British Columbia.

"
2431,ICE,"Industry giants like Google (GOOG), Disney (DIS), American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO) and Microsoft (MSFT) have corporate clubs where Smedley's philosophy shapes their leaders.
"
2432,ICE,"When Smedley finally left the YMCA in 1941 to devote his energy full time to Toastmasters, much of it was spent corresponding with new chapters across the world.
"
2433,ICE,"He tirelessly shared his insights in thousands of handwritten letters. In 1950 his alma mater, Illinois Wesleyan University, presented him a doctorate of humane letters in recognition of his impact in hundreds of communities.

"
2437,ICE,"Skeptics and deniers can make all the noise they want, but a landmark new report is unequivocal: There is a 95% chance that human-generated emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are changing the climate in ways that court disaster.
"
2438,ICE,"That's the bottom line from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which Monday released the latest of its comprehensive, every-six-years assessments of the scientific consensus about climate change.
"
2439,ICE,"According to the IPCC, there is only a 1-in-20 chance that human activity is not causing dangerous warming. You may like those betting odds. If so, let's get together for a friendly game of poker, and please don't forget to bring cash.
"
2440,ICE,"The squawking from naysayers has recently been all about a supposed ""pause"" in global warming. They say there has been no detectable warming in the past 15 years and claim that any temperature rise that scientists attribute to human activity is really part of some grand natural cycle — probably nothing to worry about, and, in any event, nothing we can control.
"
2441,ICE,"One look at the data indicates that the skeptics' view is wishful thinking, at best. It is true that if you look at the period 1998-2013, there is very little warming. But that is because 1998 was an extreme outlier — a sharp spike on the graph. That year was much warmer than the preceding or subsequent few years.
"
2442,ICE,"If you plot global temperatures over a longer time period, covering 50 or 100 years, you get a line that jiggles up and down but generally trends upward at an alarming slope. Look closely and you'll notice that 2005 and 2010 were both a bit warmer than 1998.
"
2443,ICE,"Why is this happening? Because ""the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years,"" according to the executive summary of the 2,000-plus-page IPCC report.
"
2444,ICE,"By processes well-known to science and reproducible in the laboratory, these gases trap solar heat. Since the Industrial Revolution, when humans began burning fossil fuels on a vast scale, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by an astounding 40%. Unless all the physics textbooks are wrong, this causes warming.
"
2445,ICE,"Atmospheric science is difficult because there are so many variables involved. Heat can be trapped in the depths of the oceans, thus mitigating its effect on surface temperatures — for a time. Volcanic eruptions spew particles into the atmosphere that block some measure of sunlight. El Nino and La Nina changes in Pacific Ocean currents are associated with seasonal or yearly temperature fluctuations.
"
2446,ICE,"Nevertheless, the infamous ""hockey stick"" graph showing global temperatures rising over time, first slowly and then sharply, remains valid.
"
2447,ICE,"""Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system,"" the IPCC summary says. ""Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.""
"
2448,ICE,"Prospects for those reductions are iffy. The sluggish economy, higher automotive fuel economy standards and the substitution of natural gas for coal in many power plants have helped keep U.S. emissions in check.
"
2449,ICE,"But China is by far the world's biggest emitter, and while there are signs that Chinese leaders now consider climate change important, it is unclear how the economy can continue its rapid growth without relying on coal.
"
2450,ICE,"The IPCC report says it is ""very likely"" that heat waves will become more frequent and more intense. It is also ""very likely"" that extreme rainfall events, such as the deluge in Colorado last month, will become more common; that ""Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin"" in coming decades; that ""Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover will decrease"" and that ""global glacier volume will further decrease.""
"
2451,ICE,"Sea levels will continue to rise because of warming — water expands as it heats — and because of glacial melting. This has implications for coastal populations not just in places such as Calcutta or Dhaka but also in rich and powerful cities such as New York: Witness the massive flooding and storm-surge damage caused by Superstorm Sandy.
"
2452,ICE,"""A large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial time scale,"" the IPCC says. In other words, this is the world we have made. Get used to it.
"
2453,ICE,"But it is within our power to adapt to climate change and keep it from getting much worse. The first step in Carbonoholics Anonymous is admitting we have a problem.Skeptics and deniers can make all the noise they want, but a landmark new report is unequivocal: There is a 95% chance that human-generated emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are changing the climate in ways that court disaster.That's the bottom line from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which Monday released the latest of its comprehensive, every-six-years assessments of the scientific consensus about climate change.According to the IPCC, there is only a 1-in-20 chance that human activity is not causing dangerous warming.

It is true that if you look at the period 1998-2013, there is very little warming. But that is because 1998 was an extreme outlier — a sharp spike on the graph. That year was much warmer than the preceding or subsequent few years.If you plot global temperatures over a longer time period, covering 50 or 100 years, you get a line that jiggles up and down but generally trends upward at an alarming slope. Look closely and you'll notice that 2005 and 2010 were both a bit warmer than 1998.Why is this happening? Because ""the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years,"" according to the executive summary of the 2,000-plus-page IPCC report.By processes well-known to science and reproducible in the laboratory, these gases trap solar heat. Since the Industrial Revolution, when humans began burning fossil fuels on a vast scale, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by an astounding 40%. Unless all the physics textbooks are wrong, this causes warming.Atmospheric science is difficult because there are so many variables involved. Heat can be trapped in the depths of the oceans, thus mitigating its effect on surface temperatures — for a time. Volcanic eruptions spew particles into the atmosphere that block some measure of sunlight. El Nino and La Nina changes in Pacific Ocean currents are associated with seasonal or yearly temperature fluctuations.Nevertheless, the infamous ""hockey stick"" graph showing global temperatures rising over time, first slowly and then sharply, remains valid.""Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system,"" the IPCC summary says. ""Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.""Prospects for those reductions are iffy. The sluggish economy, higher automotive fuel economy standards and the substitution of natural gas for coal in many power plants have helped keep U.S. emissions in check.But China is by far the world's biggest emitter, and while there are signs that Chinese leaders now consider climate change important, it is unclear how the economy can continue its rapid growth without relying on coal.The IPCC report says it is ""very likely"" that heat waves will become more frequent and more intense. It is also ""very likely"" that extreme rainfall events, such as the deluge in Colorado last month, will become more common; that ""Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin"" in coming decades; that ""Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover will decrease"" and that ""global glacier volume will further decrease.""Sea levels will continue to rise because of warming — water expands as it heats — and because of glacial melting. This has implications for coastal populations not just in places such as Calcutta or Dhaka but also in rich and powerful cities such as New York: Witness the massive flooding and storm-surge damage caused by Superstorm Sandy.""A large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial time scale,"" the IPCC says. In other words, this is the world we have made. Get used to it.But it is within our power to adapt to climate change and keep it from getting much worse. The first step in Carbonoholics Anonymous is admitting we have a problem.

2465,ICE,"Law: President Obama often uses regulatory fiat as a substitute for enacting laws with Congress. But things aren't working as planned, now that 10 ICE agents are suing to uphold immigration laws. Yes, the law matters.Until those 10 Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agents filed a lawsuit in federal court, suing for the ""right"" to enforce federal immigration laws they are sworn to uphold, the president seemed to expect them to act like corrupt big-city cops, twiddling their thumbs, thinking about their fat union pensions and early retirements, taking zero risks, and telling the irate public all the reasons why they can't seem to do anything about crime.Obama tried to turn Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials into just such do-nothing civil servants. He told them not to enforce immigration laws against people under 30 in a Homeland Security order this month.The law mimics the provisions of the Dream Act, a failed bill in Congress favored by Obama as a back-door amnesty gambit. That's why it didn't pass.In doing this, Obama's using the lazy philosophy he's repeatedly used in his governance: doing an end-run around Congress and avoiding the hard work of negotiating the laws he wants and issuing rulings instead.Agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and Energy Department have been happy to go along, issuing draconian regulations dear to the heart of radical environmental leftists that wouldn't stand a chance in the open air of a freely elected and publicly accountable legislature.But on immigration, it's a different picture.Arizona was the first to step forward, passing legislation to enforce laws the Obama administration refused to enforce. Now the U.S. lawmen have followed.Arizona's leaders acted as they did because they listened to the will of their voters and wanted to be accountable.The federal lawmen acted because they took their oath to uphold the law seriously. Not to enforce the law renders the U.S. border meaningless — and their own work without purpose.Indeed, their work is anything but worthless — it often calls on them to risk and even give their lives for this precious rule of law we all enjoy.ICE agent Jaime Zapata, killed in 2011 by Mexican cartel gunmen armed with what might have been U.S.-supplied weapons from another politicized operation called Fast and Furious, is just one example. And the U.S. Marines shot in Mexico on Friday highlight the risk U.S. government workers on the front lines face.ICE agents also also know very well the nature of the enemy they are up against — not the hapless ""Dreamer"" with a well-crafted professional sob story for media consumption, but the real nature of illegal immigration.It's a massive problem, with as many as 20 million people in this country who've brazenly broken the law.It involves human smuggling, collaborating with Mexico's monstrous drug and crime cartels, engaging in identity fraud, draining public services they never paid for, and undercutting Americans' wages in the workplace as they've taken jobs illegally, hitting the least-skilled U.S. workers particularly hard.To Obama, none of this matters. Only politics does. Those illegal immigrants aren't lawbreakers to him. They're vast troves of future Democratic voters.It's rank cynicism on every count.And it's why the unexpected and rather courageous lawsuit of those 10 ICE agents will ultimately come down to the hard reality for President Obama as he attempts to circumvent the law: In the end, the law matters.

""So-called"" is a necessary modifier because defensive stocks can sometimes act growthy — at least for a while. Growth investors shouldn't write off a potential investment based on reputation. It's always best to look at what a stock and its industry group are doing. The Food-Meat Products industry…

The others will get their turn.

2547,ICE,"Zealots, to whom 1964 is an ancient date somewhere near the last Ice Age, say that's because Romney was not purely conservative enough.

For now, their energies are directed at ""primarying"" alleged RINO's such as Sen. Lamar Alexander.

2548,ICE,"At the moment, some stars seem to be aligning for Christie. If he wins a landslide reelection in November in a Democrat state, he'll be an unofficial frontrunner. Next year he becomes chair of the Republican Governors Association. A good public platform.

2549,ICE,"For all of his troubles for holding Obama's hand so long after the hurricane last fall, Christie in well-received remarks to the Republican National Committee the other day derided political debating societies that parse fine ideological points. Like, say, the U.S. Senate.

2588,ICE,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) soared to an eight-year high Thursday on its second-quarter earnings beat. But its success isn't a barometer for other burger joints or eateries overall. Leading restaurant stocks are as varied as diners' tastes — and investors are just as finicky about food stocks as they are about what to eat.
"
2589,ICE,"The Retail-Restaurants group, at No. 38, still sits in the top fifth of the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. But it has trended lower from No. 10 just two months ago.
"
2590,ICE,"There's no common theme or trend linking the leading names. They run the gamut from fast-food to sit-down and from doughnuts to burritos. Among them: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Krispy Kreme Doughnuts (KKD), Starbucks (SBUX) and, perhaps after today's strong earnings results, Red Robin.
"
2591,ICE,"The Greenwood, Colo.-based casual restaurant chain reported Q2 profit of 77 cents a share, up 48% from last year and topping views by 11 cents. Revenue rose 7% to $238.3 million, in line with forecasts.
"
2592,ICE,"Comparable-store sales grew 4.3% for company-owned locations. Profit margins at those restaurants improved 220 basis points to 23.3%, helped by lower food and beverage costs.
"
2593,ICE,"That's coming off a tough Q1, in which EPS fell 7% on a 2% increase in sales. Analysts expect a 38% profit jump in Q3.

2594,ICE,"Shares were up 8% in afternoon trade to 61.29 on the stock market today.

2596,ICE,"The Relative Price Strength Rating is 92, and also will show a gain after Thursday's big move.
"
2597,ICE,"By comparison, McDonald's (MCD) has a 40 RS. Its EPS Rating is higher at 70, but the burger giant didn't fare as well in Q2, missing profit and sales forecasts in late July amid weak sales in Europe and China. It also warned of a rough patch ahead.
"
2598,ICE,"Chipotle also announced Q2 results last month, with EPS meeting and sales topping Wall Street estimates. Shares have been on the rebound after a steep April-October 2012 sell-off. The stock popped 9% July 19 on the report and has been holding near its highs since.
"
2599,ICE,"The Denver-based fast-casual chain scores a 94 EPS and 80 RS. Its Composite Rating, which combines key IBD ratings and stock-price action, is 98 — putting it in the top 2% of all stocks.
"
2600,ICE,"Krispy Kreme has come back a long way after recovering from a steep drop between its 2003 peak and early 2009 trough, as it fell victim to too-fast growth.
"
2601,ICE,"The doughnut seller has grown sales and profit the past three fiscal years. Analysts expect a 25% EPS jump to 15 cents and an 8% pickup in sales when Krispy Kreme reports Aug. 29.
"
2602,ICE,"It boasts IBD's highest-possible EPS and RS Ratings, at 99 for each, and earns a 98 Composite.

2622,ICE,"Ocwen Financial (OCN) has shown such explosive growth that some industry observers have speculated it might have nowhere to go but down.
"
2623,ICE,"Doubters figured the specialty mortgage servicer wouldn't get enough new mortgages to service to offset those running off its books.
"
2624,ICE,"But Ocwen insists it is anything but a ""melting ice cube,"" as Chairman William Erby told analysts Aug. 1 on the heels of a strong second-quarter report.
"
2625,ICE,"In that report, the firm said it has more than $400 billion in its current pipeline of potential new business opportunities. That was up from $375 billion it forecast at the end of March.
"
2626,ICE,"Management still thinks at least $1 trillion will be up for grabs over the next two to three years.
"
2627,ICE,"Investors took the company's commentary as a positive sign, sending shares up more than 7% that day to 51.11. A week later, shares hit an all-time high of 52.25.
"
2628,ICE,"Ocwen is the largest specialty mortgage servicing company in the U.S., focused on high-risk loans. Revenue has more than doubled in the last year alone as a string of wins from banks and other mortgage holders came onboard.
"
2629,ICE,"Ocwen gets fees for servicing loans and is adept at reducing delinquencies on nonprime loans, including those backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
"
2630,ICE,"Growing Portfolio
"
2631,ICE,"Its servicing portfolio has gone from $40 billion in 2009 to around $500 billion currently, says Piper Jaffray analyst Mike Grondahl.
"
2632,ICE,"""We think Ocwen's prospects are very strong,"" he said, adding that banks will keep selling mortgages to specialty servicers for at least two to three years.
"
2633,ICE,"For example, top residential mortgage servicer Wells Fargo (WFC) indicated in a recent conference call that it would likely return to selling mortgage servicing rights as early as the current quarter or the next quarter.
"
2634,ICE,"With $1.7 trillion in servicing rights, Wells has ""a big pool to pull from,"" Grondahl said. ""Ocwen can clearly get some of it.""
"
2635,ICE,"Because of Ocwen's deeper pipeline and Wells' coming transfers, the focus on Ocwen has ""shifted"" from whether it can offset the run-off of its portfolio ""to how much further can the servicing portfolio grow,"" analyst Kevin Barker wrote in an Aug. 7 research note.
"
2636,ICE,"Rising interest rates are also a positive for Ocwen, Grondahl says. That's because loans it services would less likely be refinanced and taken off its books.
"
2637,ICE,"The same goes for Ocwen's chief nonbank rivals Nationstar (NSM) and Walter Investment Management (WAC), both of which have also been showing strong gains over the last two years.
"
2638,ICE,"Two of Ocwen's biggest deals closed earlier this year, adding nearly $200 billion in mortgage servicing rights to its books. They were from Homeward Residential and Residential Capital, the mortgage unit of government-owned Ally Financial.
"
2639,ICE,"The integration of the two portfolios is going well, management said in its second-quarter report.
"
2640,ICE,"Revenue in the quarter jumped 151% to $530 million. But transition expenses and reserves added for a consumer-relief fund for a possible settlement with state and federal agencies impacted earnings, which rose 9% to 36 cents a share.
"
2641,ICE,"More business was added during the second quarter. About $87 billion in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage servicing rights were acquired from Ally.
"
2642,ICE,"Ocwen also acquired $8.3 billion in servicing rights from Greenpoint Mortgage in late June.
"
2643,ICE,"All of that more than offset the $10 billion of mortgage business that ran off in the second quarter.
"
2644,ICE,"And the firm expects to close on a total of $6 billion in bank-related subservicing business during the third quarter.
"
2645,ICE,"Ocwen also announced it would purchase $78 billion in servicing rights from OneWest Bank for $2.5 billion, to close in stages over the next several months. OneWest had bought assets of bankrupt IndyMac in 2009.
"
2646,ICE,"""There is a lot of new (bank) servicing that will be coming up by the end of the year,"" said analyst Henry Coffey of Sterne, Agee & Leach.
"
2647,ICE,"Ocwen's revenue is expected to hit nearly $2.2 billion this year, up from $845,000 in 2012 and $496,000 in 2011.
"
2648,ICE,"Earnings are seen rising 190% over last year to $4.23 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
"
2649,ICE,"Ocwen says it has the lowest operating costs in the industry in terms of servicing nonperforming loans, at $262 per nonperforming loan vs. the industry average of $877.
"
2650,ICE,"That's due in part to the scalability of its technology platform and large number of servicing employees who work offshore, where wages are lower.
"
2651,ICE,"Selling Continues
"
2652,ICE,"Banks will continue to sell off mortgage servicing rights to nonbank servicers because of stricter capital requirements, other banking regulations and the higher costs of servicing troubled loans, Grondahl says.
"
2653,ICE,"Jefferies' analyst Daniel Furtado said in a recent note that his team ""remain believers in the long-term thesis"" of banks shedding such assets.
"
2654,ICE,"""Given that the recent move higher in (interest) rates will drive banks to mark MSRs higher, capital pressure is only likely to increase"" to get them off their books, Furtado wrote.
"
2655,ICE,"As the housing market continues to strengthen, there will be fewer distressed loans for Ocwen to acquire, Grondahl acknowledges.
"
2656,ICE,"""But at some point the subprime cycle will start all over again,"" he said.
"
2657,ICE,"In the meantime, Grondahl says, banks will keep selling servicing rights for two or three more years at least.

We also asked how they would mark Obama's birthday. Leave your suggestions in the Comments below. Here are some favorites so far, that were also printable:@Brock2120 To honor Pres. Obama's birthday, I'm going to fail at something and blame it on the rich.@cbrown65 I'd close some Middle East embassies even though al Qaeda is decimated.@pgstreby I plan to spend the day quietly polishing my Nobel Peace Prize and being clear about false choices.

2727,ICE,"House Republicans, in their final days at work before taking a five-week vacation, have come out with a new agenda: ""Stop Government Abuse."" A more candid slogan might be: ""Stop Government.""
"
2728,ICE,"This is traditionally one of the busiest weeks of the year, when the House rushes to complete the dozen annual spending bills so that the Senate can pass them before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1. But there is no hurry this time.
"
2729,ICE,"Instead of taking the lead on spending bills as the House traditionally does, lawmakers are instead proceeding with bills such as one ""guaranteeing a citizen's right to record conversations with federal regulators.""

"
2733,ICE,"The budget and appropriations processes have been a mess in recent years under both parties' control, and there was no expectation this year would be different. But this time the slow walk serves conservatives' singular purpose of undermining ObamaCare.

2734,ICE,"Because the appropriations won't be completed by Oct. 1, Congress will have to pass a temporary extension, or ""continuing resolution.""

2837,ICE,"Big personalities don't have a lock on promotions. That quiet type can climb. How to make the most of your temperament:
"
2838,ICE,"• Peel back shells. A guarded exterior can hide strengths. So says Jennifer Kahnweiler, author of ""Quiet Influence."" One top trait is a heady approach. ""Introverts think things through,"" she said. They can honestly say: ""I am a great listener.""
"
2839,ICE,"• Come clean. Inhibited types can put off a mysterious vibe. One shy manager inspired downright paranoia. ""His whole team thought he was planning some nefarious scheme,"" Kahnweiler said.
"
2840,ICE,"Another supervisor who periodically closed her door discovered staffers were put off by her aloofness, until she explained: ""I'm just regrouping. It's nothing personal.""
"
2841,ICE,"• Warm up. To compensate for soft spots, like hesitance in meetings, timid types should prepare. ""Ask for the agenda ahead of time, or even write it,"" Kahnweiler said.
"
2842,ICE,"• Break the ice. ""Follow my first-five-minutes rule,"" Kahnweiler said, and speak up early. ""Get your voice in the room.""
"
2843,ICE,"• Try a gesture. Talked over by a vociferous colleague? Instead of fighting volume, ""put your hand up"" to quiet the interrupter, Kahnweiler suggested.
"
2844,ICE,"• Try different shoes. A word to the wise extrovert: ""Try stepping into the quiet side. Listen rather than talk,"" Kahnweiler said. Being well-rounded pays dividends at work. ""Introverts have been playing both sides for a long time"" by trying to act more outgoing.

"
2853,ICE,"If it's the latter, the ""fight"" against global warming has been a needless battle. The strategy in this war has been to curtail man's use of fossil fuels because they emit carbon dioxide, which as a greenhouse gas traps heat in the atmosphere. With CO2 levels rising, the alarmists have pushed hard to keep them in check.
"
2854,ICE,"But what if carbon concentrations didn't cause the warming we've seen since the end of the Little Ice Age? What if the proxy record viewed through the lens of ice cores indicated that higher levels of CO2 actually followed Earth's natural warming?

It was recently revisited by academic Murry Salby, who pushed it ahead during a talk in Germany in the middle of April.
"
2856,ICE,"Salby is no crank. He's a climate scientist at Macquarie University in Sydney and has written a number of books, including the text ""Physics of the Atmosphere and Climate."" His works are scholarly publications, not political screeds.

2857,ICE,"Salby has been making this same argument for years. In 2011 he called attention to his research that found then, as now, that ""in the real world, global temperature is not controlled exclusively by CO2, as it is in the model world."" In fact, he says, ""in significant part CO2 is controlled by global temperature, as it is in the proxy record.""
"
2858,ICE,"Salby has also had something to say about the global warming models that have been predicting CO2-induced heating — if their conclusions differ from observations, then they're wrong — and today's studies on CO2 — it's a ""cult science.""

2861,ICE,"According to Bloomberg News, this change in the government's accounting ""could have wide-ranging implications for everything from power plants to the Keystone XL pipeline.""

But as last week's passing of Richard Ramirez reminded us, that's far from the case in California.Ramirez was better known as ""The Night Stalker"" — the fiend who raped, tortured and butchered his way through Southern California in the long, hot summer of 1985.He was the crack-smoking, devil-worshipping drifter who gained entrance to suburban homes through windows and sliding glass doors left open to beat the 100-degree heat to terrorize the innocents inside for no reason other than he knew he was ""evil"" since he was nine.The 25-year-old monster beat a 16-year-old girl with a tire iron, shot a woman's fiance and then made her swear allegiance to Satan, used another victim's lipstick to draw a pentagram on her thigh, gouged the eyes out of a 44-year-old woman after stabbing her and her husband to death, and sodomized an 8-year-old boy who witnessed the shooting death of his father and the rape of his mother at gun point.He was a walking nightmare who held Southern Californians captive for months behind newly locked doors and bolted windows, who drove up sales of guns, security systems and air-conditioning systems, who even scared some people into painting their houses on rumors he favored yellow ones near freeways.It was this man who, after being arrested Aug. 30, 1985, and convicted four years later of 13 murders and 30 other felonies, as well as 19 special circumstances that made him eligible for the death penalty, died peaceably ""of natural causes"" at a hospital near San Quentin prison last Friday morning.He was 53 and had lived on San Quentin's death row for 24 years. Twenty-four years! But he's not alone. Only 13 condemned convicts have been put to death since the state resumed executions in 1992 while more than 700 others continue to get free room and board. Eighty-four have, like Ramirez, died of natural causes.Yes, we've heard the rationales for letting the Ramirezes live out their lives behind bars, including our favorite — that it costs more, not less, to execute them when all the legal appeals are taken into account.But that doesn't cut much ice with us or most Californians, who voted again last year to keep the death penalty in force. We're with Gilbert Vargas, a 70-year-old eyewitness to Ramirez's capture in the streets of East Los Angeles. ""He in jail. He's a killer. Not fair. No good. I don't understand the laws. The law is no good.""

2891,ICE,"Climate Hysteria: The unraveling of the global warming scare continues thanks to several recent important pieces of science news. The alarmists who have hyped fear for decades should be ashamed of themselves.We begin with an analysis of ice cores taken from the Arctic. The samples, according to Scientific American, ""show this region used to be a lot warmer — and may thaw out again in the future.""The sediment recovered by researchers dates ""back to the lake's formation 3.6 million years ago"" and indicates ""that back then summers reached about 15 to 16 degrees Celsius, a good 8 degrees warmer than modern Arctic summers.""""These warm temperatures, which supported plants like Douglas fir and hemlock, lasted until about 2.2 million years ago.""We believe we can state with a high degree of certainty that 3.6 million years ago there were no cars belching greenhouse gases and no power plants emitting carbon dioxide.So why is the warming that Earth has been going through as it exited the Little Ice Age blamed on man?Could it be possible that today's global temperatures — which, by the way, haven't increased over the last 16 years — could be entirely natural and largely unaffected by human activity? On Monday, the BBC noted with some surprise this ""unexplained 'standstill' in the heating of Earth's atmosphere"" and cited a new scientific paper in which ""researchers say this will reduce predicted warming.""It quoted one researcher saying that the ""most extreme projections are looking less likely than before.""It must have pained the BBC, which has done its part to ring loudly the global warming alarm, to report that the study's ""authors calculate that over the coming decades global average temperatures will warm about 20% more slowly than expected."" The second piece of significant news is the admission that previous predictions of ice melt and sea-level rise were exaggerated.Rather than the oceans swelling 80 inches by 2100, which is a number used by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the likely maximum increase will be 27 inches.This fits in with the revisions we reported earlier this month. Predictions of sea-level rise by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have fallen from a range of 11.8 inches to 39.4 inches by 2100, to 3.5 inches to 34.6 inches, to, most recently, 7.1 inches and 23.2 inches. In a related story — our third point that isn't necessarily new, as it was first reported in 2010 — it turns out that rather than shrinking, many low-lying Pacific islands are actually growing.""Islands in Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia are among those which have grown, largely due to coral debris, land reclamation and sediment,"" the Australian Broadcasting Company said three years ago.A researcher from Auckland University said 80% ""of the islands we've looked at have either remained about the same or, in fact, gotten larger."" Some have grown by 20% to 30%. The evidence tells scientists that ""the physical foundations of these islands will still be there in 100 years.""These findings, says Australia's ABC, have been a surprise to climate scientists.Yes, we imagine so, because it was climate scientists who warned that rising oceans caused by global warming would swamp these small islands. Fourth, is a study published Thursday in Science Express that determined that sea level is impacted by the Earth's mantle. Livescience.com explains that ""scientists have to be careful when looking at Earth for evidence of past sea level changes from the planet's cycles of glacial advance and retreat.""We're not scientists, but it's clear from this study that activity beneath Earth's crust can have an impact on future sea level changes independent of melting. Finally, there's the latest admission about the climate's sensitivity to carbon dioxide.What we're talking about is the climate's warming response to increases in CO2 concentrations over pre-industrial levels.In citing a new study, the New York Times reported last week that carbon concentrations might have to triple or quadruple before any of the global warming catastrophes that have been predicted actually occur.It's our hope that in five years we won't be talking about the climate change issue because the entire global warming axis will have been disbanded due to its shrinking credibility. Then maybe the alarmists can bring themselves to apologize for the decades of public disservice they have provided another five years after that.

3006,ICE,"Federal Power: Homeland Security's procurement officer is grilled in Congress on why federal agents who rarely fire weapons need several times more bullets annually than an Army officer. Who or what are they shooting at?
"
3007,ICE,"Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz on Thursday asked Nick Nayak, DHS' chief procurement officer, a question we and others have been asking: Why has the Department of Homeland Security been buying so much ammunition?
"
3008,ICE,"Dismissed as a concern only of right-wing conspiracy theorists, the reported amounts as high as 2 billion rounds have varied and been explained not as a one-time purchase but a bulk buy over five years to reduce costs. It's one of the rare instances, apparently, a government agency has actually cared about such a thing.
"
3009,ICE,"Nayak appeared before Chaffetz's House oversight subcommittee to do what Obama administration officials are loath to do the actual math. Chaffetz has, and his number-crunching raises more questions than DHS has answered to date.
"
3010,ICE,"Chaffetz noted that the department currently has more than 260 million rounds in stock. He said the department bought more than 103 million rounds in 2012 and used 116 million that same year among roughly 70,000 agents.
"
3011,ICE,"Comparing that with the small-arms purchases by the U.S. Army, he said the DHS is churning through between 1,300 and 1,600 rounds per officer per year, while the Army goes through roughly 350 per officer.
"
3012,ICE,"Nayak, acknowledging that the five-tear potential bullet buy could be as high as 750 million rounds, did not contest Chaffetz's math and said the massive buys were needed for training. DHS has procured ""approximately 120 million rounds of ammunition per year of all calibers and types and fired approximately the same number of rounds per year, almost exclusively for training purposes,"" according to Nayak's testimony.
"
3013,ICE,"""What does not make sense in the information you provided is that Customs and Border Control used (around 14 million) rounds for operational purposes when they rarely fire their guns,"" a skeptical Chaffetz said, citing just one example of a particular allocation.
"
3014,ICE,"Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which falls under DHS's jurisdiction, fired ""less than 100 rounds"" during 15 shooting incidents last year, according to Humberto Medina, assistant director of ICE's' National Firearm and Tactical Training Unit. By this criterion, the DHS stockpile should last a very long time.
"
3015,ICE,"Jonathan L. Lasher, the Social Security Administration's assistant inspector general for external relations, has previously explained the purchase of 174,000 hollow-point bullets by saying they were for the Social Security inspector general's office.
"
3016,ICE,"Its 295 agents investigate Social Security fraud and other crimes. When they say they are cracking down on waste, fraud and abuse, they apparently mean it.
"
3017,ICE,"Another question is why so many hollow-point bullets are being purchased?
"
3018,ICE,"As former Marine Richard Mason recently told reporters with WHPTV News in Pennsylvania, hollow-points (which make up the bulk of the DHS purchases) are not used for training because they are more expensive than standard firing-range rounds. ""We never trained with hollow points. We didn't even see hollow points my entire 4-1/2 (years) in the Marine Corps,"" Mason said.
"
3019,ICE,"We'd like to think this is just another example of government waste. Some have suggested these massive ammunition buys are an attempt to dry up supply as part of the administration's push for gun control.
"
3020,ICE,"We have asked if this has anything to do with then-candidate Obama's proposal for a national security force as powerful as the U.S. Army.
"
3021,ICE,"In a July 2, 2008 speech in Colorado Springs, candidate Obama said: ""We cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.""

3022,ICE,"The government that would limit law-abiding citizens to some seven bullets to defend their families and their homes still has some explaining to do.Federal Power: Homeland Security's procurement officer is grilled in Congress on why federal agents who rarely fire weapons need several times more bullets annually than an Army officer.

DHS has procured ""approximately 120 million rounds of ammunition per year of all calibers and types and fired approximately the same number of rounds per year, almost exclusively for training purposes,"" according to Nayak's testimony.""What does not make sense in the information you provided is that Customs and Border Control used (around 14 million) rounds for operational purposes when they rarely fire their guns,"" a skeptical Chaffetz said, citing just one example of a particular allocation.Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which falls under DHS's jurisdiction, fired ""less than 100 rounds"" during 15 shooting incidents last year, according to Humberto Medina, assistant director of ICE's' National Firearm and Tactical Training Unit. By this criterion, the DHS stockpile should last a very long time.Jonathan L. Lasher, the Social Security Administration's assistant inspector general for external relations, has previously explained the purchase of 174,000 hollow-point bullets by saying they were for the Social Security inspector general's office.Its 295 agents investigate Social Security fraud and other crimes. When they say they are cracking down on waste, fraud and abuse, they apparently mean it.Another question is why so many hollow-point bullets are being purchased?As former Marine Richard Mason recently told reporters with WHPTV News in Pennsylvania, hollow-points (which make up the bulk of the DHS purchases) are not used for training because they are more expensive than standard firing-range rounds. ""We never trained with hollow points. We didn't even see hollow points my entire 4-1/2 (years) in the Marine Corps,"" Mason said.We'd like to think this is just another example of government waste. Some have suggested these massive ammunition buys are an attempt to dry up supply as part of the administration's push for gun control.We have asked if this has anything to do with then-candidate Obama's proposal for a national security force as powerful as the U.S. Army.In a July 2, 2008 speech in Colorado Springs, candidate Obama said: ""We cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.""The government that would limit law-abiding citizens to some seven bullets to defend their families and their homes still has some explaining to do.

3059,ICE,"Budget: Even before sequestration hits, the administration has been releasing hundreds of illegal aliens scheduled for deportation, jeopardizing public safety in a demagogic attempt to scare us into not cutting spending.'I'm appalled to learn the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has begun to release hundreds of illegal aliens from custody, the first of potentially thousands to soon be freed under the guise of federal budget cuts,"" said Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on Tuesday in response to the release by Immigration and Customs Enforcement of hundreds of ""low-risk"" illegal aliens from detention.Well, so are we.We are appalled at the bogus warnings that our food supply will be tainted, our transportation security jeopardized and the like by slowing the rate of growth by the federal behemoth by a paltry $85 billion.And now this — the release of criminal illegal aliens before sequestration even happens is a cynical and unnecessary political ploy. In Pinal County, 70 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border, Sheriff Paul Babeau told Newsmax, the release of hundreds of detainees over the weekend was ""outrageous and unacceptable, because there's a direct and immediate impact to public safety of families in my county.""Babeau noted: ""These are criminal illegals. They were headed for deportation — but now, they have received a budget pardon.""An ICE spokesman said the detainees selected for release were ""noncriminals and other low-risk offenders who do not have serious criminal histories.""Well, that depends on how you define ""low risk"" and ""serious."" We view all crime as serious and law enforcement and border security as an essential, not optional, function of government.""It's abhorrent that President Obama is releasing criminals into our communities to promote his political agenda on sequestration,"" said Rep. Robert Goodlatte of Virginia, who, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is running the House hearings on immigration reform. ""By releasing criminal immigrants on to the streets, the administration is needlessly endangering American lives.""""We're doing our very best to minimize the impacts of sequester. But there's only so much I can do,"" DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano said. ""I'm supposed to have 34,000 detention beds for immigration. How do I pay for those?""Considering ICE only has to reduce expenditures by 5.3% and that it had months to prepare, a better question to ask is why efficiency has to come at the expense of public safety?ICE officials say only 303 were initially released, but a spokesman for Babeau told FoxNews.com that ICE officials have said they plan to release a total of nearly 10,000 illegal immigrants.This strikes as a kind of domestic Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro emptied his jails and institutions of undesirables as part of the 1980 mass exodus from Cuba.This move is a way of further appeasing amnesty and open-border advocates using sequestration as political cover.""It is clear the administration is using the (budget cuts known as sequestration) as a convenient excuse to bow to political pressure from the amnesty groups, as it did with its unilateral decision to confer legal status on millions who are not lawfully present,"" said Jeff Sessions R-Ala.Some 7,283 deportable illegal aliens who were released between 2008 and mid-2011 were later charged with 16,226 subsequent crimes, including 19 murders, 142 sex crimes, such as rape or child molestation, and thousands of drunk-driving offenses, drug crimes and felonies, according to a recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.Sequestration, which President Obama designed and signed into law, has allowed the administration to continue and expand a policy of open borders and amnesty that wins political support at the price of public safety.

3061,ICE,"Scandal: In a new low for Obama corruption, AP reports that the Homeland Security Department ""several times"" protected a Democratic senator's registered sex criminal aide from arrest before November's election.The scandal that broke Wednesday — reported by the Associated Press' Alicia Caldwell — may be impossible for the press to sweep under the Oval Office rug.Caldwell found that Luis Abrahan Sanchez Zavaleta, an 18-year-old Peruvian illegal alien employed as an unpaid intern in one of the offices of Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., is a registered sex offender:""The Homeland Security Department instructed federal agents not to arrest him until after Election Day, a U.S. official involved in the case told the AP.""Sanchez was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on Dec. 6, two federal officials told the AP, and he remains in custody.A Homeland Security spokesman told AP on Wednesday it was ""categorically false"" that the department delayed Sanchez's arrest until after the election. But Caldwell's account of the bureaucratic machinations screams out for a congressional investigation.Local New Jersey officials ""notified ICE agents in early October that they suspected Sanchez was an illegal immigrant who was a registered sex offender and who may be eligible to be deported,"" AP's Caldwell reported. ""ICE agents in New Jersey notified superiors at the Homeland Security Department because they considered it a potentially high profile arrest, and DHS instructed them not to arrest Sanchez until after the November election, one U.S. official told the AP.""According to the AP, ""ICE officials complained that the delay was inappropriate, but DHS directed them several times not to act, the official said.""What reason can there be other than saving two powerful Democrats — Menendez and President Obama — from embarrassment as they faced re-election?Menendez's communications chief late on Wednesday e-mailed the alibi that ""No staff member responsible for managing the internship program had reason to believe, based on their interview process, that Sanchez had any criminal background or immigration issues.""Would that explanation wash for a private-sector employer who hired an illegal alien/sex offender? Fat chance. He or she would be lucky to avoid jail.Menendez, a champion of open-door immigration, blamed the law for being so anti-immigrant that ""I can't know who is here to pursue the American dream vs. who is here to do it damage.""Blindsided by, of all media outlets, the left-wing MSNBC on Wednesday afternoon, Menendez claimed, ""there's no way we could know about his status.""But Menendez's incompetence is a sideshow. Obama is seriously considering Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to replace Eric Holder, the attorney general responsible for Fast and Furious and for ignoring Black Panther voter intimidation in Philadelphia.A cabinet official who protected a known sex offender for purposes of ensuring the re-election of both a president and a U.S. senator has no business breathing the same air as the top law enforcement official of the U.S., let alone to be appointed to that office.The Obama campaign proved its willingness to slander its GOP presidential opponent as a felon, and even a murderer, to get the president re-elected.Now, apparently, an Obama cabinet department let a sex criminal roam the streets just to ensure re-election of both the president and a liberal Democratic senator.It's been said that, unlike Benghazi and Fast and Furious, ""nobody died in Watergate.""

3065,ICE,"Environment: The global warming alarmists repeat the line endlessly. They claim that there is a consensus among scientists that man is causing climate change. Fact is, they're not even close.Yes, many climate scientists believe that emissions of greenhouse gases are heating the earth. Of course there are some who don't.But when confining the question to geoscientists and engineers, it turns out that only 36% believe that human activities are causing Earth's climate to warm.This is the finding of the peer-reviewed paper ""Science or Science Fiction? Professionals' Discursive Construction of Climate Change"" and this group is categorized as the ""Comply with Kyoto"" cohort.Members of this group, not unexpectedly, ""express the strong belief that climate change is happening, that it is not a normal cycle of nature, and humans are the main or central cause.""Academics Lianne M. Lefsrud of the University of Alberta and Renate E. Meyer of Vienna University of Economics and Business, and the Copenhagen Business School, came upon that number through a survey of 1,077 professional engineers and geoscientists.Their work also revealed that 24% ""believe that changes to the climate are natural, normal cycles of the earth"" while another 10% consider the ""'real' cause of climate change"" to be ""unknown"" and acknowledge that ""nature is forever changing and uncontrollable.""The 10% group, known as the ""Economic Responsibility"" cohort, expresses ""much stronger and more negative emotions than any other group, especially that climate science is a fraud and hoax and that regulation is futile, useless, and impossible.""The 24% group, tagged as the ""Nature is Overwhelming"" faction, is the ""most likely to speak against climate science as being science fiction, 'manipulated and fraudulent'"" and is ""least likely to believe that the scientific debate is settled, that IPCC modeling is accurate.""The researchers also found a group they call the ""Fatalists"" — the 17% who ""diagnose climate change as both human- and naturally caused,"" ""consider climate change to be a smaller public risk with little impact on their personal life"" and ""are skeptical that the scientific debate is settled regarding the IPCC modeling.""Lefsrud and Meyer also note that ""skepticism regarding anthropogenic climate change remains"" among climate scientists. They mention, as well, that ""the proportion of papers found in the ISI Web of Science database that explicitly endorsed anthropogenic climate change has fallen from 75% (for the period between 1993 and 2003) as of 2004 to 45% from 2004 to 2008, while outright disagreement has risen from 0% to 6%.""If the alarmists are getting only limited cooperation from man, they are getting even less from nature itself. Arctic sea ice, which sent the green shirts into a lather when it hit a record low in the summer of 2012, has ""with a few weeks of growth still to occur ... blown away the previous record for ice gain this winter.""""This is only the third winter in history,"" when more than 10 million square kilometers of new ice has formed in the Arctic, Real Science reported on Tuesday, using data from Arctic Climate Research at the University of Illinois.At the same time, the Antarctic ""is now approaching 450 days of uninterrupted above normal ice area,"" says the skeptical website Watts Up With That, which, also using University of Illinois Arctic Climate Research data, notes that ""the last time the Antarctic sea ice was below normal"" was Nov. 22, 2011.This is all illuminating information. But it won't get the same media attention given to Al Gore and the usual assortment of eco-radicals, because it violates the narrative that our selfish activities are warming this planet.It is consistent, however, with what most people call common sense.

3086,ICE,"Sermon at the Funeral of Baroness Margaret Hilda Thatcher by Bishop Richard Chartres
"
3087,ICE,"After the storm of a life lived in the heat of political controversy, there is a great calm. 
"
3088,ICE,"The storm of conflicting opinions centres on the Mrs Thatcher who became a symbolic figure — even an “ism”. Today the remains of the real Margaret Hilda Thatcher are here at her funeral service. Lying here, she is one of us, subject to the common destiny of all human beings. 
"
3089,ICE,"There is an important place for debating policies and legacy; for assessing the impact of political decisions on the everyday lives of individuals and communities. Parliament held a frank debate last week — but here and today is neither the time nor the place. 
"
3090,ICE,"This, at Lady Thatcher’s personal request, is a funeral service, not a Memorial Service with the customary eulogies. At such a time, the parson should not aspire to the judgments which are proper to the politician; instead, this is a place for ordinary human compassion of the kind that is reconciling. 
"
3091,ICE,"It is also the place for the simple truths which transcend political debate. Above all it is the place for hope. 
"
3092,ICE,"But it must be difficult for those members of her family and close associates to recognise the wife, mother and grandmother in the mythological figure. Our hearts go out to Mark and Carol and their families, and also to those who cared for Lady Thatcher with such devotion in her last years. 
"
3093,ICE,"One thing that everyone has noted is the courtesy and personal kindness which she showed to those who worked for her, as well as her capacity to reach out to the young, and often also to those who were not, in the world’s eyes, “important”. 
"
3094,ICE,"The letter from a young boy early on in her time as Prime Minister is a typical example. Nine year old David wrote to say, “Last night when we were saying prayers, my daddy said everyone has done wrong things except Jesus. I said I don’t think you have done bad things because you are the Prime Minister. Am I right or is my daddy?” 
"
3095,ICE,"Perhaps the most remarkable thing is that the PM replied in her own hand in a very straightforward letter which took the question seriously. 
"
3096,ICE,"“However good we try to be, we can never be as kind, gentle and wise as Jesus. There will be times when we do or say something we wish we hadn’t done and we shall be sorry and try not to do it again. … If you and I were to paint a picture, it wouldn’t be as good as the picture of great artists. So our lives can’t be as good as the life of Jesus.”
"
3097,ICE,"She was always reaching out and trying to help in typically un-coded terms. I was once sitting next to her at some City function. In the midst of describing how Hayek’s 'Road to Serfdom' had influenced her thinking, she suddenly grasped my wrist and said very emphatically, “Don’t touch the duck paté, Bishop — it’s very fattening.”
"
3098,ICE,"She described her own religious upbringing in a lecture she gave in the nearby church of St Lawrence Jewry. “We often went to church twice on Sundays, as well as on other occasions during the week … We were taught always to make up our own minds and never take the easy way of following the crowd.” 
"
3099,ICE,"Her upbringing was in the Methodism to which this country owes a huge debt. When it was time to challenge the political and economic status quo in nineteenth century Britain, it was so often the Methodists who took the lead. The Tolpuddle Martyrs, for example, were led not by proto-Marxists but by Methodist lay preachers.
"
3100,ICE,"Today’s first lesson describes the struggle with the principalities and powers. Perseverance in struggle and the courage to be were characteristic of Margaret Thatcher. 
"
3101,ICE,"In a setting like this, in the presence of the leaders of....
"
3102,ICE,"....the nation, it is easy to forget the immense hurdles she had to climb. Beginning in the upper floors of her father’s grocer’s shop in Grantham, through Oxford as a scientist and, later, as part of the team that invented Mr Whippy ice cream, she embarked upon a political career. 
"
3103,ICE,"By the time she entered Parliament in 1959 she was part of a cohort of only 4% of women in the House of Commons. She had experienced many rebuffs along the way, often on the shortlist for candidates only to be disqualified by prejudice against a woman — and, worse, a woman with children. She applied herself to her work with formidable energy and passion. But she continued to reflect on how faith and politics related to one another.
"
3104,ICE,"In the Lawrence Jewry lecture she said that, “Christianity offers no easy solutions to political and economic issues. It teaches us that there is some evil in everyone and that it cannot be banished by sound policies and institutional reforms … We cannot achieve a compassionate society simply by passing new laws and appointing more staff to administer them.” 
"
3105,ICE,"She was very aware that there are prior dispositions which are needed to make market economics and democratic institutions function well: the habits of truth-telling, mutual sympathy, and the capacity to cooperate. These dispositions are incubated and given power by our relationships. 
"
3106,ICE,"In her words, “the basic ties of the family are at the heart of our society and are the very nursery of civic virtue”. Such moral and spiritual capital is accumulated over generations but can be easily eroded.
"
3107,ICE,"Life is a struggle to make the right choices and to achieve liberation from dependence, whether material or psychological. This genuine independence is the essential pre-condition for living in an other-centred way, beyond ourselves. The word Margaret Thatcher used at St Lawrence Jewry was “interdependence”.
"
3108,ICE,"She referred to the Christian doctrine, “that we are all members one of another, expressed in the concept of the Church on earth as the Body of Christ. From this we learn our interdependence and the great truth that we do not achieve happiness or salvation in isolation from each other but as members of Society.” 
"
3109,ICE,"Her later remark about there being no such thing as “society” has been misunderstood and refers to some impersonal entity to which we are tempted to surrender our independence. 
"
3110,ICE,"It is entirely right that in the Dean’s bidding there was a reference to “the life-long companionship she enjoyed with Denis.” As we all know, the manner of her leaving office was traumatic but the loss of Denis was a grievous blow indeed, and then there was a struggle with increasing debility from which she has now been liberated. 
"
3111,ICE,"The natural cycle leads inevitably to decay, but the dominant note of a Christian funeral service, after the sorrow and the memories, is hope. 
"
3112,ICE,"It is almost as perplexing to identify the “real me” in life as it is in death. The atoms that make up our bodies are changing all the time, through wear and tear, eating and drinking. We are atomically distinct from what we were when young. 
"
3113,ICE,"What unites Margaret Roberts of Grantham with Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven and constitutes her identity? The complex pattern of memories, aspirations and actions which make up a character were carried for a time by the atoms of her body, but we believe are also stored up in the Cloud of God’s being. 
"
3114,ICE,"In faithful relationships, when two people live together, they grow around one another and the one becomes part of the other. We are given the freedom to be ourselves and, as human beings, to be drawn freely into an ever closer relationship with the divine nature. 
"
3115,ICE,"Everything which has turned to love in our lives will be stored up in the memory of God. First there is the struggle for freedom and independence and then the self-giving and the acceptance of inter-dependence. 
"
3116,ICE,"In the gospel passage read by the Prime Minister, Jesus says “I am the way, the truth, and the life”. “I am” is the voice of the divine being. Jesus does not bring information or advice but embodies the reality of divine love. God so loved the world that he was generous: he did not intervene from the outside but gave himself to us in the person of Jesus Christ, and became one of us. 
"
3117,ICE,"What, in the end, makes our lives seem valuable after the storm and stress has passed and there is a great calm? The questions most frequently asked at such a time concern us all. How loving have I been? how faithful in personal relationships? Have I found joy within myself, or am I still looking for it in externals outside myself? 
"
3118,ICE,"Margaret Thatcher had a sense of this, which she expressed in her address to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland: “I leave you with the earnest hope that may we all come nearer to that other country whose ‘ways are ways of gentleness and all her paths are peace’.” 
"
3119,ICE,"TS Eliot, in the poem quoted in this service sheet, says,

3126,ICE,"This item has been edited to correct a reference to the funeral timing.
"
3127,ICE,"Britain staged the funeral of former British Prime Minister and staunch American ally Margaret Thatcher the other day. It contained almost all the pomp and circumstance you'd expect from the Brits.They skipped the RAF flyover at the request of Thatcher, a conservative thrift even in death. We wrote here about that impressive day, including its regrettably classless dismissal by America's highest-ranking South Sider. It's as if Obama already knows and resents how much more she accomplished as a leader from the front than he can ever dream of from his chosen position behind.You can watch the entire Thatcher funeral video here. And we have another one below too. As the baroness' remains were being cremated Wednesday, the Marathon Finish Line bombings in Boston were completely distracting this country.Now that the threat of these lethal culprits is over, we wanted to devote a few quiet minutes on this Sunday to ruminate over something that struck us about the Thatcher funeral. British pageantry aside, we were quite taken by the language in general of the service--the music, hymns and gospel--in the exquisite 17th-century St. Paul's Cathedral of Sir Christopher Wren.And more specifically by the sermon of Bishop Richard Chartres. He has a richly-deserved reputation for elocution, diction and simplicity/clarity of presentation. Perhaps you recall his address on marriage to William and Kate at their royal wedding almost exactly two years ago. He offered such insights and lessons about this lasting and recently controversial institution in just a few short minutes.And then there's his British accent. With Chartres peering over his Santa Claus spectacles from the ancient pulpit, we could listen long to this gentleman read the fine print on grocery coupons, so rich, rapturous and precise is his voice, vocabulary, thinking and timing. He certainly exceeds any of the American political blabber you can find by clicking on ""Text"" in the word cloud to the right here.Baroness Thatcher is fondly, even gauzily, remembered by many Americans. But in Britain she was a polarizing figure, so distinct were her goals and driven were the methods of Thatcherism. She had requested that her friend the bishop give the sermon. He chose to combine history, honesty, affection, pain, conflict and humor. Or humour, if you're reading this in British.Bishop Chartres certainly lived up to his charge. Here's Chartres' very first sentence: ""After the storm of a life lived in the heat of political controversy, there is a great calm."" And there was in his ensuing pause, a great calm in that historic church at that moment.Chartres continued:""The storm of conflicting opinions centres on the Mrs Thatcher who became a symbolic figure—even an 'ism'. Today the remains of the real Margaret Hilda Thatcher are here at her funeral service. Lying here, she is one of us, subject to the common destiny of all human beings. ""There is an important place for debating policies and legacy; for assessing the impact of political decisions on the everyday lives of individuals and communities.

We are atomically distinct from what we were when young. What unites Margaret Roberts of Grantham with Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven and constitutes her identity? The complex pattern of memories, aspirations and actions which make up a character were carried for a time by the atoms of her body, but we believe are also stored up in the Cloud of God’s being. In faithful relationships, when two people live together, they grow around one another and the one becomes part of the other. We are given the freedom to be ourselves and, as human beings, to be drawn freely into an ever closer relationship with the divine nature. Everything which has turned to love in our lives will be stored up in the memory of God. First there is the struggle for freedom and independence and then the self-giving and the acceptance of inter-dependence. In the gospel passage read by the Prime Minister, Jesus says “I am the way, the truth, and the life”. “I am” is the voice of the divine being. Jesus does not bring information or advice but embodies the reality of divine love. God so loved the world that he was generous: he did not intervene from the outside but gave himself to us in the person of Jesus Christ, and became one of us. What, in the end, makes our lives seem valuable after the storm and stress has passed and there is a great calm? The questions most frequently asked at such a time concern us all. How loving have I been? how faithful in personal relationships? Have I found joy within myself, or am I still looking for it in externals outside myself? Margaret Thatcher had a sense of this, which she expressed in her address to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland: “I leave you with the earnest hope that may we all come nearer to that other country whose ‘ways are ways of gentleness and all her paths are peace’.” TS Eliot, in the poem quoted in this service sheet, says, ‘the communication Of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living.’In this Easter season Death is revealed, not as a full stop but as the way into another dimension of Life.As Eliot puts it: “What we call the beginning is often the end And to make an end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from.” Rest eternal grant unto her O Lord and let light perpetual shine upon her. This item has been edited to correct a reference to the funeral timing.

3178,ICE,"Budget: Over a hundred jobs are at Homeland Security, which is letting criminal aliens go despite billions unspent from last fiscal year, with hundreds more jobs available at an Interior Department that warns of park closings.'We're doing our very best to minimize the impacts of sequester. But there's only so much I can do,"" DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano said.With regard to the release of illegal aliens from detention in anticipation of cuts due to sequestration, ""I'm supposed to have 34,000 detention beds for immigration. How do I pay for those?""Well, Madam Secretary, like other federal departments and agencies that have offered apocalyptic scenarios of tainted food and grounded planes, you can simply stop advertising and hiring new employees, while not replacing those who leave or quit.It's a money-saving process common in the business world. It's called attrition.A search of the USA Jobs federal employment website by Pajamas Media, filtered for positions in the U.S. and posted over the past 10 days, yielded 2,596 results, a staggering number of proposed new hires by an administration that halts White House tours that cost less money over a year than one presidential vacation.The Agriculture Department is looking to fill such critical positions as a recreation forestry technician in Sedona, Ariz., a dairy grader in Winnsboro, Texas, an archaeologist in McCall, Idaho, among 115 jobs the cash-strapped department has posted since sequestration began.Yet, the Agriculture Department had warned of Americans falling ill from tainted food due to short staffing should sequestration go into effect.The Department of Veterans Affairs, which has warned of homeless vets being dumped onto the streets, has advertised for 905 new well-paying jobs.The Department of the Interior, which continues to buy more land instead of selling or leasing the federal government's energy-rich holdings, has advertised 115 new posts since sequestration began — even as it threatens to close Yosemite and other national parks.Then there's the beleaguered Department of Homeland Security, which has advertised for 107 positions despite warnings of cutbacks that would result in everything from longer security lines at airports to the freeing of illegal immigrant detainees.DHS began releasing hundreds of detainees with criminal records even before sequestration began. Thousands are scheduled for release in the near future despite DHS having an unspent balance of $8 billion left from the end of FY 2012, and that the Office of Management and Budget projected a $9 billion surplus for the agency by the end of 2013.As the Center for Immigration Studies reports, the DHS action came despite only 30,773 out of 34,000 budgeted detention beds being occupied, which is about 9.5% below capacity.All the beds have already been paid for. Funding for detention space is determined by Congress through the appropriations process, and ICE is required by law to use all the resources provided for this purpose.The DHS asserts that detainees unnecessarily released as it advertises for new hires are ""low-risk."" In fact, these detainees are the worst of the worst, or they wouldn't be detained in the first place.Some of those let out may be like Huang Chen, a Chinese citizen who slipped into America on a ship and stayed in the country illegally.He was supposed to be deported as soon as he got out of jail for choking, punching, and pointing a knife at a woman in 2006.After jailing Chen on and off for three years in Texas, immigration officials freed him rather than deporting him. He began to stalk the same woman he had assaulted, finally killing her and mutilating her body in 2010.If agencies like DHS and ICE can't keep the Chens of the world detained, why are they still hiring more bureaucrats?

3179,ICE,"Diplomacy: After a reprieve from international regulation of our guns, another sovereignty-grabbing U.N. treaty, a pet project of our secretary of state, is still being pushed to declare the oceans the common heritage of mankind.In the pre-dawn hours last Saturday, the U.S. Senate approved by 53-46 a measure ""to uphold Second Amendment rights and prevent the United States from entering into the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty.""But a seemingly harmless cousin, the Law of the Sea Treaty (LOST), remains on the table, with its champion, former Sen. John Kerry, now our secretary of state.Kerry gave a speech at the Ross Sea Conservation Reception on March 19 in which he suggested that we should have called our planet Ocean rather than Earth. During that speech, he put forth a global environmental agenda centered around the oceans that he has made a priority in his career.In an Op-Ed for Politico last May titled ""Joining Law of the Sea Treaty Can't Wait,"" Kerry claimed, falsely, that we needed LOST to safeguard our freedom of the seas, settle maritime territorial disputes, safeguard our access to ocean resources, and, most importantly in his view, protect the oceans from being a casualty of climate change.At the Ross conference he spoke of an existing ""energy policy that results in acidification, the bleaching of coral, the destruction of species, the change in the Arctic because of the ice melt, and the change in the krill, the population of whales. The entire system is interdependent, and we toy with that at our peril.""Under LOST, any economic activity, even those on land, that threatens the sanctity of the oceans through what are deemed excessive greenhouse gas emissions would be subject to international approval similar to the ""global test"" then-Sen. Kerry said all our actions should be subject to.That would include the Keystone XL pipeline environmentalists object to.Unfortunately many who should know better, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to past and present naval leaders, have embraced LOST.Far from guaranteeing access to ocean resources, LOST regulates and taxes that access.Our Navy would be reduced from going where it wants, to asking an international body for permission.LOST establishes an International Seabed Authority (ISA) that would have the power to regulate 70% of the earth's surface, placing seabed mining, fishing rights, deep-sea oil exploration, and even the activities of the U.S. Navy under control of a global bureaucracy.It even provides for a global tax that would be paid directly to the ISA by companies seeking to develop the resources in and under the world's oceans. It would redistribute the fruits of our ocean labors to landlocked and thuggish regimes around the globe.""One of the more nefarious and insidious of its provisions is Article 82, which requires the United States to forfeit royalties generated from oil and gas development on the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles — an area known as the 'extended continental shelf,'"" notes the Heritage Foundation's Mike Brownfield in a recent analysis.LOST ""uses the failed socialist economic theory to govern the ocean floors, it has proven unable to resolve disputes, it subsidizes dangerous regimes, it does not establish meaningful property rights and thus fails to provide certainty for developers, and because it requires technology transfers, it suppresses research and development,"" according to Iain Murray of the National Center for Policy Analysis.LOST establishes a tribunal to police the treaty, an international court environmentalists could use to force the deindustrialization of the U.S., the world's second-largest carbon emitter after China, which will be exempt since it is deemed a ""developing"" country.LOST was rejected by President Ronald Reagan over concerns that it would cede U.S. sovereignty to the ISA.Reagan was right. It should be rejected again.

3196,ICE,"Bullet Buys: Fifteen members of Congress have written a letter to the Department of Homeland Security demanding to know why the federal agency is buying so many rounds of ammunition. We'd like to know too.Freshman California Republican Doug LaMalfa and 14 of his House colleagues, who signed on to his March 5 letter, are asking the Department of Homeland Security to explain why it is buying 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition of various calibers. They aren't happy with explanations provided so far in the press by lower-level officials, answers meant to debunk ""unfounded"" concerns.As we have noted, DHS has been buying lots of ammo, enough by one calculation to fight the equivalent of a 24-year Iraqi War.Peggy Dixon, spokeswoman for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Ga., told the Associated Press that the training center and others like it run by the Homeland Security Department use as many as 15 million rounds every year, mostly on shooting ranges and in training exercises.The massive purchases are said to be spread out over five years and due simply to the best practice of saving money by buying in bulk what comes down to five rounds of ammo for every man, woman and child on the U.S. That's a lot of practice and training.A good portion of the 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition are being purchased by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal government's second-largest criminal investigative agency. Yes that's the same ICE that is releasing detained criminal illegal aliens onto our streets because of sequestration cuts.Jonathan Lasher, the Social Security Administration's assistant inspector general for external relations, explained the purchase of 174,000 hollow-point bullets by saying they were for the Social Security inspector general's office, which has about 295 agents who investigate Social Security fraud and other crimes.When they say they're cracking down on waste, fraud and abuse, they apparently mean it.However, as former Marine Richard Mason told reporters with WHPTV News in Pennsylvania recently, hollow-point bullets (which make up the majority of the DHS purchases) are not used for training because they are more expensive than standard firing range rounds .""We never trained with hollow points, we didn't even see hollow points my entire 4-1/2 years in the Marine Corps,"" Mason said.LaMalfa offers one theory that's less sinister than some: The federal government is simply trying to corner the market on ammo and restrict what's available to the American people as part of its gun control efforts.""The extraordinary level of ammunition purchases made by Homeland Security seems to have, in states such as my own, created an extreme shortage of ammunition to the point where many gun owners are unable to purchase any,"" LaMalfa wrote in the letter.While lower-level officials talk to the press, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano apparently doesn't want to tell Congress herself the reasons for these purchases.""They have no answer for that question. They refuse answer that,"" Congressman Timothy Huelskamp (R-Kan.) told reporters recently, adding, ""They refuse to let us know what is going on, so I don't really have an answer for that. Multiple members of Congress are asking those questions.""Homeland Security has acquired a number of Mine Resistant Armored Protection (MRAP) vehicles which have been retrofitted for possible service on the streets of the U.S. They were formerly used for counterinsurgency in Iraq. These vehicles are specifically designed to resist mines and ambush attacks.As we noted in a recent editorial, DHS is also seeking to acquire 7,000 5.56-by-45-millimeter NATO ""personal defense weapons"" — also known as ""assault weapons"" when owned by civilians.If there are plausible explanations for all this, some congressmen would like to hear them.Maybe DHS can answer Congress' questions in a series of bullet points.

3228,ICE,"Climate Fraud: In an attempt to defend his role in the greatest scam of modern times, Climate-gate's poster child threatens to defend his tarnished reputation in court. First, hide the decline, then hide the deceit.'Get lost"" was National Review editor Rich Lowry's appropriate response to a threatened lawsuit by Penn State climate scientist Michael Mann.NR printed a post by the great Mark Steyn, who graces these pages as well, calling Mann's famous hockey-stick graph ""fraudulent."" That it is indeed a fraud has been documented by many, including us.Mann was at the heart of the Climate-gate scandal in 2009, when emails were unearthed from Britain's Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia. In one email sent to Mann and others, CRU director Philip Jones speaks of the ""trick"" of filling in gaps of data in order to hide evidence of temperature decline:""I've just completed Mike's nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (i.e. from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline (in global temperatures),"" the email read.It was that attempt to ""hide the decline"" through the manipulation of data that helped bring down the global warming house of cards.The graph created by professor Mann and his colleagues carefully selected and manipulated tree-ring data to supposedly prove that air temperatures had been stable for 900 years, then soared off the charts — in a pattern resembling a hockey stick — in the 20th century due to man-made greenhouse gases. Mann et al. performed the neat trick of making the Medieval Warm Period (about A.D. 800 to 1400) and the Little Ice Age (A.D. 1600 to 1850) statistically disappear.The graph relied on data from trees on the Yamal Peninsula in Siberia. Here too the data were carefully selected. Data from just 12 trees from the 252 cores in the CRU Yamal data set were used.A larger data set of 34 tree cores from the vicinity showed no dramatic recent warming, and warmer temperatures in the Middle Ages. They were not included.Based on this documented record of scientific fraud, Steyn posted a stinging critique that included this quote from the blog of Rand Simberg: ""Mann could be said to be the Jerry Sandusky of climate science, except that instead of molesting children, he has molested and tortured data in the service of politicized science that could have dire economic consequences for the nation and planet.""An apt comparison, as Steven Hayward points out in a PowerLine blog post, since ""Penn State's exoneration of Mann over the 'Climate-gate' scandal was as self-serving as their investigation of Jerry Sandusky.""With hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants at stake and the climate-change industry dependent on such ""research,"" the incentives for a cover-up were huge.Lowry says he welcomes such a suit, which may include Steyn himself, saying he's willing to go to the mat and use the discovery process to unearth every last jot and tittle of climate deception by Mann and his partners in fraud.""He's going to go to great trouble and expense to embark on a losing cause that will expose more of his methods and maneuverings to the world,"" Lowry writes. ""In short, he risks making an ass of himself. But that hasn't stopped him before.""A Congressional Research Service report shows that from fiscal 2008 through 2012 the federal government spent $68.4 billion to fight the phantom known as anthropogenic global warming (AGW), or man-induced climate change.In its name, the war on fossil fuels has decimated our economy, stunting growth and increasing joblessness.It's been the greatest fraud of all time, and Michael Mann has been at the heart of it.

3260,ICE,"A Howard Johnson TV commercial in the 1960s tells the company story in one minute.
"
3261,ICE,"On the screen is a deep-dish bowl of ice cream being consumed. Spoonful by spoonful.
"
3262,ICE,"A silky voice intones:
"
3263,ICE,"   ""We didn't invent ice cream.
"
3264,ICE,"   We just made it better.
"
3265,ICE,"   How did we make it better?
"
3266,ICE,"   We added fresh country cream.
"
3267,ICE,"   Lots more of it.
"
3268,ICE,"   Flavors. Everyone is pure. Everyone is natural.
"
3269,ICE,"   All 28 flavors.
"
3270,ICE,"   We never use artificial flavorings.
"
3271,ICE,"   That's Howard Johnson's ice cream.""
"
3272,ICE,"Few people appreciated ice cream more than Howard Deering Johnson (1897-1972).
"
3273,ICE,"This pioneering entrepreneur invented the modern restaurant franchise and staked his empire on creating the highest quality products — the crowning glory being perhaps the tastiest mass-produced ice cream in the world.
"
3274,ICE,"Lora Brody, a dessert specialist and author of more than a dozen cookbooks, tried Howard Johnson's ice cream as a kid and loved it. ""I remember the freshness of the fruity flavors and its creaminess,"" she told IBD. ""Absolutely delicious!""
"
3275,ICE,"Johnson, born during the Industrial Revolution, benefited greatly from the new technologies that made possible his sale of ice cream.
"
3276,ICE,"By 1926, Clarence Vogt had designed and built the first continuous process freezer, making the mass production of ice cream possible. Today's factories continue to use machinery of similar design.
"
3277,ICE,"Johnson's success hinged on more than technology. He had a relentless drive to create the finest dessert as well as the acuity to combine preparation and storage. ""It takes extremely hard work and diligence to stay on top of a business the way Howard Johnson did,"" said Robert Hurley, a business professor at Fordham University.
"
3278,ICE,"All About Work
"
3279,ICE,"""I never played golf,"" he said. ""I never played tennis. I never did anything after I left school. I ate, slept and thought of nothing but the business.""
"
3280,ICE,"That drive likely came from his father, a Boston cigar seller who despite his money failure was noted for his work ethic.
"
3281,ICE,"Johnson's quest for the ice cream dream began amid the Roaring '20s, when so many seemed to be making money and having a good time. That is, except Howard.
"
3282,ICE,"For the 20-something Johnson, that decade was bleak. His father, recently dead, had left him $40,000 in debt, which he voluntarily tried to pay off.
"
3283,ICE,"Then Johnson, digging a deeper financial hole, borrowed $500 to buy a drugstore with a soda fountain in Wollaston, a neighborhood in Quincy, Mass.
"
3284,ICE,"Although the store's previous owner had lost money, Johnson was high on new ways of doing business.
"
3285,ICE,"The soda fountain that Johnson bought sold only three flavors — vanilla, chocolate and strawberry.
"
3286,ICE,"That wasn't cutting it on two fronts. He found the taste inferior. And he wanted more flavors.
"
3287,ICE,"Johnson's goals were clear: He would produce and sell multiple flavors of superior ice cream.
"
3288,ICE,"Using a hand-cranked ice cream freezer, he experimented with new ice cream recipes.
"
3289,ICE,"Then came one of the great duh moments. He discovered that doubling the butterfat content and using only natural ingredients produced fabulous flavor.
"
3290,ICE,"A mythology grew about his recipes. Some said they came from his mother. Others said they were from an immigrant who shared them with Johnson. Others said the variations were his invention.
"
3291,ICE,"However they arose, Johnson was ready to test his product by 1925. Quickly, word spread beyond Wollaston that delicious ice cream was available in Johnson's shop.
"
3292,ICE,"Customers, driving for miles, stood in long lines to buy the treat. And Johnson rewarded them with generous portions.
"
3293,ICE,"Demand led to expansion. Soon Johnson sold his ice cream at stands on nearby beaches and other locations.
"
3294,ICE,"By 1929, Johnson's ice cream sales reached $60,000 — worth $788,000 today.
"
3295,ICE,"In three years, he paid off his debt and once again expanded.
"
3296,ICE,"This time his menu included frankfurters and hamburgers while he employed the same attention to content and preparation. Soon his ice cream store morphed into a hot restaurant. But the big draw would always be his 28 flavors of unadulterated ice cream.
"
3297,ICE,"Why the 28? One explanation comes from the Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America, which suggests the number celebrates 1928, a year when Johnson figured his success was a lock.
"
3298,ICE,"Tasty Number
"
3299,ICE,"Once the 28 gimmick caught on, he ruled that each of his restaurants has to have all the flavors, which according to a 1962 Newsweek story were: banana, black raspberry, butter pecan, butter crunch, butterscotch, caramel fudge, chocolate, chocolate chip, coconut, coffee, cherry vanilla, frozen pudding, fudge ripple, lemon, macaroon, maple walnut, mint chip, mocha chip, orange pineapple, peach, pecan brittle, pineapple, peppermint stick, pistachio, strawberry, strawberry ripple, Swiss almond and vanilla.
"
3300,ICE,"Johnson grasped right away that he needed all quality all the time.
"
3301,ICE,"""Brand is a promise,"" Hurley said. ""And great brands deliver consistently on their promise. Howard Johnson understood this concept.""
"
3302,ICE,"Jeri Quinzio, a food historian, emphasizes that Johnson never lowered his ice cream yummy factor.
"
3303,ICE,"If anything went down prices did.
"
3304,ICE,"""He was smart enough to know where to cut,"" Quinzio said.
"
3305,ICE,"In 1929, four years after plunking down $500 to open the modest shop, Johnson started that other restaurant, in Quincy, and set his grand expansion plan in motion.
"
3306,ICE,"And he was starting to see the future: America was destined to become a car nation.
"
3307,ICE,"Meanwhile, he had a brilliant business idea — franchising. His concept was simple. For a fee, he let independent operators use the Howard Johnson name. He would provide food, supplies, the logo and even a building design.
"
3308,ICE,"Cool Company
"
3309,ICE,"By 1935, 25 Howard Johnson's roadside ice cream and food stands thrived in Massachusetts.
"
3310,ICE,"Expansion continued, and during the late 1930s more than 100 HoJo's dotted the Atlantic Coast.
"
3311,ICE,"From 1951 to 1969, sales soared from $32 million to $95 million.

3312,ICE,"In 1952, Howard Johnson's opened its 351st restaurant and became the world's largest food chain. Soon after, the company went public, adding motels to its offerings. By 1965, the company had 770 restaurants and 265 motels.
"
3313,ICE,"David Stein, owner of Steve's Ice Cream, a Brooklyn-made treat distributed in New York City, proudly shares the old standard's values: ""Howard Johnson invented an artisanal ice cream, which is a high-quality product usually made in small batches. But Johnson's true genius was that he made the giant leap from small batches to a mass market without compromising quality. His was the forerunner of premium ice creams.""
"
3314,ICE,"As Johnson grew older, he traveled the country in a chauffeured Cadillac bearing the license plate HJ-28. Along the way he stopped to inspects his restaurants
"
3315,ICE,"He died at age 75. Having been married four times, he left three children and seven grandchildren.
"
3316,ICE,"With its founder gone and fast-food competition from McDonald's (MCD) heating up, Howard Johnson's started melting. It no longer runs ice cream parlors. Now Howard Johnson hotels number 475 in 13 countries and belong to Wyndham Worldwide (WYN), which in 2011 had sales of $4 billion.
"
3317,ICE,"As for Johnson's ice cream, many modern artisanal and mass-producing ice cream makers — including Ben & Jerry's and Haagen-Dazs — embraced his template for creating and maintaining absolute quality.

"
3360,ICE,"In the U.S., Dunkin' plans westward expansion. Meanwhile, its Baskin-Robbins ice cream chain, more of a hit overseas than domestically, is expanding eastward to South Korea, Vietnam and other Asian venues where ice cream is enjoyed outside the home.
"
3361,ICE,"Unlike rival Starbucks, which had to cut back on its store count several years ago due to overexpansion, Dunkin' Donuts has been expanding cautiously from its New England core. Now it stands poised to crack Western markets where it currently has minimal presence.
"
3362,ICE,"""It's an open template west of the Mississippi,"" said William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia.
"
3363,ICE,"After five years under private equity ownership, Dunkin' Brands went public in July 2011. Since then, the chain has been able to report solid revenue and earnings growth based on a a mix of expansion and improving same-store sales.
"
3364,ICE,"Dunkin' Donuts stores, mostly in the U.S., will contribute more than $530 million in 2013 revenue, JPMorgan analysts estimate.
"
3365,ICE,"Ice Cream Shops
"
3366,ICE,"Baskin-Robbins will contribute roughly $160 million, most of it from international outlets. In the U.S., Baskin-Robbins just limps along. CEO Nigel Travis said it best when he told analysts in late January that Dunkin' now sees the Baskin-Robbins brand as a ""slow growth"" rather than ""zero growth"" business.
"
3367,ICE,"Dunkin' gets a cut of revenue from every cup of coffee its franchisees sell. And coffee remains the chain's best seller. But in expanding to such items as breakfast burritos, turkey sausage sandwiches, and single-serve K-cups, Dunkin' has added numerous kickers to store sales. Last year, same-store sales rose by 4.2%.
"
3368,ICE,"Meanwhile, Dunkin' has expanded chiefly in Midwestern and Southern markets contiguous to its core store base in New England and New York. Because nearly all Dunkin' units are franchise-owned, the company can expand without onerous capital costs.
"
3369,ICE,"Now, the chain hopes to deepen its footprint out west.
"
3370,ICE,"Longbow Research analyst Alton Stump believes Dunkin' Donuts has ""a huge opportunity"" west of the Mississippi. Noting that there is one Dunkin' Donuts shop for roughly 9,600 residents in core Northeast markets, Stump says the chain has just one store per 1 million residents in much of the West. Stump reasons that there is ""a good chance"" Dunkin' could double its U.S. store base ""in less than 20 years.""
"
3371,ICE,"Dunkin's early success in opening stores out west augurs well for the future. ""First year average weekly sales are higher in Western emerging markets than in core and established markets,"" reported Zackfia.
"
3372,ICE,"With just over 7,300 U.S. stores, Dunkin' has plans for 330 to 360 openings this year. Nearly 20% will be in Western markets, says Zackfia. One expansion target is Denver. Dunkin' will enter California by 2015.
"
3373,ICE,"Meanwhile, aggressive national TV advertising has enhanced Dunkin's brand awareness. By the time Dunkin' opens in California, says Zackfia, consumers there will have been exposed to five years of TV ads. ""Brand recognition is definitely improving,"" she concluded.
"
3374,ICE,"All this should be a kicker to a formula that has been working well in Dunkin's core markets.
"
3375,ICE,"Earnings have been growing steadily. Earnings per share grew in 2012 to $1.28, a 51% increase from 85 cents the prior year. Analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters forecast 2013 EPS to grow 20% and 17% in 2014.
"
3376,ICE,"Pretax margin grew in 2012 to 35.5% from 26.5%.
"
3377,ICE,"In Dunkin's spare and unpretentious shops, the coffee is not quite the same as the rich upscale brews served up at Starbucks. Dunkin's coffee is ""middle of the spectrum,"" according to Zackfia.
"
3378,ICE,"But the coffee is priced below premium alternatives. And many prefer a weaker blend. ""Consumers like the fact that the coffee isn't as strong as Starbucks,"" Stump noted.
"
3379,ICE,"Over the years, Dunkin' has moved beyond hot coffee and doughnuts to sell bagels and a broad array of sandwiches and sugary coffee-based novelty drinks.
"
3380,ICE,"""What they've been able to do is transcend the brand identity as strictly a coffee and doughnut shop,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Nick Setyan. He explains how Dunkin' has held its own against rival chains: ""Dunkin' Donuts has been able to position itself at a slightly lower price point with a larger mix of products.""
"
3381,ICE,"That larger mix has been driving same-store sales gains. In the fourth quarter, Dunkin' comps rose by 3.2% in a quarter that had one less week than the prior year's. Same-store sales grew by 7.2%, 4.0% and 2.8% in the first three quarters of 2012.
"
3382,ICE,"Sharon Smith manages 19 stores for a multiunit Dunkin' Donut franchisee in Florida and Massachusetts. Sitting at a plain plastic table during rush hour in one of her Boston-area stores, Smith noted that the new sandwiches had extended high traffic to the afternoon and evening hours. Still, coffee sales typically account for about 70% of store revenues, Smith says.
"
3383,ICE,"Many analysts like Dunkin's entry into the home-brewing market with its sales of single-serve K-cups. Sales of K-Cups at her shops were very strong last year, notes Smith, but not quite so impressive early this year.
"
3384,ICE,"Home Brew
"
3385,ICE,"The availability of cheaper home brew alternatives may have also had a bit of a cannibalizing effect. ""There are regular customers we're not seeing three times a day, seven days a week. Now we see them once a day four times a week,"" she said.
"
3386,ICE,"That's still pretty good attendance. More worrisome is the threat of a reversal in low interest rates.
"
3387,ICE,"Like many firms with a private equity past, Dunkin' is loaded up with debt. ""It's one of the more levered balance sheets,"" noted Stump. To date, the Fed's stubborn insistence on rock-bottom rates has been a boon to heavy borrowers. Should rates reverse, Dunkin's floating rate interest payments will rise. ""Yes, there's definitely interest rate risk,' allowed Stump.
"
3388,ICE,"But it's probably manageable. For one thing, its business model of franchisee ownership limits capital costs. And if interest rates rise because of improved economic activity, the hit of higher payments should be offset by higher sales
"
3389,ICE,"With is loyal customer base in core markets, Dunkin' has a reliable base on which to grow, and because franchisees pay the freight in expansion, its risk in expansion is basically the risk to its growth profile, not its core financials..
"
3390,ICE,"But Dunkin' needs successful expansion to sustain that growth profile. ""They seem to be cognizant of the fact that there's not a whole lot of room to grow in core markets,"" said Stump.They may not brew the strongest coffee at Dunkin' Donuts.

3391,ICE,"One trip to California, and Burt Baskin was licked — by ice cream.
"
3392,ICE,"Baskin, one of the names behind what would be the sensational ice cream chain Baskin-Robbins, took that West Coast jaunt in the 1940s.
"
3393,ICE,"There he visited brother-in-law Irv Robbins, who was running a modest ice cream shop.
"
3394,ICE,"Baskin (1913-67) saw potential for a business much bigger than a single scoop. The product could be a double or a triple, he figured, which turned the joint venture into the tastiest of companies.
"
3395,ICE,"Sixty-five years later, the Baskin-Robbins chain boasts nearly 7,000 locations in some 50 countries.
"
3396,ICE,"California Creamin'
"
3397,ICE,"Even back in 1946, when Baskin opened his first Burton's Ice Cream Shop in Pasadena, Calif., it was such a success, he never had misgivings about leaving behind a men's clothing shop in Chicago after returning from the Navy.
"
3398,ICE,"How did he make such a hot transition from men's suits to ice cream? He was a natural salesman, says his wife, Shirley.
"
3399,ICE,"""Irv's expertise was in the manufacturing, and Burton's was in sales,"" she told IBD. ""A master salesman, it was said of him, 'He could sell ice water in the winter to the Eskimos.'""
"
3400,ICE,"It helped too that he had experience making and selling the frozen treat. The Navy lieutenant concocted various flavors from fruit in the South Pacific and sold the ice cream to GIs in the early 1940s.
"
3401,ICE,"""Even before he opened his first ice cream shop in California, Burt experimented with creating new ice cream flavors with tropical fruit while serving in World War II in the Pacific with an ice cream freezer he acquired from an aircraft supply officer,"" Bill Mitchell, senior vice president and brand officer for Baskin-Robbins U.S. and Canada, told IBD via email. ""There's no doubt that this flavor experimentation helped him down the road when dreaming up new flavors with Irv for Baskin-Robbins.""
"
3402,ICE,"Baskin modeled Burton's after his brother-in-law's Snowbird Ice Cream store in Glendale. They both offered a wide assortment of flavors in addition to the standard vanilla, chocolate and strawberry carried by most purveyors.
"
3403,ICE,"Dandy Dad
"
3404,ICE,"Baskin loved making and selling ice cream, his daughter Edie told IBD: ""He was energetic toward his work ... and intensely immersed in his business, constantly coming up with new ideas and flavors and marketing ideas.""
"
3405,ICE,"Consumers loved the variety and flocked to his shop. His fun-loving nature helped bring back customers too. ""I remember my father as an extremely dynamic man. He was very funny and outgoing. Everyone loved him,"" Edie said.
"
3406,ICE,"Burton's soon expanded to three locations. In the meantime, Snowbird had grown to five. In 1947 they combined their minichains — keeping their respective Burton's and Snowbird names. It was a good fit.
"
3407,ICE,"""They shared the same vision and worked in tandem,"" Shirley said.
"
3408,ICE,"Ice cream was flying out of their freezers so fast, they wanted to expand. But they were restricted by capital and time constraints. It was tough enough supervising their eight shops.
"
3409,ICE,"What could they do? By offering store managers a stake in their business, they could better ensure quality products and service.
"
3410,ICE,"Franchise Push
"
3411,ICE,"""Both Burt and Irv knew that in order to keep their high standards as the number of stores grew, they needed their managers to have an ownership interest in the operation,"" Mitchell said.
"
3412,ICE,"They sold locations to independent vendors, with Baskin and Robbins supplying the ice cream and handling marketing and promotion.
"
3413,ICE,"This idea of franchising really took off. In 1949 the brothers-in-law's first franchise opened in Glendale; by the end of the year they had 43 such stores in Southern California. They then bought a dairy in nearby Burbank so they could produce their own ice cream.
"
3414,ICE,"In 1953 they decided to combine the stores under one name. They flipped a coin to see whose name should go first: Burt won the coin toss, hence Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream was officially born.
"
3415,ICE,"It was a milestone year for the partners. They came up with the new flavor chocolate mint — their 31st — and promoted how a customer could try a different flavor every day of the month. They also unveiled their now-familiar pink and brown company logo that year.
"
3416,ICE,"The next year, Baskin-Robbins won a gold medal for its ice cream at the Los Angeles County Fair. Within six years, the franchise had expanded to more than 100 locations throughout America.
"
3417,ICE,"Baskin was a natural not just at sales, but also in dreaming up marketing and promotional ideas — helping make a visit to the ice cream chain fun.
"
3418,ICE,"""He came up with the motto 'We make people happy' and started the idea for children to receive a free ice cream cone on their birthday,"" Shirley Baskin said.
"
3419,ICE,"Baskin and Robbins had fun coming up with new flavors.
"
3420,ICE,"When the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Los Angeles ahead of the 1958 season, they introduced a new flavor called Baseball Nut.
"
3421,ICE,"Made with vanilla ice cream, the flavor included a raspberry swirl — raspberries for the umpires — and cashew pieces.
"
3422,ICE,"The partners also let customers in on the fun. ""The naming of flavors was open to family and employees, but many flavors came from customers,"" Shirley Baskin said. Her husband's favorite flavors were Jamoca Almond Fudge and Butter Pecan.
"
3423,ICE,"The Baskins all loved Baskin-Robbins ice cream. They frequented a location in Studio City, where they lived, Edie recalled: ""We were always there. We also had a soda fountain in our family room at home. There were always people over for a soda or sundae.""
"
3424,ICE,"By the time the partners sold their business to United Brands (which was called United Fruit then) in 1967, reportedly for $12 million — worth $80 million now — it boasted 500 franchises.
"
3425,ICE,"Baskin retired after the sale — and died soon at age 54.
"
3426,ICE,"The company, now owned by Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), continues to follow its founders' footsteps by dreaming up new flavors.
"
3427,ICE,"""Burt and Irv were always known for pushing the envelope when it came to new ice cream flavors, and today we have more than 1,000 flavors in our flavor library, which keeps growing year by year,"" said Mitchell.
"
3428,ICE,"Their franchising concept continues to flourish — across the globe — thanks to that energy long ago.
"
3429,ICE,"""While I didn't have the opportunity to work with Burt directly, from what I know about him he was a hard-working and creative entrepreneur,"" Mitchell said.
"
3430,ICE,"Illinois Rise
"
3431,ICE,"Born Burton Baskin in Streator, Ill., he got the nickname Butch during high school, where he played for the basketball and football teams and ran track.
"
3432,ICE,"He was also active in band and theater, was vice president of his junior class and business manager of the yearbook staff, according to MyWebTimes.com.
"
3433,ICE,"A knack for running a business may have been in his genes — his dad owned the Streator establishment Baskin's Clothing Store, where Burt sometimes worked.
"
3434,ICE,"In 1931 he went on to attend the University of Illinois. In 1942 he married Shirley, then joined the Navy during World War II.
"
3435,ICE,"""(He was a) charismatic and engaging personality, the kind of man that once you met him, you never forgot him,"" Shirley Baskin said.

By offering store managers a stake in their business, they could better ensure quality products and service.Franchise Push""Both Burt and Irv knew that in order to keep their high standards as the number of stores grew, they needed their managers to have an ownership interest in the operation,"" Mitchell said.They sold locations to independent vendors, with Baskin and Robbins supplying the ice cream and handling marketing and promotion.This idea of franchising really took off. In 1949 the brothers-in-law's first franchise opened in Glendale; by the end of the year they had 43 such stores in Southern California. They then bought a dairy in nearby Burbank so they could produce their own ice cream.In 1953 they decided to combine the stores under one name. They flipped a coin to see whose name should go first: Burt won the coin toss, hence Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream was officially born.It was a milestone year for the partners. They came up with the new flavor chocolate mint — their 31st — and promoted how a customer could try a different flavor every day of the month. They also unveiled their now-familiar pink and brown company logo that year.The next year, Baskin-Robbins won a gold medal for its ice cream at the Los Angeles County Fair. Within six years, the franchise had expanded to more than 100 locations throughout America.Baskin was a natural not just at sales, but also in dreaming up marketing and promotional ideas — helping make a visit to the ice cream chain fun.""He came up with the motto 'We make people happy' and started the idea for children to receive a free ice cream cone on their birthday,"" Shirley Baskin said.Baskin and Robbins had fun coming up with new flavors.When the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Los Angeles ahead of the 1958 season, they introduced a new flavor called Baseball Nut.Made with vanilla ice cream, the flavor included a raspberry swirl — raspberries for the umpires — and cashew pieces.The partners also let customers in on the fun. ""The naming of flavors was open to family and employees, but many flavors came from customers,"" Shirley Baskin said. Her husband's favorite flavors were Jamoca Almond Fudge and Butter Pecan.The Baskins all loved Baskin-Robbins ice cream. They frequented a location in Studio City, where they lived, Edie recalled: ""We were always there. We also had a soda fountain in our family room at home. There were always people over for a soda or sundae.""By the time the partners sold their business to United Brands (which was called United Fruit then) in 1967, reportedly for $12 million — worth $80 million now — it boasted 500 franchises.Baskin retired after the sale — and died soon at age 54.The company, now owned by Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), continues to follow its founders' footsteps by dreaming up new flavors.""Burt and Irv were always known for pushing the envelope when it came to new ice cream flavors, and today we have more than 1,000 flavors in our flavor library, which keeps growing year by year,"" said Mitchell.Their franchising concept continues to flourish — across the globe — thanks to that energy long ago.""While I didn't have the opportunity to work with Burt directly, from what I know about him he was a hard-working and creative entrepreneur,"" Mitchell said.Illinois RiseBorn Burton Baskin in Streator, Ill., he got the nickname Butch during high school, where he played for the basketball and football teams and ran track.He was also active in band and theater, was vice president of his junior class and business manager of the yearbook staff, according to MyWebTimes.com.A knack for running a business may have been in his genes — his dad owned the Streator establishment Baskin's Clothing Store, where Burt sometimes worked.In 1931 he went on to attend the University of Illinois. In 1942 he married Shirley, then joined the Navy during World War II.""(He was a) charismatic and engaging personality, the kind of man that once you met him, you never forgot him,"" Shirley Baskin said. ""He was an avid storyteller with an engaging sense of humor. He gave the same attention to the janitor in his factory as he did to a prospective customer.""

3492,ICE,"Europe: When the biggest spender in all history bluntly gets told to pay off his own debts before he starts lecturing others, it's a sure sign the adults have taken charge in Germany and the U.S. is being judged by its results.President Obama must have been taken aback by the forcefulness of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble's statement to German public broadcaster ZDF Sunday: ""Mr. Obama should first of all take care of reducing the American deficit, which is harder than in the eurozone,"" he said. ""People are always very quick at giving others advice.""Schaeuble was reflecting sentiment in fiscally responsible Germany, which is being pressured by Obama to do what he did and ramp up spending, because he really believes such spending equals economic growth.And how's that deficit spending working out? After shelling out a record $15 trillion since Obama took office, the U.S. remains mired in the weakest economic recovery in history. That's what the president bought with his stimulus, his takeover of the health care system and his vast new regulatory regime.Yet that hasn't stopped him from telling Germany to follow his lead.From Schaeuble's point of view, however, Germany doesn't need advice from Obama — who's been AWOL on Europe's crisis up until now — other than as a cautionary example of what not to do.If Obama's record isn't bad enough, the Germans have no doubt noticed how the president is slipping in the polls and how his urging of Germany to spend more may be less about saving Europe than saving himself.In Mexico last week, Obama expressed concern how Europe could affect his reelection prospects.

3514,ICE,"Precisely five years ago today Hillary Clinton took a giant step toward almost winning the 2008 Democratic Party's presidential nomination, knocking off this Barack Obama kid in Rhode Island, Texas and decisively in the crucial state of Ohio.Her wins ended a long string of Obama victories and raised questions about the durability of his ability to knock off the one-time odds-on favorite to succeed her husband in the White House. The Dem duel was one of the most hard-fought, bitter primary contests in recent history. Scroll to the bottom for video of Clinton's famously chilling ""3 A.M."" campaign ad that struck at the core of Obama's inexperience -- and strangely presaged his fumble of the deadly Benghazi crisis last September.Alas, as things turned out, Clinton came up a little short for the nomination. Early on a Monday morning in June, 2008, word quietly went out to her advance teams to stop preparing events and start preparing their final expense accounts.She graciously conceded and some days later, to allow hard feelings to subside slightly, Clinton and Obama appeared together at a campaign rally in New Hampshire, which Clinton had won, in a hamlet called Unity. Get it?A Clinton fundraiser in the Northeast told me that gathering money for her in 2007-08 was like selling ice cream bars in January. He had to call and call and meet and meet and convince and finally he'd get a modest check. While his Obama competitors in those days could send an e-mail and launch a flood of checks of the maximum amount.After the Unity unity rally, Obama appealed to his donors to help retire Clinton's debts, which had ballooned to $25 million. The response of most was, Why? She ran up her own bills fruitlessly trying to beat us and playing pretty rough along the way (those damaging racist sermon videos of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright weren't likely leaked to reporters by Obama's own people).The rest of 2008 the former first lady was whittling away at the debt when, lo and behold, the Chicago guy cleverly asked her to be his secretary of State. Clever because it appeared to be inclusive, adding his one-time bitter rival (""Shame on you, Barack Obama! Shame on you!""). And as an Obama teammate, Clinton was eliminated as an outside party critic of anything.But as a newly-sworn civil servant, it also meant Clinton could do no political fundraising. Sort-of hubby Bill stepped in and did some. He also sent out an e-mail appealing for help. In his best-selling Obama critique, ""The Amateur,"" last year author Edward Klein tells of a 2011 meeting of both Clintons and long-time advisers. At that session the former president derisively called Obama ""the amateur"" and pushed for his wife to challenge the incumbent from within the party for the 2012 nomination. She refused, as she has publicly refused to challenge the president and dismissed media suggestions of ambitions for future elective office such as -- oh, say -- a presidential race in 2016. She's said in retirement now she'd be sleeping late, relaxing and writing another book, ""It Takes a Woman."" No, just kidding on the title.Last summer, according to newly-published reports, a group of Obama donors decided to raise funds to pay off her remaining primary campaign debts from 2008 as a farewell gift upon her retirement after four years as a loyal Obama cabinet member. Apparently it was somewhat tricky, given that most of the potential donors had already maxxed out on 2012 donations. In the end about 120 anted up.And the other day the old Clinton campaign's 2012 financial report popped up on the website of the Federal Election Commission. The numbers showed all of the debts paid and, indeed, a balance of about $204,000.Which, by the way, could be used for a future federal campaign. But that's probably a silly thought, right?RELATED:Obama's shotgun photo: Fake or for real?Mounting questions on how Obama chooses whom to killJoe Biden's advice for women: Get attacked at home & have a shotgun handyWhy are the feds buying enough ammo to shoot every single American 5 times?

3516,ICE,"Energy: The president's proposed Energy Security Fund will stifle the private energy sector boom and provide permanent funding for future Solyndras and electric cars that nobody wants. And what about that pipeline, sir?A nonexistent crisis is a terrible thing to waste, and in justifying his proposal for a cap-and-tax scheme, President Obama claimed in his State Of The Union that ""the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15."" He was lying.The fact is, according to new data released quietly last October by Britain's Met Office, the world's natural post-Ice Age warming trend stopped about 16 years ago. From the beginning of 1997 until August 2012, there was no discernible rise in aggregate global temperatures.Undaunted by the truth, Obama claimed, again falsely, ""Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods, all are now more frequent and more intense."" But, for example, as Marc Morano documents at Climate Depot, all of the world's most devastating floods occurred before 1976.The U.S. has been experiencing less and less drought since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Deaths due to extreme weather are radically declining, global tropical cyclone activity is near historic lows, and the frequency of major U.S. hurricanes has declined.President Obama linked Superstorm Sandy to climate change, yet Roger Pielke, professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado-Boulder, writes: ""The U.S. is currently experiencing the longest-ever recorded period with no strikes of a Category 3 or stronger hurricane.""As for tornadoes, Pielke reports: ""Over the past six decades, tornado damage has declined after accounting for development that has put more property into harm's way.""Astonishingly, the president invoked an emission-belching China as our role model in fighting climate change, saying that ""countries like China keep going all-in on clean energy.""China has in fact overtaken the U.S. as the world's top polluter, according to a study published in the Journal of Environment Economics and Management by a University of California-Berkeley research team. And the evidence is seen daily in the skies over Beijing.Yes, Mr. President, oil and natural gas production is up and emissions are down. But the credit is due to the technology known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, employed on private lands in states like Pennsylvania and North Dakota. It is a technology you and your environmentalist buddies are trying to prohibit.If the president's proposal sounded familiar, it may be because it's an echo of the $50 billion Strategic Energy Fund presidential candidate Hillary Clinton proposed.It was to siphon off of oil companies' ""excessive"" profits to promote alternative energy development, much like the windfall profit tax and Jimmy Carter's long-defunct SynFuels Corp. were supposed to do.Her proposal itself was an echo of one of the Clinton-Gore administration's first acts in office. It was a proposal, with Al Gore taking the lead, for a $72 billion BTU tax on all fossil fuels, including oil, coal and natural gas, that would have done nothing but increase energy prices and decrease economic activity.The Earth is not warming and carbon emissions are not driving climate change. Yet that will probably be the reason Obama will use to kill off the Keystone XL pipeline, unmentioned in his address, which would bring Canadian crude from the oil sands of Alberta to our Gulf Coast refineries. Enviros claim the extraction process releases too much carbon dioxide.""Should the eco-activists be allowed to shut down the U.S. economy based on faulty science?"" asks Len Maier, president of Friends of Science, a climate science review organization. He thinks not, and neither do we.Instead of more Solyndras and Chevy Volts, we would prefer the 800,000 barrels of oil a day and the estimated 343,000 new U.S. jobs by 2015 if Keystone XL is allowed to proceed.Really, only our business climate needs to be changed.

"
3518,ICE,"Rules: Even if President Obama and John Boehner work out a deal to avoid the ""fiscal cliff,"" the U.S. is still careening toward a another cliff, thanks to Obama's massively expensive, if little noticed, regulatory agenda.As IBD reported before the election, Obama's regulatory minions had temporarily put several costly new rules on ice to protect the president from charges that he was anti-business and to shield the economy from the effects of all these huge new regulatory burdens.But almost as soon as voters decided to give Obama four more years, his regulators once again sprang into action.Or as the AP put it, ""Since the election, the Obama administration has quietly reopened the regulations pipeline.""The latest is a costly new rule that tightens allowable levels of so-called fine particulate matter. That will make it far harder for local governments to issue new manufacturing permits if they are to stay in compliance with the new standard.Worse, the new rule isn't even needed, since the EPA's own data show levels of this pollutant — called PM 2.5 — steadily declining under the existing standard.The National Association of Manufacturers called the EPA's decision a ""staggering level of shortsightedness."" That's putting it mildly.The public also didn't learn until after the election that they will each have to pay a $63 fee, thanks to new ObamaCare regulations.In essence, this is a surprise $25 billion tax hike — imposed on everyone, middle-class families included — to offset what the administration admits will be a massive disruption in the insurance market once ObamaCare's rules kick in.In addition, the EPA has proposed water quality rules for beaches. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants to require automakers to include ""black box"" data recorders in every car starting in 2014.And these are just a taste of the regulatory calamities that lie ahead now that Obama has four more years to ""remake"" the American economy. Sen. James Inhofe has a 14-page report outlining just the expected EPA regulations for 2013.Among the others waiting in the wings: New greenhouse gas rules, new rules for ""clean"" gasoline, new smog rules, new clean water rules, new food safety rules, and still more auto mandates.There are also rules in the works covering coal ash, toxic pollutants, cooling water intakes at power plants, sunscreens, new efficiency standards, and various workplace rules.Plus there's a mountain of ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank rules still to be written.According to the National Federation of Independent Business, a total of more than 4,000 federal rules are in the works, just the 13 biggest of which would cost more than $515 billion in compliance costs over four years.In his first three years in office, Obama already showed himself to be a historically aggressive regulator, issuing 37% more ""economically significant"" regulations than President Bush did in his first 3-1/2 years, according to White House data.An analysis by the Heritage Foundation finds that Obama actually imposed nearly four times as many new rules as Bush had.In his first term, Obama tried to pretend he wasn't a big regulator, ordering his agencies at one point to scrub the books for outdated or duplicative rules.But without a re-election to worry about, Obama has little reason to sustain this pretense.And, since federal rules are virtually impossible to undo once imposed, he has every reason to push regulators to do more and embed his legacy deep into the American economy.The only thing Obama will have to figure out is whom he'll blame for the economic disaster his regulatory onslaught will cause.

3539,ICE,"Panera Bread (PNRA) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) report earnings after the market close Tuesday. Not long ago, those results would whet investors' appetites. But today there are several other eateries with better ratings.Krispy Kreme Doughnuts (KKD) knows all about getting stale. The donut chain exploded as an IPO in April 2000 just as the dot-com bubble was bursting. The stock ran up until the end of 2001 as the chain rapidly expanded out of its Southern base. But that was about it. The stock briefly hit a new high in August 2003, but after that the stock went into free-fall. Overexpansion, tumbling same-store sales and accounting scandals sent Krispy Kreme into a years-long tailspin. In February 2009, the stock hit bottom at 1.01 a share.A long recovery followed as the chain gradually got back on track. The stock shot up in late November, then again at the start of 2013. Now the stock is trading above $12, where it may start to attract mutual funds and other big institutions again.Krispy Kreme's Composite Rating — IBD's overall rating that takes into account a stock's earnings, sales, stock price and other key criteria — is 95 out of a possible 99.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) may have learned its lesson from Krispy Kreme. Dunkin' Donuts is a coffee and pastry staple in the Northeast. It is quickly expanding across the country, but won't return to California until 2015. The company, which came public in July 2011, also runs the Baskin Robbins ice cream chain.On Jan. 31, Dunkin' reported slightly better-than-expected profit growth, but sales unexpectedly dropped. Shares still exploded to a new high intraday on plans for a loyalty card and a deal to expand into Vietnam. But shares closed up just 2%, near the bottom of its trading range that day.Dunkin' has a 94 Composite Rating.Starbucks (SBUX) is somewhat a rival of the sweet-toothed Krispy Kreme and Dunkin' Brands, though it has a much larger footprint in the U.S. and around the world. China has become a major growth area for Starbucks in terms of same-store sales and new outlets.Starbucks on Jan. 24 reported solid earnings that were in line with estimates. Same-store sales were strong in Asia and the U.S., though they dipped in recession-hit Europe. The new Verismo espresso machine didn't have a great start — good news for Keurig brewing maker  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR).Still, Starbucks shares broke out of a cup-with-handle base the following day, moving sideways since then.Starbucks boasts a 93 Composite Rating.Chuy's Holdings (CHUY) operates Tex-Mex casual sit-down restaurants in the South. After an initial sprint from a July 2012 IPO, Chuy's consolidated for a few months. It then busted out of its first real base in late January on a successful second offering. Chuy's could use higher volume to provide more liquidity and attract big buyers. It actually has the best Composite Rating of any restaurant, at 97.As for Chipotle and Panera, they still boast decent Composite Ratings of 81 and 83, respectively.Chipotle shares peaked in April 2012 and have continued falling amid a slew of earnings misses and warnings, mostly recently on Jan. 15. Slowing same-store sales growth and rising food costs are taking their toll.Panera Bread has not fared so badly. Profit and sales growth haven't tapered off as much. The stock isn't that far off its early October peak. That is somewhat deceptive. The stock has slowly drifted lower as the major market averages have rallied, so Panera's Relative Strength Rating has weakened to just 33. But a strong earnings report and guidance could quickly alter the picture.

3576,ICE,"The Law: President Obama's Huey Long-style government spending has showered benefits on illegals. That's ironic, because for the first time since the 1930s they would now rather live in Mexico. Maybe jobs matter after all.At a Hispanic Community Action Summit led by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa this month, 39 federal officials from agencies ranging from ICE to the EPA courted hundreds of Hispanic activists with one message: Claim your government benefits.They offered up goodies from food aid to educational benefits to help in fighting deportation.The outreach, said a conference organizer, was based on a ""community organizing"" approach of asking Latinos what they wanted and giving it to them.Well, according to a new study by Pew Hispanic Center, plenty just want jobs, not handouts. Mexican illegal immigrants — about 70% of the 10 million-plus illegals in the U.S. — are leaving America in droves.For the first time since the Great Depression, more are going back to Mexico than are coming here. Pew estimates that 1.4 million Mexicans came to America in the five years ended in 2010, while the same number and their U.S.-born children returned home.At about the same time, Obama has showered so much federal largess on the Hispanic community to shore up support for the Latino vote.In addition to benefits regardless of immigration status, he's offered de facto amnesty by cutting down on deportations, saying U.S. policy will be to prioritize those who have committed crimes. By manipulating statistics to include voluntary deportations, he's managed to make it appear that deportations are up to 400,000.He's also introduced an Ombudsman for illegal immigrants to fight his own enforcers, and further reduce deportations.He's supported the Dream Act, a back-door amnesty program to benefit illegals brought here as children.He's effectively included illegals in ObamaCare by characterizing families as a single unit for insurance purposes, regardless of how many are here illegally.His latest has been to expend enormous legal resources to challenge Arizona's effort to enforce federal immigration laws, a challenge that drew baleful questioning from the U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday.So even though Obama hasn't been able to make the seas recede, he has managed to reverse the flow of illegals, even as he's given them every incentive to stay.That's because one factor rises above all of his efforts to shower goodies and favoritism on a special interest group: his big-spending, low-growth policies, which have trashed the entire economy.Illegal immigration is always a calculated decision not by special interests, but by individuals as to where their best interests lie.Right now, Mexico is posting growth in the 5% range and has a government that practices fiscal discipline.The country has signed 50-plus free trade treaties, and runs a pension system that's privatized, like Chile's.That's why jobs are there and Mexico's unemployment rate is lower than ours. Mexican per capita incomes have crossed the critical $7,000 line.The U.S., by contrast under Obama, has $15 trillion in debt, a big-spending government whose Senate hasn't passed a budget in more than three years, a Social Security system running out of cash, and just 17 free trade pacts. Worse still, its business climate has faltered as regulation and ObamaCare costs drive out investment and keep jobs from forming.Obama may brag about the reverse exodus, but it's nothing to brag about. Wrecking the entire economy may be one way to get illegals to go home, but it's no way to treat the rest of us who live here for real.

3577,ICE,"Guns: While DHS seeks 7,000 semiautomatic guns with 30-round clips for self-defense, it makes a video saying you should use scissors to overpower armed predators. Luckily, a school guard in Atlanta thought differently. Vice President Joe Biden criticized, on Jan. 23 during a Google+ Hangout, the suggestion by NRA chief Wayne LaPierre to put armed guards in every school in the nation.""We are not calling for armed guards in schools . .. we think that would be a terrible mistake,"" the vice president said during the PBS ""Fireside Hangout.""On Thursday afternoon, a student opened fire at Price Middle School in Atlanta, wounding a 14-year-old in the neck before an armed officer working at the school was able to get the gun away possibly averting yet another mass shooting. Police say the shooter had a grudge against the victim, but the armed guard's intervention made sure the incident went no further.Some would argue an unarmed guard or teacher could have done the same, or they might have been the shooter's next victim. The incident should raise in the minds of gun-control advocates how things might have been different if an armed guard had been patrolling Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.Maybe Wayne LaPierre wasn't crazy after all. Certainly his idea is more practical and less goofy than the suggestion in a video produced by the Department of Homeland Security that was posted on the agency's website just a month after the massacre at Sandy Hook.The video, titled ""Options for Consideration,"" advises that people who get caught in an ""active shooter"" situation should run away, hide under a desk or take cover out of the line of fire. But the video also touts an option for self-defense — the right to bear scissors.""If you are caught out in the open and cannot conceal yourself or take cover, you might consider trying to overpower the shooter with whatever means are available,"" says the narrator. The video shows an office worker pulling scissors out of a desk drawer. We are not making this up. Just don't run down the hall with them.And, yes, there were plenty of scissors at Sandy Hook.Not mentioned in the DHS video is that Homeland Security is seeking to acquire 7,000 5.56x45mm NATO ""personal defense weapons"" (PDW) — also known as ""assault weapons"" when owned by civilians. The ""request for proposal"" (RFP), issued on June 7, 2012, calls these AR-15 variants ""select-fire"" weapons, meaning the weapon can be both semi-automatic and automatic.DHS is also asking for 30-round magazines with ""a capacity to hold thirty (30) 5.56x45mm NATO rounds.""Secretary Janet Napolitano would argue that ICE and other DHS agents need such ""personal defense"" weapons with high-capacity magazines in the course of their duties, and she is right. Such agents are well trained in the use of such weapons.But that does not mean that citizens should be disarmed and left with nothing but scissors to defend their homes, schools, families and children.The push for gun control has entered the realm of the absurd. On Sunday, Jan. 6, Staff Sgt. Nathan Haddad, a decorated combat veteran, was driving through Jefferson County, N.Y., when he was randomly pulled over for a vehicle check.Haddad, who had five 30-round empty magazines, was arrested by the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department and charged with five felony counts.The empty magazines were made, and Haddad's arrest occurred, before New York's new gun-control law took effect. Meanwhile, gun-control advocate David Gregory, who waved a similar empty clip on national television, has not been charged with anything.We bet Gregory has a pair of scissors in his desk drawer just in case.

But trading has since been fairly tight.Dunkin' struggled at its 10-week line for a couple months before clearing the key support line during the week of Nov. 30 in strong volume. Its Accumulation-Distribution Rating has risen steadily from a worst-possible E in late August to its current B+, indicating strong demand for the shares.Dunkin' plans to expand across the U.S. and abroad, where it earns 20% of revenue.Standard & Poor's earlier this month reiterated its hold rating on Dunkin', saying that it sees ""continued strong sales of coffee, reflecting its increased popularity in the U.S.""It said risks to Dunkin's outlook include a significant global economic slowdown, customer acceptance of Dunkin's new items and changes in consumer preferences leading to weaker demand for coffee, doughnuts or ice cream.Meanwhile, Dunkin's Retail-Restaurants industry group remains weak, though it's risen to No. 75 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks.

"
3603,ICE,"Energy: The effect of restricting domestic oil production isn't limited to gas prices. Petroleum is used to make or move everything we buy. So a higher price amounts to an unconscionable tax on middle and working classes.
"
3604,ICE,"Pump prices are now more than $2 higher than they were when President Obama took office. For a middle-class family that fills up, say, two cars with 15-gallon gas tanks each week, that amounts to an extra $3,100 a year — no small expense.
"
3605,ICE,"But it's not just the price of filling up the family cars that's getting harder to afford. From the clothes on your back to the shoes on your feet to that backpack for junior, rising oil prices made worse by restricted domestic supply have affected the cost of far more things than we realize.
"
3606,ICE,"When the railroads and trucks that deliver food to the supermarket pay more for diesel fuel, the added cost shows up when you pay for your groceries at checkout. Look in your closet and you'll find clothing made from petroleum-based fibers, including rayon, nylon and polyester. Look beneath your feet and you'll see petroleum-based carpeting and flooring.
"
3607,ICE,"Petroleum is used in agriculture to make fertilizers and pesticides, to run the tractors, threshers and other farm equipment used to raise our food. That food must also be transported via fossil fuel-consuming trucks and trains.

3608,ICE,"The average retail price for one pound of 100% ground beef was $2.36 in January 2009 — the month Obama was sworn in as president. As of last December, that price had risen to $2.92 — a 23.7% increase. One pound of sliced bacon in January 2009 was $3.73, but by December 2011 it had climbed to $4.55, an increase of 22%. A half-gallon of ice cream cost $4.44 in January 2009; in December it was $5.25, up 19.1%.
"
3609,ICE,"The push to get us off our ""addiction"" to oil through the increased use of biofuels such as corn-based ethanol raises food prices even further by increasing demand for agricultural commodities. Substituting food for oil in our gas tanks has only compounded the problem and raised food prices even more.
"
3610,ICE,"Few people have heard of the everyday price index (EPI). Unlike the consumer price index (CPI), which measures big-ticket items such as houses, cars and appliances as well as everyday goods, the EPI, a proprietary index developed by the American Institute for Economic Research (AIER), focuses on the prices of things people buy regularly, if not daily.

So a higher price amounts to an unconscionable tax on middle and working classes.Pump prices are now more than $2 higher than they were when President Obama took office. For a middle-class family that fills up, say, two cars with 15-gallon gas tanks each week, that amounts to an extra $3,100 a year — no small expense.But it's not just the price of filling up the family cars that's getting harder to afford. From the clothes on your back to the shoes on your feet to that backpack for junior, rising oil prices made worse by restricted domestic supply have affected the cost of far more things than we realize.When the railroads and trucks that deliver food to the supermarket pay more for diesel fuel, the added cost shows up when you pay for your groceries at checkout. Look in your closet and you'll find clothing made from petroleum-based fibers, including rayon, nylon and polyester. Look beneath your feet and you'll see petroleum-based carpeting and flooring.Petroleum is used in agriculture to make fertilizers and pesticides, to run the tractors, threshers and other farm equipment used to raise our food. That food must also be transported via fossil fuel-consuming trucks and trains.The average retail price for one pound of 100% ground beef was $2.36 in January 2009 — the month Obama was sworn in as president. As of last December, that price had risen to $2.92 — a 23.7% increase. One pound of sliced bacon in January 2009 was $3.73, but by December 2011 it had climbed to $4.55, an increase of 22%. A half-gallon of ice cream cost $4.44 in January 2009; in December it was $5.25, up 19.1%.The push to get us off our ""addiction"" to oil through the increased use of biofuels such as corn-based ethanol raises food prices even further by increasing demand for agricultural commodities. Substituting food for oil in our gas tanks has only compounded the problem and raised food prices even more.Few people have heard of the everyday price index (EPI). Unlike the consumer price index (CPI), which measures big-ticket items such as houses, cars and appliances as well as everyday goods, the EPI, a proprietary index developed by the American Institute for Economic Research (AIER), focuses on the prices of things people buy regularly, if not daily.The AIER focuses on Americans' typical daily purchases — food, gasoline, child care, prescription drugs, phone and TV service, plus other household products. Over the past year, the EPI is up just over 8%.The biggest factors: motor fuel and transportation costs that are up 21.1% from a year ago. The CPI, by contrast, is up 2.7%.Food, prescription drugs and tobacco — at 3.6%, 4.2% and 3.4%, respectively — have also increased faster than the government's inflation measure. The increase in the EPI accelerated to 1.9% in March (roughly 22.8% on an annualized basis), more than double the CPI increase of just 0.8%.Petroleum also affects our national security. The U.S. military spent more than $15.2 billion on energy in 2010, making the Defense Department one of the largest, biggest-spending consumers of fuel and electricity in the country, if not the world.It takes 1.2 billion gallons of fuel a year to power America's fleet of naval ships, at a cost of $5 billion. ""With the volatility of oil prices, our costs fluctuate by a billion dollars,"" says Cmdr. James Goudreau, director of the Navy Energy Coordination Office.The rising price of petroleum and its rippling effect on almost everything we buy is a hidden tax increase on the middle class and the working poor — indeed, on everyone and everything.

3618,ICE,"Excuse me, folks, but the weather is trying to tell us something. Listen carefully, and you can almost hear a parched, raspy voice whispering, ""What part of 'hottest month ever' do you people not understand?""According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, July was indeed the hottest month in the contiguous United States since record-keeping began more than a century ago. That distinction was previously held by July 1936, which came at the height of the Dust Bowl calamity that devastated the American heartland.The average temperature last month was 77.6 degrees — a full 3.3 degrees warmer than the 20th-century norm for July. This follows the warmest 12-month period ever recorded in the United States, and it continues a long-term trend that is obvious to all except those who stubbornly close their eyes: Of the 10 hottest years on record, nine have occurred since 2000.James E. Hansen, who heads NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, summed it up in a piece he wrote for The Washington Post last week: ""The future is now. And it is hot.""Hansen wrote that when he testified before Congress in 1988 and painted a ""grim picture"" of the consequences of climate change, he was actually being too optimistic. His projections of how rapidly temperatures would rise were accurate, he wrote, but he ""failed to fully explore how quickly that average rise would drive an increase in extreme weather.""The Deniers' DodgeYes, scientists are finally asserting a direct connection between long-term climate trends and short-term weather events. This was always a convenient dodge for climate change deniers. There might be a warming trend over decades or centuries, they would say, but no specific heat wave, hurricane or hailstorm could definitively be attributed to climate change.""To the contrary, our analysis shows that, for the extreme hot weather of the recent past, there is virtually no explanation other than climate change,"" Hansen wrote. ""The deadly European heat wave of 2003, the fiery Russian heat wave of 2010 and catastrophic droughts in Texas and Oklahoma last year can each be attributed to climate change.""Hansen went on, ""The odds that natural variability created these extremes are minuscule, vanishingly small. To count on those odds would be like quitting your job and playing the lottery every morning to pay the bills.""If you won the lottery yesterday, feel free to stop reading. If you didn't, stick with me a bit longer.The other escape hatch for deniers is the question of why the Earth's atmosphere is warming. Yes, there may be climate change, this argument goes, but we know there have been Ice Ages in the past and other big temperature variations. What we're witnessing is due to natural processes — perhaps some long-term cycle we are too feeble to comprehend. You can't prove that human activity, specifically the burning of fossil fuels, is to blame.Burn And WarmA Gallup poll last year found that this view — essentially, ""You can't pin it on our SUVs"" — has been gaining traction in this country, even as it has become discredited elsewhere. Between 2007 and 2010, the percentage of U.S. adults who believed human activity contributed to warming declined from 60% to 48%.I wrote a column last fall when University of California at Berkeley physicist Richard Muller, one of the leading skeptics on climate change, reversed field and announced that his own careful research indicated the atmosphere is, indeed, warming rapidly. Last week, Muller announced in The New York Times that ""I'm now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause.""Muller, who heads the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project, wrote that he and his team tried correlating the observed warming with phenomena such as solar activity and volcanic eruptions. ""By far the best match was to the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide,"" he wrote.The amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rising because of human activity — the burning of fossil fuels. The more we burn, Muller wrote, the faster the atmosphere will warm.And the crazier the weather will get.We can't do anything about the greenhouse gases we've already spewed into the atmosphere, but we can minimize the damage we do in the future. We can launch a serious initiative to develop and deploy alternative sources of energy. We can decide what kind of environment we leave to our grandchildren.I'd like to hear President Obama and Mitt Romney talk about the future of the planet. What about you?

3620,ICE,"Scandal: The House vote to hold the attorney general in contempt is well-deserved for someone with a track record of incompetence and lying to Congress. He serves and protects a president just as unworthy.It has been a mystery to us how baseball great Roger Clemens could be put on trial for lying to Congress but Attorney General Eric Holder was not. Holder has under oath made many misstatements of fact and contradictory statements and concealed documents on a life-and-death matter.Hiding the documents that show who ordered and approved Operation Fast and Furious, the Obama administration gun-running operation that killed Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and ICE Agent Jaime Zapata, is far worse than steroids in baseball.Now a bipartisan vote, including by some Democrats, holds Eric Holder in contempt of Congress, and it's completely justified.Holder had the audacity to try to plea-deal with House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, saying he would provide a ""fair compilation"" if Issa canceled permanently contempt proceedings, certified Holder was in full compliance with subpoena requests and accepted the documents offered sight unseen.Issa properly responded no deal.Holder is a man whose story keeps changing and whose department does likewise. On Feb. 4, 2011, Assistant Attorney General Ron Welch, in response to the investigations by Rep. Issa and Sen. Chuck Grassley of the gun-walking program run out of ATF's Phoenix office, wrote a letter stating that the ""allegation that ATF 'sanctioned' or otherwise knowingly allowed the sale of assault weapons ... is false.""After a series of Friday document dumps exposed the Justice Department's deceit, Deputy Attorney General James Cole, in another letter to Congress, wrote, ""Facts have come to light during the course of this investigation that indicate the Feb. 4 letter contains inaccuracies."" In other words, the Justice Department lied to Congress.""It's Groundhog Day, and Brian Terry's family and taxpayers are still waiting for Fast and Furious answers from the Justice Department,"" Issa said earlier this year during hearings on the Fast and Furious gun-running scandal. ""We will not wait until the next Groundhog Day to get answers for the American people.""Holder denied responsibility for and knowledge of Fast and Furious while he and his defenders sought to give him credit for stopping it. In May, he said he learned of it a few weeks earlier. Then how could he have stopped it in December 2010?Or maybe the documents show something else, such as presidential involvement. After all, President Obama invoked executive privilege after claiming he never participated in any discussions of Fast and Furious or received any memos.So why executive privilege if the executive was not involved, and why now instead of when documents were first requested?This administration has no problem parading secrets on the hunt for Osama bin Laden, our double agent in Yemen or our involvement in using computer viruses to disrupt the Iranian nuclear program.What's in the withheld documents that's considered more important than these secrets? A smoking gun on the floor of the Oval Office perhaps? Is Obama protecting his office or himself?As House Oversight Committee Chairman Issa wrote to Obama on Monday: ""Your privilege assertion means one of two things: Either you or your most senior advisers were involved in managing Operation Fast and Furious and the fallout ... or you are asserting a presidential power that you know to be unjustified solely for the purpose of further obstructing a congressional investigation.""If Holder and this administration are blameless and Fast and Furious was just tragically mismanaged, then provide the documents to show that.We've seen and heard enough to suggest otherwise, that there is indeed something being deliberately hidden.The families of Brian Terry and Jaime Zapata deserve to know the truth, as do all Americans, about how agents serving their country were murdered with weapons provided by their own government.

3634,ICE,"How dare he? President Obama, I mean: How dare he do what he promised during the campaign? How dare he insist on a ""balanced approach"" to fiscal policy that includes an teensy-weensy tax increase for the rich?Oh, the humanity.Republicans are having conniptions. Witness the way House Speaker John Boehner reacted when Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner presented the administration's proposals on taxes and spending:""I was flabbergasted,"" Boehner told Chris Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I looked at him and said, 'You can't be serious.' I've just never seen anything like it. You know, we've got seven weeks between Election Day and the end of the year. And three of those weeks have been wasted with this nonsense.""The ""nonsense"" in question is a set of perfectly reasonable measures that Obama wants Congress to approve. Nothing in his package should be a surprise — except, perhaps, that the president has opened this negotiation by demanding what he really wants, rather than what he believes it would be convenient for Boehner to deliver.""The president's idea of a negotiation is, roll over and do what I ask,"" Boehner groused.Hmmm. Where do you imagine the president might have learned this particular bargaining technique? Might his instructors have been Boehner's own House Republicans, who went so far as to hold the debt ceiling for ransom — and with it, the nation's full faith and credit — in order to get their way? A Tight SpotObama's proposals include effectively taking away congressional authority over the debt ceiling, which would preclude a repeat of last year's hostage crisis. Boehner called it ""silliness"" to think that Congress would willingly surrender a power it can use to ""leverage the political process."" So it's fine when Congress uses muscle to get its way but not when the president does the same?""Right now, I would say we're nowhere, period,"" said Boehner. ""We're nowhere.""Not true. It's just that we're somewhere Republicans would prefer not to be. We're just past an election in which Obama won a second term and Democrats gained seats in both houses of Congress. And we're nearing a ""fiscal cliff"" of tax increases and budget cuts that horrify Republicans more than Democrats.In Boehner's view, he has already made a major concession: He announced that Republicans are ""willing to put revenue on the table,"" perhaps to the tune of $800 billion over a decade. But he insists this money has to come from eliminating deductions and closing loopholes — and not from any increase in income tax rates.Obama insists that a modest increase in tax rates for the wealthiest households — from 35% to 39.6%, the rate during the Clinton years — must be part of any package.The Stronger HandThis fight isn't about whether the rich will pay more in taxes; it is clear that they will. It's about whether this new revenue is collected in a way that allows House Republicans to say they have kept their pledge never to raise marginal tax rates for anyone, for any purpose.Refusing to budge has served House Republicans well in previous budget negotiations. But the no-taxes-ever bulwark has not served the country well, and if Obama sees a way to blast through it, he would be remiss not to try.Geithner seems confident. ""You've heard (Republicans) for the first time, I think, in two decades, acknowledge that they are willing to have revenues go up as part of a balanced plan,"" he said Sunday. ""That's a good first step, but they have to tell us what they are willing to do on rates and revenues. That's going to be very hard for Republicans. We understand that, but there's no way through this without that.""He sounds like the doctor who says you might feel a ""pinch"" or a bit of ""discomfort."" Meanwhile, he's coming at you with a needle the size of an ice pick.There is no guarantee that Obama will get everything he wants out of this showdown. But I'd rather be playing the president's hand than Boehner's.Most House Republicans are in safe districts, but not all of them—and the GOP majority will be smaller when the new Congress convenes. Polls indicate that most Americans believe the tax increase Obama seeks for the wealthy is no big deal. It's hard to imagine how Republicans can possibly get a better offer on taxes and spending in January than they can get now.Hence Boehner's urgency. Time is not on his side.

3652,ICE,"Photo ops can be dangerous things. Recall President Obama, trying to appear genuinely green examining an electric car, but motorcading there in a cavalcade of 17 SUVs.Nonetheless, photo ops are prized political tools because they can give the appearance of normalcy in a politician's life where none exists. And the media, for all its feigned affection for policy wonkiness, eats up photo ops, especially in summer and especially if it's something of a surprise. (Scroll down for a deliciously clever video montage, courtesy of TBS' Conan O'Brien, of local news appetites for photo ops -- and clichés).Anything, please anything, different from the posed political podium shot!Photo ops typically do not appear on a politician's official schedule. They are supposed to seem spontaneous, if by spontaneous you mean the advance team found the site only a week ago and the Secret Service didn't run a check on the owner until last night, nor case the place till early this morning. Which may account for the curious sidewalk crowds assembling two hours before the president allegedly decides on the spur of the moment that he desires an ice cream cone at that very same place.Thanks to his Michelle-defying affinity for crap food, Obama has become a professional at such event performances. Which certainly helps account for his consistent poll likability margin over Mitt Romney. A multi-millionaire Harvard grad who likes mint chocolate chip, just like me. Every tiny plus helps.Someone will slip $20 in Obama's pocket. He'll emerge from the armored vehicle amid a throng of agents and staff, who then drop back. So the event photos will appear as if POTUS was alone, scanning the menu above the counter just as you and I would, ordering what the crew already knows he wants and schmoozing with any surviving customers not shooed away by security.Amazingly at least one child remains behind, so the president can stoop down for the pool cameras and consult on school vacation or favorite flavors. And staff will soon pass the youngster's name, age and answers on to waiting media, who play along with the political theater because they must have some news product to show for their long day's tag-along labors.The bottom line for the politician is the desired result of folksy photos with real and excited Americans, and no contradictory images of him, coat off, tie down, scheming on special interest spending over coffee with a donor claque, each of whom paid $60,000 for the privilege.Photo ops can be very useful. Remember back during the terrible oil spill, when it took Obama a week to realize the historic calamity's scale? To respond to governors' subsequent pleas for help restoring tourism, Obama went swimming in the gulf with a daughter for a few minutes.It wasn't really the gulf. It was an accessible inlet miles from the polluted sea. But White House photographer Pete Souza got the shot. The media sent it out. And there were no conflicting photos of Michelle Obama's opulent spa vacation in Spain.Mitt Romney's communications staff are well-experienced pros. But apparently they've been unable to convince their no-nonsense guy to perform in these charades to warm his image. He's been pretty disciplined on the primary economy-jobs message. He's fighting back harder now on the silliness over Bain, which was such an evil empire that Obama's campaigns routinely accepted many thousands in its donations.Romney does do rope-line handshakes, waves to distant fans and wears jeans, like us. Exciting stuff. But that's pretty much it for how-ya-doin' spontaneity. Over July 4th, imaginative photographers rented a boat and caught an unrehearsed picture of Romney, riding shotgun on a jet-ski with wife Ann. That image would be great for a woman's magazine, adoring hubby happy with independent wife taking the wheel. For someone auditioning as commander-in-chief, however, such a photo of leading from behind might not be the first-choice image. But his campaign planned nothing else to fill the need for 'news.'So far, no county fair cotton-candy for Romney. No merry-go-round rides with grandchildren. No impromptu Little League stops to work the grandstands, praising sun-screened parents for dutifully bearing witness to their youngsters' positive activities.Still five weeks of summer left. Romney may loosen up to get in the proactive image game and may win come Nov. 6.Or he may not.

3653,ICE,"Scandal: The head of the House oversight panel suggests the real reason for the administration's invoking executive privilege in the Fast and Furious case is to hide proof that the operation was part of a push for gun control.Defenders of President Obama's use of executive privilege to provide cover for Attorney General Eric Holder in the gun-running fiasco that resulted in the deaths of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and ICE Agent Jaime Zapata may dismiss it as just another conspiracy theory. But the suggestion by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., that the deadly operation was conceived to advance the administration's gun-control agenda is quite plausible.""Here's the real answer as to gun control,"" Issa said on ABC's ""This Week"": ""We have email from people involved in this that are talking about using what they're finding here to support the — basically assault weapons — ban or greater reporting.""Issa was asked about the possible connection after comments he made at an NRA convention. ""Could it be,"" he said on NRA News' ""Cam & Company"" program, ""that what they really were thinking of was in fact to use this walking of guns in order to promote an assault weapons ban? Many think so. And they haven't come up with an explanation that would cause any of us not to agree.""Perhaps the answer is in the documents that Holder and Obama are risking much to hide. As we observed recently, the way Fast and Furious, the government's gun-running operation, was executed made no sense unless its intended purpose was to facilitate violence with U.S. weapons in the interests of pursuing the administration's gun-control agenda.As Issa noted on ""This Week,"" the Department of Justice announced on April 25, 2011, ""right in the middle of the scandal,"" that it was requiring some 8,500 gun stores in Arizona, California, Texas and New Mexico to report individual purchases of multiple rifles of greater than .22 caliber by law-abiding American citizens to the ATF because such guns are ""frequently recovered at violent crime scenes near the Southwest border.""Like the ATF-supplied guns found next to the body of Brian Terry?Coincidence? We think not. On July 14, 2010, roughly five months before Agent Terry's murder, ATF Field Ops Assistant Director Mark Chait emailed Bill Newell, ATF's Phoenix special agent in charge of Fast and Furious. ""Bill,"" the email read, ""can you see if these guns were all purchased from the same (licensed gun dealer) and at one time? We are looking at anecdotal cases to support a demand letter on long gun sales. Thanks.""A Jan. 24, 2011, email showed Newell saw it as an opportunity ""to address (the) Multiple Sales on Long Guns issue."" Chait emailed Newell that ""this case could be a strong supporting factor if we can determine how many multiple sales of long guns occurred during the course of the case.""These documents, and perhaps others that have been withheld, show that Fast and Furious was intended not to interdict gun trafficking, but to make the administration's case for more gun control. According to Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, ""There's plenty of evidence developing that the administration planned to use the tragedies of Fast and Furious as rationale to further their goals of a long gun reporting requirement.""Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others in the administration had been pushing the discredited line that 90% of guns seized in Mexico came from the U.S. as justification for stricter gun laws and reporting rules.The final damning evidence that Fast and Furious was a gun-control plot just may be in the documents the administration is fast and furiously trying to hide.

"
3685,ICE,"Back in the 1970s, many scientists fretted that a new ice age brought on by fossil fuel use would cause glaciers to expand, wreaking havoc.A 1975 Newsweek cover story breathlessly reported that ""the earth's climate seems to be cooling down."" Meteorologists are ""almost unanimous"" that the trend will ""reduce agricultural productivity for the rest of the century,"" and ""the resulting famines could be catastrophic.""The CIA, NASA and National Academy of Sciences, Obama science adviser John Holdren and many ""mainstream"" news organizations issued similar alarms.The Chicken Little ice age never arrived. Instead, we've been presented a new ""consensus"" view: that our planet now faces fossil-fuel-induced catastrophic global warming and a planetary biodiversity crisis.The tales of doom remain standard media and political fare, even as the science continues to evolve — and ClimateGate and other revelations of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shenanigans and duplicity join the dissection of Michael Mann's hockey stick graph in reducing public anxiety.New theories about solar cycles, cosmic rays and the dominant role of solar activity in determining Earth's climate are becoming ever more accepted.Solar HeatingNevertheless, Mann-made global warming, climate change and ""weird"" weather remain the foundation of political agendas for ending our ""addiction"" to oil, ushering in a new era of ""eco-friendly"" renewable energy, and ""fundamentally transforming"" our economy and society.Their power, prestige, control and access to billions of dollars ($68 billion since 2008, to be precise, according to the Congressional Record) for biased research and crony-corporatist schemes super-glue environmentalists, five-alarm climate scientists and renewable energy companies to these disaster claims.With fracking and other new petroleum discovery and extraction technologies proving we will not run out of oil or gas — and wind and solar power will not be competitive — anytime soon, climate change is really all they are left with. Those realities are driving an extreme policy agenda.Because Congress rejected regressive climate legislation, the Obama Environmental Protection Agency issued thousands of pages of regulations designed to terminate coal-based electricity generation and impose a true-believer view that carbon dioxide must be drastically reduced to prevent a global warming Armageddon. Subsidized researchers are trying desperately to tie every conceivable phenomenon and event to global warming — even rape and murder!By making fossil fuels scarcer and more expensive, while spending billions of taxpayer dollars to subsidize wind, solar and biofuel energy, EPA's war on fossil fuels is forcing Americans to abandon the energy sources that power our economy. EPA wants to force Americans to switch to unreliable, impractical, expensive, job-killing energy sources that emit less CO2.However, changes in solar radiation caused by sunspots have changed Earth's temperature and climate for centuries, note natural scientist Dr. Willie Soon and meteorological statistician William Briggs.Even the University of California's Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) project data are ""consistent with the hypothesis that the sun causes climate change, especially in the Arctic, China and the U.S. BEST's data also clearly invalidate the hypothesis that carbon dioxide is the most important cause of observed temperature changes across the United States,"" they conclude.Job DestructionStill other analysts have shown that neither average global temperatures, nor tornado and hurricane frequency and severity, nor droughts, rainfall, sea level rise, nor Arctic climate, ice and weather patterns in recent decades differ measurably or significantly from historic norms, cycles or variations.The hysterical and spectacularly wrong predictions would be hysterically funny, except for one thing. They are being used to justify policies that are trashing our economy.Congress and the Obama administration are already implementing draconian laws and regulations that make energy less reliable and affordable, destroy jobs, weaken our national security, make us more dependent on foreign energy supplies, raise consumer prices and slow America's economic growth.The needless rules are prolonging the recession, keeping unemployment high, impairing civil rights progress, and hurting poor, minority and elderly families most of all.Any future conflicts and refugees will result far less from future weather and climate events, than from ill-advised U.S., EU, U.N. and other policies that make energy, minerals, food, water, health care and economic opportunities out of reach for millions or even billions of people.Our weather has hardly become any ""weirder"" than what Earth and humanity have faced countless times before. However, the ""new normal"" in political discourse, scientific research, democratic institutions, laws and regulations has definitely gotten both weirder and more pernicious.Contrary to President Obama's intent, we don't need to ""fundamentally transform"" our energy, economy or society. We need to fundamentally transform the political system that diverts our attention and resources from real challenges, analyses and solutions. Driessen is senior policy adviser for the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow, and author or ""Eco-Imperialism: Green Power — Black Death.""

3697,ICE,"If the near-insolvent Federal Housing Administration needs a federal bailout like its cousins, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, taxpayers can again blame federal housing policy.Washington relaxed FHA's underwriting standards before the subprime mortgage crisis and wound up insuring billions of dollars in bad loans. And now the agency continues to engage in risky lending.Among other things, it's increasingly backing new home loans to so-called rebound borrowers who recently defaulted on past mortgages. Delinquencies are so high it's extended the grace period for repayments on troubled loans to a full year.Under orders from the Housing and Urban Development Department, which controls FHA, the agency is allowing failed borrowers to get loans just three years after foreclosure with as little as 3.5% down and credit scores as low as 580. (Sub-660 is deemed subprime.)As many as two in five newer FHA-backed loans bear subprime attributes — namely, weak credit or high debt ratios, according to former Fannie Mae Chief Credit Officer Edward Pinto.""A substantial portion of its newer books contain substantial levels of subprime loans,"" Pinto, now an American Enterprise Institute fellow, said.Traditionally, FHA has insured lower-income homebuyers. But after the housing bust, the agency expanded its role in the housing market multiple times as Fannie and Freddie went into receivership.In 2007, FHA backed 4% of all home loans outstanding. Now it insures almost one-fifth, with obligations totaling $1.1 trillion.Taxpayer ExposureIts ballooning share of new-home purchases highlights just how key FHA has become to the housing industry — and how much more exposed taxpayers are as a result.FHA now insures roughly 25% of all new mortgages, up from just 6% in 2007. Over the past year, FHA has provided credit for close to 60% of all African-American and Hispanic homebuyers.Take Hermes Maldonado. The Honduras immigrant recently qualified for an FHA loan for a home in the Los Angeles area — despite two prior foreclosures and two bankruptcies.""After everything that happened, thank God I was able to buy another house,"" Maldonado told the Los Angeles Times in Spanish.Most FHA mortgages today are based on shaky underwriting — the chief cause of the financial crisis. And the share of shaky loans with 5% or less money down has jumped to close to 70% from 58% in 2008, according to an independent auditor's report.The typical FHA loan has a 3% down payment. That means borrowers are entering the government mortgage program without a lot of equity. With home prices still soft and the job market still fragile, they are skating on thin ice.Studies show borrowers who pay low or no down payment pose a higher risk of default.FHA began increasing its share of loans with low or no down payments several years before the crisis. It even let homebuyers use ""gifts"" from family and nonprofit groups like Acorn to cover 100% of out-of-pocket costs.No minimum FICO score was required — today it's 500 — and it was perfectly acceptable for people with no established credit whatever to receive a loan.In 1999, the agency nearly doubled to 44% its share of loans with 3% or less down. The share averaged a whopping 51% between 2000 and 2008. Predictably, foreclosure starts on FHA loans soared to nearly 5% from about 2% over that same period.Starting in the early '90s, HUD enlisted FHA in its ""revolution in affordable housing"" along with Fannie and Freddie. In fact, the agency put the three in direct competition for high-risk subprime loans to help meet affordable-housing goals for ""the underserved.""""HUD was coordinating these policies in the interest of creating competition between FHA and (Fannie and Freddie),"" said former Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission member Peter Wallison. ""The effect was to drive down underwriting standards, which HUD had repeatedly described as its goal.""Together, the three agencies created a feeding frenzy for subprime mortgages. But ""FHA was the pace car of the subprime binge,"" Pinto told IBD.Now this third leg of the government stool supporting ""affordable housing"" is crumbling.FHA's mortgage delinquencies, now at 17%, got so bad last year that the Obama administration extended the grace period for its loan payments.Starting in August 2011, FHA lengthened the period for unemployed homeowners to miss mortgage payments to 12 months from three months. This allows borrowers to go without making a monthly payment for a full year before the foreclosure process begins.

3698,ICE,"Polling: Among lessons drawn from this election, add one you'd think had been learned by now: Consider a poll or pundit's record before starting to quote it or him ad nauseam.'Shellshocked."" That's how one Romney adviser reportedly described his boss as the bad news started sink in on election night. Why, the crowds had been so large and enthusiastic in swing states! And besides, ""poll after poll"" showed Republicans more motivated to vote than Democrats!And indeed, many a poll had Romney ahead, with some — including the most famous of all — showing him running away with it. With just week to go, Gallup had the governor up by a whopping 6 points.We won't have the official results until next month, after the states are finished with their final tallies. As of Monday morning, the popular vote was Obama 50.6%, Romney 47.9% — a margin of 2.7 points. But that could change significantly.Four years ago, the popular vote on the morning after the election had Obama beating John McCain by 6.0 points. That put the Rasmussen poll closest at that point, and Rasmussen has been claiming ever since it was most accurate pollster in that election.The margin widened steadily over the next six weeks, however, and the final results had Obama up by 7.2 points — 52.9% to 45.7%. That was exactly what the IBD/TIPP Poll projected.So for the second presidential election in a row (we had Bush beating Kerry by 2.1 points in 2004 vs. the 2.5 actual), IBD/TIPP was No. 1 among national polls.This year, IBD/TIPP called it 50.3% for Obama (vs. Monday's unofficial 50.6%) to 48.7% for Romney (vs. 47.9%). In other words, our spread was 1.6 points vs. a real spread as of Monday of 2.7 — thereby an error of 1.1.As the table above indicates, 1.1 will probably put us third this year instead of first. But among the 11 polls active in the last three elections, IBD/TIPP has the best record.For a little different perspective, widely followed New York Times blogger Nate Silver rates pollsters' results based on performance over the last three weeks of the campaign, rather than the last poll alone. His ranking of 23 polling organizations, published Monday, had IBD/TIPP at the top.Our record didn't cut much ice, however, with the many poll critics who came out of the woodwork this cycle. They couldn't get over the fact that our registered voter sample assumed Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 7 percentage points, or 38% to 31%, before applying our ""likely voter"" screen. (We had independents at 32%.)They claimed our party breakdowns by old (2008) data, and that Republicans had narrowed the margin considerably since then.Conservatives were especially critical of our supposedly ""skewed"" data, with some sure we were, as Breitbart.com concluded, ""in the bag for Obama."" But we stuck to our breakdown because that's what the numbers said. Our pollster, TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, wasn't about to tailor its assumptions to anyone's political preference.As it turned out, exit polls showed the party affiliation of 2012 voters is 38% Democrats, 32% Republicans and 29% independents — a 6-point Democrat advantage.Rasmussen, who had Romney winning by a point, believed the electorate has more Republicans than Democrats. The hallmark of any scientific endeavor is repeatability. We're not sure if any organization has been able to repeat that finding. But that didn't keep conservative commentators from quoting Rasmussen every chance they got.As for Gallup, which also had Romney winning by a point after having him up as much as 6, the problem was grossly overestimating the non-Hispanic white vote at 78% and underestimating the non-white at 22%. The exit poll had the ratio 72%-28%. IBD/TIPP believed the ratio was 74% to 26%.Still, it's the Gallups and Rasmussens that pundits keep quoting. And it's why the pundits, from Karl Rove to Dick Morris to George Will to Michael Barone, most of whom had Romney winning handily, were so wrong.Fact is, no other poll has done better than IBD/TIPP in the last three presidential elections. We want to congratulate our partner, Raghavan Mayur and the rest of his staff at Ramsey, N.J.-based TechnoMetrica, for retaining their title as ""America's Most Accurate Pollster.""

3707,ICE,"The line at the Dunkin' Donuts cafe in Midtown Manhattan stretched to the door on this June weekday morning.
"
3708,ICE,"Iced coffee, cappuccino, latte — name the java drink, and customers were sipping it down. Donuts and muffins were also going fast.
"
3709,ICE,"Dunkin' Donuts shops have become popular stomping grounds for Americans craving a cup of joe and the snacks to go with it.
"
3710,ICE,"It's the top quick-service restaurant chain in America for hot coffee, iced coffee, donuts and bagels and muffins, says Paul Carbone, chief financial officer at the chain's parent Dunkin' Brands (DNKN).
"
3711,ICE,"Carbone expects that popularity to continue as Dunkin' Donuts steps up expansion east of the Mississippi River while moving westward beyond its home base in the Northeast.
"
3712,ICE,"""We believe we have the capability of growing in all parts of the country, and by having Dunkin' Donuts coffee available in grocery stores nationwide we are raising awareness of the brand there before we open stores in that market,"" Carbone said.
"
3713,ICE,"Ice Cream Shops
"
3714,ICE,"Dunkin' Brands, which went public last July 27, also owns the Baskin-Robbins ice cream chain.
"
3715,ICE,"The bulk, or roughly 75%, of annual revenue, comes from Dunkin' Donuts, which has more than 10,000 stores worldwide, approximately 7,000 of which are in America. Some 60% of Dunkin Donuts' U.S. franchisee sales come from coffee.
"
3716,ICE,"Dunkin' Brands is roughly a 100% franchised business model, which essentially eliminates store operating expenses, resulting in higher margins than its peers, says Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh.
"
3717,ICE,"The company's game plan involves boosting Dunkin' Donuts' presence outside its core markets of New England and New York, where it has one store for roughly every 10,000 people.
"
3718,ICE,"The firm's focus on upping it presence east of the Mississippi could lead to a boost of its one Dunkin' Donuts store for every 100,000 people.
"
3719,ICE,"It also sees a big growth opportunity in the West, where it has only 130 stores and just one store per 1.2 million people.
"
3720,ICE,"Dunkin' Brands aims to more than double the total number of U.S. Dunkin' Donuts stores to 15,000 over the next 20 years.
"
3721,ICE,"The company sees the potential to have 5,000 Dunkin' Donuts stores in the West, says Carbone. That move is in a ""contiguous fashion,"" he said.
"
3722,ICE,"It has stores in Dallas, Phoenix and Las Vegas, which, says Carbone, serve as the hubs for its Western development.
"
3723,ICE,"It also recently started recruiting franchisees for markets such as Denver and Colorado Springs.
"
3724,ICE,"As Dunkin' Donuts expands westward, it will be competing head to head with the likes of Seattle-based coffee giant Starbucks (SBUX), which has a large West Coast operation.
"
3725,ICE,"But watchers expect Dunkin' Donuts' business to stay piping hot as it expands throughout the U.S.
"
3726,ICE,"Its low coffee prices, at roughly $1.75 for a regular-size hot coffee in Manhattan, are a big draw, say followers.
"
3727,ICE,"""Their value price points and differentiated doughnut offering should provide them with a good opportunity to add stores and be competitive with more expensive brands like Starbucks,"" said Darren Tristano, executive vice president at industry consultant Technomic.
"
3728,ICE,"Dunkin' Donuts continues to be innovative with items such as breakfast sandwiches, he adds.
"
3729,ICE,"""That, combined with the affordability of its products, has given the company a very good positioning in a somewhat difficult economic climate,"" he said.
"
3730,ICE,"Slabaugh says Dunkin' Donuts' aggressive expansion into new markets presents an ""attractive franchising opportunity.""
"
3731,ICE,"Dunkin' Donuts is a well-known brand, he says, and as it enters a new market, consumers are already familiar with the bagged coffee it sells at grocers.
"
3732,ICE,"That elevated brand awareness helps push revenue in the new stores to high levels.
"
3733,ICE,"So far, so good. Carbone says Dunkin' Donuts has been successful in leveraging the brand's strength and existing franchisee base as it's expanded in new markets such as Pittsburgh and Charlotte, N.C.
"
3734,ICE,"""There is a strong national brand awareness and consumer demand for Dunkin' Donuts,"" he added.
"
3735,ICE,"That demand showed up in the latest results from Dunkin' Brands.
"
3736,ICE,"Dunkin' Donuts' first-quarter U.S. same-store sales rose 7.2% vs. a year earlier as the chain enjoyed nice gains in everything from cold drinks to its steak, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich.
"
3737,ICE,"It got a nice jolt from sales of the K-Cup portion packs used with the Keurig single-cup coffee brewing system made by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR).
"
3738,ICE,"Dunkin' Donuts restaurants began offering 14-count boxes of Dunkin' Donuts coffee in K-Cup portion packs in August.
"
3739,ICE,"Carbone says K-Cups are driving significant incremental franchisee profit and helping to further expand the brand. ""We were pleased with the first-quarter performance of K-Cups, which represented approximately 30% of our comp-store sales growth during the quarter,"" he said.
"
3740,ICE,"Jefferies & Co. analyst Andy Barish says K-Cups and Dunkin' Donuts' increasing focus on breakfast sandwiches have been the key drivers of same-store sales and should continue to do so.
"
3741,ICE,"Same-Store Sales
"
3742,ICE,"Barish feels ""comfortable"" with a long-term target of 2% to 4% annual same-store sales growth for Dunkin' Donuts.
"
3743,ICE,"Breakfast sandwiches are a big hit. Internal research shows consumers like Dunkin' Donuts because they can get breakfast sandwiches anytime of day, says Carbone.
"
3744,ICE,"That helps differentiate the chain from other brands in the market, he adds.
"
3745,ICE,"Dunkin' Brands has been enjoying a nice run since its market debut. In the most recent first quarter, earnings rose 213% to 25 cents a share. Dunkin Brands' revenue grew 9% to $152.4 million.
"
3746,ICE,"Systemwide sales grew 10.9%.
"
3747,ICE,"Baskin-Robbins' same-store sales rose 9.4% vs. a year earlier. The chain benefited from new product news around its Valentine's Day cake bites and its new ""More Flavors, More Fun"" ad campaign.

"
3757,ICE," Charles Monnett, the scientist who predicted that polar bears would drown from a lack of sea ice, ""is being investigated for scientific misconduct, possibly over the veracity"" of the article in which he makes that claim, the Associated Press reported Thursday. Monnett, a federal wildlife biologist with the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, has been placed on leave pending the probe's outcome.
"
3758,ICE,"After Monnett claimed that the deaths of four drowned polar bears foretold of an increase in deaths ""in the future if the observed trend of regression of pack ice and/or longer open water periods continues,"" polar bears became an environmentalist icon.

"
3759,ICE,"So wrenching was it that the alarmist machine has continued to use the animals to frighten the public into believing the global warming hysteria. And it didn't need to do much to turn public opinion in its favor. Research done at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has found that ""when just 10% of the population holds an unshakable belief, their belief will always be adopted by the majority of the society.""
"
3760,ICE,"The Environmental Protection Agency placed polar bears on the endangered list in 2008, four years after Monnett's observation and two years after Gore's movie filled audiences' heads with nonsense. But the claim that man-made global warming is a threat to polar bears has been debunked and the scientist who ginned up the narrative is now under scrutiny.

3770,ICE,"Honor: President Obama has been sending identically worded, typewritten form letters to the parents of soldiers, Marines and Navy SEALs killed in action. Is ""No Drama Obama"" cool or ice-hearted?For years now, the commander in chief has sent to families of fallen troops form letters that he's done little more than sign his name to. Is it a gaffe? A symptom of heartlessness? A refrigerator has more warmth. Latent anti-military sentiment? If this is the explanation, it would have to border on contempt for those who wear the uniform.In contrast, according to Ricochet.com's Diane Ellis, Obama's predecessor ""wrote personal letters to the families of every single one of the more than 4,000 troops who died in the service of their country under his watch. He also met in person with more than 500 of these families, and with nearly a thousand wounded vets.""In a 2006 letter to the mother of Marc Alan Lee, the first Navy SEAL to die in Operation Iraqi Freedom, George W. Bush wrote in his own hand: ""I regret I did not personally know Marc, but your letter was an excellent introduction to this brave man.""As for the current president, the first lady speaks of ""the man I see in those quiet moments late at night, hunched over his desk, poring over the letters people have sent him, the letter from the father struggling to pay his bills, from the woman dying of cancer whose insurance company won't cover her care.""Speaking to the Democratic convention, Michelle Obama added, ""I see the concern in his eyes . . . how that's what drives Barack Obama every single day.""Yet he continues to send out letter after letter to grieving families with exactly the same message: ""I hope you take solace in knowing that his brave service exceeded all measures of selflessness and devotion to this country.""An investigation by KPRC-TV in Houston found numerous presidential condolence letters that ""were identical other than names, ranks and service branches.""In a Washington Times interview, Bush said, ""The president is commander in chief, but the president is often comforter in chief as well.""His cool successor obviously disagrees.

3772,ICE,"Big-cap biotech Celgene  (CELG) early Thursday beat analysts' third-quarter expectations and raised its EPS outlook, though its best-selling drug faced a few head winds.
"
3773,ICE,"Celgene said sales rose 14% over the year-earlier quarter to $1.42 billion, a hair above analysts' consensus of $1.41 billion. Adjusted earnings rose 26% to $1.29 a share, beating consensus by 2 cents. The company's shares, up 10% for the year, rose a fraction Thursday, closing at 74.32.
"
3774,ICE,"The Summit, N.J.-based company added a nickel to its full-year EPS guidance, which is now $4.85-$4.90, vs. $3.79 last year. It narrowed revenue guidance to $5.45 billion-$5.55 billion, squarely in the middle of its previous range and up 14% from 2011.
"
3775,ICE,"U.S. sales of its main revenue driver, the blood-cancer drug Revlimid, fell a bit short of expectations at $547 million, but foreign sales made up the difference to meet the Street's overall forecast of $970 million. That's an 18% increase from a year ago.
"
3776,ICE,"Revlimid faced new competition this quarter from Onyx Pharmaceuticals' (ONXX) Kyprolis, which the FDA approved in July, and from a subcutaneous form of Takeda's Velcade, a longtime treatment for the same disease.
"
3777,ICE,"""The market dynamics are interesting in that we see a bit of choppiness from quarter to quarter,"" Mark Alles, Celgene's chief commercial officer, said on a conference call with analysts. ""But there's no question that Revlimid is maintaining that strong, steady (market) share.""
"
3778,ICE,"Analysts peppered Alles with questions about Celgene's ongoing efforts to gain Revlimid approval as a first-line treatment in Europe, where it's currently used only in refractory cases.
"
3779,ICE,"In June, Celgene put its application on ice so it could gather more data on whether the risk of secondary cancers from longer-term Revlimid use was great enough to harm overall survival.
"
3780,ICE,"Alles had little news, but he did say some new data will be presented early next year.
"
3781,ICE,"Sales of breast-cancer drug Abraxane also came up short, declining 6% from Q3 2011. But its year-over-year comparisons were tough because 2011 sales were boosted by a shortage in a competing generic drug.
"
3782,ICE,"Analysts are expecting a brighter future for Abraxane, thanks to new indications.
"
3783,ICE,"Earlier this month, the company won U.S. approval to add lung cancer to Abraxane's official label. Celgene also reported results from a melanoma trial showing prolonged progression-free survival in patients who hadn't taken previous chemotherapy.
"
3784,ICE,"Wall Street also is awaiting imminent news on a trial with pancreatic cancer, which has a potentially bigger market.
"
3785,ICE,"Then there's apremilast, an immunology drug that CEO Bob Hugin said has ""transformational potential"" for Celgene.
"
3786,ICE,"The company plans to file for FDA approval early next year based on positive phase-three trial results on psoriatic arthritis, which it will present in detail at a rheumatology conference next month.
"

3788,ICE,"""It looked like a weak competitor,"" said Morningstar's Karen Andersen. ""Until we see numbers in phase three, it's hard to assume it's going to run away with a dominant market share.""Big-cap biotech Celgene  (CELG) early Thursday beat analysts' third-quarter expectations and raised its EPS outlook, though its best-selling drug faced a few head winds.Celgene said sales rose 14% over the year-earlier quarter to $1.42 billion, a hair above analysts' consensus of $1.41 billion. Adjusted earnings rose 26% to $1.29 a share, beating consensus by 2 cents. The company's shares, up 10% for the year, rose a fraction Thursday, closing at 74.32.The Summit, N.J.-based company added a nickel to its full-year EPS guidance, which is now $4.85-$4.90, vs. $3.79 last year. It narrowed revenue guidance to $5.45 billion-$5.55 billion, squarely in the middle of its previous range and up 14% from 2011.U.S. sales of its main revenue driver, the blood-cancer drug Revlimid, fell a bit short of expectations at $547 million, but foreign sales made up the difference to meet the Street's overall forecast of $970 million. That's an 18% increase from a year ago.Revlimid faced new competition this quarter from Onyx Pharmaceuticals' (ONXX) Kyprolis, which the FDA approved in July, and from a subcutaneous form of Takeda's Velcade, a longtime treatment for the same disease.""The market dynamics are interesting in that we see a bit of choppiness from quarter to quarter,"" Mark Alles, Celgene's chief commercial officer, said on a conference call with analysts. ""But there's no question that Revlimid is maintaining that strong, steady (market) share.""Analysts peppered Alles with questions about Celgene's ongoing efforts to gain Revlimid approval as a first-line treatment in Europe, where it's currently used only in refractory cases.In June, Celgene put its application on ice so it could gather more data on whether the risk of secondary cancers from longer-term Revlimid use was great enough to harm overall survival.Alles had little news, but he did say some new data will be presented early next year.Sales of breast-cancer drug Abraxane also came up short, declining 6% from Q3 2011. But its year-over-year comparisons were tough because 2011 sales were boosted by a shortage in a competing generic drug.Analysts are expecting a brighter future for Abraxane, thanks to new indications.Earlier this month, the company won U.S. approval to add lung cancer to Abraxane's official label. Celgene also reported results from a melanoma trial showing prolonged progression-free survival in patients who hadn't taken previous chemotherapy.Wall Street also is awaiting imminent news on a trial with pancreatic cancer, which has a potentially bigger market.Then there's apremilast, an immunology drug that CEO Bob Hugin said has ""transformational potential"" for Celgene.The company plans to file for FDA approval early next year based on positive phase-three trial results on psoriatic arthritis, which it will present in detail at a rheumatology conference next month.Analysts have been less enthusiastic about apremilast based on the phase-two data.""It looked like a weak competitor,"" said Morningstar's Karen Andersen.

"
3801,ICE,"Nearly two centuries ago Daniel Webster stood before the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of James McCulloch, head of the Baltimore branch of the Second Bank of the United States.At issue were two basic questions: Did the federal government have the authority to establish a bank? And did states have the authority to tax that bank (and by extension the federal government)?""An unlimited power to tax involves, necessarily, the power to destroy,"" Webster famously argued in opposition to the latter question. Chief Justice John Marshall agreed, parroting Webster's words almost verbatim in his ruling. ""That the power to tax involves the power to destroy ... (is) not to be denied,"" Marshall wrote.Yet this ""undeniable"" premise — first invoked in 1819 on behalf of an onerous expansion of federal authority — has been explicitly rebuked 193 years later in support of an even more onerous expansion of federal authority. In fact the destructive power of taxation has just been extended far beyond a mere list of items subject to duties, imports or levies — it can now actually compel participation in the private sector.More than at any other time in American history, the power to tax has indeed become the power to destroy — our economy, our liberty and perhaps one day even our lives. Chief Justice John Roberts' refusal to rein in this destructive force will have immediate and lasting reverberations.The Court's JobFirst, Roberts' decision singlehandedly turned a 5-4 overruling of President Obama's socialized medicine monstrosity into a narrow upholding of its ""constitutionality.""""ObamaCare"" — which will impose $800 billion in new taxes, add $2 trillion to the national debt and raise health insurance costs by an average of $2,100 per family — is now poised to wreak havoc on a nation that's already suffocating under high taxes, crippling deficits and a devalued dollar.Obviously this is a catastrophic outcome — yet it pales in comparison to the long-term damage done by this decision.By declaring ObamaCare's individual mandate to be a ""tax,"" Roberts has not only endowed the federal government with sweeping new revenue-generating authority, he's endowed it with the authority to dictate private purchases.""It might be hard for Congress to put through a tax on not buying the New York Times or not buying broccoli, but that will be only a political check not a constitutional one,"" says Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute.Indeed, as Roberts specifically noted in his ruling ""it is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices."" Is that accurate, though? Have prior courts not protected citizens from such ""consequences"" on numerous occasions?In fact, were it not for such protections, wouldn't the federal government still view African-Americans as three-fifths human? Or women as ineligible to vote?It is precisely the duty of the court to block such overreach — yet rather than fulfill this responsibility Roberts has permitted government to slip its tentacles deeper into our private lives than ever before.Make no mistake: Under the taxing authority now available to the federal government any American can be compelled to purchase any product at any time — or face whatever financial penalty our overlords deem appropriate.Skim Milk OnlyObviously we won't see mandates compelling Times subscriptions or broccoli consumption — at least not initially. What will we see? Mandates compelling the purchase of solar panels in our homes, ethanol fuel in our vehicles or vaccinations in the arms of our children.Wherever and whenever government sees a new politically correct end to achieve, it will exercise its ""taxing authority"" in an effort to achieve it. In fact it's not hard to envision citizens using their government-mandated smart phones to count calories while sweating through a government-mandated two-mile daily walk. And to make these required constitutionals easier we'll all soon be compelled to purchase only skim milk, light beer and fat-free ice cream.But are mandates that dictate consumption really taxes? ""I absolutely reject that notion,"" Obama said in 2009 as he pushed his signature legislation through the Congress.Of course that was his answer. After all, Obama promised not to raise taxes on Americans making less than $250,000 a year — something his socialized medicine law does on at least a dozen different occasions.But Obama was correct at the time. The individual mandate wasn't a tax, it was a mandate — prior to Roberts' fateful ruling, anyway. Now it is much more than just a tax — it is a gateway to unprecedented government control over our lives.""What is left?"" Justice Antonin Scalia asked several months ago as the Court heard oral arguments for ObamaCare. ""If the government can do this, what can it not do?""The answer to that question is as simple as it is terrifying: Nothing. Rich is chairman of Americans for Limited Government.

3802,ICE,"Brent crude dropped back drastically and U.S. crude deepened losses near the close on Thursday as investors took a second look at data showing a surprise buildup in U.S. stockpiles and the sharp rise in the dollar encouraged traders to jettison riskier assets. Traders also cited some technical weakness in U.S. crude, which failed to break through its Wednesday session high, causing players to sell more late in the session.""The late extension of losses reflect a delayed reaction to the EIA data, (and) the dollar's gradual rise and the euro's slump also put pressure on crude futures,"" said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at Energy Management Institute in New York.The late downturn erased Brent crude's session gains, which were fostered by fears of supply disruptions due to rising tensions between the West and Iran. U.S. crude had been weakened early on due to the bearish inventory data.ICE Brent crude for February delivery ended a two-day winning streak and settled at $112.74 a barrel, down 96 cents, or 0.84%, after extending the day's low to $112.42. Brent crude had gained 5.89% in the first two trading days of the year.U.S. February crude, which is less influenced than Brent by global developments and more by domestic supply, settled at $101.81, falling $1.41, or 1.37%, having dropped to a session low of $101.54 late. The loss stemmed two days of gains, during which it advanced 4.4%.Brent's premium against U.S. crude widened to $10.93 at the close, from $10.48 on Wednesday.

3803,ICE,"Still don't believe in climate change? Then you're either deep in denial or delirious from the heat.As I write this, the nation's capital and its suburbs are in post-apocalypse mode. About one-fourth of all households have no electricity, the legacy of an unprecedented assault by violent thunderstorms Friday night.Things are improving: At the height of the power outage, nearly half the region was dark.The line of storms, which killed at least 17 people as it raced from the Midwest to the sea, culminated a punishing day when the official temperature here reached 104 degrees, a record for June. Hurricane-force winds of up to 80 miles per hour wreaked havoc with the lush tree canopy that is perhaps Washington's most glorious amenity.One of my neighbors was lucky when a huge branch, headed for his roof, got snagged by a power line.Another neighbor lost a tree that fell into another tree that smashed an adjacent house, demolishing the second floor.Yes, it's always hot here in the summer — but not this hot. Yes, we always have thunderstorms — but never like these. The cliche is true: It did sound like a freight train.According to scientists, climate change means not only that we will see higher temperatures but that there will be more extreme weather events like the one we just experienced. Welcome to the rest of our lives.Feeling The HeatThis is the point in the column where I'm obliged to insert the disclaimer that no one event — no heat wave, no hurricane, no outbreak of tornadoes or freakish storms — can be definitively blamed on climate change. Any one data point can be an anomaly; any cluster of data points can be mere noise.The problem for those who dismiss climate change as a figment of scientists' imagination, or even as a crypto-socialist one-worldish plot to take away our God-given SUVs, is that the data are beginning to add up.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the past winter was the fourth-warmest on record in the United States. To top that, spring — which meteorologists define as the months of March, April and May — was the warmest since record-keeping began in 1895.If you don't believe me or the scientists, ask a farmer whose planting seasons have gone awry.NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which monitors global surface temperatures, reports that nine of the warmest 10 years on record have occurred since 2000. The warmest year of all was 2010; last year was only the ninth warmest, but global temperatures were still almost a full degree warmer than they were during the middle of the 20th century.CO2 BuildupWhy might this be happening? Well, the level of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is more than 35% greater than in 1880, NASA scientists report, with most of the increase coming since 1960.And why might carbon dioxide levels be rising? Because since the Industrial Revolution, humankind has been burning fossil fuels — and spewing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere — at what could turn out to be a catastrophic rate.Scientists' predictions about how quickly temperatures would rise — and how rapidly assorted phenomena, such as melting polar ice and rising sea levels, would proceed — have turned out, thus far, to be conservative.There comes a point where anomalies can start looking like a trend. What much of the country has seen the past few days is no ordinary heat wave. Temperatures reached 105 in Raleigh, N.C., 106 in Atlanta and 108 in Columbia, S.C., and Macon, Ga., 109 in Nashville — all-time highs.Meanwhile, the most destructive wildfires in Colorado history were destroying hundreds of homes — a legacy of drought that left forests as dry as tinder. Changes in rainfall and snowfall patterns in the West cannot, of course, be blamed on climate change with any certainty. But they are consistent with scientists' predictions.It becomes harder to ignore those predictions when a toppled tree is blocking your driveway and the power is out.One other observation: As repair crews struggle to get the lights back on, it happens to be another sunny day. Critics have blasted the Obama administration's unfruitful investment in solar energy.But if government-funded research managed to lower the price of solar panels to the point where it became economical to install them on residential roofs, all you global warming skeptics would have air conditioning right now. I'm just sayin'.

And none of them are shy about making a stink on behalf of their own citizens.Now they've got another advocate inside the U.S. government, paid for by you. With that kind of coddling, it's just another reason to keep crossing our border.

3844,ICE,"Cocoa futures soared to a five-week high Tuesday, recouping the previous session's steep losses as the ICE market vaulted more than 6% on short-covering.July cocoa soared $100, or 4.5%, to $2,319 per metric ton, the highest since March 28, after flying as high as $2,356. Cocoa climbed in an initial corrective bounce from Monday's 7.1% tumble, but sharply extended its gains ahead of the settlement window on a wave of short-covering, dealers said.""It's a mixture of some spec short-covering, some new longs as we rejected the lows of yesterday,"" said Drew Geraghty, a commodity broker at ICAP North America in New Jersey. ""I think this is technical short-covering.""Cocoa futures closed above their 100-day moving averages, after falling below those levels on Monday.The rally lifted volumes, which were light prior to the surge, to just below the 30-day average, though traders in continental Europe were on holiday for the May 1 ""May Day""and many dealers away from their desks before a trade dinner in London on Friday.""The open interest reflecting yesterday's business shows the funds got short the market,"" Geraghty said. ""Looking at the volume profile of yesterday's business, it looks like a lot of these shorts are trapped between $2,210 and $2,146, yesterday's low.""Open interest jumped to 182,814 lots on April 30, the highest in nearly six months, while Monday's volume jumped to nearly 36,000 lots, a two-week high, ICE data showed.

3845,ICE,"Environment: Hillary Clinton made a well-publicized trip last week to the Arctic to see for herself the impact of global warming. Less well known, however, are two reports that contradict the climate-change alarmists.Upon her return from Saturday's tour of the Norwegian coastline, the secretary of state announced that ""many of the predictions about warming in the Arctic are being surpassed by the actual data."" But she omitted a couple of important points:First, polar ice is now the heaviest ""in more than a decade,"" reports the Los Angeles Times. It is, in fact, so plentiful it could postpone Shell's ""start of offshore oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean until the beginning of August.""The Times says the National Weather Service explains it in these terms: ""A high pressure zone over the coast of Alaska, cold winter temperatures and certain ocean currents have combined to bring unusually large amounts of ice not only along Alaska's northern coast, but farther south in the Bering Sea as well.""Second, photos taken in the 1930s by Danish explorers ""show glaciers in Greenland retreating faster than they are today, according to researchers,"" tech publication The Register reported.""It now appears that the glaciers were retreating even faster 80 years ago"" when man's carbon output was far less than today's, ""but nobody worried about it, and the ice subsequently came back again.""We can understand a U.S. secretary of state visiting a region that's material to American interests. In this case, there is sea bed mining, oil and natural gas production and vital shipping routes to be considered.But why throw in a political global warming jab?Oh, that's right: Clinton is a Democrat working in a Democrat's administration that's used global warming alarmism to push its (failed) green energy agenda. Of course. Mixing the practical — and often forgetting the practical altogether — with the frivolous to make political points is the way Democrats roll.We prefer to deal in facts, which continue to refute the prophets of global warming, who are always dragging up some point they say indisputably proves their claim. But for every argument they throw out, there's always at least one fact that wrecks the credibility of their story that man is causing the planet to warm to intolerable levels.
"
3846,ICE,"Defense Spending: Despite debate assertions, our commander in chief has in fact presided over a shrinking Navy and an Air Force with planes older than their pilots. And what's worse, he planned it that way.When Mitt Romney accurately said that under President Obama the U.S. Navy had fewer ships than in 1917, our commander-in-chief petulantly and contemptuously responded, ""Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military has changed.""As a Marine tweeted Fox News after the debate, they still use bayonets and, yes, we'll have fewer of them under the combined impact of budget cuts already under way and the mandated sequestration under the Budget Control Act.The president also seemed unaware that the U.S. special operations teams that launched the American invasion in Afghanistan were led by three commando teams who rode in on, er, horseback.""If we wanted to move, horses were the only way,"" said Master Sgt. Chris Spence, the team's communication sergeant, who serves with 5th Special Forces Group.Yes, Mr. President, we now ""have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go under water, nuclear submarines.""And, as Romney correctly stated, we will have fewer of them.We can have the most capable ships in the world, but they can't be everywhere at once with all of them constantly at sea. Some need to be in port, getting refueled and refitted, their crews resting.The rest have multiple commitments, such as defending the Taiwan Strait, keeping open the Strait of Hormuz, contesting Beijing in the South China Sea or helping defend Europe against ballistic missile attack after Obama scuttled missile defense based in Poland.In a new ""America at Risk"" video from the Heritage Foundation, David A. Deptula, a retired three-star general, tells of how he flew an F-15 for the first time in 1977 and, 30 years later, his son, Lt. David A. Deptula II, flew the same F-15 in Japan.As Heritage notes, since Obama took office, more than 50 major weapons programs valued at more than $300 billion have been cut or delayed.A 14-page analysis by the Republican majority staff of the House Armed Services Committee says the cumulative cuts will result in the Army and Marine Corps losing 200,000 troops.The Navy would shrink to 238 vessels and lose two carrier battle groups needed to project American power and influence.Strategic bombers will fall from 153 to 101. Air force fighters would drop by more than half, from 3,602 aircraft to 1,512.Heritage also exposes the Obama lie that Romney will increase defense spending by $2 trillion for things the Pentagon does not want. Obama assumes all the cuts have already occurred and uses that as his baseline. What Romney proposes is to keep the Obama cuts from happening.As Heritage states, ""In fiscal year 2010, defense spending was $721.3 billion in budget authority. Under the president's proposal, defense spending will fall to $566.3 billion in fiscal year 2014. This is a 21% reduction in just four years.""It is also a call for a return to the Jimmy Carter era, where we had planes that couldn't fly and ships that couldn't sail for lack of crews and spare parts.Obama's defense budgets and policies are the fulfillment of a campaign promise made to the far left group Caucus for Priorities a month before the January 2008 Iowa caucuses. Caucus for Priorities is an offshoot of a bigger group, the Priorities Action Fund, created by Ben Cohen, the peace activist and co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream.In a video made for the group, Obama called for a further deterioration in our military strength.""I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems,"" he pledged.So far, he has kept his word.Obama's defense cuts are real, deep and dangerous.After saying in the debate that sequestration ""will not happen,"" Team Obama member David Plouffe walked it back saying, ""everyone in Washington agrees, the sequester should not happen.""When the president said the ""sequester is not something that I proposed,"" he lied again.His then-OMB Director Jack Lew, now the White House chief of staff, and White House Legislative Affairs Director Rob Nabors pitched the idea to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who accepted and pushed it, according to Bob Woodward in his book, ""The Price of Politics.""The devastating cuts are exactly what Obama promised he would do, and his policies are damning testimony to his gutting of defense.Clearly we need a new commander-in-chief. We've tried change. It's time to try competence.

3848,ICE,"Oil prices fell on Wednesday as data showed the first release of crude from the U.S. petroleum reserve unexpectedly pushed up domestic inventories last week, adding to concerns over weak economic data.U.S. crude inventories rose 2.3 million barrels, boosted by the release of 2.268 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, part of a coordinated move by members of the International Energy Agency announced in late June to cover supply losses due to the conflict in Libya.Jitters over the higher stockpiles piled on top of fears about the unsettled debate on raising the U.S. debt ceiling before an Aug. 2 deadline to avoid a disastrous default.Further pressure came as data showed new orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods fell unexpectedly in June, and a gauge of business spending plans slipped""(The inventory report) was clearly a disappointment ... although we are trading much more off of the problems of the broader financial market and debt ceiling,"" said Bill O'Grady, chief investment strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, Mo.U.S. crude weakened further against Brent oil, sending the premium of Brent to U.S. futures to above $20 a barrel after ending below $19 on Tuesday.September crude fell $2.19, or 2.2%, to settle at $97.40 a barrel, having slid to a session low of $97.28.In London, ICE September Brent fell 85 cents to $117.43, dropping from the day's high of $118.50.

But for oil markets, if an agreement is reached, there will be a lot of austerity measures and this will affect demand,"" said Thorbjoern Bak Jensen, an analyst at A/S Global Risk Management.In London, ICE January Brent crude settled $1 higher at $110.81 a barrel. Brent posted a small loss on Monday in a late downturn after a report on the S&P warning.U.S. crude for January edged up 29 cents to settle at $101.28, after ending near flat on Monday.Brent's premium against U.S. crude widened $9.53 at the close, from $8.82 on Monday.Brent trading volume was down 37% from its 30-day average while U.S. crude volume was 36% lower than its 30-day average, according to Reuters data.S&P's warning raised hopes that EU policymakers would act quickly to tackle the growing debt crisis.A plan by France and Germany to increase fiscal integration in Europe was ""promising"" and could help avoid a mass downgrade, Frank Gil, senior director of European Sovereign Ratings at S&P, said in an interview with Reuters Insider.

3921,ICE,"The Obama RecordThe Obama Record: The president's defense strategy creates a hollow force and worsens our readiness crisis. Big cuts mean weakening the military's ability to fulfill its constitutional duty to provide for the common defense.Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the president's victory lap in Afghanistan on the anniversary of the death of Osama bin Laden at the hands of the Navy SEALs ""an attempt to shore up his national security credentials, because he has spent the past three years gutting our military.""Indeed he has. ""He cut the F-22, future combat system, C-17 and our ground-based interceptor in Poland, to name a few,"" Inhofe noted.Those are many examples of how Barack Obama has exhibited a hostility to military preparedness even greater than that of Jimmy Carter, who left successor Ronald Reagan with a legacy of ships that couldn't sail and planes the couldn't fly for lack of parts and crew.President Obama's defense policies fulfill a campaign pledge he made to the far-left group Caucus for Priorities a month before the January 2008 Iowa caucuses. Caucus for Priorities is an offshoot of a bigger group, Priorities Action Fund, created by Ben Cohen, the peace activist and co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream.In a video made for the group, Obama called for a further deterioration in our military strength.""I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems,"" he said.So far, he has kept his word.In the video, he also vowed, ""I will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons. To seek that goal, I will not develop new nuclear weapons, I will seek a global ban on the production of fissile material and I will negotiate with Russia to take our ICBMs off hair-trigger alert, and to achieve deep cuts in our nuclear arsenals.""He has kept that promise as well.As the Heritage Foundation notes, since Obama took office, over 50 major weapons programs of more than $300 billion have been cut or delayed.Obama, who betrayed Poland and Czechoslovakia on missile defense and shut down key weapon systems like the F-22 Raptor, has vowed to veto any changes to the mandated cuts, including $650 billion from defense as called for by the Budget Control Act over the next decade.That comes on top of $460 billion in defense cuts already agreed to — a total of $1.1 trillion in defense cuts our commander in chief is OK with.A 14-page analysis by the Republican majority staff of the House Armed Services Committee says the cumulative cuts will result in Army and Marine Corps losing 200,000 troops.The Navy will shrink from 300 ships to 238 vessels and would lose two carrier battle groups needed to project American power and influence. Strategic bombers will fall from 153 to 101. Air Force fighters would drop by more than half, from 3,602 aircraft to 1,512 planes. These are real cuts, both in spending and in military capability.In a recent joint appearance recently with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the National Defense University, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned, ""Very simply, (further cuts) would result in hollowing out the force,"" alluding to reductions made in the aftermath of the Vietnam War that left Army units undermanned and ill-equipped. ""It would terribly weaken our ability to respond to the threats in the world.""Maybe that's the idea. In Obama's mind, perhaps, we are the threat, the destabilizer. Hence the endless apology tour and the death of American exceptionalism.We once had a president, John F. Kennedy, who believed that only when our arms were sufficient beyond doubt could we be certain beyond doubt they would never be employed.Now we have Barack Hussein Obama, disarmer in chief. What's worse is that after the 2012 election, as he whispered to outgoing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, he'll have even more flexibility.No telling which way we'll bend then.

3922,ICE,"Environment: Climate change alarmists either ignore the existence of the Medieval Warm Period or say that it was regional rather than global. A new report, however, shows that the warming was worldwide.The Medieval Warm Period is a profound problem for those who claim that man's 20th- and 21st-century carbon dioxide emissions are warming the earth.If an era as warm or warmer than today did indeed exist 500 to 1,000 years ago, before man had invented the CO2-emitting internal combustion engine, then it weakens their claim that any warming occurring now is due to human activity. The reality of such a period is a strong sign that climate change is both natural and cyclical, not moved by man's modern habits.In fact, confirmation of the Medieval Warm Period not only dilutes the alarmists' argument, it virtually kills it.So rather than deal with it, they act as if it never happened. They want to try to make it, as one message among the Climate-gate emails suggested, ""go away.""Or they insist that it was confined to Europe and maybe North America, and therefore is of little relevance. This is the position of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is supported by America's Environmental Protection Agency that says the ""geographical extent, magnitude and timing of the warmth during this period is uncertain.""It's also the position of Al Gore, the former vice president who set off most of the global warming hysteria.He has maligned the Medieval Warm Period as a ""tiny"" blip on the temperature chart of history that he imagines proves the nonsense that he's been disgorging for years.Scientists from Syracuse University, however, have found evidence that strongly affirms that the Medieval Warm Period was no myth but rather a global event, affecting even Antarctica.Their study, published in the April issue of Earth and Planetary Science Letters, carries the academic title of ""An Ikaite record of late Holocene climate at the Antarctic Peninsula.""Journalists shouldn't let the wonkish title stop them from reporting on the study. And they probably won't.Instead, the bulk of the mainstream media will conveniently miss the study for another reason: It doesn't fit their man-is-causing-the-earth-to-warm narrative.There's nothing new there, though.It's an old habit for the media to either ignore or poorly cover evidence that doesn't support global warming alarmism.A rather cursory look at just three websites — former meteorologist Anthony Watts' blog, junkscience.com and the home of the Science and Environmental Policy Project — reveals the media have passed on at least 25 studies, reports and articles that punch holes in the global warming claim.From a study that found tree-ring data, used extensively in the hockey stick chart that allegedly proves global warming, are an unreliable proxy of past temperatures; to an account of growing sea ice in the Arctic and in Antarctica; to a report about researchers finding a new ocean current, there is a lot of contrary evidence to disclose.And that's looking back only a month. How much more evidence is out there contradicting the scientific ""consensus"" that man is warming his planet, but is being disregarded by an agenda-driven mainstream media?Don't expect the media-enviro-alarmist complex to give up its campaign because research has yet again shown that its case against humanity continues to wilt under scrutiny.It's too heavily invested in its story and the goal — stronger government, weaker capitalism and diminished liberty — that it's been zealously working toward.But it has suffered another small cut, and the minor wounds keep adding up as the facts continue to roll out and the effects of climate change that we have been warned about never develop. Its golden age will have been pushed closer to its conclusion by a warm period.

3924,ICE,"In his Dallas office 50 years ago, 7-Eleven boss John Thompson saw his time had come.Suburbs were booming, the economy was humming, and Americans were in a hurry.It was the opening he needed.Over the next three decades he transformed 7-Eleven into the world's largest convenience store chain — while changing the way Americans shop.His moves pioneered round-the-clock retailing in America with the first 24-hour stores, ushering in an era of all-night minimarts, Wal-Marts, Kinko's and fitness centers.He launched products like Big Gulp fountain drinks and Slurpees — all-American symbols of fast-paced modern life.Under his leadership, 7-Elevens sprang up in Canada, Mexico, Asia, Australia and Europe in the 1970s and '80s.Thompson (1925-2003) made sure 7-Eleven became synonymous with the industry his family helped invent.""I'm not sure the modern convenience store would even exist without 7-Eleven,"" Jeff Lenard, vice president of communications at the National Association of Convenience Stores, told IBD. ""They figured out people wanted things now. They were the first retailer to really do that. They knew what people wanted before people even knew what they wanted.""The company traces its origins to 1927, when ""Uncle Johnny"" Jefferson Green of Dallas figured out that convenience was coming fast.With the approval of Southland Ice Co. President Joe Thompson, John's father, Green started selling milk, eggs and bread on the retail ice dock after grocery stores had closed. Eventually, all the Southland franchises adopted the format, and a new company got its name — 7-Eleven — from its hours.Fifties ForceThe chain grew through the Great Depression, focusing on college towns where students stayed up all hours.By 1952, 7-Eleven had opened its 100th store and Joe Thompson was preparing to bring his three sons — John, Jere and Joe Jr. — into the operation.At the University of Texas in Austin — 200 miles south of their Dallas home — the Thompson boys studied business administration, joined the same fraternity, Phi Gamma Delta, and were managers of the football team.Friends and business associates described them as forthright and big on family loyalty.John, the oldest, was known as the bluntest of the brothers and the leader of the trio.Right after graduating from college in 1948, he started cleaning ice cream vats and lugging 100 pounds of sugar in Southland's Oak Farms Dairies.After working his way through the ranks in ice cream sales, John was tapped by his dad to help with expansion. The firm was venturing outside of Texas for the first time — to Florida — in 1954.Besides having a growing population, the state offered warm weather, an outdoor lifestyle and a network of new highways.The new 7-Elevens quickly became magnets for families that didn't have time to stand in long lines at grocery stores, or to shop at dank, 9-to-5 mom-and-pop stores.""I think we were lucky or fortunate ... that the concept fit so beautifully into the suburban living that we have come to know, particularly since the end of World War II,"" John Thompson said in an interview in the 1970s. ""It fits beautifully into the suburban areas — the more casual style of living. Perhaps the people are in more of a hurry. More women are working, and the families, the children are in the new suburban areas.""In 1956, he was at a conference in Washington, D.C., when a foot of snow fell in 12 hours, making driving impossible. The idea hit him: In densely populated areas with few parking spaces, 7-Eleven's long operating hours and commitment to providing basic needs could fill a void.""It showed we could operate in the East,"" Jere said.Two years later, 7-Eleven expanded to the East Coast, establishing stores in Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania.""According to my research, the first time the words 'convenience store' were mentioned was in 1957,"" Lenard said. ""In the postwar era, the movement to the suburbs, the growth of the car in importance and the very name 'convenience store' all combined to shoot the industry forward in the '50s and early '60s.""In 1961, Joe Sr. gathered 300 people for dinner in Dallas and announced that John was the new president. The patriarch died three months later.That same year John helped found the National Association of Convenience Stores.""What you had in the early 1960s was 7-Eleven with several hundred stores, and everyone else with a handful,"" Lenard said. ""At the time, a person in the industry said: 'If someone with 7-Eleven nailed a tin can on the roof of their store today, everybody else would be doing it the next day because 7-Eleven did it.'""But 7-Eleven was unbelievably gracious in how they shared ideas. That's really unlike any other industry. You don't see Target and Wal-Mart getting together to share ideas.""Another Hot DecadeDuring the 1960s, 7-Eleven hit its stride, expanding from 600 to nearly 4,000 stores and speeding to national prominence with products that struck a chord with Americans: fresh brewed coffee to go (1964) and Slurpee semifrozen carbonated drinks (1966).By 1984, Super Big Gulp fountain drinks had joined the lineup.""That's what made it fun,"" Jere said. ""We were willing to experiment. You don't sell the same thing every day. The public is always changing, and you've got to figure out what they want every day. We encouraged ideas to come up from the stores. That's where they all came from. But it required us to get out and visit stores.""With the pace of American life in a sprint, the Thompsons opened the first 24-hour store in Las Vegas in 1963 and installed microwaves in their stores in 1971.""People wanted it even faster,"" Lenard said. ""Forty years later, I think the speed of microwave is too slow. Today, people literally don't want to break stride.""Turning his sights to international markets, John Thompson opened stores in Mexico, Canada and Europe in the late 1960s and early 1970s.He was named chairman and chief executive in 1969, and during his first decade at the helm, 7-Eleven increased total sales from $179 million to $1 billion.By 2010, the stores were generating global sales of $62.7 billion.Penetration of the East Asian market occurred in 1973 when 7-Eleven granted a license to one of Japan's largest retailers.Going Far In The EastThe convenience-store concept may have been American, but 7-Eleven adapted so well to Japan's shopping habits and hyperefficient delivery system that many locals thought it started there.Within five years, 188 stores were operating in Japan. Today the country has 12,925 outlets, with 1,713 in Tokyo alone.""The key to why the convenience store is so popular in Japan has to do with their culture,"" Lenard said. ""They are a convenience culture; they don't go to Costco to buy a gallon of mayonnaise. They're more likely to shop a couple of times a day because of limited storage. You walk in, walk out, get what you need.""Charitable causes also benefited from Thompson, who helped raise $81.5 million for the Muscular Dystrophy Association and millions more for other organizations.John Thompson was in the thick of the bad times, too. In the late 1980s, the company began sinking under a mountain of debt.A filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy came in 1990, protecting the company from creditors.Financial salvation arrived in 1991, but at a cost.Two Japanese companies — including the company's Japanese licensee — took financial control of the company and board.Thompson was replaced as chairman — he had relinquished his duties as CEO and president in 1986 — but he remained with the company until 1996, an enduring symbol of grab-and-go shopping.""When you say convenience store, the first thing you think of is 7-Eleven,"" Lenard said. ""When you say 7-Eleven, the first thing you think of is convenience store. It's a generic name — like Kleenex and Xerox.""

3925,ICE,"Scandal: The report our attorney general used to justify withholding evidence of who was responsible for the administration program that led to the deaths of two U.S. agents is out. It delivers more scapegoats than answers.The release by the Department of Justice's inspector general of a 400-page report on the administration's gun-walking operation, Fast and Furious, is no big surprise.As Inspector General Michael Horowitz testified Thursday before the House Oversight and Government Reform (OGR) Committee, Fast and Furious represented a ""pattern of serious failures"" by various agencies.But he let the buck stop short of where it belongs — Attorney General Eric Holder's desk.Horowitz mysteriously chose to lump Fast and Furious, as Team Obama does, with a Bush-era program, Wide Receiver. That operation was run out of Tucson between 2006 and 2007, ending before Bush left office and before Fast and Furious began in 2009.Both Wide Receiver and Fast and Furious were part of a bigger effort called Project Gunrunner, which began in 2006. Even so, the differences between the two are vast, starting with the fact that Wide Receiver produced no dead bodies. It was run in close cooperation with Mexican authorities, as Fast and Furious wasn't, and involved gun-tracing and not gun-walking.The report was repeatedly invoked by Holder as a reason for withholding answers and documents on Fast and Furious from OGR Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif.Along with Sen. Charles Grassley, D-Iowa, Issa led the investigation of the operation that saw Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and ICE Agent Jaime Zapata murdered with guns supplied by the program. Holder, held in contempt by the House, still isn't very forthcoming.The report incredibly found ""no evidence ... (Holder) was informed about Operation Fast and Furious, or learned about the tactics employed by ATF in the investigation."" But Holder's own statements contradict that.So scapegoats had to be found, and the report cites 14 other department employees for potential wrongdoing and recommends Justice consider disciplinary action.Jason Weinstein, the deputy assistant attorney general for the criminal division, is resigning after the report essentially concluded he was the one best positioned to stop Fast and Furious. That's false — Eric Holder was.As early as Oct. 22, 2010, before agent Terry's murder, a DOJ official sent Holder a memo saying: ""It's not going to be a big surprise that a bunch of U.S. guns are being used in (Mexico), so I'm not sure how much grief we get for 'guns walking.'"" Holder said he didn't recall the memo.Nor does he probably recall a speech he gave to Mexican authorities in Cuernavaca, Mexico, on April 2, 2009, taking credit for Gunrunner as well as Fast and Furious for himself and the Obama administration.Holder told the audience: ""Last week, our administration launched a major new effort to break the backs of the cartels...(and) to supplement our ongoing Project Gunrunner.""It's important to note that Gunrunner and Fast and Furious both ran guns to Mexican cartels under the DOJ umbrella and the chains of command all led to Holder.The report doesn't contain the answers the Terry and Zapata families, or the American people, were looking for. But it does show that either Holder is culpable or incompetent. And either way, he should be fired.

3968,ICE,"One day in 1980, as Totino delivered the invocation at the Pillsbury annual meeting, she thanked the Lord for several things and began to step away from the podium. But she had one last thought and grabbed the microphone to say, ""Oh, and Lord, I forgot to thank you for the crisp crust.''It was 1930, during the early days of the Great Depression, and Rose Cruciani and her family were struggling to eat.At her Minneapolis school, she stayed late at recess to pick up orange peelings that classmates dropped on the playground.If she picked up a peeling, she'd nibble the remaining pulp.Later she quit school in 10th grade and started cleaning homes for $2.50 a week to help her family.But even on the bleakest days, the tiny, dark-eyed striver never lost faith in the future and the virtue of hard work. It paid off in a big way.In 1951 the woman who became Rose Totino (1915-94) and her husband opened one of the first pizzerias in Minneapolis.After the store took off, they launched a frozen-food business in 1962 that mushroomed into a national phenomenon.Her recipe for crisp crust made Totino's the top-selling frozen-pizza brand in the country and a model for the frozen-food industry.In The MoneyIn 1975 America's frozen-pizza titan sold the business to Pillsbury for $22 million (which translates to $92 million now) and was named the company's first female executive vice president — the final chapter in an extraordinary rags-to-riches story.""She is a great example of an optimist,'' Susan Casey, author of ""Women Invent!,"" told IBD. ""A lot of people would've given up. She and her husband weren't going to be stopped. She was a very vibrant woman.""In a newspaper interview in the early 1980s, Totino said: ""Never beyond my wildest dreams did I imagine we'd ever grow this big. We didn't plan on setting the world on fire. We just knew how to make a good pizza.""Totino was born the fourth of seven children of Italian immigrants. She grew up in the Scandinavian section of Minneapolis, but took pride in her Italian heritage.During her teens, she learned to make traditional Italian dishes, including tomato-based sauce and bread. At the time, most Americans hadn't heard of pizza, and few pizza restaurants were in the U.S.In 1935 she married James Totino, who worked as a baker. As a young wife, she served her exotic pizza dish at a parent-teacher association meeting.""Can you imagine coming to a PTA meeting's pot luck and people saying 'Wow, what's this?' No one knew what pizza was,"" Casey said.In 1951, using their car as collateral, the Totinos borrowed $1,500 from a bank to open a takeout pizzeria. She had to bake a pizza for the bank loan officer because the banker didn't know what pizza was.The Totinos figured they'd meet the $85-a-month rent if they could sell 25 pizzas a week. As a hedge against an uncertain future, Jim kept his job at the bakery.The hedge wasn't needed.On the first day of business, the lines outside their store stretched for blocks. Before long, Jim was baking the crusts, Rose was applying the sauce and the couple was making as many as 450 pre-baked and ready-to-make pizzas a day in their tiny kitchen.When customers said they wanted to eat their pizza on site, the couple hauled in tables and chairs and opened a landmark restaurant.Teen Taste""I'll never forget my first bite of pizza there,"" said Mary Sparks, a Minneapolis resident and longtime Totino's fan. ""I was 16. I grew up on meat, potatoes and vegetables. When I dug my teeth into my first bite of pizza, it was like nothing else I'd ever tasted. I was 16 and I'm 65 now and I still remember it. The crust was never soggy, yet it was never like cardboard. They just had great crusts.""Totino's was a kitchen. It didn't have ambience. It was old-fashioned. Your family went there. When it closed I felt like someone had died.""Hard work was the Totinos' ace in the hole. ""The early days of the restaurant were long and exhausting days for my parents, but they always pressed on, no matter what,"" Bonnie Totino Brenny, her daughter, said when her mother was inducted into the Minnesota Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008.Work And BillsAdded Brenny: ""I recall my mother's words: 'We were so tired at night that we just stuffed the money into a brown paper bag. The next morning I paid the milkman, the bread man, the meat man and others. Then I looked into the bag and was surprised to see money left.' One day a gentleman from the bank called and asked my mother if he could review a cash-flow statement. Without hesitation, my mother replied, 'I can assure you, sir, I don't see any cash flowing around here.' ""In 1961 the Totinos took their $50,000 savings and aimed for the frozen Italian entree business.The couple figured the frozen-pizza business was a better investment, but lacked the capital to enter the new field. Finally the Totinos obtained a loan from the federal Small Business Administration and in 1962 started Totino's Finer Foods, selling frozen pizza that could be baked at home.At the time, frozen pizza was nearly unheard of. And the Totinos had to figure out how to make the pizza for this novel package.Jim came up with a temporary solution. One day he came to work with an old phonograph turntable, the kind operated by a foot pedal. He replaced the arm with a plastic tube attached to a bucket of sauce.As he spun the crust on the turnstile, he squirted on sauce and added sausage and cheese, using the pedal as a stop-and-go lever.The record player gave way to more sophisticated equipment. Before long, the company operated a plant with two shifts of workers and became the first big name in the frozen-pizza industry and a national phenomenon.The business grew so much that in 1971 the Totinos built a $2.5 million plant in Fridley, Minn.Yet they couldn't meet the demand for frozen pizza.With Jim's health failing, Rose sold the company to Pillsbury of Minneapolis in 1975. At the time, Totino's Finer Foods had annual sales of $40 million and employed 375 people. In 2001, Pillsbury merged with General Mills (GIS), which kept the rights to Totino's.In a 1984 interview, Jerry Levin, Pillsbury's executive in charge of acquisitions, recalled his negotiations with Totino: ""We offered $16 million, saying it was a fair price.

3969,ICE,"The Record: Big media and left-leaning pundits are engaged in an effort to revise the history of Barack Obama's four years in the Oval Office. But the facts are clear: Obama is the biggest presidential failure in modern history.Obama is unique among presidents in large part because he fails to even recognize his deficiencies and mistakes — or when he does, he learns the wrong lessons and doubles down on his policies.Whether it's food stamp rolls that have swollen to 47 million, or the decline in household income that has left millions more with a lower standard of living, or the diminution of esteem for America around the world, Obama's time in office has been subpar.A by-no-means-exhaustive list of President Obama's deficient results follows. In four short years, he has:Produced an anemic recovery. Economic growth and job gains have been slower than in almost every other recovery on record. Had this rebound merely matched the post-World War II average, 8 million more people would have jobs and the GDP would be $1.2 trillion bigger. Since the recovery began, real GDP has expanded 7.2% vs. an average at this point since World War II of 15.8%. Put another way, since the start of the recovery, real GDP per person — a measure both of productivity and standard of living — has fallen an unprecedented 1.5%.Created a large pool of unemployed. Official figures vastly underestimate the severity of joblessness on Obama's watch. Millions have given up looking for work, for example, and don't get counted as unemployed. Between January 2009 and September 2012, the number of people who aren't in the labor force shot up 8.2 million, while the number of employed rose just 787,000. Unemployment today is 7.9% — higher than when Obama entered office.Vastly expanded the disability rolls. As job prospects diminished, millions of workers applied for federal disability benefits and more than 3.8 million were approved. Today, a record 8.3 million workers are on disability. The result is millions of workers who are likely never to return to the workforce, and billions of dollars in new Social Security and Medicare costs.Created a food stamp nation. In less than four years, the number of people receiving food stamps has shot up by 15 million. Today, almost one in six Americans is on food stamps. The lousy economy is one reason, but the Obama administration has also pushed to get more people enrolled.Massively increased regulations. The federal regulatory state is one of country's few growth industries under this administration, with increases in federal spending and regulatory jobs far outpacing the private sector. A Heritage Foundation analysis found that in his first three years, President Obama imposed nearly four times as many new rules as Bush did in his first three, with a combined annual price tag of $46 billion. In a second term, Obama's agenda could add $128 billion to a regulatory burden that now weighs in at $1.8 trillion.Hammered the middle class. Median household incomes have dropped 8%, more than during the recession that was ending when Obama took over. From his inauguration to the end of last year, real median household incomes fell 4.7% to $50,054. Only the top 20% have seen gains; every other income group lost ground.Created business uncertainty. In an interview with the Des Moines Register, the president noted businesses are sitting on huge amounts of cash. And indeed, companies have a record $1.5 trillion in liquid assets. Obama said his policies will help unlock this cash if he gets a second term, but they are what have kept this money bottled up due to uncertainty about taxes, regulations and health costs — not to mention ""you didn't build that.""In a recent poll by the National Association of Manufacturers and National Federation of Independent Business, 55% of businesses said they would not have started up in today's economy, and 69% said the current president's policies have hurt their business.Not lived up to the promises of transparency. The Washington Post, typically a reliable ally of the president, reported that ""new evidence suggests that administration officials have struggled to overturn the long-standing culture of secrecy in Washington."" Benghazi and Fast and Furious stand out among many other secrets the administration is keeping to itself.Increased the debt by 50%. When President Obama was a candidate, he promised he would halve the deficit by the end of his first term. Yet every budget since he's been in office has had a larger deficit than the year before and the debt, $10.6 trillion when took office, now exceeds $16 trillion. Rather than cut the deficit by 50%, he's increased the debt by that much. Worse, the long-term liabilities we owe are exploding — by one estimated, we now owe $76 trillion more than we'll take in over the next half century or so. We're on the path to potential insolvency, the magnitude of which the world has never seen.Pushed ObamaCare. This is the most costly legislation ever, and surely one of the least popular, with over half of Americans saying they don't like it. It will cost as much as $1.5 trillion over the next decade, while imposing new taxes on business and robbing $714 billion from Medicare to pay for it all.Driven up health care premiums. President Obama said he would ""bend the cost-curve down."" His reforms would cut the premium for the average family by $2,500 a year, he said, but ObamaCare has done the opposite — costing an extra $2,400, a bigger jump in the last four years than in the previous four under George W. Bush. Health care spending is up an average of $4,500 per individual, reports the Health Care Cost Institute.Left minorities worse off. ObamaCare threatens thousands of entry-level jobs, as small businesses and big restaurant chains like McDonald's, Red Lobster, Olive Garden and Denny's plan to eliminate full-time positions to avoid the new mandates. Real household incomes for both blacks (down 2%) and Hispanics (off 1.6%) have fallen, while their unemployment rates are up. Joblessness among black youth approaches 30%.Doubled down on the housing debacle. The Dodd-Frank financial reforms have damaged the U.S. economy by wrongly blaming Wall Street for the financial crisis. It was in fact caused by federal housing policies, starting with President Clinton and leading to Obama, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac out front.The two GSEs used a near-limitless supply of government-supported funding to push banks into lending to poor households, which couldn't pay the loans back.This was the start of the crisis. In 2007, Fannie and Freddie held or originated roughly $7 trillion of the $13 trillion in U.S. mortgages. Today, nearly 90% of all new mortgage activity is backed by the bankrupt giants, who have already cost U.S. taxpayers $160 billion and may end up costing $500 billion. Fannie and Freddie are still unreformed and unprivatized.Exploded spending and the deficit. Deficits have surged despite the president's pledge of a ""new era of responsibility."" This didn't happen because of ""Bush tax cuts."" No reputable study claims those cuts caused our trillion-dollar-plus deficits, which have added $5 trillion in debt in just four years. It was excessive spending.President Obama increased outlays to nearly 25% of GDP, a record. His plans envision roughly $47 trillion in new spending over the next decade. In the previous 10 years, just $25 trillion was spent. So spending will grow nearly 90%. Is it any wonder the U.S. has lost its AAA rating for the first time since 1917?Watched college costs surge. The talk was about making tuition more affordable for all. Tuition at four-year public colleges grew by 72% above inflation in the past decade, to an average of $8,244 last year, according to the College Board. Total student debt today is $1 trillion — more than $24,000 per graduate. The trend hasn't slowed under the president.Meanwhile, 50% of those who have graduated either can't find a job or are working in one that doesn't require a degree — a waste of a generation's skills, talent and training unmatched since the Great Depression.Dragged his feet on free trade. President Bush signed off on 17 new trade pacts, but President Obama has failed to sign any new agreements on his own watch. Meanwhile, China and the European Union have respectively signed or negotiated 19 and 25, winning new markets. Some 511 trade deals have been done around the world since 2007.Done nothing as crime has spiked. Violent crime has risen for the first time since 1993, with the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics' annual national crime victimization survey of 2012 reporting assaults up 22%, burglaries up 14%, thefts up 10% and property crimes up 11%. This may be the ultimate bitter fruit of Obamanomics: soaring crime as young people find they have no opportunities in a stagnant economy.Showed a lack of interest in his job. The commander in chief attended fewer than half of his national security briefings, failed to attend any of his jobs council meetings since 2010 and ignored his own bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Commission's recommendations on the budget. But he played more rounds of golf, had more date nights and spent more on White House dinners than any president in history. Blocked badly needed energy development. Obama has stood in the way of new sources of energy — from new pipelines to increased drilling — as gas, oil and electricity costs soared and America stood on the verge of technological revolution that would lead at last to energy independence.Killed the Keystone XL pipeline. If built, Keystone would transport an additional 830,000 barrels of oil per day to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast, including 100,000 barrels a day from the Bakken region of North Dakota and Montana. Its construction would create 20,000 jobs, and it would create hundreds of thousands more over its lifetime.Wasted billions on ""green energy"" jobs. After candidate Obama promised to create 5 million green jobs, just 355 direct jobs have been created annually — at a cost of $10 billion — since he took over. A classic example: Battery maker A123 Systems, which got a $250 million grant from ""stimulus"" money in 2009, created just 400 jobs before folding this year — about $300,000 a job. Now, those jobs are gone.All told, Obama has spent $86 billion on green stimulus, with nothing other than 50 bankrupt green companies to show for it — including Solyndra, First Solar and Ener1. He has also subsidized production of unsafe electric cars like the Chevy Volt, which few can afford or want to buy, and the Fisker Karma, a car built in Finland by Finnish auto workers.Waged a war on coal. While campaigning, Obama promised that if anyone built a coal-fired power plant under his watch, ""it will bankrupt them."" Since he's been in office, his Environmental Protection Agency has targeted coal for added regulations. Coal mines have been shut and jobs lost, and new coal plants are being required to install equipment that hasn't been fully developed yet.His EPA's regulatory bludgeon will kill an estimated 1.4 million jobs by 2020 and lead to a 23% jump in electric rates in states dependent on coal-fired plants due to EPA rules, fulfilling a 2008 campaign pledge to make electricity prices ""necessarily skyrocket.""Limited oil and gas exploration. Some 94% of federal onshore lands and 97% of federal offshore lands are now off-limits. That includes areas like the Green River Formation centered around Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, estimated to contain some 3 trillion barrels of recoverable crude oil — more than any other supply source on Earth. He's also kept Alaska's North Slope from being fully explored, keeping further millions of barrels of oil off the market as energy prices soar.Doubled gasoline prices by restricting supply. Gas prices were only $1.40 a gallon when he took office. The $2 difference in today's prices from where they were at the start of Obama's term adds $800 a year to the cost of operating a car that gets 25 miles per gallon and racks up 10,000 miles a year, a huge tax increase on the middle class, something he promised not to do.Restricted drilling permits. The Heritage Foundation reports that new drilling permits are down 88% from their historical average. Even shallow-water permits, supposedly unaffected by the moratorium, are down 11% from their high after a moratorium on deep-water drilling was imposed in the Gulf of Mexico.Opposed fracking and other new technologies. These new methods of extracting energy resources have increased oil production and created thousands of jobs on private lands. The EPA has pursued studies and supported environmentalists seeking to show fracking poisons drinking water, despite evidence that this long-used process is not harmful.Gutted our defense budget. Obama is slashing defense through direct cuts and a sequestration process agreed to as part of the Budget Control Act. Some $500 billion in defense-spending reductions are scheduled to kick in Jan. 2. These cuts come on top of the recently approved $487 billion in cuts to the Defense Department and threaten not only to jeopardize our national security but also gut our skilled defense workforce.Scrapped or cut badly needed weapons systems. Among these are the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. The Heritage Foundation says that since President Obama took office, more than 50 major weapons programs at a value of more than $300 billion have been cut or delayed, reducing our ability to keep pace with our growing number of potential adversaries.Given away missile defense to appease Russia. After saying he would push the ""reset"" button with our former enemy, the president disappointed allies Poland and the Czech Republic by canceling plans for missile defense sites on their territories. He then promised Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have ""more flexibility"" to further disarm after Tuesday's election.Downsized the military. The Navy will shrink from 300 ships to 238 and lose two carrier battle groups needed to project American power and influence. Strategic bombers will fall from 153 to 101. Air Force fighters would drop by more than half, from 3,602 aircraft to 1,512 planes.Mishandled the ""Arab Spring."" Obama encouraged revolts across North Africa that have now installed the Muslim Brotherhood and related extremist Islamic groups to power in places like Libya and Egypt. Just like President Carter did 33 years ago, Obama watched as a U.S. ally — Hosni Mubarak — was deposed in Egypt and replaced by extremists. Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, likewise, was replaced by extremists.Syria, a nation on which our secretary of state lavished praise, has murdered thousands to keep Bashar Assad, a puppet of the Russians and Iranians, in power. Strangely, in 2010, when legitimate revolts broke out in Iran against the mullahs, the U.S. went silent.Ignored the rise of China. The Middle Kingdom has just commissioned its first aircraft carrier and is rapidly building a blue water Navy. It has built its own stealth fighter, a carrier-killing ballistic missile and is threatening Japan and other neighbors over territorial claims in the East and South China Seas. China announced that its military budget in 2012 would rise 11.2% on top of a 12.7% increase last year.Weakened ties with Israel. The president has assured he ""has Israel's back."" But Israel now faces very real threats of annihilation, with little clear support from its long-time ally. Fundamentalists in Egypt threaten to break the 33-year old peace treaty. Hamas in Gaza shoots hundreds of rockets at Israel's cities, while in southern Lebanon Hezbollah makes terroristic threats.Worst of all, Iran now has enough uranium to make five nuclear bombs, and will soon do so. Yet, President Obama has repeatedly snubbed Israel and its leaders, and refuses to draw ""red lines"" for Iran's misbehavior.Shrunk our nuclear arsenal. In a quest to seek a ""world without nuclear weapons,"" the president is making the U.S. vulnerable to attack by rivals such as China and Russia, and rogue nations like Iran, North Korea and Pakistan that have nukes or may soon have them. The U.S. has about 5,000 warheads in its arsenal now, and the president's proposed reduction would take that down to 1,500 and eventually to 300. As our current arsenal ages, the commander-in-chief calls for a two-year delay in the development of a new generation of warheads.Surrendered U.S. sovereignty. Obama pushed the Law of the Sea Treaty, which would turn over freedom of navigation, formerly guaranteed by the U.S. Navy, to an International Seabed Authority run by Third World socialists and land-locked nations that would oversee a redistribution of the ocean's resources and wealth.Fumbled the pullout from Iraq and Afghanistan. He did this by understaffing ambitious nation-building operations, pulling out before Afghani and Iraqi troops were ready to defend themselves, and by announcing an inflexible pullout date from Afghanistan for purely political purposes, alerting our enemies. Thanks to Obama's ""hearts-and-minds"" strategy, which hamstrung our troops with impossible rules of engagement, the Taliban has surged instead.Two-thirds of U.S. deaths in Afghanistan have occurred since President Obama's surge. Hundreds have come at the hands of Taliban posing as Afghan security forces. With training now suspended over growing insider attacks, the Taliban has effectively sabotaged America's exit strategy. Yet instead of hitting harder, the U.S. is negotiating the release of their leaders from Gitmo. Net result: Iran is poised to take over or influence both countries.Lessened respect for the U.S. around the world. From the president of France remarking privately that President Obama was out of his league, to snide remarks from Chinese officials visiting the White House and commenting disapprovingly on U.S. debt, to Germany's refusal to take Obama's calls on the euro crisis and Britain's recent refusal to let U.S. ships dock at its Indian Ocean bases, it's clear the administration has lost influence around the world, even among allies and trading partners.More seriously, America's enemies pay little heed to the U.S. as it calls for nations such as Iran to heed its nuclear treaty obligations and Iran thumbs its nose at U.S. threats of sanctions. Venezuela, Cuba and Iran have all taken American hostages with little fear of retribution.Bailed out the auto industry and auto unions. Through the bailout, Obama rewarded the United Auto Workers union — a political ally — while wreaking havoc on 200 years of bankruptcy precedent, stiffing the bondholders, politically choosing which auto dealerships would live or die, and cheating the pension holders from the non-union Delphi workforce.Singled out companies for politicized attacks. President Obama accomplished this just as former EPA administrator Al Armendariz prescribed — by ""crucifying"" companies in public to make an example of them. Among the targets have been Toyota (over safety issues), BP (over the oil spill), Fox News (over its coverage) and Rush Limbaugh (over his radio commentary).Appointed unaccountable ""czars."" At one point, the president had 31 czars of this, that or the other thing (including green jobs, TARP, border and terrorism) all of them escaping congressional oversight. Through them, he has enacted major legal changes by regulatory order instead of through working with Congress. Done nothing about Fast and Furious gunrunning. The president continues to hide Justice Department correspondence under the guise of executive privilege on the Fast and Furious gunrunning case, which armed Mexico's cartels without Mexico's knowledge to whip up domestic support for gun control in the U.S.Politicized the Justice Department. Obama turned the Justice Department into a political creature, with Exhibit A being DOJ's failure to pursue voter intimidation recorded on film by Philadelphia's Black Panthers.Scrapped our space program. Rather than search and explore our solar system and beyond, the president turned NASA into a kind of global diversity organization. Asked what his priorities were when appointed, Obama's new head of NASA blithely answered ""Muslim outreach."" Meanwhile, the U.S. has few new options for sending payloads into space, while both Russia and China build and expand on their space capabilities.Not defended Americans abroad. This resulted in many casualties, not just in the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Libya, but in the shootings of two CIA employees in Mexico in 2012, the killing of ICE agent Jaime Zapata in Mexico in 2011, the borderland killing of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in 2010 and the hostage-taking of Alan Gross in Cuba in 2009. The State Department has noted a significant upsurge in imperiled Americans around the world from Venezuela to Iran.Rebooted rules that caused the subprime crisis. The president readopted the Clinton administration's regulatory guidelines for ""flexible"" underwriting. He has also ordered bank defendants to set aside millions in mortgages for minorities who, according to Justice Department documents, ""would ordinarily not qualify for reasons including the lack of required credit quality, income or down payment.""Mainstreamed the radical Muslim agenda. While the White House has rolled out the red carpet for Muslim Brotherhood leaders — despite their recently revealed goal of ""destroying"" America ""from within"" — the Justice Department has defended legal cases involving Sharia doctrine.Also at the request of Brotherhood leaders, it has bleached ""jihad"" and other Islamic references from counterterrorism training materials used by federal law enforcement. So sensitized has the government become that recent military exercises used ""zombies"" rather than our real living, breathing foes — radical Islamic fundamentalists — as opponents.Pushed stimulus and TARP. So much spending, so little result. Based on the Keynesian fallacy that government spending boosts the economy, the massive $862 billion stimulus bill and bailouts under TARP ended up being a goody-bag for politically connected companies and public-sector unions.At any rate, the idea that $1 of spending by government could somehow create more than $1 of economic activity in the private sector has been debunked. With 47 million people living in poverty and an estimated 23 million either without jobs or underemployed, the failure of Obama's stimulus to stimulate anything is clear.Quite a list, isn't it? In fact, we had to cut some things out for space considerations. No doubt, you can think of others. Suffice to say, Obama has not done his job well — and, as we say elsewhere, it's time for a change.

4006,ICE,"Crude oil futures fell Wednesday as concerns about the euro zone persisted, outweighing an unexpectedly large drop in U.S. stockpiles. Oil got a boost in early U.S. trade after U.S. government data showed steep drops in crude and refined product inventories, briefly lifting Brent crude to positive territory and extending U.S. crude's gains. The heavy drop came as crude imports…

4007,ICE,"Brent crude fell nearly 2% in light trading volume on Monday after Germany's finance minister said an upcoming European Union summit would not produce a definitive resolution to the euro zone debt crisis.West Texas intermediate, the U.S. contract, also declined. But analysts said its losses were limited by trading associated with November crude options expiration and with narrowing the spread between Brent and U.S. crude prices after the November Brent contract expired on Friday.ICE Brent crude for December fell $2.07 to settle at $110.16 a barrel, pushing under front-month Brent's 100- and 200-day moving averages after reaching $113.86.U.S. front-month November WTI crude fell just 42 cents to settle at $86.38 a barrel, having swung from $85.88 to $88.18.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said European governments would not present a definitive plan for the sovereign debt crisis at the Oct. 23 summit, curbing investor optimism about prospects for tackling the region's problems.""Germany's comments pulled oil back and the euro fell, strengthening the dollar,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at PFGBest Research.""The oil complex obviously got swept up in a de-risking phase that featured a sharp sell-off in the equity markets as well as the euro and industrial commodities,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president at Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note.""But, just as noteworthy were the sharp losses in the Brent futures relative to (WTI),"" Ritterbusch said.

It peaked at $2.4670. Total volume rose above 28,000 lots, the highest since Sept. 22, preliminary Thomson Reuters data showed.Heavy rains in Central America, where high-quality washed arabica beans are grown, helped lift the market, which rallied in heavy volume and attracted chart-based buying after hitting key levels, dealers said.The U.S. dollar hit a five-week low against a basket of currencies, making coffee more attractive to buyers holding currencies other than the greenback. Automatic buy stops and short-covering were triggered when the December arabica contract hit $2.3710 and $2.40 per pound, dealers said.A lack of origin selling due to concerns over crop damage in Central America allowed the market to jump. Additionally, producers in top-grower Brazil, where harvest was recently completed, held onto their beans and exporters there were viewed as oversold.

4042,ICE,"In sports, a team usually wins more games in its own ballpark. Companies too can benefit from home-field advantage. They can create it in a global economy no matter where they're based. Tips:
"
4043,ICE,"• Establish beachheads. Directors in boardrooms in London and New York simply don't know enough about doing business in China and India. So says John Quelch, who with Katherine Jocz wrote ""All Business Is Local."" Companies need boots on the ground. Some key decision-making has to be delegated to these local managers since they know the dynamics of their markets. ""Understanding place is critical to achieving corporate growth,"" Quelch told IBD.
"
4044,ICE,"• Promote location. Quelch says the famous four P's of marketing always list place last, behind product, price and promotion. ""But product without place, i.e., distribution, is like music without instruments,"" he said.
"
4045,ICE,"Customers associate quality for many products with their place of origin — such as German-engineered cars and Italian suits. ""French champagne set the standard in their categories,"" he said. ""If you can leverage your product's origin and wrap it in a special image, you can often price it higher. Think Perrier mineral water from France and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey.""
"
4046,ICE,"• Pay the price. Make it easy for customers to find your product, whether in physical locations or on the Internet. ""Ease of navigation is important in both physical and virtual space. Paying extra for prime placement can often pay off,"" Quelch said. He suggests paying a Web portal for a higher ranking of your business in search list.
"
4047,ICE,"• Pre-sell. Amy Cortese, author of ""Locavesting,"" cites the example of many restaurants doing this to stimulate business and raise capital. She says a restaurant might sell coupons for $1,000 that entitle buyers to $1,200 worth of meals over a year. ""The restaurant gets the cash it needs upfront in addition to a built-in base of customers, while the buyer gets a nice discount on meals,"" she said.
"
4048,ICE,"Quelch said Internet marketers can deliver local value to consumers based on where they live: ""Groupon does this with coupons, and Amazon often emails its core users with AmazonLocal deals.""
"
4049,ICE,"• Cater to clients. Many people want to give their loyalty to companies they know, love and believe in, ""rather than a faceless conglomerate whose business may be hard to comprehend,"" Cortese said.

4050,ICE,"She says the most visible way that entrepreneurs and established businesses have been tapping into the desire for local investing has been through a crowd-funding donation model. This raises lots of small sums from many people over the Internet, on sites like Kickstarter and IndieGoGo.
"
4051,ICE,"• Do it yourself. For firms that need to raise money but find banks not suitable for them, doing a direct public offering can be a good alternative. Businesses with a strong local following can raise money by reaching out to its customers to sell actual shares and ownership.
"
4052,ICE,"""The most famous example is probably Ben & Jerry's ice cream, which raised $750,000 from Vermont residents in a DPO in 1984,"" Cortese said. ""They advertised the shares with stickers on their ice cream cartons that read, 'Get a scoop of the action.' The money allowed the ice cream maker to build a new plant and expand distribution.""In sports, a team usually wins more games in its own ballpark. Companies too can benefit from home-field advantage. They can create it in a global economy no matter where they're based. Tips:• Establish beachheads. Directors in boardrooms in London and New York simply don't know enough about doing business in China and India. So says John Quelch, who with Katherine Jocz wrote ""All Business Is Local."" Companies need boots on the ground. Some key decision-making has to be delegated to these local managers since they know the dynamics of their markets. ""Understanding place is critical to achieving corporate growth,"" Quelch told IBD.• Promote location. Quelch says the famous four P's of marketing always list place last, behind product, price and promotion. ""But product without place, i.e., distribution, is like music without instruments,"" he said.Customers associate quality for many products with their place of origin — such as German-engineered cars and Italian suits. ""French champagne set the standard in their categories,"" he said. ""If you can leverage your product's origin and wrap it in a special image, you can often price it higher. Think Perrier mineral water from France and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey.""• Pay the price. Make it easy for customers to find your product, whether in physical locations or on the Internet. ""Ease of navigation is important in both physical and virtual space. Paying extra for prime placement can often pay off,"" Quelch said. He suggests paying a Web portal for a higher ranking of your business in search list.• Pre-sell. Amy Cortese, author of ""Locavesting,"" cites the example of many restaurants doing this to stimulate business and raise capital. She says a restaurant might sell coupons for $1,000 that entitle buyers to $1,200 worth of meals over a year. ""The restaurant gets the cash it needs upfront in addition to a built-in base of customers, while the buyer gets a nice discount on meals,"" she said.Quelch said Internet marketers can deliver local value to consumers based on where they live: ""Groupon does this with coupons, and Amazon often emails its core users with AmazonLocal deals.""• Cater to clients.

4053,ICE,"Arabica coffee futures on ICE soared nearly 5% in technical trading Tuesday, on heavy short-covering in a market that was seen as unsustainably oversold.It was arabica's biggest one-day jump in five months as speculators, who currently hold the biggest net short position in more than six years, appeared to panic that they were leaning too far.""The chart patterns are forcing their hand,"" said Jack Scoville, a vice president with the Price Group in Chicago.The active May arabica coffee contract surged 8.55 cents, or 4.8%, to finish at $1.8735 per pound, after rising to $1.8765. The front month hit a 17-month low at $1.7445 per pound last week.The market was technically oversold on the 14-day relative strength index for more than two weeks, and today's rally lifted the market up from this range. Total volume was heavy at nearly 40,000 lots, a six-week high, preliminary Thomson Reuters data showed.""I think it was technically oversold and funds came back in,"" said John Wolthers, a trader at Comexim in Santos, a key port town for Brazil's coffee shipments.Wolthers pointed out that the backdrop of a more positive economic outlook also helped.Automatic buy orders were triggered around $1.82 and again above $1.84, basis May, dealers said.As of March 20, speculators were holding their biggest net short position in arabica futures and options since the data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission was made available in 2006.

4054,ICE,"The turning point in his life was only seconds away, and Al Oerter didn't even realize it.
"
4055,ICE,"A high school sprinter on Long Island, N.Y., he was on a track when a discus landed near his feet.
"
4056,ICE,"Oerter, then 15, picked it up and casually tossed it back over the thrower's head.
"
4057,ICE,"The discus would never be the same. Oerter (1936-2007) went on to become the first athlete to win four Olympic gold medals and the only one to set four straight records in the Games.
"
4058,ICE,"He claimed discus gold in Melbourne, Australia (1956); Rome (1960); Tokyo (1964) and Mexico City (1968), even though he was never the favorite, never won the U.S. Olympic trials and was never the reigning world-record holder.
"
4059,ICE,"Except for 1956, he was behind after the first throw and twice went into the next-to-last round trailing the leader.
"
4060,ICE,"""Al Oerter knew how to flip the switch,'' Luke Sullivan, a top American discus thrower the past 20 years, told IBD. ""The day of the Olympics was his day to shine. Most people have one or two days that aren't going to go well. But he hit it every time.
"
4061,ICE,"""You can read all the books on how to perform under pressure. But certain guys have it, certain guys don't. His technique was somewhat flawed, but he was always able to bring it together for the big one. He just had a knack for winning.''
"
4062,ICE,"Cool In The Heat
"
4063,ICE,"Said Oerter several decades ago: ""Something happens to me when I get to the Games. The people, the pressure, everything. Pressure is opportunity.''
"
4064,ICE,"Oerter, who stood 6 feet 4 inches and competed at a weight up to 300 pounds, was also one of the last of the truly successful amateur athletes in track and field.
"
4065,ICE,"He never trained more than two hours a day and never had a coach. He was a regular worker, lasting 26 years as a computer expert for Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp. on Long Island.
"
4066,ICE,"The discus was simply Oerter's fun and recreation — until the quadrennial Olympics rolled around.
"
4067,ICE,"""That was one of the things I thought was so great and wonderful about Al,'' said Jay Silvester, a four-time Olympic discus thrower whose career overlapped with Oerter's. ""He worked all the time he was throwing. He was a down-to-earth guy, a good man.''
"
4068,ICE,"Oerter was born in Astoria, a neighborhood of the New York City borough of Queens. He played football, baseball and ran track before discovering the discus.
"
4069,ICE,"After improving his technique by studying a flip book, he set a New York state high school record — 184 feet 2 inches — and won a scholarship to the University of Kansas.
"
4070,ICE,"As a KU sophomore he qualified for the 1956 Olympics.
"
4071,ICE,"Not many gave Oerter, then 20, a shot at winning a medal in Melbourne. He had been throwing the plate at an advanced level for less than five years, never won a major international competition and wasn't ranked among the top five.
"
4072,ICE,"Yet Oerter rose Down Under.
"
4073,ICE,"On his first toss in the finals, he stunned his opponents, unleashing a throw of 184-11. It was an Olympic record and a personal best.
"
4074,ICE,"No one came within 5 feet of that mark, and Oerter finished with the three best throws.
"
4075,ICE,"On the podium receiving the gold medal, his knees buckled when he realized what he had done.
"
4076,ICE,"Less than a year later, Oerter's hopes for another gold almost ended in a near-fatal car crash.
"
4077,ICE,"Yet he recovered, headed back to the track and qualified for the 1960 Olympic team.
"
4078,ICE,"The gold medal winner in Rome was supposed to be Rink Babka, who entered the Games as the world record holder.
"
4079,ICE,"Indeed, the Wyoming native and University of Southern California star led in the early rounds.
"
4080,ICE,"Oerter struggled with his grip until none other than Babka told him he was carrying his left arm too low as he was spinning.
"
4081,ICE,"The sportsmanship was uplifting. On Oerter's next throw, the fifth of the event, he broke the Olympic record again with 194-2, once more the best he had thrown.
"
4082,ICE,"Babka took the silver.
"
4083,ICE,"""Once you've won it once or twice, you have the ability to do it again,'' Silvester said. ""You understand what it requires. Oerter kind of ruled the world for a while. It's the only time an American had done that in the discus.''
"
4084,ICE,"Then came more trouble.
"
4085,ICE,"In 1962 Oerter pinched a nerve in his neck that immobilized his left side when he tried to throw.
"
4086,ICE,"Doctors told him to quit, but he said nuts to that. He built a horse collar out of foam and plastic, went on throwing and qualified for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.
"
4087,ICE,"Then a week before the Games he slipped on a wet field and ripped cartilage loose in his rib cage. A doctor told him he risked internal bleeding, adding: ""You have two medals, kiddo. Enjoy the meet because you're not doing anything else.""
"
4088,ICE,"Yes He Was
"
4089,ICE,"Oerter received a shot of Novocain and covered himself with ice and tape from armpit to hip to prevent that bleeding.
"
4090,ICE,"""There are the Olympics, and you die before you don't compete in the Olympics,'' he said later.
"
4091,ICE,"His chances hardly had life in the early going in Tokyo. After three throws he trailed Ludvik Danek of Czechoslovakia by 7 feet.
"
4092,ICE,"So Oerter went for broke on his fifth throw — and shot off a howitzer of a toss: 200 feet 1 inch.
"
4093,ICE,"He was doubled over in pain by the time the discus landed for another Olympic record.
"
4094,ICE,"""You're not going to find that many people who can do that in great pain,'' Sullivan said. ""Every time you throw you know it's going to hurt like a son of a gun.'
"
4095,ICE,"By then Oerter was legendary for his composure under pressure and his capacity to rattle opponents.
"
4096,ICE,"""What he did definitely messes with someone's psyche,'' Sullivan said. ""They're almost waiting for you to do something. I'm sure the first time you (overcome adversity for the gold) it's a shock, but when you do it multiple times it's like Michael Jordan — you're just waiting for him to make that shot.''
"
4097,ICE,"Said Oerter: ""I simulated every possible competitive situation that might arise (during training). Wet weather, strong winds, throwing when I was injured. I was prepared for anything, physically and mentally.''
"
4098,ICE,"He sure was at the 1968 Games.
"
4099,ICE,"Flex And The City
"
4100,ICE,"Just as the athletes finished warming up for the finals, it started to rain in Mexico City. The downpour continued for an hour, with most of the tracksters taking cover.
"
4101,ICE,"Except Oerter.
"
4102,ICE,"He stayed out in the rain, taking one practice throw after another in the slippery cement circle.
"
4103,ICE,"""He had a little flair for the dramatic,'' Silvester said. ""He enjoyed being on (center stage).''
"
4104,ICE,"Added Oerter: ""Those other guys were huddled under umbrellas and blankets and losing their warm-ups, and I was staying loose. I knew I was going to win.''
"
4105,ICE,"Though he trailed after two rounds, Oerter unleashed the best throw of his life on his third attempt, setting an Olympic record of 212-6.
"
4106,ICE,"Oerter had done it, capturing the grand slam of Olympics.
"
4107,ICE,"The four-time champ mounted a comeback in the late 1970s, but his hopes to participate in the 1980 Games were dashed when America boycotted the Moscow event because of the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan a year earlier.
"
4108,ICE,"He later turned to abstract painting, with a traveling exhibit featuring artwork of former Olympians.
"
4109,ICE,"Carl Lewis was the only other track star to win the same event in four straight Olympics when he captured the long jump in 1984, 1988, 1992 and 1996. Oerter, however, is the only athlete to set an Olympic record in each of his victories.
"
4110,ICE,"Oerter died at age 71.
"
4111,ICE,"""There are mere mortals,"" said Pete Cava, a spokesman for the Athletics Congress of USA, ""and then there is Al Oerter.''The turning point in his life was only seconds away, and Al Oerter didn't even realize it.A high school sprinter on Long Island, N.Y., he was on a track when a discus landed near his feet.Oerter, then 15, picked it up and casually tossed it back over the thrower's head.The discus would never be the same.

Darrell Issa, R-Calif., that the deadly operation was conceived to advance the administration's gun-control agenda is quite plausible.""Here's the real answer as to gun control,"" Issa said on ABC's ""This Week"": ""We have email from people involved in this that are talking about using what they're finding here to support the — basically assault weapons — ban or greater reporting.""Issa was asked about the possible connection after comments he made at an NRA convention. ""Could it be,"" he said on NRA News' ""Cam & Company"" program, ""that what they really were thinking of was in fact to use this walking of guns in order to promote an assault weapons ban? Many think so. And they haven't come up with an explanation that would cause any of us not to agree.""Perhaps the answer is in the documents that Holder and Obama are risking much to hide. As we observed recently, the way Fast and Furious, the government's gun-running operation, was executed made no sense unless its intended purpose was to facilitate violence with U.S. weapons in the interests of pursuing the administration's gun-control agenda.As Issa noted on ""This Week,"" the Department of Justice announced on April 25, 2011, ""right in the middle of the scandal,"" that it was requiring some 8,500 gun stores in Arizona, California, Texas and New Mexico to report individual purchases of multiple rifles of greater than .22 caliber by law-abiding American citizens to the ATF because such guns are ""frequently recovered at violent crime scenes near the Southwest border.""Like the ATF-supplied guns found next to the body of Brian Terry?Coincidence? We think not. On July 14, 2010, roughly five months before Agent Terry's murder, ATF Field Ops Assistant Director Mark Chait emailed Bill Newell, ATF's Phoenix special agent in charge of Fast and Furious. ""Bill,"" the email read, ""can you see if these guns were all purchased from the same (licensed gun dealer) and at one time? We are looking at anecdotal cases to support a demand letter on long gun sales. Thanks.""A Jan. 24, 2011, email showed Newell saw it as an opportunity ""to address (the) Multiple Sales on Long Guns issue."" Chait emailed Newell that ""this case could be a strong supporting factor if we can determine how many multiple sales of long guns occurred during the course of the case.""These documents, and perhaps others that have been withheld, show that Fast and Furious was intended not to interdict gun trafficking, but to make the administration's case for more gun control. According to Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, ""There's plenty of evidence developing that the administration planned to use the tragedies of Fast and Furious as rationale to further their goals of a long gun reporting requirement.""Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others in the administration had been pushing the discredited line that 90% of guns seized in Mexico came from the U.S. as justification for stricter gun laws and reporting rules.The final damning evidence that Fast and Furious was a gun-control plot just may be in the documents the administration is fast and furiously trying to hide.

4141,ICE,"At 35, Edgar Rice Burroughs had a resume full of failure.
"
4142,ICE,"He flunked the West Point entrance exam and then was booted out of the Army for a weak heart.
"
4143,ICE,"He drifted from job to job, working as a railway cop and selling pencil sharpeners.
"
4144,ICE,"With time to spare, he began reading pulp magazines and realized he could create better stories.
"
4145,ICE,"In 1912, his first tales about Tarzan of the Apes and John Carter of Mars were published.
"
4146,ICE,"Since then, his novels have sold 100 million copies, as many as Lewis Carroll, Anne Rice, Ian Fleming and Ken Follett.
"
4147,ICE,"Burroughs (1875-1950) grew up in Chicago, the son of a Civil War veteran and prosperous businessman, with a mother who had a staff of three. It was a proper Victorian household, and Edgar was expected to do well at everything.
"
4148,ICE,"He didn't. From an early age his mind wandered from his studies to writing poetry and drawing humorous sketches. He was often out of school because of illness.
"
4149,ICE,"But he did have an ability to bounce back from failure.
"
4150,ICE,"In 1892 he was sent to his two older brothers' Idaho ranch in 1891 to avoid a flu epidemic. His first attempt to ride a mean bronco nearly got him killed, but he got right back on until the horse calmed down. The rough life of the ranch built up his physique and health.
"
4151,ICE,"After flunking out of the prestigious Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and entering a military school, Burroughs joined the Army, but was out a year later.
"
4152,ICE,"He returned to Idaho to work at his brothers' stationery shop, then went to Chicago to spend three years at his father's battery store.
"
4153,ICE,"He was bored to death by retail and went into a gold mining venture, which failed. Then it was on to a series of sales jobs, including hawking light bulbs to janitors and peddling books door-to-door.
"
4154,ICE,"Rich With Ideas
"
4155,ICE,"Penniless, he decided to try writing, but had no grasp of storytelling construction. He wrote half a novel about John Carter's adventures on Mars and sent it off to All-Story magazine in early 1912. The editor liked it and asked for the rest, to be run February to July. Burroughs was shocked to get a $400 check.
"
4156,ICE,"His next story was about an infant whose English parents, Lord and Lady Greystoke, are put ashore in West Africa by a mutinous crew. The parents are killed by apes, who adopt the boy. His name?
"
4157,ICE,"Tarzan, King of the Apes.
"
4158,ICE,"He later meets a French naval officer and learns French, then is taught English by Jane Porter and her father, who have been abandoned by their boat crew.
"
4159,ICE,"Reviews helped bolster sales. The New York Times declared it ""a story of many marvels, told well.""
"
4160,ICE,"Burroughs realized that he had signed away secondary rights to his early stories and these were worth something in syndication. He insisted on retaining them in his later contracts.
"
4161,ICE,"""Burroughs was distinctive for his time in treating writing as a business and was one of the earliest to make a full-time living writing fantasy and science fiction,"" Matt Cohen, who teaches English at the University of Texas, told IBD. ""He had a chart on his wall which showed how many words he had written each month. He stuck to what he knew he was good at, popular fiction, which he regarded as primarily for entertainment, rather than serving some highbrow literary purpose. But within that genre he kept tinkering with ways to tap into a mass market, and it's hard to think of another very successful author who continued to get so many rejection letters.""
"
4162,ICE,"Burroughs' lesson: Even if you are successful in a niche, continue to innovate and take risks to push the boundaries of that field.
"
4163,ICE,"At the time, writers had few protections; their characters were easily imitated by other writers. Copyright renewal also had a narrow window often missed by heirs.
"
4164,ICE,"""He did a couple of things which were incredibly clever,"" said Cohen. ""In 1923, he incorporated himself, which meant that heirs could retain experts not only in literary copyrights who would make sure they were properly renewed, but specialists in intellectual property generally. He also trademarked his characters so that they could not be knocked off so easily.""
"
4165,ICE,"By the 1930s, Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc. was printing and distributing his books, which he continued to write at a furious pace. He completed 70, including novels set in the American West and in Roman times. Most are still in print.
"
4166,ICE,"Several dozen Tarzan movies were made, starting with a silent film in 1918, ""Tarzan of the Apes,"" one of Hollywood's first six flicks to gross more than $1 million.
"

4173,ICE,"""Burroughs had his own problems with the studios,"" said Brendan Mathews, who teaches literature at Bard College at Simon's Rock in Great Barrington, Mass. ""He wasn't happy with the way that some later Tarzan movies portrayed his King of the Apes, downplaying his cultured, aristocratic side that eventually emerges in the stories in favor of a more brutish 'me Tarzan, you Jane' type of hero. But he was proud of what he created and very practical, so if the latest movie does fail, he would focus on setting up deals for a John Carter video game, a series on Cartoon Network and an app for the iPad.""
"
4174,ICE,"Before the movie cameras rolled, Hollywood experts told Burroughs that his efforts to capitalize on his characters' popularity were too ambitious, that offering too many products would leave less money for each market segment. He proved them wrong big-time.
"
4175,ICE,"""Burroughs was an amazing innovator, one of the first writers to realize that the new media of his day — silent films — weren't competitors with his novels, but would actually spur more interest in the whole Tarzan franchise,"" said Mathews. ""He was smart enough not to fear that other media would cannibalize each other, recognizing that they could collaborate to drive interest, so in 1912 his first Tarzan story ran in a magazine, in 1914 the first Tarzan novel was published, and he sold his movie rights in 1916.

4180,ICE,"Burroughs was proud that he never had to hire a publicist, always making himself available for interviews to promote his books and their offspring.
"
4181,ICE,"According to John Taliaferro, author of ""Tarzan Forever,"" Burroughs in some years made more than $100,000 — worth $1.5 million today — but spent lavishly, including the purchase of fast cars, thoroughbreds and a 540-acre ranch in Los Angeles.

4206,ICE,"Robert Rich was a young dairy man in 1945 in Buffalo, N.Y., trying to launch a nondairy alternative to whipped cream.
"
4207,ICE,"The tinkerer had packed his soy-based concoction with dry ice to keep it cool on his long hot summer train ride across the state to make his case on Long Island.

4216,ICE,"Rich (1913-2006) was born in Buffalo. His father, Paul, owned Rich Ice Cream Co., a large independent producer. After college, the son borrowed $5,000 from his dad to start his own dairy career. Soon it was one of Western New York's largest independent milk distributors.
"
4217,ICE,"So why nondairy dessert topping?
"
4218,ICE,"Rich wasn't exactly lactose intolerant. He just didn't think all that much of cows. He saw them as difficult animals. Their offerings spoil fast. And the quality of the milk was inconsistent, varying widely with the animal's diet. He often called the cow ""this country's most inefficient manufacturing plant.""
"
4219,ICE,"After America entered World War II in late 1941, most of the nation's milk production was earmarked for the troops overseas. A dollop of whipped cream on top of a slice of pie was a luxury a nation at war couldn't afford.

4220,ICE,"But soybeans were plentiful. Rich saw an opportunity.
"
4221,ICE,"The government appointed Rich — because of his successful dairy business — to a post in Detroit administering dairy distribution and rationing in Michigan. That's when he learned that car pioneer Henry Ford was dabbling with soybeans to develop things the war was making scarce.

4250,ICE,"""He treated customers as if they were part of the family of Rich Products, and customers knew they could count on him,"" Kitchens said. ""They could call him up and he would deal with it.""The sales pitch could have ended even before it began.Robert Rich was a young dairy man in 1945 in Buffalo, N.Y., trying to launch a nondairy alternative to whipped cream.The tinkerer had packed his soy-based concoction with dry ice to keep it cool on his long hot summer train ride across the state to make his case on Long Island.When he finally got there, the cream that he planned to whip had frozen into a solid block. Undeterred, he broke off a piece, put it in a mixer and worked up the mess.It soon thawed and turned into the smoothness of real whipped cream. Remarkably, the flavor hadn't died in the freezing process.Because his new product could hold up in the freezer — something dairy whipped cream couldn't do — his dessert topping had a much longer shelf life. And it was cheaper than the dairy version.It was a hit.Rich's Whip Topping was the product that launched Buffalo-based Rich Products, a frozen foods giant and one of the nation's largest privately held companies.BillionsThe still family-owned Rich Products says it has $2.9 billion in annual sales and sells more than 2,000 products in 100 countries.""His contributions are legendary (with) what he's done for our industry both on the retail side and the food service side,"" Skip Shaw, CEO of the National Frozen & Refrigerated Foods Association, told IBD. ""Someone like Mr. Rich was really on the leading edge when frozen food was introduced to the consumers. He and Clarence Birdseye are the folks we hang our hat on as the true innovators of frozen foods.""Rich (1913-2006) was born in Buffalo. His father, Paul, owned Rich Ice Cream Co., a large independent producer. After college, the son borrowed $5,000 from his dad to start his own dairy career. Soon it was one of Western New York's largest independent milk distributors.So why nondairy dessert topping?Rich wasn't exactly lactose intolerant. He just didn't think all that much of cows. He saw them as difficult animals. Their offerings spoil fast. And the quality of the milk was inconsistent, varying widely with the animal's diet. He often called the cow ""this country's most inefficient manufacturing plant.""After America entered World War II in late 1941, most of the nation's milk production was earmarked for the troops overseas. A dollop of whipped cream on top of a slice of pie was a luxury a nation at war couldn't afford.But soybeans were plentiful. Rich saw an opportunity.The government appointed Rich — because of his successful dairy business — to a post in Detroit administering dairy distribution and rationing in Michigan. That's when he learned that car pioneer Henry Ford was dabbling with soybeans to develop things the war was making scarce.Ford was ahead of Rich with milk substitutes and even used some soy-based plastic in his cars.Rich originally intended to license that technology from Ford Motor, but executives at the industrial giant balked after worrying about the impact on Ford tractor sales to dairy farmers, according to an account in the Economist magazine.

4251,ICE,"Security: The president insists he wasn't trying to ""hide the ball"" until after the election, but the man who as candidate pledged to ""end misguided defense policies"" such as missile defense is fulfilling that campaign promise.Despite the administration's rap-dancing with the help of the usual suspects in the mainstream media, it's clear that the recent meeting between President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in Seoul, South Korea, couldn't be more different in tone and meaning from the one President Ronald Reagan had with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 1986.President Obama has tried to explain away his open-mic gaffe when he told Medvedev that he would have more ""flexibility"" on missile defense after our November election.He told reporters at the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul that he was merely talking about the difficulty of dealing with sensitive issues in a politically charged election year for both countries.""This is not a matter of hiding the ball,"" Obama said. Oh, but it is — and his own words as a candidate in 2008 expose that lie and the fact that the president is indeed fulfilling campaign promises to unilaterally disarm the U.S. and pursue a world without nuclear weapons, particularly the American variety.Obama's defense budgets and policies are the fulfillment of a campaign promise made to the far-left group, Caucus for Priorities, a month before the January 2008 Iowa caucuses. Caucus for Priorities is an offshoot of a bigger group, the Priorities Action Fund, created by Ben Cohen, the peace activist and co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream.In a video made for the group, Obama called for a further deterioration in our military strength. ""I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems,"" he pledged. ""I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems."" So far, he has kept his word.In that video, candidate Obama also pledged, ""I will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons. To seek that goal, I will not develop new nuclear weapons, I will seek a global ban on the production of fissile material and I will negotiate with Russia to take our ICBMs off hair-trigger alert, and to achieve deep cuts in our nuclear arsenals."" He has kept that promise as well.A sycophantic press has spent more time gasping at Rick Santorum's language to a New York Times reporter than to Obama's revelatory gaffe, ""No shock or awe there,"" Bloomberg News actually wrote in an editorial.The Washington Post barely covered the story, except as just another technical goof-up with a microphone.When Reagan met with Gorbachev in Reykjavik, there was no talk of special relationships or reset buttons, only a commitment by the leader of the free world to the defense of the United States against nuclear missile attack. In Seoul, Obama told the Russians to be patient and the rest of their wishes will be granted.Past and future Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a hint of what Obama's ""flexibility"" might mean in an interview earlier this month. ""(U.S. negotiators) made some proposals to us, which we virtually agreed to and asked them to get them down on paper,"" Putin said during an interview with editors-in-chief of six foreign newspapers.Among proposals Putin said U.S. negotiators wouldn't put in writing was an agreement to have Russian specialists conduct round-the-clock monitoring of the anti-missile components, and the radar system would be cemented so they were directed exactly at Iran and ""were technically unable to turn toward Russia.""Obama is hiding the ball and has masked his disarmament and appeasement in the context of budget necessities, not ideological commitment.What has he promised the Chinese, with whom he also met in Seoul? Or the Iranians? Will Israel be thrown under the Iranian bus after November? Obama has already betrayed NATO allies Poland and the Czech Republic on missile defense.More importantly, will President Obama throw America under the bus, as he promised to do in 2008?

"
4279,ICE,"Coming soon after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of Arizona's immigration and border enforcement law, the Justice Department's release of a scathing report Thursday accusing Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio of violating federal law and the Constitution in his department's handling of Hispanics smacks of retaliation.
"
4280,ICE,"With a thoroughness not seen in Justice's handling of the ""Fast and Furious"" federal gun-running debacle that resulted in the murder of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry a year ago, Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez, head of the department's Civil Rights Division, listed Arpaio's alleged excesses and said a three-year civil investigation found that the sheriff and his deputies engaged in unconstitutional conduct and violations of federal law that jeopardized his ""commitment to fair and effective"" law enforcement.
"
4281,ICE,"Arpaio has described himself as ""America's toughest lawman.""

"
4282,ICE,"No doubt Arpaio has been under scrutiny for some time. But the timing of the announcement is curious, not only because of the announced Supreme Court review of SB1070, but also because it can be seen as another attempt to rally the president's Hispanic base as we enter an election year, and to portray border security advocates as racist and anti-Latino.

"
4289,ICE,"What makes this case interesting, as the Washington Examiner's Byron York has reported, is that in September 2008, nine months before DOJ first informed Arpaio of its investigation, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted its own investigation of Arpaio's office and procedures and found nothing inappropriate or illegal.

""DHS will not be a party to such practices.""Accordingly, and effective immediately, DHS is terminating (the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office's) 287(g) jail model agreement and is restricting the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office access to the Secure Communities program.""Napolitano, it should be noted, recently sent letters to Congress announcing a backdoor amnesty program, saying she has the authority on a case-by-case basis to ignore the nation's immigration laws and halt the deportation of illegal aliens not perceived to be a criminal threat as long as they meet certain administration-determined criteria.DHS has memoranda of agreement (MOAs) with around 70 state and local law enforcement agencies to participate in 287(g) partnerships to enforce federal law. Under the 287(g) program, Arpaio's deputies could question jail inmates about their immigration status.What makes this case interesting, as the Washington Examiner's Byron York has reported, is that in September 2008, nine months before DOJ first informed Arpaio of its investigation, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted its own investigation of Arpaio's office and procedures and found nothing inappropriate or illegal.The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) has 189 officers trained under the federal 287(g) program to enforce federal immigration laws. According to the ICE report, ""The OI (Homeland Security's Office of Investigation) and DRO (Detention and Removal Operations office) consider the conduct and performance of the MCSO ... officers to be professional and meeting the standards of the MOA.""Not according to an administration that plans to halve the number of National Guard troops on the border and set up unmanned border kiosks so border crossers can check themselves through. Heck, it's not as if Arpaio was a member of the New Black Panther Party.

4324,ICE,"Last month, at a Raeford, N.C., elementary school, a teacher confiscated the lunch of a 5-year-old girl because it didn't meet U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines and therefore was deemed non-nutritious. She replaced it with school cafeteria chicken nuggets.The girl's home-prepared lunch was nutritious; it consisted of a turkey and cheese sandwich, potato chips, a banana and apple juice.But whether her lunch was nutritious or not is not the issue. The issue is governmental usurpation of parental authority.In a number of states, pregnant teenage girls may be given abortions without the notification or the permission of parents. The issue is neither abortion nor whether a pregnant teenager should get one. The issue is: What gives government the authority to usurp parental authority?Part of the problem is that people who act as instruments of government do not pay a personal price for usurping parental authority. The reason is Americans, unlike those of yesteryear, have become timid and, as such, come to accept all manner of intrusive governmental acts.Can you imagine what a rugged American, such as one portrayed by John Wayne, would have done to a government tyrant who confiscated his daughter's lunch or facilitated her abortion without his permission?I believe that the anti-tobacco movement partially accounts for today's compliant American. Tobacco zealots started out with ""reasonable"" demands, such as the surgeon general's warning on cigarette packs.Then they demanded nonsmoking sections on airplanes. Emboldened by that success, they demanded no smoking at all on airplanes and then airports and then restaurants and then workplaces — all in the name of health.Seeing the compliant nature of smokers, they've moved to ban smoking on beaches, in parks and on sidewalks in some cities. Now they're calling for higher health insurance premiums for smokers. Had the tobacco zealots demanded their full agenda when they started out, they would not have achieved anything.Using the anti-tobacco crusade as their template and finding Americans so compliant, zealots and would-be tyrants are extending their agenda. Why not control what we eat? San Francisco, Chicago and several other cities have outlawed or seek to outlaw foie gras in restaurants.Here's my challenge to these people: Don't be a coward and use the state to accomplish your agenda. If you see Williams eating foie gras, just come up and take it off his plate.Other food tyrants want to stop us from eating Dove and Haagen-Dazs ice cream, Mrs. Fields cookies and McDonald's Chicken McNuggets.San Francisco has already banned McDonald's from selling Happy Meals with toys to children. Seeing San Franciscan compliance may have been the source of inspiration for the North Carolina schoolteacher who took the 5-year-old girl's lunch.Americans have become compliant in nation-crippling ways. Over the past several years, gasoline prices have been shooting through the roof, but not to worry.President Barack Obama's current secretary of energy, Steven Chu, said in December 2008, ""Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe."" That translates to $8 or $9 a gallon.During a recent hearing on the Department of Energy's budget, Secretary Chu was asked whether it is the DOE's ""overall goal"" to lower gas prices. ""No,"" Chu responded. ""The overall goal is to decrease our dependency on oil, to build and strengthen our economy.""Because Americans are so compliant and willing to suffer silently at the gasoline pump, the Obama administration is willing to press on as handmaidens of environmental extremists who want to halt the exploration of our country's vast oil supplies, which are estimated to be triple those of Saudi Arabia.The Obama administration would rather pour more taxpayer dollars into risky alternative crony energy suppliers and electric cars.The OPEC nations have to be laughing at us, and I wouldn't be surprised if it were revealed that they are making under-the-table payments to environmental wackos.

4340,ICE,"The first quarter of the year was a real roller coaster ride in the U.S. equity markets.  A big run-up in January was followed by an even bigger slide in February.  After peaking at 2782 on January, the S&P 500 index plunged to 2581 on February 8th.  Unfortunately, the nauseating ride wasn’t over and we saw several more large daily moves throughout February and March that helped move the CBOE volatility index (VIX - the market’s “fear gauge”) to a peak of 37 – a multi-year high.Things have settled down considerably recently, with the S&P 500 basically unchanged on the year and the VIX back in the mid-teens – close to its historical average.Clearly a lot of money changes hands during the tumultuous first quarter of 2018, and big banks Q1 results show it.  Both Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) beat Zacks Consensus Sales Estimates, aided by improved trading and brokerage revenue.But what other companies might be the beneficiaries of the wild ride of the past few months?Let’s take a look at an exchange that facilitates the trades that occur during volatile periods.Chicago Trading PowerhouseSince its inception as the Chicago Butter and Egg Board in 1898, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) has been a constant innovator in the creation and trading of futures and options products. After a merger with its crosstown rival the Chicago Board of Trade in 2007 and the acquisition of the New York mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the New York Commodities Exchange (COMEX) in 2008, the CME has emerged as the world’s leading marketplace for derivatives on agricultural commodities, equity indexes, interest rates, currencies, oil and precious metals.The CME makes approximately 86% of its revenues from transaction and clearing fees on trades - with the balance coming from access/communication fees and selling market data.During periods of market volatility, market participants of all stripes turn to the CME’s deep and liquid markets to hedge risk and/or speculate on future price movements.  Originally an open outcry exchange where traders and brokers transacted business in person on a trading floor, the CME now does upwards of 90% of its volume on its Globex electronic platform. “The Merc” as it’s known to Chicago locals consistently outpaces similar exchanges CBOE Global Markets (CBOE  -  Free Report) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE  -  Free Report).The first Quarter of 2018 was no exception.  Growing Volumes Equal Growing RevenuesThanks to huge interest in Interest Rate and Equity futures and options, the CME has increased trading volumes in 2018 by 28% over the same period in 2017.  Because its cost structure is relatively fixed, a big portion of additional trading volumes goes straight to the bottom line.Here are the 2018 YTD volume figures from the CME website:                                                                                                   Zacks consensus Estimates for CME’s revenue from transaction and clearing fees in Q1 is $865M, an increase of 9% from the $792M they reported in Q1 of 2017.                                                                                             A quick look at the volume data shows that 1.35 Billion contracts have traded at the CME so far this year, almost 28% higher than the same period in 2017.  Analysts are taking notice with 4 upgrades in the past 30 days, bringing the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate for 2018 to $6.86/share from $6.22/share 90 days ago and 44% higher than the $4.77/share reported in 2017.                                                                                                       Rising earnings estimates are a bullish indicator for a stock’s price and thanks to these upgrades, CME earns a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

While U.S. equity options volume expanded 23.1% year over year to 474 million contracts, European options and futures volumes were 22.3 million contracts in the quarter, up 2.8% year over year.However, revenues per contract for U.S. equity options declined by a penny to 15 cents, though the same for European options and futures increased 11.9% to 47 cents.Under its cash equities, Nasdaq’s U.S. matched equity volume in the first quarter totaled 88.6 billion shares, up 18.6% from the prior-year quarter. While the European equity volume rose 26.2% year over year to $260 billion. Again, the U.S. Fixed income volume augmented 2.3% year over year to $5.2 billion. Whereas the European fixed income volume was 8.3 million contracts, up 15.3% year over year.Nasdaq’s strategic initiatives have always accelerated growth. Improvement in non-transaction revenue base including market technology, listing and information revenues, has been driving revenues.

4346,ICE,"MarketAxess Holdings Inc.’s (MKTX  -  Free Report) revenues have been consistently growing since 2005 (except 2008 when revenues declined just 0.6%). Revenues have witnessed a CAGR of 13% from 2012-2017. This top-line growth was primarily driven by persistent increase in commission (which forms the lion’s share of total revenues) received on trading volumes. The same was up 11.4% in the first quarter of 2018. The company has been successful in increasing its trading volumes by way of inorganic and organic strategies.Its efforts of pursuing international opportunities, a compelling economic market model and a diversified product suite of the coveted U.S. high-grade floating rate and other credit bonds to broaden the scope of volumes growth for MarketAxess, going forward, will further drive commission revenues. The company is also witnessing an uptick in post-trade and services revenues mainly due to MiFID II implementation fees.MarketAxess supplements its organic growth by entering into strategic alliances, or by acquiring businesses or technologies, which enable it to enter new markets, provide new products or services. Some of the notable deals to this end included the acquisition of Xtrakter Limited which provided the company with an expanded set of technology solutions; a strategic alliance with BlackRock, Inc. which improved the range of trading connections available to global credit market participants; agreement with S&P Dow Jones Indices to jointly develop indices that will track the most liquid segments of the U.S. corporate bond market. The company’s inorganic growth which has also aided top-line growth remains impressive.The company has been able to fund its acquisition backed by its strong liquidity position. Notably, it has been generating free cash flow from past several years. Strong liquidity not only mitigates balance-sheet risks, but also paves the way for an accelerated capital deployment in employees, trading platform, new products, geographic expansion and infrastructure.The company remains focused on enhancing shareholders’ value through share buy and dividend hikes. Earlier this year, the company raised dividend by 27%, marking eight consecutive years of dividend hike.While MarketAxess’ growth strategy has led to noticeable increase in the top and bottom line, escalating costs remain a significant headwind. Total expenses increased at 13% on average from 2013-2017, thereby weighing on the company’s margins. In the first quarter of 2018, the same was up 14% year over year. We expect the company’s expenses to rise over the coming quarters given its ongoing investments in several areas including trading platform, new protocols and infrastructure as well as headcount additions. Notably, for 2018, the company anticipates total expenses in the range of $220-$232 million. The midpoint of this range reflects about 15% year-over-year increase in expenses.Year to date, the stock has gained 1.2%, compared with the industry’s growth of 6.9%. Though this performance pales in comparison with the growth of 18.9%, 13.3%, 5.8% for Nasdaq, Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report), CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) and Intercontinental Exchange Inc.

Last quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.41%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Intercontinental Exchange’s results are likely to have benefited from a strong performance in data and listing as well as trading and clearing segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to-be-reported period is pegged at 72 cents on revenues of $1.15 billion.

Also, it estimates fourth-quarter expenses to be about $480 million.Nonetheless, the company forecasts 2017 synergies of minimum $70 million, up from the prior guidance of $60 million.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Intercontinental Exchange is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have the right combination of the two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for an earnings beat. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Intercontinental Exchange has an Earnings ESP of -0.12%.

Price and EPS Surprise | Intercontinental Exchange Inc. Quote Zacks Rank: Intercontinental Exchange carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. A company, however, needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to surpass expectations this time around are as follows:The Carlyle Group L.P. (CG  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 7. The company has an Earnings ESP of +5.23% and a Zacks Rank #3.

4356,ICE,"We expect the securities exchange Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) to surpass expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, before the market opens.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Intercontinental Exchange has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.33%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 76 cents is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents. This positive ESP is a leading indicator of a likely earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Intercontinental Exchange holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have significantly higher chances of beating on earnings.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Intercontinental Exchange is likely to report bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, driven by growth across the company’s data and listings business segments, strong volumes and open interest growth in futures markets.The securities exchange has also likely witnessed a rise in revenues in the second quarter, fueled by higher data services as well as increased listings revenues.Also, a continued share buyback should have boosted the bottom line.However, the company might have incurred higher total operating expenses in the second quarter, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, technology and communication as well as selling, general and administrative expenses.Notably, Intercontinental Exchange remains on track toward its full-year expense guidance. To that end, the securities exchange has projected adjusted expenses in the second quarter to range between $485 million and $495 million.With respect to the earnings trend, this company delivered positive surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.44%.Intercontinental Exchange Inc.

4357,ICE,"Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, before the opening bell.Last quarter, this health insurer surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14.83%. In spite of higher costs associated with the termination of the merger agreement with Humana Inc. (HUM), the company displayed bottom-line improvement.The company has a decent surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded estimates on each occasion, delivering an average positive surprise of 8.62%. This is depicted in the graph below:Aetna Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Aetna Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Aetna Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackAetna’ results will continue to suffer from the ongoing losses in its Individual Commercial Affordable Care Act-compliant products sold on public exchanges. Consequently, the company has scaled back its footprint on many exchanges to reduce its risk exposure to these products. In the first quarter, revenues suffered from lower membership in the ACA compliant individual and small group products and the same is expected in the to-be-reported quarter.Its commercial membership will also feel the strain as employers prefer to stay self-insured.The company’s Government business which consists of Medicare and Medicaid is has been performing well for the past many quarters. With ever-increasing demand for these products from the growing population of baby boomers, we expect to see higher sales from this business in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s focus on managing costs will keep a check on its operating expenses. As a result of these cost-control initiatives, adjusted operating expense ratio declined in 2016 and through the first quarter of 2017. We expect the trend to continue in the second quarter, providing an extra cover to margins.In the first quarter, Aetna resumed its share buyback which was terminated due to its planned merger with Humana. Share repurchases made by the company in the second quarter will help to lift its earnings.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Aetna is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Aetna has an Earning ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.34 per share is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) will report second-quarter 2017 earnings results on Aug 3.

This was mainly due to higher operating expenses related to the acquisitions closed in 2016. As of Jun 30, 2017, Nasdaq achieved $60 million in annualized run-rate cost synergies. Besides, the company estimated $10-$20 million in additional synergies to be realized post completion of other platform consolidations.Notably, the company tightened the upper end of its 2017 non-GAAP operating expense to the range of $1.26–$1.29 billion from $1.26–$1.30 billion guided earlier.Segment wise, net revenue at Market Services jumped 14.4% from the year-ago quarter to $222 million. The upside was driven by higher revenues from the ISE and higher European cash equities revenues.Revenues at Corporate Services increased 1.2% year over year to $164 million.

4363,ICE,"We expect securities exchange CME Group Inc (CME  -  Free Report) to beat expectations, when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Progressive has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.83%.

4367,ICE,"Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) has agreed to acquire TMC Bonds LLC for $685 million in cash. The transaction, pending regulatory approval, is expected to culminate in the second half of 2017.TMC Bonds, a premier fixed income marketplace, was established in 2000. The trading platform facilitates click-to-trade and request-for-quote in asset classes like Municipals, Corporates, Treasuries, Agencies and Certificates of Deposit.The addition of TMC Bonds will consolidate Intercontinental Exchange’s fixed income market trading. The acquirer will benefit from TMC Bonds’ new and complementary access point to liquidity for customers. Also, the buyout will expand Intercontinental Exchange’s portfolio of diverse solutions in the global fixed income markets across analytics, execution and post-trade.Nonetheless, the acquisition is unlikely to impact results or capital returns in 2018.On the other hand, TMC Bonds will enjoy superior workflow solutions by deploying Intercontinental Exchange’s compelling data and analytics.Carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Intercontinental Exchange as a securities exchange has a solid track of strategic buyouts, including TMX Atrium, National Stock Exchange and VirtuBondPoint among others. Several strategic acquisitions have not only expanded Intercontinental Exchange, but have also resulted in expense synergies. Management is on track to achieve at least $30 million in expense synergies by the end of this year.The most significant of these deals is the acquisition of NYSE in Nov 2013, which cemented Intercontinental Exchange’s position as a premier stock trading platform. The takeover also transformed the company into the second-largest global exchange group, thus allowing over 60% accretion in market capitalization.Per ICE President Benjamin Jackson, “the fixed income markets continue to automate and migrate to electronic trading.” The move to acquire TMC Bonds thus bears a testimony to the diversifying aims of the company to emerge in rapidly growing markets.Shares of Intercontinental Exchange have rallied 17.4% in a year, compared with the industry’s gain of 30%. We expect successful integration of acquisitions, organic growth initiatives, strong operational performance and solid capital position to drive its shares higher.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks from the finance sector are Cardtronics PLC (CATM  -  Free Report), CME Group Inc.

4370,ICE,"Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3 before the market opens. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.39%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Intercontinental Exchange is likely to report top-line growth in the soon-to-reported quarter, driven by higher data revenues, accelerated growth in its listings business along with a growing open interest in revenue capture trends in the trading and clearing segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $1.2 billion, representing an increase of 4.8% on a year-over-year basis.The company is expected to reap the benefits of a lowered tax rate (ranging between 22% and 25%), which is anticipated to favorably impact the company’s bottom line and drive its margin expansion.Also, continued share buyback might have boosted the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at 88 cents per share, reflecting an 18.9% rise from the year-ago quarter.On the basis of the company’s portfolio of proprietary pricing data, reference data, analytics, indices, futures data and desktops plus connectivity solutions, the data revenues might have increased. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for data service fees stands at $524 million, up 0.8% year over year.The company is likely to have reported revenue growth in trading and clearing segment, mainly fueled by volume growth and a resilient revenue per contract (RPC), which gained from a favorable product mix.Further, Intercontinental Exchange is likely to witness organic growth in listings revenues (excluding the impact of the sale of NYSE Governance Services).Intercontinental Exchange’s probable increase in expenses is attributable to higher compensation and benefits, technology and communication as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. This in turn might restrict margin expansion, hurting the company’s overall performance in turn.Nonetheless, the company estimates to generate around half of the remaining $60 million in synergies (after delivering more than $70 million in 2017) during 2018.Notably, Intercontinental Exchange delivered record average daily volume (ADV) in the first quarter.Intercontinental Exchange Inc.

4376,ICE,"A number of factors influence investment decisions, particularly when it comes to choosing stocks. While investors with a high-risk appetite looking for higher returns seek sophisticated and complex strategies, those with a low-risk appetite prefer conventional investment strategies based on solid fundamentals.Conventional strategies can be banked upon in bearish markets as well. We have picked one such strategy that is focused on the sales growth of a company.Sales Growth – A Key Financial IndicatorIn the current market scenario, characterized by changing customer preferences and habits, evolving needs, demographic changes and an extremely competitive environment, continued sales growth is crucial for the survival of any business. Companies are always looking out for ways to boost their marketing initiatives to boost sales.Sales are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business. It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases where companies incur a loss, albeit temporarily, they are valued on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future earnings performance. Hence, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can turn out to be a suitable metric for stock valuation. It remains a key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to tamper with revenues as they can with earnings. Thus, the P/S ratio is subject to lesser manipulation than the Price-to-Earnings ratio. Sales growth alone, however, cannot ensure success. Consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more reliable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) operates as a play and entertainment company. This Pawtucket, RI-based company currently has long-term expected EPS growth rate of 11.7% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. American Airlines Group Inc.

4379,ICE,"On Aug 11, we issued an updated research report on MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (MKTX  -  Free Report), a provider of electronic trading network for the institutional market in U.S. credit products.While MarketAxess’ growth strategy has led to noticeable top and bottom-line growth, escalating costs remain a significant headwind. Total expenses increased at 11% on average from 2013-2016, thereby weighing on the company’s margins and by 6.4% in the first half of 2017.We estimate the company’s expenses to rise over the coming quarters given its ongoing investments in several areas including trading platform, new protocols and infrastructure as well as headcount additions. Notably, for 2017, the company anticipates total expenses in the range of $192-$208 million. The midpoint of this range reflects about 12% year-over-year increase in expenses.Over the past six months, shares of MarketAxess have returned 3% underperforming the gain of 8.5% logged by the industry. It also fared poorly compared with returns of 22.2%, 10.4% and 7.4% for CBOE Holdings, Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report), Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) and Nasdaq Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report), respectively. Given the headwinds faced by the company, its shares are expected to remain under pressure in the coming quarters.During the most recently reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.10 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.5% on higher trading volumes. Also, the bottom line improved 13.6% from the year-ago quarter.Nevertheless, MarketAxess's valuation looks stretched at the current level. Looking at the company’s one-forward price-to-earnings ratio, investors might not want to pay any further premium. The company currently has a one-year forward P/E ratio of 49 which is above its median range of 40. It is also higher than the one-year forward P/E ratio of 24.12 for the industry and 19.56 for the S&P 500.MarketAxess carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Results reflected synergies from the Heartland acquisition (completed last year) and strong organic growth in its direct distribution businesses in the U.S.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider     The company’s earnings will see synergistic effects of the Heartland acquisition, which has accelerated growth by broadening its direct distribution channels in the United States and enhancing its vertical markets’ exposure.Last quarter, the company’s gaming business gave a solid performance.

Given its favorable performance in e-commerce and omni-channel solutions business in Europe, we expect the strength to continue.Nevertheless, the bottom line may suffer from an increase in interest cost due to high debt incurred to fund the Heartland deal.

For Futures, the company projects RPC between 3% and 4%, higher than $1.503 reported for the two months ended May 31, 2018. This estimate represents a shift in the mix of trading volume in June.Shares of Cboe Global Markets have lost 17.4% year to date against the industry’s increase of 4.8%. Nonetheless, we expect market volatility lending momentum to trading volumes, a diversified product portfolio as well as benefits derived from Bats Global acquisition to help the stock turn around in the near term.Cboe Global Markets carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

4389,ICE,"A healthy business with steady sales growth is the key to survival in today’s fast changing and highly competitive business environment. As such, superior revenues are necessary to drive growth, and most companies look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise.Revenues are income generated by a company through business activities. Though a company might not be profitable over a particular time period, it usually generates revenues unless there are unforeseen situations. In such cases, the company is valued on the basis of revenues. This is because sales growth (or decline) is usually an early indicator of the company’s future earnings performance.The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio takes into account a company’s revenues when valuing it. It remains the key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to manipulate revenue figures as it can with earnings.  While sales growth is an important metric for any corporate for the purpose of growth projections and strategic decision making, this in isolation doesn’t indicate too much about a company’s future prospects. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits.Therefore, a consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control, and sales are increasing faster than costs — an optimal situation for it.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 22 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Burbank, CA, The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) operates as an entertainment company.

4391,ICE,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Intercontinental Exchange is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ICE in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 76 cents per share for ICE, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ICE, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 1.33% heading into earnings season. Intercontinental Exchange Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Intercontinental Exchange Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Intercontinental Exchange Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that ICE has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

4392,ICE,"Lincoln National Corp. (LNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2, after market close.Riding on higher revenues, Lincoln National surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a good 18.5%, in the first quarter. Earnings benefited from higher contribution from its segments – Annuities, Retirement Plan Services and Group Protection.This insurer has a decent surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded estimates on three occasions, delivering an average positive surprise of 8.75%. This is depicted in the graph below:Lincoln National Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Lincoln National Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lincoln National Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackLincoln National results will reflect growth through its multichannel distribution model, industry leading shelf space and a broad set of customer solutions.The company’s life insurance business is expected to see top-line growth from a change in sales mix to fight the low interest rate environment. Its strategic focus is to decrease the portion of sales from products with long-term guarantees and to increase the share of earnings coming from the mortality and morbidity business lines.The company’s wide and expansive independent brokers, agents and financial advisors’ network may expand the distribution reach of its products and add to the top line.We also expect to see an increase in total annuity sales driven by product enhancements that have been well received in the marketplace. New product launches and upgrades to existing ones will further aid annuity sales.Margins will get an extra cushion from disciplined expense management, given the company’s efforts to manage general and administrative expenses in a period of slower revenue growth.Its disciplined capital management by way of share buyback will aid the bottom line.In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company announced its digital initiative targeted at improving customer experience. These efforts will result in significant cost savings over time as well as potential revenue enhancements, but will cause the company to incur digitization expense of roughly $10 million a quarter in 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lincoln National is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

4394,ICE,"American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, after market close.Last quarter, this company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by 27.5%. Also, earnings were up 33% year over year.Better-than-expected earnings were driven by strong performance from the company’s Consumer business partially offset by losses sustained by its Commercial business. Also, cost control efforts and shares bought back during the quarter aided the bottom line.The company has a positive surprise history, having exceeded estimates in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 0.1%. This is depicted in the graph below:American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | American International Group, Inc. QuoteLet’s Take a Look at the Factors Affecting Q3 ResultsWeakness in Commercial Insurance Segment – The company’s Commercial Insurance business has been suffering for the past many quarters from challenging market conditions. Management has undertaken actions to restore profitability in this segment by shifting its mix of business to the more profitable ones. This has led to a reduction in U.S. casualty exposure, shrinking the gross book by a third from 2015. While business portfolio repositioning has reduced operating risk, the segment’s revenues continue to suffer from reduction in premium written from forgone business. The same is expected to be reflected in third-quarter results.The segment’s underwriting profitability is likely to suffer from nearly $3 billion of estimated catastrophe loss from hurricanes — Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico.We expect the segment’s profitability to suffer in the third quarter from high loss claims at a time when the segment’s top line is already weighed down by challenging market conditions.Lower Share Buyback – The company’s newly appointed CEO has made a shift in its capital utilization strategy in an effort to scoop up more profits. Management now expects to utilize capital for possible acquisitions in international markets, personal and life lines, and domestic middle market as opposed to significant capital used for share repurchases till now.Though the acquisitions to be made by the company will expand its business, these might not be immediately accretive to earnings. The bottom line will also be bereft of the support provided by significant buybacks till now. This might likely drain earnings in the third quarter.Strong Consumer Segment – This business represents roughly half of the company's core equity and is a valuable source of earning stability. The company enjoys a leading market position across many products and distribution channels, which allow it to maintain profitability in evolving markets. We expect improved contribution from Group Retirement and the Life Insurance line of business.In its Life Insurance sub-segment, the company recently introduced a new administrative platform and digital capabilities, revamped its product suite, and substantially exited its U.S. life career distribution channel, service agent channel, and subscale group benefits business. These steps were undertaken to enhance ROE from this line of business. The efforts were reflected in an increase in life insurance sales in the first half of 2017 and we expect to see further sales growth in the third quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AIG is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

The trend continued in the first half of 2017, which saw membership increasing by 3%. We expect to see increased membership on growth across all its Commercial market segments, given its diversified product portfolio, a wide agent network and superior service. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership is 15.7 million, up 3.5% year over year.Higher Revenues from Global Supplemental Business: Earnings and revenues in the segment have been increasing consistently for the past several years, a trend which continued in the first half of 2017. We expect the segment to grow in the third quarter on the back of its leading innovations, direct-to-consumer distribution capabilities, and easy to understand, affordable products that are designed to fill in gaps in coverage and locally licensed and strongly managed talent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this unit is $963 million, up 10.9% year over year.Higher Premium in Health Care Segment: We expect to see an increase in premium and fees in the company's Health Care segment driven by customer growth and specialty contributions from the Commercial employer group. The Zacks Consensus for the same is pegged at $7.1 billion, up 4.3% year over year.Share Buyback: The company’s strong business generates sufficient cash flows from operations, which enables it to make strategic mergers and acquisitions, buy back shares and pay dividend.

4397,ICE,"Lincoln National Corp. (LNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Nov 1, after market close.The company’s Retirement Plan Service segment is expected to show growth in deposits, net flows and earnings. This will be driven by higher sales growth from, product enhancements that are focused on simple and transparent pricing, improved customer service and strong retention. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for income from operation for the segment is $34.75 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of 8.6%.Other Developments in Q3  Increased Top Line From Life Insurance Unit: Lincoln National’s life insurance business is expected to see top-line growth from a broad product portfolio and an industry-leading distribution network. The company has changed in its sales mix to fight the low interest rate environment. Its strategic focus is to decrease the portion of sales from products with long-term guarantees and increase the share of earnings coming from the mortality and morbidity business lines.Increased Sales in Group Protection Unit: The company’s Group Protection segment which was challenged in the recent past is now recovering. Sales in 2016 were up nearly 18% and 11% in the first half of 2017. This strong sales growth indicates the resilience of its distribution channel. The company’s pricing remains disciplined and its outlook for sales growth is aligned with its long-term target of mid single-digit increases. We expect sales growth and improving persistency to contribute to third-quarter results.Annuity Sales to Rise: We also expect to see an increase in total annuity sales driven by product enhancements that have been well received in the marketplace. New product launches and upgrades to existing ones will further aid annuity sales.Increased Expenses: In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company announced its digital initiative targeted at improving customer experience. These efforts will result in significant cost savings over time as well as potential revenue enhancements, but will cause the company to incur digitization expense of roughly $10 million a quarter in 2017.Balance Sheet Strength and Capital Management: Its disciplined capital management by way of share buyback will drive the bottom line. Lincoln National’s balance sheet strength and solid capital generation, which enables it to buy back shares, will provide extra support to the bottom line.Lincoln National Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Lincoln National Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lincoln National Corporation QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model shows that Lincoln National has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP:   Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.05%.

4398,ICE,"Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, before the opening bell.We expect results of this payments network company to reflect increased purchase volume and processed transaction. The impact of acquisitions should improve its business volume in the quarter led by higher spending by members on an improved economy.Here are some of the broad factors likely to affect third-quarter earnings:Increase in Gross Dollar Volume: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gross Dollar volume which measures all Mastercard Credit Charge and Debit programs and includes purchase volume plus cash volume, one of the main revenue drivers, is expected to be $1.32 trillion, up almost 8% year over year.Growth in Different Areas, Product Launch, Deals and Partnerships:  Third-quarter results would manifest the company’s targeted growth from its card offerings in different verticals — consumer credit, debit and commercial prepaid. Its continued investments in physical-digital convergence will keep it ahead in an industry witnessing rapid technology usage and accrue to its top line. Also, several new deals, extension of partnerships and agreements, new product launches, upgrades and alliances will be accruing to Mastercard's top line.Expanding Service Business: The company's efforts in expanding its services business, which has been posting strong earnings, are its differentiators in the market. Higher utilization of the company's service offerings led to revenue acceleration in the previous quarter, and the same is expected in the quarter to be reported.Other FactorsMasterCard’s top line in the third quarter would gain traction from its massive international business.The company's disciplined cost management will add to its bottom line.Earnings will, however, be offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to the impact of new and renewed agreements. Also, accelerated advertising and marketing spend is likely to hamper the company's bottom line.We expect to see a lower tax rate led by higher earnings from lower tax-rate international markets (accounting for more than 60% of the company’s revenues) than in the prior year.MasterCard’s use of capital in buying back shares will provide an extra cushion to its bottom line.Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Mastercard Incorporated QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that Mastercard is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen.

4399,ICE,"MetLife Inc. (MET  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, after market close.Last quarter, MetLife surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.6% and soared 57% year over year. Earnings benefited from volume growth, continued expense discipline and higher fees from improved equity markets.The company has an impressive surprise history. It beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 7.39%. This is depicted in the graph below:MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | MetLife, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q3 FlashbackMetLife’s third-quarter earnings should highlight the favorable impacts of equity markets and solid underwriting in the United States as well as continued focus on expense management.We expect the company’s U.S. business segment to showcase a strong quarter of earnings and sales from Group Benefits, which is one of its largest growth engines. MetLife has a leading position in group benefits with a market share of 25% among the large employers. It is experiencing strong growth in the mid-market segment in this business.The company witnessed continued strength in sales across all market segments, as well as in core and voluntary products in the first half of 2017. We also expect continued investments in this segment to bear fruit.We expect the company’s Property and Casualty (P&C) segment to benefit from improvements in the auto insurance business. The company has been making targeted rate increases in auto insurance over the last past one year which continues this year too. These price increases, along with other management actions, will drive profitability in this line of business.Overall, P&C sales may also benefit from price increases and management actions to drive value. Weather-related destruction in the months of August and September might also dent earnings from this segment, in the form of catastrophe loss.  MetLife has been generating enough free cash flow which it uses for investment purposes and buying back shares. Repurchases made by the company in the third quarter will aid its bottom line.We also expect to see an increase in variable investment income driven by favorable hedge fund performance and strong private equity. The company’s bottom line will be aided by its expense management initiatives.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that MetLife is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: MetLife has an Earning ESP of 0.00%.

4400,ICE,"Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Intercontinental Exchange has likely benefited from growth across the company’s data and trading and clearing segments as well as strong volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 71 cents on revenues of $1.14 billion. While the bottom-line reflects increase of 10.9% from the year-ago quarter, top-line represents an improvement of 5.9%.Continued share buyback provided additional upside to the bottom line.However, the company stated the ongoing integration of Securities Evaluations, denoting the rationalization of identical business lines, might lower revenues by a couple of million dollars in the third quarter.  The company is likely to have reported an improvement in data services revenues, mainly due to solid results in pricing and analytics as well as desktops and connectivity. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for data services revenues is currently pegged at $521 million, an increase of 4.8% from the year-ago quarter.        However, listings revenues have likely lowered due to the divestiture of NYSE Governance Services on Jun 1, 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for listings revenues is currently pegged at $103 million, which reflects a slip of 2.8% from the prior-year quarter.Also, the company might have incurred higher total operating expenses in the third quarter, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, technology and communication as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. Also, the company projects interest expense to be $47 million in the third quarter.Notably, Intercontinental Exchange remains on track toward its full-year expense guidance. To that end, the securities exchange has projected adjusted expenses in the third quarter to range between $485 million and $495 million.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model shows that Intercontinental Exchange has the right combination of the following two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter:Zacks ESP: Intercontinental Exchange has an Earnings ESP of +0.19%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Intercontinental Exchange Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Intercontinental Exchange Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Intercontinental Exchange Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Intercontinental Exchange carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP as stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 along with a positive Earnings ESP, have significantly higher chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to surpass expectations this quarter are as follows:Ares Capital Corporation (ARCC  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter earnings on Nov 2 with an Earnings ESP of +2.86% and a Zacks Rank of 3 as well.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise CME Group Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | CME Group Inc. QuoteIncluding one-time items, the net income was 91 cents per share, down 34.5% year over year.Performance in DetailCME Group’s revenues of $891 million increased 5.8% year over year. This reported figure marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $890 million. Improvement in revenues may be attributable to higher clearing and transaction fees (up 7% year over year), plus access and communication fees (up nearly 8%).Total expenses increased 2.1% year over year to $322.9 million during the reported quarter, attributable to a rise in compensation and benefits, technology support services as well as licensing and other fee agreements.Operating income improved about 8.1% to $567.9 million from the prior-year quarter.Average daily volume (ADV) rose 10% year over year to a record 15.7 million contracts with growth across five of the six product lines.

The company remains well-positioned for growth, given its strong market position with diverse derivative product lines. Efforts to expand and cross-sell core exchange-traded business through strategic alliances and acquisitions, new product initiatives and global reach, boost growth.

4404,ICE,"Despite a cloud of uncertainty looming over the global market environment due to rapidly changing climatic conditions — storming the industrial space with consecutive catastrophic disasters Hurricanes Harvey and Irma — and the palpable disagreement among the Fed officials over how quickly to raise interest rates, the performance of some pivotal players in the Securities and Exchanges industry has shown a ray of hope.Some major players of Securities and Exchanges industry have been successfully recording robust trading volumes and August was no exception.  We expect to see these key players generating solid trading volumes in the near term as well.Momentum to Continue?The key players in the Securities and Exchanges industry are largely dependent on their product and service portfolios to churn out revenues. The major services include trade execution, clearing, settlement services for securities and commodity contracts, listing services as well as trading and clearing systems services. There are other sources of revenues that might include data products, financial indexes, along with information and public company services.In a highly competitive industry, demand is fueled by investor-confidence, dependent on the overall growth of the industry itself. Interestingly, the individual exchanges’ profitability rests on maximization of transaction and clearing fees while keeping transaction-based expenses low. Such organic growth will help the individual exchanges drive their revenues, which in turn will continue to fuel increasing trading volumes. This makes us hopeful for the future, which has a high possibility to see major players in the industry generating substantially high trading volumes.This apart, the individual exchanges rely heavily on their diverse product offerings to drive their overall growth. With introduction of new products, which not only cater to the demands of the derivatives industry but also complement the core product lines, the key players are expected to strengthen their market position and global reach. To that end, the companies remain committed toward investing in new product extensions and offerings to boost overall growth, thereby creating an opportunity for trading volumes to thrive.The individual exchanges are focused on building a strategic economic market model through technological advances and upgrade of diverse service and product offerings to help them stay ahead and maintain the competitive streak amid the changing industry dynamics.Interestingly, some leading players in the industry have been making substantial efforts to expand product portfolio via prudent acquisitions, which in turn will aid them to retain their market share, expand product lines as well as widen global footprint. For instance, the acquisition of Bats Global Markets by CBOE Holdings on Feb 28, 2017, has enabled the latter to broaden and diversify its product portfolio.Also, on Jul 5, 2017, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) has purchased the remaining 20% stake in ICE Endex shares from N.V. Nederlandse Gasunie. The buyout adds capabilities to Intercontinental Exchange’s European gas and power portfolio.We wait to see if new product initiatives and global presence help these major players in the Securities and Exchanges industry to post high trading volumes in the future.The Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry is currently ranked at #105 (which lies in the upper half of the Zacks Industry Rank for 252 plus industries). Notably, the industry has outperformed the broader market year to date, evident from a gain of 17.3% compared with the S&P 500’s increase of 11.2%.Stocks in FocusFollowing are some key stocks which have exhibited robust trading volumes in August, witnessed upward estimate revisions and their respective share prices have also the industry, quarter to date:CBOE Holdings, Inc.
