0,EXR,"U.S. real estate investment trusts, or REITs, outperformed broader equity markets in the first nine months of this year, according to a new report out from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.Apartment REITs led various sectors with a 20.3% return through the end of September, NAREIT said, followed by infrastructure and self-storage REITs, up 16.8% and 15.3%, respectively.The total return for all REITs in NAREIT's index over that period was a little over 13%, with a dividend yield of 4.3%.Total return in the REIT world is defined as a stock's dividend income plus capital appreciation, before taxes and commissions.""Positive economic trends have increased demand for commercial real estate this year while the supply of new properties remains tight by historical standards,"" said NAREIT CEO Steven Wechsler in a statement accompanying the results.Such market conditions provided support for key REIT fundamentals such as occupancy rates, rental income, cash flow and dividend growth, he said.Apartment REITs are also among the strongest performers in IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group, though the group itself is not ranked highly — it's No. 74 of 197 groups tracked.Top-rated apartment performers include Avalonbay Communities (AVB) and Post Properties (PPS), each with high IBD Composite Ratings of 90 out of a possible 99. Brookfield Property Partners (BPY), which is also active in multifamily and other commercial properties, has a 92 rating.In infrastructure, American Tower (AMT) holds a CR of 96. It's the second-largest in the group by market cap, after shopping-center giant Simon Property Group (SPG), which has a 93 CR.Self-storage REITs Extra Space Storage (EXR) and Sovran Self Storage (SSS) each rate a 96.

54,EXR,"Among the best dividend stocks, Life Storage (LSI) is a bit of an anomaly in IBD's REIT Leaders screen. While most real estate investment trusts are far off highs with weak technicals, Life Storage is the exact opposite. It's near highs with a bullish chart.It briefly cleared a cup-with-handle base Thursday with an 88.15 buy point. It followed through Friday in light volume. Shares reversed lower with the broad market Monday, but it's still holding above the buy point.Life Storage, with a market capitalization of $4.1 billion, operates more than 700 storage facilities in 28 states. It serves residential and commercial customers. More than a third of its revenue in 2017 came from facilities in Florida and Texas.In the late 1980s, the company was known as Uncle Bob's Storage. It went public in 1995 under the name Sovran Self Storage. The company changed its name in 2016 to Life Storage when it acquired California-based LifeStorage LP.The best dividend stocks are known for high dividend yields, and Life Storage has one. Last week, it paid a quarterly dividend of $1 a share, giving it an annualized yield of around 4.5%. A dividend growth rate of 17% is also impressive.Life Storage trades just over 400,000 shares a day. It's a high-priced stock, giving it an average daily dollar volume of nearly $40 million. That's good liquidity.An Accumulation/Distribution Rating on Monday of A- points toward signs of institutional buying in recent weeks. An up/down volume ratio of 1.6 also indicates strong demand for shares.That Life Storage is outperforming at a time when interest rates are going up might seem counterintuitive. Debt becomes more expensive when interest rates are on the rise, and heavy debt loads are commonplace in real estate investment trusts.But the company's debit-to-equity ratio of 80% in 2017 isn't excessive compared to other self-storage REITs. Competitors CubeSmart (CUBE) and Extra Space Storage (EXR) had debt-to-equity ratios of 100% and 194%, respectively, in 2o17.An improving economy is also working in Life Storage's favor. Late last week, the first estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product came in at 2.3%, above the consensus forecast for 2% growth.A two-day Federal Reserve meeting starts Tuesday. A decision on interest rates will be out Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The Fed isn't expected to raise rates this time around, but another quarter-point hike to a range of 1.75% to 2% is widely expected at the June meeting. REITs often compete with bonds for income investors.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Revenue increased 3% to $133.1 million. The company delivered same-store revenue growth in 21 of its major markets.

72,EXR,"The public storage sector has been a boon to investors of late, with a number of players prospering or, at worst, sustaining minimal damage in an otherwise rough market.So it stands to reason that Public Storage (PSA), the world's largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities, will reap gains from the sector's current bonanza.Public Storage ""is in a fantastic space right now,"" said analyst Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.""It's a very well-run company with a conservative balance sheet. It has minimal debt and low leverage,"" Golladay said.The major players in the self-storage industry operate as real estate investment trusts, or REITs, and they've been strong performers the last two years. With a total return (share-price appreciation and dividends) in 2015 of 40.65%, self-storage led all other REIT sectors, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.It even slaughtered the hot apartment sector's 16.45% total return over that same time. Public Storage's dividend yield is a relatively high 6.8%; its stock soared more than 30% last year.Public Storage, which opened its first storage facility in 1972, is viewed as the industry's large-cap bellwether. Rivals include Extra Space Storage (EXR), CubeSmart (CUBE), Sovran Self Storage (SSS) and National Storage Affiliates (NSA).Big Is BetterIn storage, ""big is better,"" says Rod Petrik, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, adding that Public Storage saves money by efficiently spreading costs over a large base.""They are the largest in this space, and it allows them to run at the lowest cost,"" Petrik said.Indeed, Public Storage is one of the largest landlords in the world, and its near-full occupancy rate is the envy of just about any real estate company that relies on tenants for income. More than 1 million customers occupy rooms in over 2,200 of its company-owned locations — most in the U.S. — comprising more than 142 million net rentable square feet of real estate.Analysts expect another good year for the self-storage industry in 2016, and for Public Storage specifically. In a poll by Thomson Reuters, analysts see the company's funds from operations rising 10% over 2015, to $8.78 a share. That would put it at the same growth pace expected in 2015.Public Storage hasn't yet announced when it will report fourth-quarter and full-year results, and the company did not respond to a request for an interview.High Occupancy, Big MarginsFunds from operations measure net income before depreciation, gains and losses and impairment charges related to real estate assets. In the third quarter, Public Storage's funds from operations rose to $2.27 a share from $2.09 a year earlier.""They generally run with the highest occupancy in the industry and the best margins,"" Petrik said.In the third quarter, the company's occupancy rate was 95.3% vs. 94.7% a year prior. Gross margin was 74.2%, up from 73%.Spending on advertising, which has been gravitating to the Internet, has been falling due to high demand for space.""If you're running at 95% occupancy, it means all your 10(foot) by 10(foot) rooms are gone,"" Petrik said. ""You end up with the odd sizes.""Few ExpensesAnd like other self-storage companies — but unlike other forms of real estate — there's relatively little capital expenses involved to spruce up assets.""Someone moves out of an office building or retail space, and the landlord has to reconfigure the space and make tenant improvements,"" Petrik said. ""When someone moves out of a storage space, you sweep it and make sure the light bulb is working. You're ready to re-lease that space within minutes, not months or weeks.""""Investors look at this as a cash-flow business,"" he said.Public Storage has raised rents around 5% a year the last couple of years, around the same pace as apartment rentals. Its three top markets are in fast-growing states where people move around a lot: California, Florida and Texas.Demand for self-storage is typically driven by any kind of change, says RBC Capital's Golladay, pointing to life changes such as divorce, death, a job or military move, retirement or a home renovation. Restless young people are particularly heavy users.""Population alone is growing 1%, and more and more people are using storage, so 1.5% growth would be a good indicator of demand (growth) for their products,"" he said.Same-Store GainsMuch of the company's revenue growth comes from annual rent increases, however. In the third quarter, for instance, revenue at facilities open since Jan. 1, 2013 — referred to as same-store facilities — rose 6.7%, due largely to higher realized annual rent per occupied square feet, the company said. Total revenue grew 6.7% to $511.8 million.During the quarter, Public Storage acquired two self-storage facilities in Colorado. It subsequently acquired or contracted to buy 11 others, eight of them in Florida and the rest in Texas and California.But it also completed three facilities it developed on its own, as well as various expansion projects. More are underway.While limited new supply in the self-storage industry has helped to keep occupancy rates high and rental rates rising, analysts expect new supply to increase this year, though at manageable levels.""It's been undersupplied the last few years, so the new supply could easily be absorbed without any issues,"" Golladay said.Even when Public Storage opened a new 2,000-unit facility in Glendale, Calif. last year, space quickly filled, he adds.""It opened in April and was already 72% leased in the third quarter,"" Golladay said. ""It takes three to four years to lease up a facility. That tells you how much pent-up demand there is.""

74,EXR,"The bigger the debt, the harder it is for borrowers to dig out of the hole. The same often holds true for companies too.""Rule 1 for all competent investors and homeowners is never ever borrow more than you can pay back. Excessive debt hurts all people, companies and governments,"" IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""IBD uses the long-term debt-to-equity (LTD-to-E) ratio to determine if a company is showing too much borrowing risk. The ratio is simply a company's long-term debt divided by shareholders equity, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage figure.A ratio of 100% or more implies that a firm is borrowing at an aggressive pace to fuel its expansion. It could also indicate a company is overreaching and not growing in a disciplined manner. By the same token, if a company's LTD-to-E ratio is falling year to year, it might be worth a second look. ""A corporation that's been reducing its debt as a percentage of equity over the last two or three years is worth considering,"" O'Neil wrote. ""If nothing else, interest costs will be sharply reduced, helping to generate higher earnings for share.""So when comparing two stock candidates for purchase, assuming they are in the same industry and all else being equal, pick the company with the smaller LTD-to-E ratio.Some industries require heavy spending to grow, so it may be natural for companies in those industries to borrow heavily. Firms in the telecom, heavy construction, and oil and gas exploration fields tend to carry heavier debt. Yet in other industries, the best-run companies may carry zero long-term debt. So be sure not to compare stocks from different industries. Do an apples-to-apples comparison.A company may take on debt for various uses. For instance, a business that is growing via acquisitions may need cash to fund those purchases, with the idea that the buys will help it expand going forward. Or a telecom company wants to build more towers to reach its ultimate goal of growing its subscriber base.In a study of the greatest stock market winners, IBD found that many of them didn't have much debt.The accompanying table shows current leaders with outstanding EPS and RS ratings, priced at least $20 a share, and an average daily volume of at least 1 million shares. Facebook (FB), New Oriental Education (EDU), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Ross Stores (ROST), show zero to low single-digit debt ratios.Constellation Brands (STZ), Extra Space Storage (EXR), Hawaiian Holdings (HA) and Verizon Communications (VZ) occupy the higher end. Beer and wine maker Constellation has made a number of acquisitions over the past few years and is planning to expand its Nava brewery in northeast Mexico. Verizon has been spending on wireless spectrum space to build out its wireless network.Companies can finance future investments in new products, services or plants and equipment by issuing new shares as well. This too can dilute shareholder value in the long run.

83,EXR,"It's a safe bet that when most people think of self-storage units, the term ""high tech"" doesn't immediately leap to mind. After all, they're just storage units, right? You open the door, put a few things inside and then close the door.About the most high-tech thing involved is turning a key in a lock.Behind the scenes, however, technology plays a big part in the success of large, publicly traded self-storage facility operators like Sovran Self Storage (SSS).Sovran is a real estate investment trust that owns or operates 500 self-storage facilities in 25 states. It operates under the name Uncle Bob's Self Storage and serves more than 250,000 customers.Like the three other publicly traded players in the self-storage space — Public Storage (PSA), Extra Space Storage (EXR) and CubeSmart (CUBE) — Sovran uses its size to take business away from small mom and pop operations. A big part of its edge against the little guys involves technology — specifically, its revenue management system and Internet marketing strategy.Fitting The MarketsSovran's revenue management system was developed a few years ago to help the company gauge how much it should charge in specific markets during specific times of the year. The system crunches massive amounts of data to determine why some customer inquiries turn into rental contracts, while others don't.""The system uses computer algorithms that help them price units better and increase occupancy,"" Jefferies analyst George Hoglund told IBD.""The result is that you're seeing overall occupancies rise at the big public REITs.""The publicly traded REITs typically have storage unit occupancy rates in the low-to-mid 90% range, he says. That's about 5 to 10 percentage points higher than the average for small private players.""Sovran and the other public REITs have the kinds of systems in place that generate more data than the mom and pops, which gives them a big edge in terms of finding and winning customers,"" Hoglund said.The same holds true for Sovran's Internet marketing strategy, which basically involves paying top dollar to secure important search terms. These include the obvious — ""storage unit,"" ""self-storage,"" etc. — as well as street names, city names, ZIP codes and terms like ""cardboard boxes"" and ""moving vans.""What's It Worth?""Self-storage operators have to ask themselves how much it's worth to pay for a particular search term,"" Hoglund said. ""You can only do that efficiently and effectively if you have scale, which gives Sovran and the other public REITs another advantage over the small players.""Analyst R.J. Milligan of Robert W. Baird echoed that point in a research note, saying the larger players ""continue to out-market"" the smaller players online.""Technology and economies of scale are allowing the REITs to capture greater market share at better rates, while the data analysis is contributing to a more efficient use of marketing dollars,"" Milligan noted.Those advantages help explain why Sovran regularly trots out double-digit revenue and earnings growth — and why its stock price has been trading at record highs this month, along with those of its publicly traded peers.Macro Trends HelpingThe sector also is getting help from several favorable macro trends, analysts say. One is the rising population of millennials entering the workforce. Many choose to live in densely populated areas where apartments are small and storage units are needed to house items that don't fit in the available living spaces.It also helps that the U.S. job market is improving, which means more millennials are finally able to leave home and move out on their own. Meanwhile, there's a shortage of storage units nationwide, which helps drive up rental rates.""The lack of development financing, an increasingly difficult land entitlement process, and increasing development land values have kept new supply relatively muted,"" Milligan said.It all adds up to a pretty stout operating environment for Sovran. The company has a years-long streak of double-digit revenue growth, helped by a stream of acquisitions. Funds from operations, or FFO — the figure that REITs use to define cash flow from their operations — have risen by double digits for five quarters in a row.During its third quarter, Sovran logged FFO of $1.29 a share, up 15% from the prior year and above analysts' consensus estimates. Revenue grew 12% to $95.4 million. Same-store revenue climbed 6.5%.High OccupancyThe company's same-store occupancy rate as of Sept. 30 was 91.4%, up 100 basis points from the prior year. In July, it set an occupancy record rate of 93.1%. Sovran spent $66 million to acquire 11 self-storage facilities during the quarter.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Sovran's full-year funds from operations to rise 20% in 2015. Growth is seen as slowing to 11% in 2016 and 8% in 2017.One area of concern is Sovran's large exposure to the Houston market, which has been hurt by the slumping oil and gas industry. Sovran's same-store revenue in Houston rose 6.9% during the third quarter, though the occupancy rate there fell by 180 basis points year-over-year.Sovran Chief Executive David Rogers downplayed the problem during a Q3 conference call with analysts, pointing out that rental rates in Houston actually rose faster than the company average during the quarter.""Things are real strong and continue to look strong in Houston,"" Rogers said.Wall Street doesn't seem too worried. Sovran's stock price shot to a new intraday high of 106.59 on Friday and is up more than 20% since Sept. 4. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99.

Storage stocks have performed especially well, accounting for four of the top 16 stocks in the group as acquisitions and limited supply allow them to boost rents.Yet it may become more difficult for REITs to finance new acquisitions and build new structures such as storage units, hospitals and office buildings if, as expected, the Federal Reserve raises interest rates on Wednesday. Higher rates may also prompt investors to move money into other income investments, such as bonds.Yet it appears that investors expect borrowing costs to remain low for some time amid slow-but-steady economic growth.Extra Space Storage (EXR), which buys, operates and develops self-storage facilities in 36 states, boasts a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. It's up about 45% this year and is 9% past a 78.42 cup-with-handle entry, out of buying range.On Monday, KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded Extra Space to overweight from sector weight, calling it a ""premium growth vehicle,"" according to TheStreet.com. Extra Space in October bought California-based SmartStop Self Storage for about $1.4 billion.Its Q3 results, released Oct. 28, showed that same-store revenue rose 9.9% from a year ago thanks to rising occupancy, higher rental rates and lower customer discounts.""Fundamentals for the sector continue to be strong,"" Extra Space CEO Spencer Kirk said after the report. ""We expect occupancy to remain at all-time highs, which should allow us to further increase rates to new and existing customers.""Funds from operations, the main measure of a REIT's profitability, is expected to rise 15% to $3 a share this year followed by a 21% increase next year.Public Storage (PSA), which buys and operates self-storage facilities in the U.S. and Europe, is well out of buying range after clearing a 218.09 buy point Oct. 5.The stock ""has the potential to move even higher, given improving fundamentals of the storage real estate sector, and superior performance of its properties and strategic acquisitions,"" Zacks Equity Research said Nov. 23.Zacks, which has a buy rating on the stock, said an improving economy and a lack of new supply have helped Public Storage trim its marketing and promotion costs.Annual FFO is expected to rise 9% this year to $8.77 a share, followed by a 10% gain in 2016.Sovran Self Storage (SSS) and CubeSmart (CUBE) are the other two top storage stocks in the property REIT group.Sovran is holding above a 98.21 cup-with-handle buy point.CubeSmart is out of buying range. It's seen FFO growth accelerate for two straight quarters.

"
110,EXR,"Last year may have been the year of the REIT, as total returns for the dividend stocks fetched an alluring 27.5% total return in aggregate, double that of the S&P 500 Index.
"
111,EXR,"But this year, the group of real estate investment trusts, or REITs, got battered.
"
112,EXR,"They logged a paltry total return of just 1% through Dec. 4 vs. the S&P 500's 3.6% gain, according to SNL Financial. But self-storage and apartments were standouts.
"
113,EXR,"Prospects of a looming rate hike by the Fed scared investors. REITs return at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, leaving them sensitive to interest-rate increases as they seek financing to grow, since they don't have much cash on hand. Or so investors like to think.
"
114,EXR,"""Rumors of rising interest rates have certainly weighed on REITs,"" said Jason Lail, manager of real estate research at SNL Financial.
"
115,EXR,"With a rate hike expected imminently, will REITs falter again in 2016?
"
116,EXR,"REIT experts say that it might be better to look at fundamentals such as operating earnings, which in REIT parlance are known as funds from operations, or FFOs.
"
117,EXR,"""A rising interest rate environment is indicative of the overall health of the economy,"" Lail said. ""REITs are much more tied to economic health than to interest rates in regard to their performance.""

"
122,EXR,"But operating earnings jumped by 25.6%, the best showing of any sector. ""And that can definitely have a positive impact on health care REIT equity pricing in 2016,"" Lail said.

"
131,EXR,"In health care, Lail singles out Physicians Realty Trust (DOC) and Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) for impressive FFO growth in 2016. He limited his top 25 picks, compiled exclusively for IBD, to U.S. REITs with market caps above $1 billion and at least three analyst estimates.
"
132,EXR,"Besides their sensitivity to interest rates due to long-term leases, too much construction all at once might have brought down health care REITs this year.
"
133,EXR,"""Health care is a very good long-term investment that right now has suffered because of new construction,"" said Calvin Schnure, senior vice president of research and economic analysis at NAREIT.

205,EXR,"Real estate investment trusts are outperforming in the stock market, up 8% this year as an IBD industry group after doubling the S&P 500's 11% gain in 2014. And factoring in dividends, REITs delivered a total return of 27.5% for the year, according to SNL Financial.One of the top-rated names in IBD's Finance-Property REIT group — which ranks No. 22 out of 197 industries tracked — is Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB). It invests in upscale hotel and resort properties primarily in large U.S. markets.The company's portfolio tends toward four-diamond boutique hotels in big cities such as New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Washington. The AAA travel site defines four-diamond hotels as ""upscale in all areas,"" with ""an extensive array of amenities combined with a high degree of hospitality, service and attention to detail.""Pebblebrook's properties include the Hotel Monaco in Seattle and Washington, D.C.; the Le Meridien Delfina in Los Angeles; the Westin Gaslamp in San Diego; the Sir Francis Drake in San Francisco; the InterContinental Buckhead in Atlanta; and the Affinity Manhattan in New York.Hot In HotelsThe company owns all or part of 35 hotels with a total of nearly 7,000 guest rooms and a 49% joint venture interest in six hotels with a total of 1,775 guest rooms.It boasts an IBD Composite Rating of 99, which puts it atop the Finance-Property REIT group along with Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT), Extra Space Storage (EXR), Sovran Self Storage (SSS) and Sun Communities (SUI), among others.Like those companies, Pebblebrook has seen its share price hit record highs this month. The company is also in the middle of a long run of double-digit-percentage earnings and revenue gains, thanks to a mix of favorable macro trends and strong internal operations.On the macro side, the tourism industry in general and the hotel business in particular have gotten a boost from an improving economy, lower gas prices and an influx of visitors from overseas, particularly in large urban markets.""The fundamentals are very good for the hotel industry right now, and they're improving,"" said Pebblebrook Chief Financial Officer Raymond Martz.Overall demand for U.S. hotel rooms in 2014 rose 4.5% from the prior year, he told IBD. ""That's a very strong increase. At the same time, supply was only up 0.9%. So right now demand is very good.""On the operational side, Pebblebrook boasts a ""high-quality portfolio"" and some of the highest room rates and revenue per available room (RevPAR) in the hotel sector, according to a recent note by Stifel Nicolaus analyst Rod Petrik.During its third quarter, Pebblebrook posted an 11.4% year-over-year increase in same-property RevPAR to $225.25 a day. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, same-property RevPAR climbed 9.8% from a year earlier.Those growth numbers are expected to decelerate this year as Pebblebrook focuses on integrating a handful of new properties. On Jan. 22 the company issued its 2015 outlook and guided same-property RevPAR growth of 6.5% to 7.5%.Pebblebrook focuses on buying underperforming hotels and turning them around. The company completed more than $600 million worth of acquisitions in 2014, Martz says.""A lot of assets we buy are broken,"" he said. ""In many cases they were mismanaged or are being renovated, or the prior owners lost their focus for whatever reason. So we work to renovate the hotels, reposition the room rates and make the properties appeal to a certain kind of traveler.""Restoring GrandeurThe job involves ""a lot of hard work and creativity,"" Martz says. ""There's a lot more operating involvement vs. buying an office building and leasing it out for five years. You have to bring in the right food and beverage operator, create the right atmosphere.""Pebblebrook's most recent deal came on Dec. 18, when it announced the acquisition of the Revere Hotel Boston Common, an attached, 826-space parking garage and an adjacent land parcel. That deal, for $260.4 million, brought the company a 356-room hotel in downtown Boston's historic Theater District.The Revere buyout came a week after Pebblebrook spent about $52 million to purchase the Union Station Hotel, a 125-room property in downtown Nashville, Tenn., that first opened in 1900 as the L&N Railroad Station. The property was converted to a hotel in 1986.Other recent deals include the Nov. 20 purchase of the Hotel Palomar Los Angeles-Westwood for $78.7 million and the Nov. 12 buyout of Miami's Westin Colonnade Coral Gables for $59.4 million.Looking For The GemsWhen pursuing acquisitions, Pebblebrook looks at properties ""that can be positioned as four-diamond hotels,"" Martz said.""We get hotels that cater to business travelers as well as high-end leisure travelers,"" he added. ""About two-thirds are considered boutique hotels, and we have a lot of flexibility in tailoring those hotels to specific travelers.""Pebblebrook's near-term expansion strategy will likely focus on West Coast markets because that's where most of the new supply is, he says.Analysts credit the company with doing a good job of turning acquired properties around.""PEB has actively acquired hotels that lost market share due to the recession and has allocated capital ... to reposition these hotels to recapture market share,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Wes Golladay noted in a research report.He says Pebblebrook's increased acquisition volume will be ""a key driver of increased shareholder value.""That value keeps going up. Pebblebrook shares touched a record high of 49.61 on Jan. 22 and have risen more than 60% over the past 12 months.

206,EXR,"Like many businesses, self storage is a numbers game.
"
207,EXR,"In a locale with a certain number of people, a certain percentage will need storage units. That baseline holds regardless of the local economy, job market or housing trends.
"
208,EXR,"Dave Rogers knows all about those numbers. He's CEO of Sovran Self Storage (SSS), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that operates more than 500 self-storage facilities in 25 states under the Uncle Bob's Self Storage brand.
"
209,EXR,"Sovran is one of four publicly traded self-storage companies that comprise the ""Big Four"" of an industry otherwise dominated by small mom-and-pop operations.
"
210,EXR,"Like Sovran, the other Big Four players — Extra Space Storage (EXR), Public Storage (PSA) and CubeSmart (CUBE) — have enjoyed strong financial and share-price growth as they've seen steady demand for storage units.
"
211,EXR,"Sovran set a record high of 94.07 in the stock market on Friday, putting it up 8% for the month.
"
212,EXR,"One of the most important numbers for Sovran and the other big guys is 1 million. That's how many people a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) needs to make it worth Sovran's while to set up shop.
"
213,EXR,"It's Not The Economy
"
214,EXR,"It doesn't seem to matter how the stock market and the broad economy are doing, Rogers says. Once you reach around 1 million people, the numbers always come out the right way.
"
215,EXR,"""Everybody's looking for that holy grail tying something to storage demand, but there just don't seem to be any economic or macro patterns that apply,"" Rogers told IBD. ""We found that if you can get into an MSA of 1 million people or so, you can do well in storage. We like the idea that with 1 million people or so, we can buy enough stores to reach the scale we want.""
"
216,EXR,"In this case, ""stores"" means self-storage facilities, and Rogers' company has been buying a lot of them.
"
217,EXR,"Sovran has acquired about 125 stores over the last three and a half years, he says. In 2014, it added nearly $500 million worth of storage assets when you factor in its own buyouts as well as joint venture acquisitions it invested in.
"
218,EXR,"""It's been a very busy year acquisitionwise,"" Rogers said.
"
219,EXR,"The acquisitions have helped Sovran expand in core markets such as Florida, the mid-Atlantic states and Texas. It has also added stores in relatively new markets such as Chicago, where it arrived only a couple of years ago.
"
220,EXR,"""We had no units in Chicago in 2012. Now we have 13 there and a couple more underway,"" Rogers said.
"
221,EXR,"Another growth market is the greater New York area that extends from southern Connecticut to northern New Jersey.
"
222,EXR,"Sovran intends to keep expanding, Rogers says, though he would not disclose details on specific plans — other than to say that the pace of acquisitions will probably be slower in 2015 than in 2014.
"
223,EXR,"Room To Grow
"
224,EXR,"In December, Sovran announced details of financing arrangements totaling $625 million of senior unsecured debt. Sovran's revolving credit limit increased from $175 million to $300 million, and it got a lowered interest rate on that credit and its $325 million in term notes.
"
225,EXR,"In a statement at the time, Sovran Chief Financial Officer Andrew Gregoire said the financing arrangements ""will allow us to continue to execute on our growth plan.""
"
226,EXR,"KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Todd Thomas noted in a research report that Sovran management ""indicated it suspects the company could acquire between $100 million and $200 million"" worth of assets in 2015, excluding investments in joint ventures and the like.
"
227,EXR,"""Portfolio deals continue to surface, however, so it is possible that Sovran exceeds that target,"" Thomas said.
"
228,EXR,"Much of Sovran's acquisition strategy focuses on high-end, ""third-generation"" properties. They tend to be multistory self-storage facilities with modern amenities such as security systems and 24-hour access.
"
229,EXR,"""Everything being built new is going to be third-generation,"" Rogers said, adding, ""The industry is in transition.""
"
230,EXR,"The industry is also dominated by small local or regional players, at least in nonurban areas.
"
231,EXR,"Rogers estimates that the Big Four self-storage companies control a little less than 10% of the U.S. market, so there's ""plenty of room to grow.""
"
232,EXR,"Business is good. Of the four publicly traded self-storage REITs, all but Public Storage consistently deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth.
"
233,EXR,"Public Storage's growth rate is a little slower, probably because it's far and away the biggest player in the sector, with more than $2 billion in 12-month trailing revenue. It therefore has a much higher hill to climb to establish year-over-year growth.
"
234,EXR,"By contrast, Extra Space has $622 million in trailing 12-month revenue. CubeSmart has $360 million, and Sovran has $313 million.
"
235,EXR,"During its third quarter, Sovran posted total operating revenue of $85.3 million, up 21% from the previous year. The company logged funds from operations (FFO) of $1.17 vs. $1.01 a year earlier, on an adjusted basis. Same-store net operating income rose 9.2%.
"
236,EXR,"""The trends are evidence of continued strength in fundamentals,"" Citigroup analyst Michael Bilerman noted.
"
237,EXR,"Sovran has credited its Revenue Management System with helping to drive top-line growth. The system was developed a few years ago to help Sovran gauge how much it should charge in specific markets during specific times of the year.
"
238,EXR,"Need A Storage Unit?
"
239,EXR,"It is the product of extensive research that involved crunching call-center data to learn when, and why, some customer inquiries turn into rental contracts and some don't.
"
240,EXR,"""We wanted to build a history — what were the patterns, what caused people to buy or just shop,"" Rogers said. ""We stored data like how long the call was, did it turn into a rental, what was the pricing. The result is that we were able to build algorithms into the system that are proactive and preventive.""
"
241,EXR,"Analyst Thomas notes that Sovran's technology ""has come a long way"" in recent years. He points out that ""a minimum of 70%"" of Sovran's rental customers use the Internet at some point during the rental process.
"
242,EXR,"Because the Internet has become the main source of business for self-storage companies, investing in web advertising is key to finding and winning customers. To that end, Sovran plans to spend about $6 million on Internet advertising in 2015, Thomas says, ""which equates to about $11,000 per store.""
"
243,EXR,"Sovran has a top IBD Composite Rating of 99. It is among several now sporting that high a rating in IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group, which ranks No. 27 out of 197 in performance.Like many businesses, self storage is a numbers game.In a locale with a certain number of people, a certain percentage will need storage units.

290,EXR,"It's hard to think of anything more low-tech than a self-storage facility. Once you figure out how to open a door and work a lock, you've pretty much mastered it.Long before you've done that, however, chances are someone who works behind the scenes has spent years using high-tech tools to ensure the facility has the best chance of capturing your business.A tech-savvy self-storage company will make sure its facilities are among the first three or four names that pop up in an Internet search — a process that involves things like analyzing search algorithms to determine the most productive keywords to use on the website.In the case of Extra Space Storage (EXR), a real estate investment trust, it also means hiring a team of marketing and search engine optimization — or SEO — specialists.Gang of FourExtra Space owns and/or operates more than 1,000 self-storage properties in 35 states as well as in Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Its properties comprise around 715,000 units and 79 million square feet of rentable storage space.It is one of four major players in the self-storage industry, along with fellow publicly traded REITs Public Storage (PSA), CubeSmart (CUBE) and Sovran Self Storage (SSS).Outside of U-Haul parent Amerco (UHAL), which provides self-storage rentals as well as truck and van rentals, the rest of the market is dominated by the many smaller mom-and-pop operations.One reason the bigger players have put so much distance between themselves and the rest of the field is that they've done a better job at developing Internet marketing strategies, says Jeff Norman, Extra Space's senior director of investor relations.Just about everyone who needs a self-storage facility looks online to find one. Since a lot of companies are competing for business, search results often mean the difference between success and failure.""It's a very fragmented industry, and if you are not one of the top three or four terms that pop up after a search, no one is ever going to find you,"" Norman told IBD during a phone interview. ""If someone goes to Google (GOOGL) and types in 'self-storage Long Island' or 'self-storage Chicago,' you will consistently see the larger REITs come at the top of those searches.""That's mainly because the larger REITs have the resources and expertise to develop effective Internet search and marketing strategies, while many smaller ones don't.This has ""created a moat"" between the larger operators and the smaller ones, Norman says, and goes a long way in explaining why Extra Space trots out double-digit-percentage revenue and profit growth with astonishing regularity.""We have a lot of data points to track and analyze,"" Norman said. ""If we see that something works well in one market, we will roll it out in other markets. We are constantly trying to keep up with the evolving algorithms that search engines use to make sure we are getting a good return.""That has been a key internal driver of Extra Space's financial growth, he says.A key external driver is the self-storage industry itself, which has seen a shortage of supply nationwide since the early days of the financial crisis and recession in 2009.According to industry estimates, there are about 50,000 storage facilities in the U.S., Norman says. With the nation's population growing at around 1% a year, he reckons you could add 1% a year to the storage facility supply and ""still not upset the equilibrium.""Over the past five years, however, the amount of new supply has been ""virtually zero,"" Norman says. That's mainly due to a lack of financing for local developers, who handle the vast majority of self-storage construction projects.This lack of supply ratchets up demand for Extra Space and other self-storage operators.Go Where The People AreVery little alters that demand outside of the number of people living in a given area, Norman says. The ups and downs of the housing market don't seem to have a big impact, he says, and neither do the ups and downs of the economy.Since demand is primarily driven by population growth, Extra Space looks to buy properties in cities with dense and growing populations.""We try to focus on the top 50 MSAs (metropolitan statistical areas),"" Norman said. ""Our main motivation is places with high population density — not just because there is more demand, but also because there are stronger barriers to entry because there is less space to build new storage properties.""The strength of the self-storage market is reflected in Extra Space's financial results. The company has delivered 11 straight quarters of 21%-or-better revenue and funds from operations (FFO) growth.Solid ResultsDuring its second quarter, overall revenue rose 27% from the prior year to $160.2 million. Same-store revenue growth was 7.9%, flat with the prior quarter and up from 7.4% the previous year, according to a report from Citigroup analyst Michael Bilerman. FFO gained 26% to 63 cents a share.Extra Space paid a Q2 common stock dividend of 47 cents a share, up 17.5% from the prior quarter.""Occupancy continued to move higher year-over-year, up 160 basis points, and realized rent growth inched up to 5.2%,"" Bilerman noted. ""Acquisitions continue to ramp but at a slower pace.""Extra Space uses acquisitions to expand its business in existing markets and move into new ones.One of its biggest deals came in January, when it spent around $200 million to buy a self-storage portfolio of 17 assets located in Virginia.""We believe there are plenty of growth opportunities because there are a lot of properties out there to acquire,"" Norman said. ""The stereotypical storage owner is an entrepreneur reaching a point where he wants to capitalize on his investment and move on to another phase of his life, so you see opportunities pop up regularly.""Extra Space is due to report Q3 results after the stock market close on Oct. 29. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect FFO of 65 cents a share, up 41% from a year earlier. Full-year FFO is seen rising 27% to $2.49.The company's stock price touched a record high of 56.05 on Oct. 17 and still trades near there.

332,EXR,"Extra Space Storage (EXR) is still repairing the dividend damage suffered during the last recession.The Utah-based real estate investment trust skipped the second- and third-quarter payouts in 2009 and reduced the subsequent payouts.The quarterly dividend was 25 cents a share in Q1 of 2009. After skipping the next two quarters, the Q4 payout was 13 cents a share and 10 cents a share in Q1 of 2010.Since then, the quarterly dividend has doubled to 20 cents a share. The annualized yield is 2.3%.The stock appeared Friday in IBD's Your Weekly Review, which basically involves the top 15 percentile of the market.Extra Space is a REIT that derives its income from rent payments on storage units, a revenue fee of 6% on properties it manages for others, and tenant insurance.The fee-based revenue for managing other facilities brings a benefit beyond revenue. Extra Space Storage sees the management business as an acquisition pipeline. Acquisitions are a key part of Extra Space Storage's growth strategy. The company made 55 acquisitions in 2011.As of June 30, Extra Space was managing 179 facilities for franchisees or third parties. The company owns 363 facilities and has a stake in 340 joint ventures. Together, that makes for 882 in 34 states.Most facilities are in major cities. About 24% are in California.Annual earnings last year grew 28% on revenue growth of 17%. The Street expects EPS to advance 24% this year on a 16% pop in revenue.In the past three quarters, EPS leapt 30%, 31% and 34% on revenue gains of 27%, 22% and again 22%.Rivals such as Public Storage (PSA),  Sovran Self Storage (SSS) and  CubeSmart (CUBE) are showing slower growth on the top and bottom lines.Drawbacks for Extra Space include a sluggish economy and tight credit. Extra Space has $1.3 billion in total debt, with 18% subject to variable interest rates.Some market watchers say the self-storage business is ""recession-proof"" or ""recession-resistant."" If so, someone forgot to tell the stock market.In the past recession, the stock of Extra Space fell 76%, Public Storage 61%, Sovran 74% and Cube-Smart 94%.

But the market for them has grown tens of billions of dollars bigger than it was seven to 10 years ago, analysts note, although it's still fragmented.

340,EXR,"From 2004 to the end of this October, the market capitalization of health care REITS grew more than 300% to about $67 billion, according to data from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. Meanwhile the market cap of self-storage REITs has tripled to $30 billion. And while there were no publicly traded student housing REITs at the end of 2004, NAREIT data show now there are three with a total market cap of $5.8 billion.
"
341,EXR,"IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group ranks just No. 141 of 197 groups tracked. And all equity REITs generated an annualized average total return of just 2% over the five years ended Oct. 31, according to NAREIT. But its data show niches outperforming: Student housing REITs saw an average of 8%, as trusts in the health care and self-storage areas had average returns of 11.7% and 12.8%, respectively.
"
342,EXR,"Why are yields higher? Merrill notes that some 70% of college students need off-campus housing and aging Baby Boomers need health care. Self-storage has benefited from the steady thrum of marriage, divorce and other life events — not to mention moves from houses into apartments after the housing bust.
"
343,EXR,"Storage was one of the most resilient asset classes in the downturn, given its low cost and need-based nature, Merrill says. Demand ""comes from downsizing"" as the population ages, he adds, and areas with a ""high percentage of renters.""
"
344,EXR,"But he notes that about 30% of demand comes from business users who find storage a low cost way to run their operations.

Generally top properties in the best locations across all three niches trade for a cap rate of roughly 5.5% to 6.5%, observers say, while lower-quality real estate and smaller-market assets have higher rates.

Publicly traded Ventas (VTR) and Duke Realty (DRE) REITs, as well as nonlisted Griffin American Healthcare REIT II, have been the most active buyers of medical office properties over the last 24 months, according to Real Capital.

Those big owners control as much as 50% of the properties in the top 20 markets, estimates Charles ""Chico"" LeClaire, senior director of Marcus & Millichap's self-storage group.
"
353,EXR,"Historically mom-and-pop or other small investors owned about 80% of the properties, and it's still that way in smaller markets, he adds, but likely not for long.

378,EXR,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Extra Space Storage, Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report) recently announced a 10.3% hike in its quarterly cash dividend. The company will now pay a dividend of 86 cents per share, up from 78 cents paid earlier. The raised dividend will be paid on Jun 29, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Jun 15.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $3.44 a share, resulting in a 3.6% yield, considering Extra Space Storage’s closing price of $95.15 on May 25. Since the company’s dividend yield surpasses the industry average of 3.3%, the stock is likely to draw investors’ attention.Moreover, the company remains committed to increasing shareholders’ wealth. In May 2016, the company announced a 32.2% hike in quarterly dividend payout. With that, Extra Space Storage achieved a five-year total increase of 212% in dividend. In fact, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for real estate investment trust (REIT) investors.Extra Space Storage has solid fundamentals to back dividend hikes. It is a self-storage REIT that offers a vast array of well-located storage units to its customers, for boat, recreational-vehicle and business purposes. As of Mar 31, 2018, Extra Space Storage enjoyed ownership, had ownership stakes in or managed 1,523 stores in 39 states of the United States, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. Its  ROE is 18.85%, higher than the industry average of 4.9%.Further, the company made concerted efforts to consistently grow its business and achieve geographical diversity through accretive acquisitions, mutually beneficial joint-venture partnerships and third-party management services. Over the past five years, Extra Space Storage acquired $4.5 billion in properties. The company gained an increased scale in several core markets on the back of these acquisitions. It also fortified its presence in a number of new markets.Moreover, the industry is characterized by fragmented ownership and only around 20% of the total self-storage square footage is under REIT’s ownership. This creates solid scope for consolidation at some level in the future. With a solid balance sheet, Extra Space Storage remains well poised to compete for acquisitions.Extra Space Storage currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of Extra Space Storage have outperformed the industry in the past three months.

379,EXR,"Extra Space Storage, Inc.’s (EXR  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 core funds from operations (FFO) as adjusted per share of $1.09 was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure was also 5.8% higher than the prior-year quarter.Results reflect growth in property-rental revenues and improvement in same-store net operating income (NOI). Further, higher rental rates supported growth.Quarterly revenues of $285.5 million climbed 8.5% year over year. However, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $286.8 million.Behind the HeadlinesSame-store revenues increased 5.2% year over year to $234.1 million during the first quarter while same-store NOI climbed 4.5% to $167.2 million. The increase in same-store revenues was driven by higher rental rates for both new and existing customers. Same-store occupancy was 92.1% as of Mar 31, 2018, up 10 basis points from 92.0% as of Mar 31, 2017.Notably, during the reported quarter, Atlanta, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Sacramento were the major markets, which recorded revenue growth above the company's portfolio average. However, markets, which performed below the company's portfolio average, included Charleston, Dallas, Houston, Virginia Beach and West Palm Beach.Portfolio ActivityExtra Space Storage acquired three operating stores, one store at the completion of construction and it also purchased their joint-venture partners' interest in a store for a total investment of $69.9 million. Also, the company purchased one Certificate of Occupancy store and finished a development with joint-venture partners for $22.8 million, out of which the company’s shares were $14.9 million.Notably, as of Mar 31, 2018, the company managed 456 stores for third-party owners. Moreover, with additional 216 stores owned and operated in joint ventures, the company’s total stores under management reached 672.Balance SheetExtra Space Storage exited first-quarter 2018, with roughly $35.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, declining from $55.7 million at the end of 2017. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company's percentage of fixed-rate debt to total debt was 74.4%.In addition, the company had $349.4 million available for issuance under the ATM program as of Mar 31, 2018.OutlookExtra Space Storage revised its outlook for 2018. The company now anticipates FFO as adjusted per share in the band of $4.57-$4.66. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.59.The company projects same-store property revenue growth of 3.50-4.25% and same-store property NOI growth of around 3.25-4.50% for the year.In ConclusionWe are encouraged by the performance of Extra Space Storage in the first quarter. We are also impressed with its focus on expanding  itsgeographical footprint through accretive acquisitions and third-party management platforms.It enjoys a presence in key cities and opts for strategic joint ventures to drive long-term profitability. Moreover, a solid balance sheet and fragmented ownership of its industry will likely prove conducive to portfolio consolidation and strategic acquisitions.However, many of the company’s markets are witnessing an escalating supply of new self-storage space and this is anticipated to fuel competition for the company, curb its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.Extra Space Storage currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(DCT  -  Free Report) to acquire the latter in a $8.4-billion stock-for-stock deal, including debt assumption. Notably, the deal, which is anticipated to create near-term synergies of nearly $80 million, was unanimously approved by both companies’ board of directors.Moreover, the news was well received by Wall Street, as the company’s shares witnessed a marginal rise on May 1, 2018.   Deal Terms:DCT shareholders will be given 1.02 shares of Prologis in exchange of each DCT share. The transaction, subject to DCT stockholders’ approval and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in third-quarter 2018.  How will Prologis Benefit From The Acquisition?With this acquisition, Prologis adds 71-million-square-foot of operating portfolio that overlaps the company’s existing assets. This enables the company to strengthen its foothold in major high-growth markets of Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area, New York/New Jersey, Seattle and South Florida.Further, this deal has helped the company acquire 7.1 million square feet of development, redevelopment and value-added projects, 195 acres of land in pre-development, with build-out potential of more than 2.9 million square feet, and 215 acres of land under contract or option, with a build-out potential of more than 3.3 million square feet.Considering DCT’s high-quality realigned portfolio, along with an efficient platform and strong customer base, the buyout is expected to solidify Prologis’ market position and improve its growth curve.Notably, the combined portfolio will allow the company to realize significant economies of scale. In fact, management anticipates that the $80-milion synergies in corporate general and administrative cost savings, operating leverage, interest expense, and lease adjustments will increase stabilized core FFO per share by 6-8 cents, annually.Furthermore, the combined portfolios indicate the possibility of generating additional annual revenues and development profit to the tune of $40 million, in the future.Our ViewpointPrologis’ acquisition of one of its peers comes at a time when the industrial real estate market is experiencing a boom, courtesy the e-commerce boom. Additionally, there has been a significant increase in the number of industries and companies opting for consolidation of operations in a bid to improve supply chain efficiencies, and shift near large population centers. These factors have driven demand and rent for industrial realties across the nation.    Hence, amid the encouraging market scenario, this acquisition enables the company to expand its reach in major markets without having to individually purchase assets, that would not be viable given the stiff competition for quality assets.  In addition, we note that the company is well capitalized with a solid balance sheet, and the stock-for-stock deal will increase its U.S. dollar net equity.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed its industry in the past three months.

381,EXR,"Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, after the market closes. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are expected to register year-over-year growth.In the last reported quarter, this Salt Lake City, UT-based self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 3.7%, in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected growth in property-rental revenues and improvement in same-store net operating income (NOI). Higher occupancy and rental rates also supported growth.The company has a decent surprise history. In fact, it exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.8%. This is depicted in the graph below:Extra Space Storage Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Extra Space Storage Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Extra Space Storage Inc QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors That Might Impact Q1 ResultsExtra Space Storage is the second largest self-storage operator in the United States, as well as the largest self-storage management company in the nation. The company offers a wide array of well-located storage units to its customers, including boat storage, recreational vehicle storage and business storage. It enjoys high brand value and robust presence in key cities.The company also made concerted efforts to consistently grow its business, and achieve geographical diversity through accretive acquisitions, mutually beneficial joint-venture partnerships and third-party management services.In addition, the self-storage industry is anticipated to witness solid demand, backed by favorable demographic changes and events like marriages, shifting, death, and even divorce. Amid these, in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the company is anticipated to benefit from steady demand in the self-storage industry, and record growth in same-store revenues and NOI.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $251 million for property rental revenue reflects a sequential rise from the prior-quarter figure of $246 million. The estimate for management fees and other income is pegged at $10.5 million, up from $10.1 million in the previous quarter. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total revenues is pegged at $286.8 million, indicating a year-over-year rise of 9.0%.However, Extra Space Storage operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. In addition, there is a development boom of self-storage units in many markets. This will likely fuel competition for the company, curb its power to raise rents, and turn on more discounting.Prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the first quarter remained unchanged at $1.09, over the past month. However, it indicates a year-over-year increase of 5.8%.Additionally, shares of Extra Space Storage have gained 3.0% in the past three months, outperforming the 6.7% decline registered by its industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Extra Space Storage will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

382,EXR,"The stock market’s strong run over the past few years brought attention to high-flying growth stocks, usually from the technology sector, that were consistently outpacing the market. However, fresh volatility within the last few months has shifted the focus back towards other investment strategies, and now it might be time for investors to check out things like real estate investment trusts, or REITs.REITs are companies that own, operate, or finance real estate properties that produce income, such as apartment complexes or retail locations. These companies are heavily regulated and must meet a number of qualifications to be classified as a REIT, but they do offer investors a few distinct advantages.First of all, real estate can be a very profitable investment sector when certain economic conditions are present. What’s more, REITs must pay at least 90% of their taxable income in dividends to shareholders, so they are a great option for income investors looking for steady payouts.Luckily for Zacks readers, the proven Zacks Rank—which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions—works with REITs just as it would with any other company. The strongest REITs are going to be those with improving outlooks and great Zacks Ranks.With that said, check out the REITs that are model says are impressive options right now:1. New Residential Investment Corp. (NRZ  -  Free Report)New Residential is a mortgage REIT focused on the residential real estate market. The company deals primarily with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), having pioneered investments in so-called Excess MSRs—which enable it to collect monthly cash flows without assuming some servicing duties, advance obligations, or liabilities.NRZ is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and offers a dividend yield of about 10.7%. The stock is also an interesting value play, with shares trading at just 8.5x forward earnings. The company’s P/B ratio of 1.1 is also in an attractive territory. The firm has also put together a solid earnings beat streak and watched its 2018 outlook improve significantly. Shares have since been testing a new 52-week high. 2. Ladder Capital Corp. (LADR  -  Free Report)Ladder Capital is a commercial real estate finance company. The company focuses on midmarket senior secured commercial first mortgage loans, securities backed by first mortgage commercial loans, and investing in net leased and other commercial real estate. Ladder Capital also provides some services to the commercial real estate industry.LADR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its dividend yield is about 8.1% right now, and the company has steadily raised its quarterly dividend from 28 cents to 33 cents per share over the past two years.Meanwhile, the stock is a decent growth option, with earnings and revenue both expected to improve about 12% this fiscal year. LADR trades at just 9.3x forward earnings and has a PEG ratio of 1.9. 3. Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report)Chatham Lodging Trust is a self-advised hotel REIT, formed to invest in premium-branded upscale extended-stay and select-service hotels. It invests primarily in hotels in large metropolitan markets in the U.S. Its brand investments include Residence Inn by Marriott, Homewood Suites by Hilton and Summerfield Suites by Hyatt, and more.CLDT has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. The stock has a dividend yield of about 6.4%, and the firm has a proven track record of maintaining this payout for many years. This is a small-cap play, but shares have added more than 12% over the trailing three months, and the stock is trending back toward its 52-week high. Want more market analysis from this author?

387,EXR,"Boston Properties, Inc. (BXP  -  Free Report) is slated to break ground on May 2 for its first residential project on the West Coast, per news from San Francisco Business Times. The move comes as part of the company’s effort to diversify its asset base.Specifically, a 402-unit apartment tower will be developed adjacent to Oakland's MacArthur BART station. As a result, the tower is expected to enjoy decent accessibility to transportation. In fact, per the report, buses plied by AC Transit, Emeryville and major neighboring employers halt there. Therefore, residential units in the tower are likely to enjoy demand.According to the company’s prior earnings call, excluding land, the tower is slated to cost $265 million. The project is planned to be fully financed with equity, rather than debt. Boston Properties has a ground lease with McGrath Properties, which is the long-time developer of MacArthur Transit Village, as well as the land’s owner.Boston Properties is basically an office landlord having millions of office spaces in its portfolio. However, the company aims to diversify and add more residential spaces in its portfolio because such property types usually ensure steady cash flow. The company’s residential development project includes around 400 units in Reston, VA, and a mixed-use project having housing and a hotel in Boston.The company’s assets are located in select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets, and its diversified tenant and industry base are expected to steadily drive the company’s long-term growth. Its properties are concentrated in five core markets: Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC. These regions comprise traditional tenants, like government, financial services and law firms, as well as businesses involving technology, advertising, media and information distribution, mobility, life sciences and medical devices.Nevertheless, there is growth in supply of office space and this remains a concern because higher supply usually leads to lesser absorption, and also curtails landlords’ capability to demand more rents. Further, a few big financial players are resizing their business and trying to cut costs, which is affecting demand for office space. Rate hike is another concern.Boston Properties has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

388,EXR,"Of late, Iron Mountain Incorporated (IRM  -  Free Report) has been adding capabilities to its cloud platform. Specifically, the company recently announced rolling out the Iron Cloud for Video, which is a secure and scalable cloud-based solution enabling organizations to manage video content efficiently.Particularly, the solution offers organizations a scope to lower the cost and complexity of management of video data and content while increasing compliance. In fact, without bearing the upfront capital expenses for purchase of additional on-premise video infrastructure, organizations can progress with video-content management and access requirements. The solution is available as part of the company’s Iron Cloud purpose-built portfolio of cloud-based enterprise-class data management and access solutions.Notably, the volume of video data is growing at an exponential pace, thanks to the increasing use of video technology across sectors and industries. In fact, with the arrival of new video sources and technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), drone surveillance and high-definition cameras, the volume of data and content is likely to supersede the capacity of on-premise solutions. However, this rapid growth is also leading to cost escalations and complexity, in turn throwing up challenges for management. Amid this, the company’s addition to the Iron cloud platforms seems a strategic fit.Apart from this, Iron Mountain recently announced that it has added new capabilities to its online policy management platform — Policy Center — that will enable companies to understand and comply with policies relating to privacy and retention of data.The latest capability additions will improve the services offered by the company’s cloud-based platform amid a challenging regulatory landscape. Nevertheless, Iron Mountain’s service revenues remain modest due to shrinking activity rates, as stored records are becoming less active. Also, recycled paper prices continue to fall. The recovery is expected to be slow in the near term, thus making it difficult for the company to achieve any robust top-line growth. Furthermore, the company has a highly-leveraged balance sheet.Amid these, shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have underperformed its industry in the past three months.

389,EXR,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) reached a “handshake” deal to sell 49.5% stake in the Manhattan office tower at 666 Fifth Avenue to Kushner Companies, as per the regulatory filing by Vornado done on Friday.The terms of the deal with Kushner, the majority owner of the economically distressed building, has not been revealed yet. Notably, Vornado will retain the ownership of 666 Fifth Avenue retail.Kushner Companies was earlier led by US President Donald Trump’s key adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The company bought the building, just before the financial crisis in 2007, for a record price of $1.8 billion. However, as recession created chaos for Kushner, they eventually started selling its parts. As a result, in 2011, Vornado acquired 49.5% stake in the building and was permitted to rearrange the mortgage on the office building.Through the filing, Steven Roth, Vornado’s chairman and chief executive officer informed the investors, “I believe we now have a handshake to sell our interest to our partner at a price which will repay our investment plus a mezzanine-type return. The existing loan will be repaid including payment to us of the portion of the debt that we hold.”Notably, as part of portfolio-repositioning efforts, Vornado has been aggressively disposing of its assets. Moreover, in July 2017, it completed the spin-off of its Washington, DC-segment. Earlier, the company spun-off the shopping center business, creating Urban Edge Properties – a publicly traded REIT. Another $1 billion of assets have been identified, which the company will be selling over the next several years. The streamlining efforts are a strategic fit and are anticipated to propel growth over the long term. However, the earnings dilutive impact cannot be bypassed in the near term.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock underperformed the industry in the past 12 months, declining 16.3% versus the industry’s descend of 4.1%.Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same space include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

390,EXR,"Data Center REIT — Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report) — recently announced a partnership with Singapore Internet Exchange (SGIX). The move is aimed at providing local peering at its Singapore data-center facilities in Jurong West and Loyang East.In fact, one of the largest internet exchanges in Singapore, SGIX enjoys peak Internet traffic of more than 150 Gbps. It will provide customers at Digital Realty's Jurong West and Loyang East Singapore facilities better and cost-effective connectivity choices. The consumers will benefit from SGIX's rich peering ecosystem, consisting of international and regional carriers.As a result, the partnership of Digital Realty with this open and neutral Internet exchange in Singapore seems a strategic fit. Particularly, Singapore serves as the Internet gateway to Asian markets. The region is fast growing and in fact, South East Asia is likely to upkeep 81 million people in its fast-growing cities by 2020.Notably, growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, is triggering demand for data centers. Demand is outpacing supply in the top-tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets continue to randomly absorb new constructions at a faster pace. This, along with improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to drive demand for data centers.To capitalize on the trend, Digital Realty has resorted to accretive acquisitions, developments as well as strategic partnerships. In September 2017, the company announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros, in an all-stock deal, for an enterprise value of about $7.8 billion. This move enhanced Digital Realty’s portfolio in the top U.S. data center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley. It helped it upgrade hyper-scale product offering and grow blue-chip customer base. The company is also focused on expanding its footprint in Europe, Australia and Asia.Nevertheless, given the solid growth potential of the data-center real estate market, competition is expected to intensify in the upcoming period from existing as well as new players. Amid all this, an aggressive pricing pressure is predicted in this market.Digital Realty has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

391,EXR,"Iron Mountain Incorporated (IRM  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has added new capabilities to its online policy management platform — Policy Center — that will enable companies to understand and comply with policies relating to privacy and retention of data.Notably, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is scheduled to be effective from May 25, 2018, is a legal framework that consolidates data-privacy laws across Europe, and will be applicable to companies within and outside the country that control data of European Union (EU) subjects.As a result, enterprises will need to be well informed about legal retention and data-processing obligations to ensure complete adherence, as well as avoid any data breach possibilities. Further, to achieve compliance, the firms require a clear governance program that provides accurate information. By incorporating data-privacy information into the Policy Center platform, Iron Mountain fulfills compliance needs of companies. Amid this increasing rigid regulation, such a cloud-based retention and privacy policy management platform will help enterprises to comprehensively understand the obligations and adhere to regulations such as the EU GDPR. In addition, Policy Center Enterprise Edition offers various tools to document important information relating to personal data. In fact, the cloud-based solution is now equipped with updated privacy and retention guidelines from all over the world, backed by privacy experts from individual industries and locations. This will provide better clarity to companies that can update the respective data privacy and retention practices through a browser interface. Additionally, these companies can notify employees of the rules to ensure uniform implementation.Though the latest capability addition will improve the services offered by the company’s cloud-based policy management platform amid a challenging regulatory landscape, it is struggling to maintain revenues from storage services. Notably, service revenues remain modest due to the shrinking activity rates as stored records are becoming less active.

392,EXR,"Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) unveiled a new three-story self-storage facility in sync with its plans of expanding in North Carolina. The storage facility was established in Huntersville, a suburb of Charlotte.Located at 10219 Bryton Corporate Center Dr. Huntersville, NC 28078, this self-storage unit has 900 spaces available. The facility is adjacent to the new Walmart Supercenter, Lake Norman and the Northlake Mall.Notably, expansion in North Carolina is a strategic fit for the company as many people are shifting to Huntersville and other suburbs. The area is witnessing fast growth as the I-485 beltway was broadened, aiding commuting. Currently, the homes are reasonably priced and provide easy access to people who are traveling to the city for work.The units boast energy-efficient climate-controlled systems, making it suitable for extreme weathers. They come in a variety of sizes that range from small to extra-large to suit individual requirements. Free car parking is also available in abundance.Public Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. The ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry with presence in all the major metropolitan markets of the United States. Further, the company managed to create a significant presence in the European markets through the Shurgard Storage Centers’ acquisition in 2006.Additionally, the company has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. In fact, since January 2015, 345 self-storage facilities have been acquired, developed or expanded by the company. Particularly, during 2017, it acquired 22 self-storage facilities, comprising 1.4 million net rentable square feet, for $149.8 million. Following the quarter end, the company acquired or was under contract to acquire two self-storage facilities, spanning 0.2 million net rentable square feet, for $18 million. Such acquisitions and expansions bode well for long-term growth.Nevertheless, supply has been high in a number of markets and this adversely affects the company’s pricing power. In fact, Public Storage operates in a highly-fragmented market in the United States with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. This limits its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.Shares of Public Storage outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past three months.

393,EXR,"The lawsuit of Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report) — better known as Aimco — against Airbnb, which alleged that the short-term rental website has allowed tenants to violate their lease agreements through unauthorized subleases, has proceeded in the Florida court.Further, the court dismissed Airbnb’s premise which was supposedly protected by the Communications Decency Act. Per the act, online-service providers are protected from the responsibility for the content users’ actions.Aimco alleged that its high-end apartment communities’ tenants in Los Angeles complained about noisy Airbnb tourists and therefore more security staff had to be employed for property monitoring, tracing and expelling of unlawful Airbnb guests. Per the court, the company was right to claim compensation due to increased expenses because of enhanced security, damage caused to their properties and reduction in value of the properties. Further, the court allowed Aimco to put a perpetual ban if they succeed at the trial.Cindy Lempke, Aimco‘s spokesperson informed, “Aimco will vigorously pursue its remedies for Airbnb's illegal use of our properties that disrupts the residential living experience, tramples on private property rights, and reduces affordable housing options for middle class renters. We are confident that we will be successful in our efforts to stand up for working families who need housing and want to maintain a tranquil home life, free from the intrusions that are created by illegal short-term rentals.""Though this verdict by the court is favorable for Aimco, elevated apartment supply remains a concern for the company. Particularly, new supply is competing with some of Aimco’s higher rent properties. This high supply in a number of the company’s markets is a concern because it curtails landlords’ ability to command more rent and result in lesser absorption.In the past six months, shares of the company edged down 8.1% against the industry’s decline of 8.4%.Aimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the REIT space include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

Along with that, a five-property portfolio, located in Florida and Georgia, was sold for $72.7 million.As per Ross Cooper, president and chief investment officer at Kimco, because of the increased demand for open-air shopping centers, the company was able to make substantial advances toward its disposition target for 2018. He further added, “We continue to see favorable interest for these types of assets, and together with the considerable sales volume achieved during the first quarter as well as the additional properties under contract, we remain confident in our ability to meet our 2018 net disposition target of $700 to $900 million.”In 2018, Kimco intends to be a net seller of properties. The company has  about $465 million worth of properties already in contract and assets worth $330 million in the market as of Mar 31, 2018.The company’s strategic 2020 Vision envisages simplifying its business structure by concentrating on its U.S. shopping center portfolio, targeting for the ownership of large and high-quality assets in major metro markets, and simultaneously shedding non-core assets and exiting from its joint-venture portfolio.

395,EXR,"Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results after the market closes on Feb 13. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are anticipated to experience year-over-year growth.Last quarter, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 2% with respect to FFO per share. Results indicated growth in revenues and FFO on a year-over-year basis.The company has a decent surprise history having surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 1.55%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS Surprise Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Federal Realty Investment Trust QuoteHowever, Federal Realty’s shares have descended 16.1% in the past six months, against the industry’s decline of 6.1%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFederal Realty has been taking advantage of the redevelopment opportunities. Particularly, amid a fast-evolving retail environment, the company is making strategic efforts to reposition, redevelop and re-merchandise its portfolio.These efforts will not only help the company counter competition from e-retailers but will also enable it to post decent operating results in the to-be-reported quarter.Subsequently, minimum rents from the retail and commercial segment will likely record year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $147 million indicates an encouraging growth of 4.6% as compared to the year-ago quarter. Furthermore, total rental income is projected to be $214 million, an increase of 6.5% from the prior-year tally.However, rising consumer purchases through the Internet has emerged as a pressing concern for this REIT. These have made retailers reconsider their footprints and eventually opt for store closures. Also, retailers, not able to cope with competition, have been filing bankruptcies.Accordingly, percentage rents, which indicate additional rent based on the level of sales achieved by the tenant, are predicted to witness a considerable decline due to the tepid retail environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.34 million reflects a 7.4% rise as compared to the prior-year quarter.Federal Realty’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q4 FFO has edged down marginally to $1.47 in two months’ time. However, it indicates a rise of 1.4% year-over-year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $218.7 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 7.1%.For full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $851.5 million, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 6.2%. The consensus estimate for FFO per share is $5.91, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 4.6%. Management expects FFO per share in the range of $5.89-$5.92.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Federal Realty will likely beat on earnings this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Federal Realty is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both are pegged at $1.47.Zacks Rank: Federal Realty’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to come up with a positive surprise this time around:CubeSmart (CUBE  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 15.

Further, the area boasts strong trade demographics which help generate high sales per square foot of $906.The sale is consistent with Macerich’s aggressive capital-recycling program, which involves the divestiture of non-core and slower-growth assets, and using the proceeds in higher-growth properties through acquisitions, developments and redevelopment initiatives. Specifically, the company aims at rotating capital out of its non-strategic assets and reinvesting in high-quality retail properties in key retail destinations across the nation.  In fact, per the latest earnings call, the company continued to shrink its non-core portfolio and shed interest in a Philadelphia-based office building for $31 million. Macerich recorded a gain of $6.7 million from this transaction. Additionally, the proceeds from these dispositions were used for share buybacks.Going forward, we expect such moves to offer an upside potential to the company and strengthen its high-end portfolio which consist of ownership in 54 million square feet gross leasable area, in mainly 48 regional shopping centers.However, year to date, amid the choppy retail real estate environment, shares of Macerich have underperformed the industry it belongs to. During this time frame, shares of the company have dropped 9.9%, whereas the industry has registered growth of 9.6%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share for 2017 has been revised 0.2% downward to $3.95 in a month’s time.Macerich currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksBetter-ranked stocks in the real estate investment trust (REIT) space include Cedar Realty Trust (CDR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage (EXR  -  Free Report) and Urstadt Biddle Properties (UBA  -  Free Report).

398,EXR,"Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. The ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry, with presence in all major metropolitan markets of the nation. Further, the company has managed to create a significant presence in the European markets as well, through the Shurgard Storage Centers’ acquisition in 2006.Moreover, the self-storage industry’s fundamentals are likely to be driven by favorable demographic changes, and events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce. Also, due to shorter leasing periods, this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike.In recent times, Public Storage announced opening of new units in Plano, TX. Specifically, the company unveiled nearly 900 storage units at a new self-storage facility in the rapidly growing region of North Dallas.In fact, the company has been efficiently capitalizing on growth opportunities. Since the beginning of 2015 through Sep 30, 2017, the company has acquired a total of 86 facilities, with 6.2 million net rentable square feet from third parties for around $679.6 million. Further, since Jan 1, 2013, Public Storage has opened newly developed and redeveloped self-storage space for a total cost of $831.2 million, which added around 7.5 million of net rentable square feet.Following the third-quarter 2017 closure, the company acquired or was under contract to acquire eight self-storage facilities, spanning 0.5 million net rentable square feet of space, for $67.8 million. Such acquisitions and expansions bode well for the company’s long-term growth. The company also has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, with adequate liquidity to actively pursue acquisitions and developments.Public Storage also delivered a decent performance in the recently-reported quarter. The company’s core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.61 marked 3.2% growth from the prior-year quarter figure of $2.53. Results mirror an improvement in net operating income (NOI) from both same-store and non-same store facilities. Higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot supported the company’s same-store performance.Shares of Public Storage have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. The company’s shares logged in a gain of 4.2% compared with growth of 3% recorded by the industry. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year FFO per share has been revised 0.1% upward in a month’s time, reflecting analysts’ bullish sentiments. Given its progress on fundamentals, the stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead.Nonetheless, supply has been rising in a number of markets and this adversely affects the company’s pricing power. In fact, the company operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. This limits its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.Also, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Public Storage currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the REIT space are Cedar Realty Trust (CDR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage (EXR  -  Free Report) and Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report).

399,EXR,"Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) recently completed the acquisition of the Infomart Dallas from ASB Real Estate Investments in an $800-million cash-debt transaction. This move is in sync with the company’s effort to expand in the region. Further, it offers scope to capitalize on the solid growth potential of the Latin America market in terms of Interconnection Bandwidth.The buyout seems a strategic fit for Equinix. Specifically, the acquisition has enhanced the company’s portfolio with around 1.6 million gross square feet of space. It includes multiple diverse fiber entry points. Also, the company gained from the addition of more than 50 tenants, including networks, colocation providers and office tenants.Around $50 million of revenues were generated by the Infomart building in 2017. One year from closing, Equinix estimates this transaction to be adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share breakeven. In addition, future development of the adjacent acquired land parcel offers significant AFFO upside potential.In fact, Equinix’s global platform gets a boost with the acquisition of Infomart, which is one of the largest inter-connection hubs in the United States. It currently houses four of eight Equinix Dallas International Business Exchange data centers.Moreover, the Dallas market has been experiencing sizable growth with solid demand stemming from a rising number of enterprises across different verticals setting their regional or national headquarters in the region.Furthermore, according to the company, Dallas serves as a key interconnection point for LATAM traffic, with routes serving Central and South America. Therefore, with LATAM predicted to be the fastest growing region in terms of Interconnection Bandwidth through 2020, per the Equinix published 2017 Interconnection Index Report, this Infomart facility acquisition in Dallas, and its operative units in Miami, Los Angeles, Bogotá, Sao Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro will likely help the company leverage on the growth potential of the Latin America market.Notably, acquisitions have been a major growth driver for Equinix and helped it expand its data-center capacity in many of the company’s key markets since 2003. Last year, the company bought various assets, including the Itconic and Zenium businesses, and data-center assets from IO UK and ICT-Center AG. Furthermore, in 2017 the company completed the acquisition of 29 data centers and their operations from Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), for a total cash consideration of $3.6 billion. All these acquisitions are expected to make decent contributions toward the company’s total revenue growth.Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

400,EXR,"Office real estate investment trust (REIT) Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE  -  Free Report) has a particular focus on collaborative life-science and technology campuses. The company, which is based in Pasadena, CA, specifically emphasizes on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses.These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit, and a limited supply of available space. This highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants, in turn, ensuring steady rental revenues for the company. In fact, as of Dec 31, 2017, 55% of the annual rental revenues were derived from investment-grade tenants, whereas 80% of the annual rental revenues came from Class A properties in AAA locations.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has gained 1.5% in the past six months against 7.6% decline of its industry. However, the stock is likely to rally significantly in the near term, as there are a number of favorable factors.In fact, high demand for Class A properties in AAA locations has been boosting occupancy level. The company is witnessing strong demand for space in key life-science markets. It enjoys a solid 10-year historical occupancy rate of 95%, which is anticipated to continue in the upcoming quarters as well.Alexandria continues to execute and deliver strong internal growth. The year 2017 marked its second highest year of leasing volume at nearly 4.6 million rentable square feet. Further, the company achieved rental rate growth of 12.7% on lease renewals and re-leasing of space. In addition, robust external growth, development and redevelopment of new Class A properties in AAA locations will likely boost its operating performance.Moreover, Alexandria has adequate financial flexibility to cushion and enhance its market position. The company had $2 billion of liquidity as of Dec 31, 2017. Additionally, it has no debt maturities in 2018, while two loans are set to mature in 2019. Also, its current cash flow growth of 35.6% compares favorably with the 6.2% increase estimated for the industry.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors can also consider other top-ranked stocks in the REIT industry like Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

401,EXR,"The industrial real estate asset category has grabbed attention due to elevated demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and a healthy manufacturing environment. Given Prologis Inc.’s (PLD  -  Free Report) capacity, the company remains well positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities.In fact, the company provides industrial distribution warehouse space in some of the busiest distribution markets across the globe. Its properties are typically located in large, supply-constrained infill markets with airports, seaports and ground transportation facilities nearby, which facilitates rapid distribution of customers’ products.At the end of fourth-quarter 2017, occupancy level in the company’s owned and managed portfolio was 97.2%, expanding 10 basis points (bps) year over year. This record level was driven by the U.S. portfolio which experienced 98.0% of occupancy. Moreover, the company’s share of net effective rent change was 19.0% in the quarter compared with 16.0% recorded in the prior year. The figure was led by the U.S. portfolio, which recorded impressive growth of 29.8%.Prologis is focused on bolstering its liquidity and strengthening the balance sheet. For full-year 2017, the company reported a 340-basis-point contraction in leverage to 23.7%, on a market capitalization basis, and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA improved around 0.2x to 4.6x. The company remains well poised to capitalize on growth opportunities backed by its balance-sheet strength and prudent financial management.In addition, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Prologis remains committed to that. Shareholders of the company rejoiced this February after the board approved a 9% hike in its annualized dividend rate to $1.92 from the $1.76 paid earlier. This dividend rate is expected to be sustainable on the back of the company’s financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio and payout ratio compared to that of the industry.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed its industry in the last year. The stock has gained 17% against the industry’s descend of 5.3% during this time frame.However, recovery in the industrial market has persisted for a long time and chances of any significant drop in availability rates are less. In fact, a whole lot of new buildings are slated to be completed and made available in the market in the near term, leading to higher supply and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth.Additionally, hike in interest rate can pose a challenge for the company. Rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company, which might affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate and lower dividend payouts as well. Also, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same industry are Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

402,EXR,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) declared a 4% increase in annualized common dividend for 2018. The company will now pay a cash dividend of 32.25 cents per share for the first quarter compared with 31 cents paid in the prior quarter.The new dividend will be paid on Apr 30 to shareholders on record as of Apr 9. Based on this increased rate, annualized yield comes to about 3.7%, considering UDR's closing price of $34.70 on Mar 27.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors and UDR is consistent in this regard. In fact, the new dividend will mark this residential real estate investment trust’s (REIT) 182nd successive quarterly dividend payout on its common stock. Prior to the latest hike, the company had increased its dividend per share by 5% in 2017.Further, UDR is believed to have adequate capital to support its dividend policy. The company reported fourth-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) as adjusted per share of 48 cents, matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure also came higher than the prior-year quarter tally of 46 cents.Total revenues for the quarter rose 4.1% year over year to $252.9 million. Further, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $251.4 million. Growth in total revenues was due to the higher revenues from same-store communities and stabilized non-mature communities. Moreover, as of Dec 31, 2017, the company had around $855.3 million available from a combination of cash and undrawn capacity on its credit facilities.UDR’s portfolio, located in the targeted U.S. markets, has a superior product-mix. However, the company continues to deal with an elevated level of apartment supply in a number of its markets. This is likely to limit the landlord’s ability to demand higher rents and increase concessional activities.UDR carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

403,EXR,"Data Center REIT — Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report) — announced that for the 11th consecutive year it has achieved ""five nines"" of uptime, surpassing 99.999% availability throughout 2017. This reflects the company’s efficiency in developing and delivering data center solutions, which can be relied upon by customers.This operational excellence has been achieved despite growth of the company’s portfolio over the years, which expanded from 74 data center suites at the beginning of 2007 to more than 750 by the end of 2017.Moreover, recently, the company exceeded 1.7 billion operating minutes across its 205 data center properties. These properties included around 27 million square feet in 33 metropolitan areas internationally. The company noted that though hurricanes Harvey and Sandy left large regions without power, its data centers could uphold steady uptime.With projected growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data-center REITs are experiencing a market boom. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in the top-tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, the said markets continue to randomly absorb new constructions at a faster pace. This, along with improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to drive demand for data centers.Amid these, accretive acquisitions and development efforts are expected to boost top-line growth for Digital Realty. In September 2017, the company announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros in an all-stock deal for an enterprise value of about $7.8 billion. This move enhanced Digital Realty’s portfolio in the top U.S. data center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley. It helped it to upgrade hyper-scale product offering and grow blue-chip customer base. The company is also focused on expanding its footprint in Europe and Australia.However, given the solid growth potential of the data center real estate market, competition is expected to intensify in the upcoming period from existing as well as new players. Amid all this, an aggressive pricing pressure is anticipated in the data center market.Digital Realty has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

404,EXR,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) is likely to benefit from a diversified high-quality health care real estate portfolio, rising healthcare spending and aging population. Further, the company has resorted to strategic divestitures and is also lowering its Brookdale-portfolio concentration. Recently, in sync with its efforts, the company announced the shift in its operator for 24 senior-living communities owned by them, from Brookdale to Atria Senior Living.However, the softness in the seniors housing fundamentals amid new supply is anticipated to thwart the company’s pricing power. Also, the hike in interest rate and stiff competition remain concerns for HCP.Notably, in February, HCP reported fourth-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) as adjusted of 48 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. Results reflected a 1.2% increase in the three-month same-property portfolio cash net operating income.HCP has exposure to all types of facilities in the healthcare sector and has a well-balanced and diversified portfolio. The diverse product mix of the company allows it to explore available opportunities in various areas, based on individual market dynamics.Further, the company is focused on making opportunistic acquisitions and strategic dispositions to enhance its overall portfolio mix. During the fourth quarter, HCP announced $424 million of acquisitions. Notably, HCP completed the previously-announced $228-million acquisition of the Hayden Research Campus in the Boston life-science market. It also acquired 11 off-campus medical-office buildings for $151 million. Also, the company started Phase I of Sierra Point, marking its next key life-science development in the South San Francisco market.In addition, recently HCP shifted the operator of 24 senior living communities owned by them, from Brookdale Senior Living to Atria Senior Living. The transition is scheduled to start from this month and is likely to be accomplished by September 2018. The company has been continually trying to reduce its exposure to Brookdale as it has been facing operational and financial challenges for the past few years.Once it is completed, the dealings will benefit HCP in a number of ways. It will considerably decrease Brookdale’s concentration, increase lease coverage of their remaining triple-net assets leased to Brookdale, improve the diversification of tenants in the portfolio and enhance credit profile and balance sheet.Nevertheless, softness in the senior housing fundamentals is likely to continue in the upcoming quarters amid rising supply in the market. This is anticipated to adversely affect the company’s pricing power and occupancy level. In addition, the cut-throat competitive market makes it more challenging for HCP to increase its revenues as well as identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet its objectives.Additionally, the company is currently focusing on lowering its Brookdale-portfolio concentration. The move involves a number of strategic efforts including selling of considerable part of its portfolio and using the proceeds in debt repayment. Although such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the dilutive impact on earnings in the near term from the sale of assets is unavoidable.Amid these, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company underperformed its industry over the past three months, plunging 14.3% as against the industry’s loss of 10.8%. Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same industry include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

405,EXR,"Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA  -  Free Report), commonly known as MAA, is expected to witness high demand for its properties, stemming from robust job growth in the core markets. However, the company’s portfolio is concentrated in the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. This exposes it to economic and political doldrums prevailing in the area.This Sunbelt-focused apartment real estate investment trust (REIT) opts for opportunistic investments to maintain the right product mix and raise the number of apartment communities in dynamic markets. In fact in December 2016, the company merged with Post Properties that created a combined entity with a larger presence in targeted markets. MAA’s strong balance sheet with lower leverage and well-laddered debt maturities, offer scope for further expansion.The company is set to witness increased demand, supported by the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration. This, along with a solid portfolio, positions the company to enjoy higher occupancy and effective rent per unit.    MAA reported better-than-expected results in third-quarter 2017 with regard to funds from operations (FFO). It witnessed robust revenue growth in large as well as secondary markets. Subsequently, the company lifted full-year FFO per share outlook, revising it from the previous range of $5.77-$5.97 to $5.84-$5.94.Moreover, shares of MAA have outperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date. MAA’s shares gained 6.8% compared with 4.7% growth recorded by the industry. Nonetheless, new supply of residential properties in a number of markets, specifically in high priced-point and urban locations continue to hamper MAA’s leasing activities. This high supply adversely impacts the landlord’s capability to demand more rent and results in lesser absorption.Also, stiff competition in the residential real estate market with various housing alternatives like single-family housing, manufactured housing, condominiums and the new and existing home markets might dent any near-term revenue growth prospects. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year FFO was revised downward by a cent over a month, reflecting analysts’ bearish sentiments.MAA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the REIT space are Extra Space Storage (EXR  -  Free Report), DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report) and Paramount Group (PGRE  -  Free Report).

406,EXR,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Duke Realty (DRE  -  Free Report) announced a special cash dividend of 85 cents per share. This was primarily the outcome from the sale of its assets. This dividend will be paid on Dec 12, 2017 to shareholders of record on Dec 1.Notably, this real estate investment trust (REIT) made a sale of around $2.85 billion of assets through Sep 30, 2017. Particularly, Duke Realty resorted to the sale of its medical office assets in recent quarters. This strategic move is aimed at simplifying business model and transforming into a leading domestic pure play industrial REIT.Usually, special dividends are paid by REITs on capital gains from the sale of assets to avoid paying tax. Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest attraction for REIT investors as the U.S. law requires these companies to distribute 90% of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders.Along with special dividends, Duke Realty continues to pay regular quarterly dividend. In fact, concurrent with third-quarter 2017 earnings release, Duke Realty announced a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of 20 cents per share. This marked a sequential hike of 0.5%. The third-quarter dividend will be paid on Nov 30 to shareholders of record as of Nov 16, 2017.According to management, after going for this special dividend that satisfies the minimum REIT distribution requirements, the company will retain a significant part of sale proceeds for reinvestment in its industrial portfolio as well as strengthening balance sheet.As a matter of fact, in the overall U.S. real estate market, industrial properties have grabbed attention on robust demand, a recovery in the economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce and a healthy manufacturing environment.Duke Realty too is poised for growth by leveraging on the improving fundamentals backed by its solid portfolio of industrial properties that spans more than 145 million rentable square feet in 21 major U.S. logistics markets.While we believe that the sale of its medical office assets would aid the company in focusing exclusively on industrial asset category, the dilutive impact on earnings from such sale of assets would be impossible to avoid in the near term.Duke Realty currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Year to date, shares of the company have climbed 10.3%, outperforming 5.3% growth recorded by the industry.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the REIT space are Cedar Realty Trust (CDR  -  Free Report), DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report) and Extra Space Storage (EXR  -  Free Report).

408,EXR,"Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of the Courtyard by Marriott Charleston Summerville, S.C. The 96-room hotel, located in Nexton, has been acquired for $20.2 million, or around $210,000 per room.The company used cash from its recent share offering. Island Hospitality Management will manage the property. The construction of this hotel which opened in October 2014 has been made in adherence to strict building requirements. It is expected that the property will not require any additional capital for a minimum of four years.  In addition to the acquisition of the Courtyard Charleston Summerville, the company is under contract to acquire the adjacent, under-construction, 96-room Residence Inn by Marriott, upon opening in second-quarter 2018.The acquisitions seem a strategic fit for Chatham Lodging. This is because Nexton is an emerging mixed-use community near Charleston. It is anticipated to become a thriving place over the next decade with a projection of around 10,000 homes, eight million commercial square feet of area, and a medical campus.Moreover, a lot of encouraging development is taking place around Nexton. Volvo is constructing a factory nearby Nexton, while major companies like Daimler and Boeing have their facilities in the area as well as have made land acquisitions for further expansions.Per management, the two above-mentioned hotels are likely to experience solid top-line growth backed by corporate demand in future.In fact, with corporate investment and expansion moves, as well as relocation of reputed companies over the recent years, South Carolina has emerged as one of the fastest growing states in the nation. Specifically, the greater Charleston area enjoys presence of companies belonging to aerospace, automotive, bioscience, marine and distribution industries. Also, there is significant presence of technology companies. This makes the corporate demand not only high but also well diversified in this region.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has outperformed its industry in the past three months.

409,EXR,"Mack-Cali Realty Corp. (CLI  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of 57 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter tally of 56 cents.Total revenues of $160.0 million exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $153.9 million and came in 1.6% higher than the year-ago quarter.Results indicate rise in parking and other income in the quarter. However, decrease in base rents and revenues from real estate services were disappointing.Quarter in DetailDuring the third quarter, Mack-Cali executed 51 lease deals, spanning around 747,562 square feet, at the company’s consolidated in-service commercial portfolio. This comprised 20% for new leases, and 80% for lease renewals and other tenant-retention deals.As of Sep 30, 2017, Mack-Cali’s consolidated Core, Waterfront and Flex properties were 90.1% leased, up 20 basis points (bps) from the prior-quarter end.Further, rental rate roll up for the third-quarter transactions in the company’s Core, Waterfront and Flex properties was 0.1% on a cash basis and 14.7% on GAAP basis.Portfolio ActivityThrough the first nine months of 2017, Mack-Cali completed $472 million of sales. Further, the company expects to accomplish or sign contracts for another $432 million of sales, in order to be on track to complete its sales program by early 2018.LiquidityMack-Cali exited third-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $88.8 million, up from $31.6 million recorded at the end of the prior year.In addition, as of Sep 30, 2017, the company had a debt-to-undepreciated assets ratio of 46.2% compared with 47.5% as of Jun 30, 2017.GuidanceMack-Cali revised its guidance for full-year 2017.

410,EXR,"Outfront Media Inc. (OUT  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share of 56 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure, however, came in lower than the year-ago quarter tally of 60 cents.Results indicate higher local sales across billboard and transit, benefit from acquired digital billboards in Canada, as well as conversion of static billboards to digital.Revenues for the quarter came in at $392.4 million, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $391.1 million. Further, revenues rose 2.5% from the year-ago figure.OUTFRONT Media Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  OUTFRONT Media Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | OUTFRONT Media Inc. QuoteQuarter in DetailBillboard revenues of $272.4 million in the quarter indicated a marginal increase of 0.7% year over year. Results reflect acquired digital billboards in Canada, conversion of static billboards to digital and increased proceeds from condemnations. However, the positives were partly offset by a drop in average revenue per display (yield) mainly from a decline in U.S. national advertising revenues, the net impact of new and lost billboards in the period, as well as the effect of hurricanes in the Florida and Texas markets.Transit and other revenues of $120.0 million also increased 6.9% from the prior-year quarter. This was due to the net impact of won and lost franchises in the period, partly offset by a decline in the average revenue per display due to a reduction in revenues from the U.S. national advertisements.Operating expenses of $212.6 million flared up 5.5% year over year, mainly due to elevated transit franchise expenses from higher transit revenue and new transit contracts.Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization inched up 0.1% year over year to $120.8 million.Net cash flow resulting from operating activities for the nine-month period ending Sep 30, 2017, came in at $182.6 million, down from $200.7 million recorded in the comparable period last year. Results indicate lower net income, as adjusted for non-cash items, and higher cash-paid for direct lease acquisition costs. This was partly offset by improvement in the working capital.  As of Sep 30, 2017, Outfront Media’s liquidity position comprised cash of $42.0 million, as well as $428.3 million of availability under its $430.0 revolving credit facility, net of $1.7 million of issued letters of credit against the revolving credit facility.   Our TakeOutfront Media’s diversity, both geographical and industry wise, efforts to convert from traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays, and low cost of advertisement across the OOH platform bode well for growth. However, a challenging national advertising market remains a major concern, as well as intense competition and rise in interest rates add to its woes.Currently, Outfront Media carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).In addition, the stock has declined 3.3% year to date, underperforming the 5.2% gain of the industry it belongs to.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

Moreover, total revenues increased 5.2% year over year.Results reflect growth in occupancy and same-store net operating income (NOI) in the New York portfolio.Notably, in July, the company completed the spin-off of its Washington, DC segment. This included 37 office properties aggregating more than 11.1 million square feet, five multi-family properties with 3,133 units and five other assets totaling around 406,000 square feet of space.

In addition to this, the company recently announced the extension of one of the two $1.25-billion revolving credit facilities. The extended credit facility will improve its liquidity position.In a bid to improve its core business operations, Vornado has been aggressively disposing its non-strategic assets. In July, it completed the spin-off of its Washington, DC business. This made the company a New York-based office and retail REIT. The streamlining efforts are a strategic fit and will likely propel the company’s growth over the long term. However, the earnings dilutive impact cannot be bypassed in the near term.

412,EXR,"AvalonBay Communities, Inc.’s (AVB  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.19 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.26. However, total revenues of $550.5 million managed to exceed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $538.5 million.Results highlight modest growth in average rental rates. Economic occupancy managed to increase only slightly in the quarter.Nevertheless, the company’s core FFO per share recorded 5.8% growth from the year-ago figure of $2.07. This was driven by growth in net operating income (NOI) from existing, acquired and newly developed operating communities.Also, total revenues increased 6.6% year over year as revenues from development communities and stabilized operating communities recorded growth.AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AvalonBay Communities, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Quarter in Detail   For the reported quarter, average rental rates were up 2.0% year over year, with the highest growth in the Pacific North West portfolio (4.1%), followed by the South California (3.8%) and New England (2.3%) portfolios. Economic occupancy inched up 0.2% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues from established communities — those that stabilized operations as of Jan 1, 2016, are neither executing nor planning any significant redevelopment work and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year — improved 2.2% year over year, indicating increase in average rental rates.However, operating expenses for established communities flared up 2.4% on a year-over-year basis. Consequently, NOI from established communities rose 2.1% year over year to around $279.0 million.Notably, in the third quarter, the company acquired The Lodge Denver West, in Lakewood, CO, (252 apartment homes) for roughly $76.8 million. The acquisition marked the company's entry into the Denver metropolitan area.As of Sep 30, 2017, AvalonBay had 23 communities under construction (expected to contain 6,888 apartment homes in total), which are anticipated to be completed for an estimated total capital cost of $3.2 billion. This includes the company's share of communities being developed through joint ventures.Liquidity PositionAs of Sep 30, 2017, AvalonBay had $242.0 million outstanding under its $1.5-billion unsecured credit facility. The company had around $217.1 million in unrestricted cash and cash in escrow as of that date. In addition, the company’s annualized net debt-to-core EBITDA for third-quarter 2017 was 5.0 times.OutlookFor the fourth quarter, AvalonBay expects core FFO per share in the range of $2.21-$2.27.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $8.43.In ConclusionAvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of its solid portfolio of high-quality assets in premium locations. Furthermore, the company has a healthy balance sheet. Nevertheless, there is presence of elevated supply in a number of the company’s markets. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain modest in the upcoming period.

413,EXR,"Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, after the market closes.In the prior quarter, this San Mateo, CA-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) generated a positive surprise of 1.71% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results reflected solid growth in revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions — the average beat being 1.23%. This is depicted in the graph below:Essex Property Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Essex Property Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Essex Property Trust, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.For third-quarter 2017, the company estimates core FFO per share in the $2.88-$2.98 range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.97.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderEssex has a strong property base and a sturdy balance sheet. The company’s substantial exposure to the West Coast market, which is home to several innovation and technology companies, is likely to offer scope to boost its top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Improved economy and job market strengths are anticipated to act as a catalyst and drive demand for apartments in the company’s markets in the quarter.Notably, per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), the U.S. apartment market reported stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter. However, the levels of rent growth have moderated from the previous years. For new leases, effective rents moved up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6%, annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the country’s top 100 metros.However, although apartment deliveries have not yet reached peak levels due to delay in delivery, the supply remained elevated in the third quarter. This elevated supply is a concern because it curbs landlords’ ability to command more rent and results in lesser absorption.As such, in the to-be-reported quarter, occupancy is likely to remain nearly unchanged. Furthermore, escalating supply in certain submarkets is expected to result in aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power of landlords.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $342.1 million, marking an expected increase of 3.9% year over year.Moreover, in a week’s time, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the third quarter inched up 0.3% to $2.97, highlighting analysts’ bullish sentiments.Essex Property’s shares have rallied 12.9% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 5.1%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Essex Property will likely beat estimates this season.

414,EXR,"Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report) amended and restated $1.25-billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The move is encouraging down the line for the company’s operational efficiency as it enhances the financial flexibility of the Retail REIT.Specifically, the move helped in increasing the size of the facility to $1.25 billion from $1 billion. Also, the maturity date gets extended to Mar 23, 2022. Plus, the facility enjoys options for extension of maturity for two additional six-month periods.In addition, the interest rate on the borrowings would be at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points, conditioned upon the company’s credit ratings, compared with a rate of 92.5 basis points under its earlier facility. Moreover, there is an annual facility fee of 15 basis points, which is subject to the company’s credit ratings, applicable to the total $1.25-billion facility.Further, Regency enjoys a large pool of unencumbered assets and shares a good relationship with lenders. In fact, as of Dec 31, 2017, 85.7% of its wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered. With a high percentage of such assets, the company can enjoy accessibility to secured and unsecured debt markets and maintain availability on the line. The company’s debt maturity profile is well laddered with limited near-term maturities.However, the market is witnessing a shift in retail shopping from brick-and-mortar stores to internet sales. Particularly, the recent effort of online retailers to go deeper into the grocery business has emerged as a concern for this REIT that focuses on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers.This is because the shift in retail shopping to internet sales is adversely affecting the retail tenants’ sales, leading to retailers reconsidering their footprint and opting for store closures, thereby resulting in lesser demand for retail real estate space. Moreover, retailers unable to cope with competition are filing for bankruptcies. In fact, move outs, store closures and bankruptcies of retailers are likely to affect the company’s performance in the near term. Rate hike is another concern.Currently, Regency has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The stock has declined 18% compared with the industry’s descend of 13.6% over the past three months.Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the REIT industry are Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

415,EXR,"Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) is witnessing solid demand for its properties in the United Kingdom. Recently, the company announced that SearchFlow, a provider of conveyancing search services for the legal profession, has renewed its lease for another 10 years at Kings Hill, Kent.For SearchFlow, which is part of Daily Mail and General Trust plc and has been based at Kings Hill since 2007, the move is a strategic fit. The site offers easy accessibility to London. Moreover, with SearchFlow focusing on growing its customer service operations for widening customer base, the site supports the company’s expansion plan.  Notably, Kings Hill is being developed by Liberty Property Trust’s subsidiary, Liberty Property Trust UK Ltd. Specifically, this U.K. subsidiary and Kent County Council created a collaborative public/private sector partnership for the development of Kings Hill as a mixed-use community. It includes commercial, residential, educational, retail, community, sports and leisure uses across 800 acres of landscaped low density parkland.Notably, mixed-use developments too have gained much popularity in recent years. Such developments narrow the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses and other amenities and destinations. Hence, such developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area — a trend that drove development in several other cities in the United States as well as in the United Kingdom.Kings Hill too is expected to benefit from its mixed-use focus. Its tenant roster is well-diversified with tenants belonging to sectors like financial services, oil, food, automotive and telecommunications. Notably, last year, the property’s developer Liberty Property Trust was able to sign property deals on more than 100,000 square feet of office space.Going forward, Liberty Property Trust is likely to benefit from its top-quality office and industrial properties, covering 100 million square feet of space and comprising 554 properties in the markets with strong demographic and economic fundamentals. Its tenants include several major companies, promising steady rental revenues.Liberty Property Trust has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

416,EXR,"Shares of data center REIT Digital Realty Trust (DLR  -  Free Report) have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past month. The stock has gained 2% against the industry’s slip of 0.4%. The stock has still room for growth.  With projected growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data plus an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data-center REITs are experiencing a market boom. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in the top-tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, the said markets continue to randomly absorb new constructions at a faster pace. This, along with improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to drive demand for data centers. Amid these, accretive acquisitions and development efforts are expected to boost top-line growth for Digital Realty.In September 2017, Digital Realty announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros in an all-stock deal for an enterprise value of about $7.8 billion. This move enhanced Digital Realty’s portfolio in the top U.S. data center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley. It helped Digital Realty upgrade hyper-scale product offering and grow its blue-chip customer base.The company had bought Telx in October 2015 and a portfolio of eight high-quality, carrier-neutral data centers in Europe (Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London) from Equinix in July 2016. Such buyouts offered a leading colocation and interconnection platform, a superior connectivity infrastructure and better growth scope at attractive locations. The company is also focused on expanding its footprint in Europe and Australia.Further, the company aims at maintaining an investment grade balance sheet and is committed to a conservative capital structure. It enjoys ample, growing liquidity with diversified sources of capital and has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule with no material maturities until 2020.Additionally, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Digital Realty remains committed to disbursing the same. The company’s dividend has witnessed a hike at 12% compound annual growth rate since 2005. Furthermore, much to the shareholders’ delight on Mar 1, 2018, it announced an 8.6% dividend increase. The company has annually raised dividend since its initial public offering and the recent March 2018 hike marked the 13th consecutive year of increase.However, Digital Realty faces stiff competition in its industry. In fact, the company contends with several data center developers, owners and operators, many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets at locations same as Digital Realty. Also, there are multiple local developers in the United States and several regional operators across Europe, Asia and Australia.Given the solid growth potential of the data center real estate market, competition is expected to intensify in the upcoming period from existing as well as new players. Amid all this, an aggressive pricing pressure is anticipated in the data center market.Moreover, Digital Realty’s earnings have a notable exposure to foreign currency translation. Also, the company has substantial debt burden. Further, the rate hike adds to its woes.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share remaining unchanged at $6.54 over the past month.  Digital Realty has a Zacks Rank #3(Hold).Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same industry are Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

The figure also came in 8.7% higher than $1.03 recorded in the prior-year quarter. Results reflect growth in property-rental revenues and improvement in same-store NOI. Higher occupancy and rental rates supported growth.Quarterly revenues of $281.8 million climbed 8% year over year.

Further, revenues of $1.11 billion for full-year 2017 came ahead of the prior-year quarter figure of $991.9 million.Behind the HeadlinesSame-store revenues were up 4.9% year over year to $210.8 million during the fourth quarter, while same-store NOI climbed 5.7% to $154.9 million. The increase in same-store revenues was driven by higher rental rates for both new and existing customers as well as gains in occupancy. Same-store occupancy was 91.9% as of Dec 31, 2017, up 40 basis points from 91.5% as of Dec 31, 2016.For 2017, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Sacramento were the major markets which recorded revenue growth above the company's portfolio average. However, markets which performed below the company's portfolio average included Boston, Dallas, Denver and Houston.Portfolio ActivityExtra Space Storage acquired 24 operating stores, eight stores at the completion of construction and it also purchased their joint-venture partners' interest in six stores for a total investment of around $500.5 million.

In addition, the company had $349.4 million available for issuance under the ATM program as of Dec 31, 2017.OutlookExtra Space Storage provided its outlook for 2018. The company anticipates FFO as adjusted per share in the band of $4.55-$4.65. The company projects same-store property revenue growth of 3.25-4.25% and same-store property NOI growth of around 3-4.5% for the year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

418,EXR,"Rayonier Inc. (RYN  -  Free Report), a timberland real estate investment trust (REIT), is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, after market close. The company’s pro forma net income per share and revenues for the quarter are expected to decline year over year.Rayonier’s second-quarter 2017 pro forma net income per share came in at 20 cents, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents. Results highlighted encouraging performance in the New Zealand Timber, real estate and trading segment, primarily due to rise in sawtimber price, strong demand from China and favorable foreign exchange movements.Over the trailing four quarters, Rayonier beat estimates in three occasions and missed in the other, recording an average beat of 59.9%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Rayonier Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Rayonier Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Rayonier Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderRayonier’s portfolio of timberlands enjoys geographical diversity and is located in the productive timber-producing regions of the United States. Recent developments in the field of biogenetics and cloning have significantly benefited this timberland REIT’s business.The company is aimed at consistently monetizing higher and better uses (HBU) properties through rural land sales for enhancing its portfolio value. Additionally, the favorable demand-supply dynamics have reinforced the company’s pricing power.However, Rayonier faces cut-throat competition in the market from national and local players. Increasing rivalry from a variety of substitute products, like non-wood and engineered wood products, is expected to thwart its operating performance in the timber segment too. This might dent the company’s operating results from the timber segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.90 million for operating income from the overall timber segment reflects a steep decline from the prior-quarter figure of $35 million.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from the real estate segment is currently pegged at $4.4 million. This compares unfavorably with the year-ago quarter figure of $43.10 million.     In addition, Rayonier’s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter net income per share remained unchanged at 5 cents over the past month.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Rayonier will likely beat earnings estimates this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Rayonier is -20%.Zacks Rank: Rayonier’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.The stock has gained 10.5% year to date, underperforming 21.2% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report),slated to release third-quarter earnings on Nov 1, has an Earnings ESP of +1.31% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

419,EXR,"Dependence of REITs on debt for their business makes investors wary of their performance in a rising rate environment. Also, the investment world's treating them as bond substitutes for their high and consistent dividend-paying nature makes them susceptible to rising rates. This is why their price performance tends to fluctuate when the Federal Reserve is optimistic about rate hikes.Chairman Jerome Powell opened his innings with a 0.25% interest rate hike yesterday but this time we should perhaps think twice before looking at the REIT space with a sceptic’s eye. Over the years, REITs have managed their balance sheets efficiently and are now well prepared for a rising rate environment. In fact, instead of looking for debt to finance their portfolio, these have strategically resorted to equity capital in recent years.This helped the balance sheets of the overall REIT industry to become less leveraged in decades. Per the Nareit T-Tracker, the ratio of debt-to-book assets came at 47.6% in fourth-quarter 2017, denoting a 95 basis-point decline over the past year while market leverage ratio is hovering around its record low achieved in 2016. Moreover, interest expense as a share of Net Operating Income (NOI) of 22.3% in the fourth quarter came close to its record low of 21.7% and well below 38% before the financial crisis.Not only have the REITs reduced their exposure to interest rate hikes, they have opportunistically used the low-rate environment to make their financials more flexible, which is encouraging down the line for their operational efficiencies. REITs have made borrowings at a fixed rate and extended the average maturity of their debt outstanding to more than six years, thereby locking the low rates for an elongated period.And finally, along with the much anticipated quarter-point rate hike this time, the GDP forecast for 2018 was raised to 2.7% from 2.5% in December while the same for 2019 has been revised north to 2.4% from 2.1%. Moreover, in a post-meeting statement, the committee said that the ""economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.""This in turn drives the prospects of the real estate sector because growth in the economy translates into greater demand for real estate, higher occupancy levels and landlord’s greater power to ask for higher rents. Because one will eventually need “real space” for economic activities and therefore, a REIT’s earnings, cash flow and dividend get a boost as rate increases amid economic growth.Now, if the rise in construction activity and the lengthy current real estate cycle point at a late stage of the cycle, then one needs to consider the vacancy rates. This is because, vacancy rates are either stable or hovering near lows for majority of the asset categories, suggesting that the industry is not overbuilt yet and that rather supply is in sync with demand.4 Stocks to Scoop Up Big GainsHere we handpicked four REIT stocks that sport a favorable Zacks Rank. These stocks have been witnessing positive estimate revisions. Also, their underlying asset categories display strength with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery.

421,EXR,"The stock market’s strong run over the past few years brought attention to high-flying growth stocks, usually from the technology sector, that were consistently outpacing the market. However, fresh volatility within the last few months has shifted the focus back towards other investment strategies, and now it might be time for investors to check out things like real estate investment trusts, or REITs.REITs are companies that own, operate, or finance real estate properties that produce income, such as apartment complexes or retail locations. These companies are heavily regulated and must meet a number of qualifications to be classified as a REIT, but they do offer investors a few distinct advantages.First of all, real estate can be a very profitable investment sector when certain economic conditions are present. What’s more, REITs must pay at least 90% of their taxable income in dividends to shareholders, so they are a great option for income investors looking for steady payouts.Luckily for Zacks readers, the proven Zacks Rank—which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions—works with REITs just as it would with any other company.

422,EXR,"Boston Properties, Inc. (BXP  -  Free Report) is likely to beat expectations in the third quarter. The company is scheduled to release its quarterly numbers on Nov 1, after the market closes.Last quarter, this REIT, which mainly owns and develops Class A office real estates in the United States, delivered better-than-expected performance in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share, witnessing a positive surprise of 3.09%. Results indicated an improvement in portfolio revenues, as well as development and management services revenues. However, Boston Properties has a mixed surprise history. In fact, the company exceeded estimates in two occasions for as many misses, over the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 0.93%. This is depicted in the graph below:Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Properties, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Boston Properties is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) to beat estimates, and Boston Properties has the right mix.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.50%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise.Zacks Rank: Boston Properties’ Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season.What's Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Boston Properties, based out of Massachusetts, concentrates on a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets. The company’s solid tenant and industry base, including several bellwethers, ensure steady rental revenue growth. Over the past five years, it recorded annual revenue growth rate of 8.17%. This trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter as well.Notably, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm, CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate declined to 12.9% in the third quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.In fact, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, healthy growth in demand for office spaces is likely to have continued in the company’s markets in the quarter under review. Particularly, growth in demand for office space is anticipated to have been fueled by technology and life sciences businesses in the to-be-reported quarter.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $631.5 million, indicating estimated growth of 1% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for base rent is $512 million.The company projects third-quarter FFO per share in the range of $1.52-$1.54. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at the high end of this range at $1.54.Shares of Boston Properties have inched up 0.2% in the past three months, outperforming the 1.4% loss incurred by its industry.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Nov 1, has an Earnings ESP of +2.96% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

424,EXR,"Public Storage’s (PSA  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.61 marked a 3.2% growth from the prior year quarter figure of $2.53. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $2.60.Results mirror an improvement in net operating income (NOI) from both same-store and non-same store facilities. Higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot supported the company’s same-store performance. Also, Public Storage benefited from its expansion efforts.Quarterly revenues of $686.4 million also climbed 3.5% from the prior year quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same was $685 million.Public Storage Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Public Storage Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Public Storage QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Moreover, the company recorded a total $7.8 million casualty loss because of damaged buildings and equipment, together with expenses for repairs, cleanup, and disposal. Further, it anticipates incurring around $10.0 million of capital expenditures for completion of the hurricane-damage repair. The loss projections are below its insurance deductibles.Behind the HeadlinesSame-store revenues advanced 2.4% year over year to $564.4 million during the third quarter, while the company’s NOI climbed 2.6% to $416.9 million. The increase in same-store revenues was primarily driven by a 3.4% rise in realized annual rental income per occupied square feet to $17.52. However, the weighted-average square foot occupancy of 94.5% contracted 80 basis points year over year.In addition, the company’s NOI from non-same store facilities grew on the back of the 321 self-storage facilities acquired, developed or expanded since January 2015.Portfolio ActivityIn the reported quarter, Public Storage bought seven self-storage facilities, comprising 0.4 million net rentable square feet, for $47.3 million. Following the quarter end, the company acquired or was under contract to acquire eight self-storage facilities, spanning 0.5 million net rentable square feet of space, for $67.8 million.Finally, as of Sep 30, 2017, the company had several facilities in development (2.8 million net rentable square feet), with an estimated cost of $365 million, as well as expansion projects (1.9 million net rentable square feet) worth roughly $235 million. Public Storage estimates to incur the remaining $378 million of development costs related to these projects mainly over the next 18 months.LiquidityPublic Storage exited third-quarter 2017 with around $694.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, up from $183.7 million recorded at the end of the prior year.DividendOn Oct 25, Public Storage’s board of trustees announced a regular quarterly dividend of $2.00 per share. The amount will be paid on Dec 28 to shareholders of record as of Dec 13, 2017.In ConclusionPublic Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. The company’s acquisition and expansion efforts look promising. Nevertheless, rising supply in a number of its markets is a headwind. Rate hike also remains a concern for the company.Public Storage currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

425,EXR,"Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. The ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry, with a presence in all major metropolitan markets of the United States. Further, it has managed to create a significant presence in the European markets as well, through the acquisition of Shurgard Storage Centers in 2006.Additionally, the company has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. In fact, since January 2015, 345 self-storage facilities have been acquired, developed or expanded by the company. Particularly, during 2017, it acquired 22 self-storage facilities, comprising 1.4 million net rentable square feet, for $149.8 million. Following the quarter end, the company acquired or was under contract to acquire two self-storage facilities, spanning 0.2 million net rentable square feet of space, for $18 million. Such acquisitions and expansions bode well for long-term growth.In fact, Public Storage has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, with adequate liquidity to actively pursue acquisitions and developments. Moreover, a solid balance sheet has enabled it to pay sustainable dividends.Also, shares of Public Storage have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past month. Its shares have lost 1.8% against the decline of 5.3% incurred by the industry. In addition, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share being revised 0.2% upward in a weeks’ time.However, supply has been high in a number of markets and this adversely affects the company’s pricing power. In fact, Public Storage operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. This limits its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.Moreover, the company has a significant development and refurbishment pipeline. In fact, as of Dec 31, 2017, Public Storage had several facilities under development (2.7 million net rentable square feet) with an estimated cost of $367 million as well as expansion projects (1.9 million net rentable square feet) worth roughly $247 million. The company estimates to incur the remaining $350 million of development costs related to these projects, mainly over the next 18 months. Though this is encouraging, the substantial pipeline increases the operational risks and exposes the company to rising construction costs, entitlement delays and failure to fulfill government requirements. Further, self-storage spaces are not usually pre-leased and new assets generally take time to generate yields.Public Storage currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the same space include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Investor Real Estate Trust (IRET  -  Free Report) and Extra Space Storage Inc.

428,EXR,"Washington Real Estate Investment Trust, also known as Washington REIT, (WRE  -  Free Report), announced an amended credit agreement that expands and extends the company’s existing $600-million unsecured revolving credit facility to $700 million. Further, the company replaced an existing $150-million unsecured term loan with a $250-million unsecured term loan. The move enhances Washington REIT’s balance sheet and will support its growth plans.Importantly, the previous credit facility, which was set to expire on Jun 22, 2019, is now slated to mature in four years on Mar 29, 2022, unless one of the two six-month extension options is exercised to further extend the loan. Moreover, the newly refinanced loan will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin that will be determined by the company’s then unsecured debt rating.       In addition, the company has refinanced a seven-year $150-million loan due on Jul 21, 2023, with a $250-million loan with a term of five years. In fact, the company has entered into an interest rate swap arrangement that has reduced the interest spread by 55 basis points (bps).Specifically, Washington REIT will pay a fixed rate of 2.31% per annum on the $150-million part of the term loan and 3.71% per annum on the remaining $100 million. While swap relating to the $150-million portion is currently in effect, the 3.71% swap will be effective from Jun 29, 2018.  Moreover, Washington REIT can exercise an accordion feature, conditioned on lender approval that can increase its aggregate credit facility top $1.5 billion.  The company plans to use $100 million from the expanded term loan to pay down a portion of the revolving credit facility.Per management, this refinancing activity provides it with an appealing source of capital and boosts flexibility. It has enabled the company to use available capital optimally and will likely benefit shareholders.     The refinancing is a strategic fit for this company as it has reduced interest expenses and extended maturities of loans. Furthermore, the well-favored financial covenants available to the company reflect its improved access to the debt markets and helps meet the firm’s financial obligations in an efficient way.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

429,EXR,"Mack-Cali Realty Corporation’s (CLI  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Roseland Residential Trust, has initiated the leasing for its new luxury rental community, Signature Place. It boasts 197 newly-constructed apartments and is situated in Morris Plains, NJ. Earlier, Signature Place was an unoccupied office asset, owned by Mark-Cali.Andrew Marshall, president and executive vice president of development at Roseland Residential Trust stated that ""What was formerly an underperforming office asset has become the newest apartment community in an incredibly attractive market for high-end residential development and its success will serve as a model for future property conversions.""  The community is very conveniently located at 250 Johnson Road with easy access to recreational, dining and shopping centers. It has a stylish club room with multiple facilities like billiards, conference rooms, swimming pool and a movie theater to name a few.The plush homes are also done up using the best quality products, well-furnished with all the modern amenities. A few apartments are also built with personal balconies and terraces.Mack-Cali has made concerted efforts in recent years to transform from a sub-urban office REIT to a residential and geographically-focused office REIT. The company announced a three-year strategic initiative in September 2015, aimed at transforming itself into a more concentrated owner of New Jersey Hudson River waterfront and transit-oriented office properties as well as a regional owner of luxury multi-family residential properties. The company’s portfolio-repositioning strategy is focused on capturing the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area — a trend that drove development in several other cities in the United States. This group also gives much importance to transit options, and hence focusing on such areas remains a strategic choice for the company. Moreover, Several Fortune 500 companies have their headquarters in New Jersey, while others have a significant presence in the region. Armed with a skilled workforce and a well-established transit network, the region remains a top choice for the company to expand its business.However, as part of portfolio-streamlining efforts, Mack-Cali has been aggressively disposing its assets. In fact, it completed $56 million of property sales in fourth-quarter 2017, bringing the tally for full-year 2017 property sales to $528 million. Further, the company has additional dispositions of around $400 million planned for 2018 and expects those to be completed by the end of the second quarter. This will mark completion of its major disposition program. While the measures are a strategic fit for the long run, the dilutive impact on earnings from such huge asset sales cannot be bypassed in the near term.Shares of Mark-Cali have underperformed its industry in the past 12 months.

430,EXR,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) announced that it sold a mezzanine loan that was secured by interests in its skilled nursing and long-term healthcare portfolio, Tandem, to Fundamental Advisors LP, for $112 million.Fundamental Advisors is an alternative asset manager focused on public purpose assets. The company targets investments that can be controlled and are stressed. It also focuses on buying securities from the secondary market that are undervalued.Recently, HCP also resorted to shift in the management on its 24 senior-living communities from Brookdale Senior Living to Atria Senior Living. The transition, which still awaits a few regulatory approvals, is scheduled to start from this month and is likely to be accomplished by September 2018.HCP has been continually trying to reduce its exposure to Brookdale. This is because, Brookdale, which is one of the largest senior living providers in the nation, has been facing operational and financial challenges for past few years.This was the last mezzanine loan investment of the company and Scott Brinker, Chief Investment Officer of HCP, feels that the recent announcements are in sync with their 2018 objectives.Once the transition of management from Brookdale to Atria is completed, the dealings will benefit the company in a number of ways. It will considerably decrease Brookdale’s concentration, increase lease coverage of their remaining triple-net assets leased to Brookdale, improve the diversification of tenants in the portfolio and enhance the credit profile and the balance sheet.Nevertheless, shares of HCP have underperformed its industry in the past three months. During this time, the stock declined 14.9% compared with industry’s decline of 9.2%.HCP currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same industry include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

431,EXR,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) is likely to gain from its solid portfolio of upscale hotels across potential markets. Furthermore, the company is anticipated to improve the revenue per available room (RevPAR) backed by its value enhancement initiatives. Moreover, demand is likely to benefit amid improving corporate profits, business investment, consumer sentiment and low unemployment level.Last month, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of 42 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. Results reflect margin improvement through better productivity.Importantly, Host Hotels undertakes a strategic capital-recycling program to enhance its portfolio quality and strengthen its position over global vibrant markets. Furthermore, the company has been monetizing a considerable part of real estate in Washington D.C. and lowering its exposure in New York.In fact, following the end of the prior year, the company has completed the sale of the Key Bridge Marriott for $190 million. Further, it is under contract to sell the W New York for $190 million. This sale is likely to close in second-quarter 2018.On the other hand, three Hyatt assets are placed under contract for acquisition. These include the 301-room Andaz Maui, 668-room Grand Hyatt San Francisco, and 454-room Hyatt Regency Coconut Point. The assets, positioned in markets with solid RevPAR growth, have gone through substantial renovations.Additionally, during 2017, the company expended around $277 million on capital expenditures — $72 million was return on investment (ROI) capital projects, and $205 million for renewal and replacement projects. Also, the company projects capital expenditures of $475-$550 million for 2018. This comprises $185-$220 million in ROI projects, and $290-$330 million in renewal and replacement projects. Such investments are anticipated to help the company improve its portfolio quality and bolster revenues as well.In addition, Host Hotels has a decent balance sheet and ample liquidity. The company exited 2017 with around $913 million of unrestricted cash and $822 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver part of its credit facility. This provides the company ample scope for deploying capital for long-term growth opportunities and at the same time, carrying out redevelopment initiatives.Though supply growth has been lackluster in the past, it has gathered momentum in recent times. In fact, this growth is expected to remain elevated in 2018, particularly in markets where the company has exposure. Furthermore, the company’s performance might be weak in first-quarter 2018 due to tough comparisons resulting from inauguration and Women's March in D.C. last year, as well as Easter weekend beginning on Mar 30 this year.In addition to this, the dilutive impact of asset sales cannot be bypassed. Also, rate hike remains another concern.Shares of Host Hotels have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past six months. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have ascended 4.1%, while the industry incurred a loss of 8.5% during this time frame. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Additionally, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share being revised 1.2% upward in a month’s time. Given the progress on fundamentals, the stock is likely to perform well in the upcoming period.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the real estate space include Arbor Realty Trust, Inc. (ABR  -  Free Report), Sotherly Hotels Inc. (SOHO  -  Free Report) and Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report).

432,EXR,"Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after the market closes.Last quarter, this San Francisco, CA-based date center real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 3.36%. Results were supported by growth in revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions, met estimates in the other, and missed in another, with an average beat of around 1.18%. This is depicted in the graph below: Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Digital Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for Digital Realty prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderData center REITs are experiencing a boom market amid growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure. This has been driving demand which is outpacing supply in top-tier data center markets. Therefore, despite enjoying high occupancy, the top-tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.Additionally, improved outlook for economic growth is anticipated to fuel demand for data centers. Amid these, Digital Realty’s focus on offering upgraded technology to entice clients is likely to bolster its revenue stream in the to-be-reported quarter.  In addition to this, the company is expected to ride on its growth curve backed by strategic acquisitions. In fact, it acquired Telx in October 2015 and a portfolio of eight high-quality, carrier-neutral data centers in Europe (Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London) in July 2016. We expect such diligent efforts to drive the company’s top line in the quarter to be reported.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $593.2 million, indicating projected growth of around 8.6% year over year.Also, in September, the company announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros. This buyout helped the company reinforce its hyper-scale product offering and widen its blue-chip customer base.Nevertheless, Digital Realty faces stiff competition in the industry. In fact, the company competes with several data-center developers, owners and operators, many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets in regions same as Digital Realty. Amid this, aggressive pricing pressure is likely to sustain in the data-center market, while robust growth in occupancy is anticipated to remain elusive.Hence, prior to the third-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations (FFO) per share for the third quarter remained unchanged at $1.49 over the past week.However, Digital Realty’s shares have rallied 25.6% year to date, outperforming 3.4% growth recorded by the industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Digital Realty will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is -0.26%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Digital Realty’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 26, has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report), scheduled to release earnings on Nov 1, has an Earnings ESP of +2.23% and a Zacks Rank of 2.Cousins Properties Inc. (CUZ  -  Free Report), slated to release quarterly numbers on Oct 25, has an Earnings ESP of +1.13% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Note: All EPS numbers presented in this write up represent funds from operations (FFO) per share. FFO, a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses to net income.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

433,EXR,"Digital Realty Trust, Inc.’s (DLR  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (“FFO”) per share of $1.54 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49. The core FFO per share also came higher than the year-ago quarter tally of $1.42. Results were supported by growth in revenues.The company reported revenues of $566.0 million for the second quarter, which also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $556.8 million. The revenue figure also marked 9.9% growth year over year. Further, the company reiterated its 2017 core FFO per share outlook.Signed total bookings during the reported quarter are estimated to generate $34 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue. This would include an $8 million contribution from interconnection. Notably, the weighted-average lag between leases signed during second-quarter 2017 and the contractual commencement date was six months. Per the company, this was in line with the long-term historical average.Moreover, the company signed renewal leases, marking $65 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue. Rental rates on renewal leases signed during the reported quarter rolled up 6.5% on a cash basis and expanded 9.3% on a GAAP basis.Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Digital Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Portfolio ActivityNotably, in Jun 2017, Digital Realty announced that it is set to acquire DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc. (DFT), in an all-stock transaction for an enterprise value of about $7.6 billion. The transaction, which is expected to close in the second half of 2017, is conditioned upon the approval of shareholders of both DuPont Fabros and Digital Realty, as well as other customary closing norms.The move would enhance Digital Realty’s portfolio in top U.S. data center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley. In addition, the transaction is anticipated to be immediately accretive to financial metrics. (Read more: Digital Realty to Acquire DuPont Fabros in $7.6 Billion Deal)Apart from this, in May 2017, the company acquired a 264,000 square foot industrial building on a 13-acre site neighboring the company's present campus in Franklin Park, IL, for $14 million. Also, in June 2017, the company acquired a five-acre land parcel next to its current development project in Amsterdam, the Netherlands for $6 million. In the same month, Digital Realty invested $8 million for acquisition of a 4.9% stake in Megaport, which is a leading provider of software-defined networking interconnection solutions.Balance SheetDigital Realty exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of around $22.4 million, up from $15.0 million at the prior-quarter end.Additionally, as of Jun 30, 2017, the company had around $6.4 billion of total debt outstanding, substantially all of which was unsecured. Also, as of the same date, the company’s net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 5.1x, while fixed charge coverage was 4.3x.OutlookDigital Realty reaffirmed its 2017 core FFO per share outlook at $5.95–$6.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $6.03.The full-year outlook provided by the company is backed by revenue expectations of $2.2–$2.3 billion, year-end portfolio occupancy growth of +/- 50 bps and ""same-capital"" cash NOI growth of 2.0–3.0%.Our TakeWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance of Digital Realty in the second quarter. The company is poised to ride on the growth curve backed by robust fundamentals of the data center market. The company’s business has significantly grown since its launch. Further, its accretive acquisitions and development efforts augur well for long-term growth. However, exposure of earnings to foreign currency translation, cut-throat competition in the industry and a substantial debt burden remain concerns.Digital Realty currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

434,EXR,"Public Storage’s (PSA  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 funds from operations (“FFO”) per share of $2.31 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.56. The figure was also down 1.3% from the year-ago tally of $2.34.Quarterly revenues of $664.3 million also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $674.2 million. Nevertheless, revenues managed to grow 4.8% from the year-ago period.Results reflect a fall in weighted-average square foot occupancy in the same-store portfolio for the reported quarter. However, higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot supported its results. Also, the company benefited from its expansion efforts.Public Storage Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Public Storage Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Public Storage QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Behind the HeadlinesSame-store revenues advanced 3.3% year over year to $550.0 million during the second quarter, while net operating income (“NOI”) climbed 2.6% to $402.7 million. The increase in same-store revenues was primarily driven by a 4.4% rise in realized annual rental income per occupied square feet to $16.97. However, the weighted-average square foot occupancy of 94.5% contracted 90 basis points year over year.In addition, the company’s NOI from non-same store facilities enhanced on the back of 292 self-storage facilities acquired, developed or expanded since Jan 2015.Portfolio ActivityIn the reported quarter, Public Storage bought three self-storage facilities, comprising 0.2 million net rentable square feet, for $11.6 million. Following the quarter end, the company acquired or was under contract to acquire seven self-storage facilities, spanning 0.4 million net rentable square feet, for $47.1 million.Finally, as of Jun 30, 2017, the company had several facilities in development (3.9 million net rentable square feet), with an estimated cost of $468 million, as well as expansion projects (1.7 million net rentable square feet) worth roughly $191 million. Public Storage projects to incur the remaining $376 million of development costs related to these projects mainly over the next 18 months.LiquidityPublic Storage exited second-quarter 2017 with around $358.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, up from $183.7 million at the end of the prior year.DividendOn Jul 26, Public Storage’s Board of Trustees declared a quarterly dividend of $2.00 per share. The amount will be paid on Sep 28 to shareholders of record as of Sep 13, 2017.In ConclusionWe are discouraged with the lower-than-expected performance of Public Storage in the second quarter. However, higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot is a positive. Notably, the company is a recognized and established name in the self-storage industry in the U.S., and its acquisition and expansion efforts look encouraging. However, rising supply in a number of its markets is a headwind. Rate hike also remains a concern for the company.Public Storage currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

435,EXR,"AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, after the market closes.Last quarter, this residential REIT delivered a negative surprise of 2.34% in terms of funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.In the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates on one occasion and missed in the other three. This resulted in an average negative surprise of 0.7%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AvalonBay Communities, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAvalonBay is well-poised to grow on the back of a rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. Also, increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth, rising wages and a healthier balance sheet, promise strong prospects for this Arlington, VA-based REIT.Notably, per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), the U.S. apartment market reported stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter. However, the levels of rent growth have moderated from the previous years. For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6%, annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the country’s top 100 metros.AvalonBay is also likely to continue experiencing high occupancy. Although the pace of rental growth has slowed down from the bygone years, it is now likely to achieve stability.However, there is presence of elevated supply in quite a few of the company’s markets. Hence, any robust growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain restricted in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Further, delay in construction activities in the development portfolio is anticipated to affect the company’s lease-up net operating income in the near term.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $538.5 million, denoting an expected increase of 4.3% year over year.Additionally, prior to third-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising overt optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at $2.26, over the past month.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AvalonBay is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

436,EXR,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 27, before the market opens.In the last reported quarter, this Indianapolis, IN-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) witnessed a positive surprise of 0.82% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share.However, over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and missed in the other, the average beat being 4.20%. This is depicted in the graph below:Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Simon Property Group, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderSimon Property enjoys a wide exposure to retail assets across the United States. Moreover, the company’s international presence fosters sustainable long-term growth as compared with its domestically-focused peers. This diversification, with respect to both product and geography, largely insulates Simon Property from market volatility and helps it stay ahead of its peers by delivering a decent performance.Further, Simon Property has been undertaking various initiatives, of late, to strengthen its relationship with customers. In addition, with the omni-channel strategy gaining popularity among retailers, the company is initiating programs and events, as well as entering into several partnerships for upgrading services and amenities offered to its customers. This retail REIT has invested more than $5 billion in development projects in five years’ time and intends to spend around $1 billion each in 2017 and 2018. These initiatives are anticipated to draw more traffic at the company’s properties.Nevertheless, with more and more consumers opting for online purchases, mall traffic continues to remain depressed considerably. This, again, has resulted in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. These latest developments have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent times.Further, retailers unable to keep up with the intense competition in the industry are filing bankruptcies. This is a pressing concern for retail REITs, as the trend has been significantly dragging down demand for the retail real estate space. This choppy retail real estate market situation is also said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, though the mall landlords find it unjustified.While Simon Property is grappling to battle this pressure through various initiatives, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. Consequently, this would limit any robust growth in the company’s profit margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $1.4 billion, indicating projected growth of around 3.1% year over year.Moreover, prior to the third-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter remained unchanged at $2.87 over the past month.Shares of Simon Property have climbed 2.4%, versus the 1.1% loss incurred by the industry, in three months’ time.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Simon Property will likely beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

437,EXR,"Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report) is consistently making efforts to expand its business around large population centers and attain geographical diversity. However, stiff competition from new supply in various markets may limit its profitability.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has underperformed its industry year to date.  Shares of the company have gained 0.3%, as compared with 7.4% growth recorded by the industry. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operation (FFO) per share estimates for third-quarter 2017 edged down a cent to $1.09 in a week’s time.Nonetheless, Extra Space Storage has been increasing its scale of operations in several core markets through accretive acquisitions, mutually beneficial joint-venture partnerships and third-party management services. In fact, over the past five years, Extra Space Storage acquired $4.8 billion in properties. Amid sound demand conditions in the industry, such efforts are anticipated to stoke solid growth for the company.These efforts enabled the company to enhance its brand value and become the second largest self-storage operator in the United States. Extra Space Storage increased its branded store count from 694 in 2008 to 1,470 in second-quarter 2017.Additionally, with majority of its stores gathered around large population centers, the company enjoys above-average income demographics from these markets.Further, the industry is characterized by fragmented ownership and only around 20% of the total self-storage square footage is under this REIT’s ownership. Under such circumstances, Extra Space Storage remains well poised to pursue its acquisition plans.However, stiff competition from new supply in certain metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) will keep dampening the company’s rent growth and pricing ability.In addition, the month-to-month lease basis prevalent in the industry may adversely affect the company’s operating performance during times of distress — when tenant turnover is typically high.Key PicksBetter-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Getty Realty Corporation (GTY  -  Free Report), Seritage Growth Properties  and Communications Sales & Leasing, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.19.Furthermore, the company has increased total SSNOI guidance to 2.25–3% from the prior outlook of 2–3%, mainly due to better-than-expected seniors housing operating performance in the first half of 2017.Additionally, in sync with its strategic repositioning of its premier health care portfolio, the company continues to anticipate 2017 disposition proceeds to be around $2 billion.Our TakeWelltower’s diversified portfolio and strategic investments have the capability to serve as growth drivers in the long run. Also, a rise in senior citizen spending for healthcare reasons promises scope for growth. However, any rate hike remains a concern for the company due to its high exposure to long-term leased assets.

This included $53 million of acquisitions with existing partners in its seniors housing portfolio, as well as $57 million of funding for its share of development, and redevelopment projects for projects presently in progress.For financing its investments, the company issued and sold 1.1 million shares of common stock, reaping net proceeds of $74 million under the “at the market” equity offering program.

We believe the company’s adequate size and scale would help it capitalize on opportunities such as increasing healthcare spending and aging population. Furthermore, the sale of the SNF would lower the company’s exposure to this particular healthcare real estate category which is becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the change in medical billing procedure.Also, university-based life science real estate is a new zone of investment which has grabbed attention and Ventas has already committed substantial amount to this segment. Such investments offer scope to capitalize on growing health-care-driven research and development, supported by top-tier research universities.

441,EXR,"Asset manager, Brookfield Property Partners made a revised acquisition offer to GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), according to a report by Reuters. Per people familiar with the matter, the revised offer boasts of an elevated cash component.In November 2017, Brookfield offered $14.8 billion or $23 per share in a cash-and-stock offer to acquire the remaining 66% stake in GGP. However, GGP’s special board committee rejected the offer.The negotiations between the companies are ongoing and the exact value of the new offer is not known. The special board committee has yet to accept the offer.Brookfield wants to buy the remaining stake in GGP, one of the largest owners of shopping centers in the United States, to take the company private.This move of acquiring GGP by Brookfield comes as a surprise as the U.S. retail real estate market has been plagued with issues like downsizing and bankruptcies of retailers. This is because mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences and patterns with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds.This has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs like GGP, as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably and curbing the landlord’s pricing power and occupancy level of properties. Moreover, such a choppy environment has led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions but mall landlords are finding these unjustified.However, the combination of GGP and Brookfield will make the combined company one of the largest companies in the world and, in turn, help them in negotiating better with the tenants.Shares of GGP outperformed its industry in the past six months.

443,EXR,"Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. (HPP  -  Free Report) announced a major lease renewal in Silicon Valley with InvenSense, Inc., a supplier of micro-electro-mechanical systems sensor platforms.Particularly, this lease, which runs through April 2025, involves 139,336 square feet of office space at 1745 Technology Drive. This space is a part of company’s Concourse office complex in San Jose. The prior lease was set to expire in 2019.Concourse is conveniently located at the junction of Technology Drive and Airport Parkway. Also, it is situated next to San Jose International Airport. The Class A office complex has seven buildings and spans across 944,386-square-feet.Importantly, this early renewal indicates  the rising demand for office space in the San Jose Airport submarket area and the strong interest of existing tenants in Hudson Pacific’s premium properties . The company  boasts a portfolio of more than 2.6 million square feet in the San Jose Airport submarket area.Notably, the improving economy and a healthy job market environment are anticipated to stoke growth in the office real estate market in 2018. However, the pace of growth will likely remain modest with an increased supply of office space that has been curbing the pricing power of landlords and resulting in elevated concession levels. Also, rate hike adds to its woes.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share was revised 1% downward in a month’s time.Nevertheless, shares of the company have outperformed its industry in the past three months, declining 5.4% compared with the industry’s descend of 8.5%. Currently, Hudson Pacific has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same industry include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

444,EXR,"DDR Corp.’s (DDR  -  Free Report) profitability is likely to be hurt by choppy retail real estate environment. In fact, demand for space is anticipated to be affected in the near term, thanks to the shift in customers’ shopping preferences toward online purchases. Also, aggressive asset disposition is expected to have a dilutive effect on earnings. Competition from other players in the industry and rate hike pose other challenges to this retail REIT.Notably, DDR is trying to streamline its portfolio and focus on core markets. In fact, in December 2017, its board of directors revealed the decision of spinning-off a portfolio of 50 assets into a separate public-traded REIT to be named Retail Value Inc. (RVI). Further, the company sold $590.1 million of assets in the fourth quarter. While dispositions are a strategic fit for long-term growth, the near-term dilution effect of such moves cannot be bypassed.For fourth-quarter 2017, DDR reported funds from operations (FFO) per share of 28 cents that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents. However, the figure declined a couple of cents from the prior-year quarter , reflecting the dilutive impact of deleveraging asset dispositions. The company generated revenues of $209.4 million for the fourth quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $208 million. However, the top line fell short of $232.2 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The results highlighted higher-than-expected business in its Continental U.S. portfolio as well as balance-sheet improvement efforts.  Admittedly, mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences and patterns with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually made them opt for store closures in recent times. Further, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing for bankruptcies. This comes as a pressing concern for retail REITs like DDR as this trend has been considerably curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.Also, hike in interest rate can pose a challenge for DDR as its ability to refinance existing debt would be restricted while the interest cost on new debt would also increase. This could adversely affect the company’s financial results.Shares of DDR have underperformed the industry it belongs to in the past six months. During this time frame, shares of the company have declined 25.6% compared with the industry’s descend of 11.1%.DDR currently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the real estate industry include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc (EXR  -  Free Report) and Sotherly Hotels Inc.

445,EXR,"Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report) is well positioned to benefit from an escalating demand for industrial properties by offering modern distribution facilities in strategic infill locations. Also, the medical office asset sale enabled the company to turn into a leading domestic pure-play industrial REIT. However, large-scale asset dispositions are expected to have a dilutive effect on earnings in the near term. Further, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns.In January 2018, Duke Realty reported  fourth-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of 30 cents, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the figure was lower than the year-ago tally of 31 cents. Total rental and related revenues of $179.4 million for the quarter jumped 11.5% on a year-over-year basis. Further, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $175 million. The results reflected growth in same-property net operating income on the back of solid rental increase.Notably, the industrial real estate market has been witnessing elevated demand for modern, bulk distribution properties and warehouses. This demand is stemming from the growth of industries and companies opting for measures to improve supply chain efficiencies. This is helping the industrial real estate market to grow. Given Duke Realty’s solid capacity to offer such properties, it remains well poised to capitalize on this trend.In fact, as part of its strategy to concentrate on industrial properties, in recent years, the company has made concerted efforts to lower exposure to suburban office assets. Further, it divested its medical office business in the prior year. Such efforts are particularly aimed at simplifying the company’s business model and turn it into a leading domestic pure play industrial REIT.Moreover, solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors. Duke Realty has raised its regular common dividend rate by 5.9%, 5.6% and 5.3% in fourth-quarter 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Furthermore, the company contributed $70 million toward special dividend in 2015. Also, during fourth-quarter 2017, the company paid 85 cents as special dividends.Nevertheless, as Duke Realty is enhancing its portfolio mix through continued divestitures, this included the significant disposition of suburban office assets and MOBs in recent times. While such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. Such moves tend to drag the company’s quarterly results and weigh on its profitability.Though the company’s large development pipeline is encouraging for its future growth, it increases operational risks by exposing it to rising construction costs, entitlement delays and lease-up risks. The company also faces significant competition from developers, owners and operators of commercial real estates. This influences its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors.Further, shares of Duke Realty have underperformed its industry in the past six months, declining 13.3% compared with the industry’s descend of 8.6%. Currently, Duke Realty carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

446,EXR,"Hotel REIT Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report) has announced refinancing of its $250-million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The move offers the company financial flexibility as well as capacity to take up growth opportunities.Specifically, Chatham, which mainly invests in upscale extended-stay hotels and premium branded, select-service hotels, has been able to lower borrowing costs by 0-15 basis points from the comparable leverage-based pricing levels in its previous credit facility. Based on the company’s current leverage level, the borrowing cost under its new facility is LIBOR plus 1.65%.Moreover, the company has been able to push the maturity. This is because the new unsecured revolving credit facility is slated to mature in March 2023. Further, it bears option for maturity extension by an additional year, while the earlier $250-million senior unsecured credit facility was scheduled to mature in 2020.This reduction in interest cost as well as extension of maturity is a strategic fit for the company. The company has resorted to opportunistic asset sales for redeploying the proceeds for its development efforts and acquisitions in high growth markets.However, in the near term, the company’s growth tempo is likely to remain curtailed amid higher supply. Furthermore, the company is likely to face tough comparisons in 2018, mainly in the first and fourth quarters. This is because the company’s four properties in Houston benefited from the Super Bowl in first-quarter 2017, while three properties in the Washington DC area gained from the inauguration in the quarter. Also, significant demand stemmed from hurricanes for the company’s Houston properties in fourth-quarter 2017.In addition to the difficult comparisons, the company’s margins are likely to bear the brunt of increasing wages and declining revenues. Also, the dilutive impact of asset dispositions on earnings cannot be bypassed.Amid these, Chatham currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Sell). In the past month, the company’s shares have depreciated 7.1%, while its industry registered growth of 2.0%.

448,EXR,"Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report) has been making concerted efforts to expand its business around large population centers and diversify geographically.The company has significantly expanded its business in recent years, growing its branded store count from 694 in 2008 to 1,483 in fourth-quarter 2017. Also, total stores managed for third-party owners increased from 185 in 2011 to 422 in the recently-reported quarter.Moreover, over the past five years, Extra Space Storage acquired $4.5 billion in properties. Through these acquisitions, the company gained an increased scale in several core markets as well as fortified its presence in a number of new markets.As a result, this Salt Lake City, UT-based self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) emerged as the second largest self-storage operator as well as the largest self-storage management company in the United States. Majority of this REIT’s stores are situated around large population centers which enjoy above-average population and income demographics for stores.In addition, the self-storage asset category is basically need-based and recession-resilient in nature. This asset class has low capital-expenditure requirements and generates high operating margins. Additionally, the self-storage industry is likely to continue experiencing solid demand, backed by favorable demographic changes, and events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce.Also, Extra Space Storage’s Return on Equity (ROE) is 18.9% compared with the industry’s average of 5.4%. This reflects that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry. Further, the company remains committed to boost shareholders’ wealth. It has achieved five-year total increase of a whopping 212% in dividend. Such shareholder-friendly efforts are encouraging.Furthermore, the industry is characterized by fragmented ownership and only around 20% of the total self-storage square footage is under REIT’s ownership. This creates solid scope for consolidation at some level in the future and with a solid balance sheet, Extra Space Storage remains well poised to compete for acquisitions.Encouragingly, in the just reported quarter, Extra Space Storage delivered a positive surprise of 3.70% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. In fact, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.8%. The company’s results highlight solid growth in same-store net operating growth and high level of occupancy.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has also seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year FFO per share being revised 0.9% upward to $4.52 in a month’s time, reflecting analysts’ bullish sentiments.

The figure also came in 8.7% higher than $1.03 recorded in the prior-year quarter.Results reflect growth in property-rental revenues and improvement in same-store net operating income (NOI).

The increase in same-store revenues was driven by higher rental rates for both new and existing customers as well as gains in occupancy. Same-store occupancy was 91.9% as of Dec 31, 2017, up 40 basis points from 91.5% as of Dec 31, 2016.Notably, for 2017, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Sacramento were the major markets which recorded revenue growth above the company's portfolio average.

The company projects same-store property revenue growth of 3.25-4.25% and same-store property NOI growth of around 3-4.5% for the year.In ConclusionWe are encouraged by the better-than-expected performance of Extra Space Storage in the fourth quarter. We are also impressed with its focus on the expansion of its geographical footprint through accretive acquisitions and third-party management platforms.It enjoys presence in key cities and opts for strategic joint ventures to drive long-term profitability. Moreover, a solid balance sheet and fragmented ownership of its industry will likely prove conducive to portfolio consolidation and strategic acquisitions.However, the company is likely to be affected by the development boom going forward. In fact, many of its markets are witnessing an escalating supply of new self-storage space and this is anticipated to fuel competition for the company, curb its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.Extra Space Storage Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Extra Space Storage Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Extra Space Storage Inc QuoteExtra Space Storage currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

451,EXR,"Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Feb 15, after the market closes.Last quarter, this San Francisco, CA-based date center real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 1.34%. Results were supported by growth in revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and met estimates in the other, with an average beat of around 1.69%. This is depicted in the graph below:Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Digital Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for Digital Realty prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderData-center REITs are experiencing a boom market amid growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure. This has been driving demand which is outpacing supply in top-tier data center markets. Therefore, despite enjoying high occupancy, the top-tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.Additionally, improved outlook for economic growth is anticipated to fuel demand for data centers. Amid these, Digital Realty’s focus on offering upgraded technology to entice clients is likely to bolster its revenue stream in the to-be-reported quarter.In addition to this, strategic acquisitions are likely to aid the company’s top-line growth. Also, in September 2017, the company announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros. This buyout helped the company reinforce its hyper-scale product offering and widen the blue-chip customer base.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $729.3 million, indicating projected growth of around 49.8% year over year.However, Digital Realty faces intense competition in its industry. In fact, the company competes with several data-center developers, owners and operators, many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets in locations same as Digital Realty. Also, there are a number of local developers in the United States, and several regional operators in Europe, Asia and Australia.Given the solid growth potential of the data-center real estate market, competition is expected to have been intense from existing players, as well as entry of new players. Amid this, aggressive pricing pressure is predicted to have been prevalent in the data-center market in the quarter-to-be reported, while robust growth in occupancy might remain elusive.Moreover, Digital realty has a significant number of properties situated outside the United States. The company is also considering making additional international acquisition. Although a sound global footprint helps the company meet rising data-center requirements of customers around the world, the process exposes the company’s earnings to foreign currency translation. Also, the hike in interest rate is a concern as the company has a substantial debt burden.Hence, prior to the fourth-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations (FFO) per share for the fourth quarter remained unchanged at $1.52 over the past week. However, FFO per share denotes a projected increase of 6.3% year over year.Also, Digital Realty’s shares have declined 12.5% in the past three months, underperforming the 10.7% loss incurred by the industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Digital Realty will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

452,EXR,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) is slated to report its fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Feb 13, before the opening bell. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are expected to experience a decline on year-over-year basis.Last quarter, this Irvine, CA-based healthcare REIT delivered a positive surprise of 4.35% in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected growth in three-month same-property portfolio cash net operating income (NOI).The company has a decent surprise history. In fact, over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded estimates in each occasion, generating an average positive surprise of 4.1%. This is depicted in the graph below.HCP, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HCP, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | HCP, Inc. QuoteHowever, HCP’s shares have lost 22.1% of its value over the past six months, underperforming the 8.7% decline recorded by the industry it belongs to.Let’s see how things are shaping up, prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderHCP enjoys a diversified, well-balanced portfolio in the healthcare sector. In the to-be-reported quarter, the company is likely to gain from rising healthcare spending and a growing aging population. Importantly, strategic investments, tie-ups and acquisitions are anticipated to drive decent cash flows.Subsequently, rental and related revenues are likely to record sequential growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $271 million indicates growth of 1.9% as compared to the prior quarter. However, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues from life science and medical office will remain stable compared with the prior quarter tally of $90 million and $120 million, respectively.The company also remains on track with its deleveraging plan and its balance sheet is likely to reflect that. However, as part of such efforts, it significantly disposed of non-core assets. While such moves are a strategic fit for the long term, the company cannot bypass the dilutive impact on earnings in the near term from huge asset dispositions.Moreover, growth might be hindered by cut-throat competition in HCP’s markets. In addition, there is an increased supply in senior housing category. As this curtails landlords’ pricing power and limits growth in occupancy level, the prevalent oversupply situation is expected to impact the company’s third-quarter numbers.HCP’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q4 FFO has remained constant at 47 cents in a month’s time. Further, it indicates a decline of 20.3% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $456.2 million, indicating a year-over-year drop of 15.5%.For full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $1.86 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 12.7%. The consensus estimate for FFO per share is $1.94, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 29.2%. Management expects core FFO per share in the range of $1.92-$1.96.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that HCP will likely beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

453,EXR,"Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Feb 15, before the market opens. The company’s revenues are expected to inch up in the quarter, while funds from operations (FFO) per share will likely remain flat year over year.Last quarter, this New Hyde Park, NY-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered better-than-expected results with respect to FFO per share.Over the trailing four quarters, Kimco beat estimates in one occasion and posted in-line results in the other three, recording an average beat of 0.68%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kimco Realty Corporation QuoteHowever, the stock has depreciated 25.2% in the past three months versus the industry's loss of 9.7%.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsKimco has been taking long strides and is progressing well with its strategic 2020 Vision. In fact, the company has been strategically reducing its portfolio size and channeling the proceeds toward high-quality assets. Further, the company is engaged in the execution of strategic measures to boost the capital structure, and enhance its growth profile and tax efficiency.Kimco announced fourth-quarter 2017 and full-year 2017 transaction activities. Acquisitions for the fourth quarter totaled $123 million. Moreover, the company’s share from dispositions aggregated $174 million. In 2017, Kimco acquired three shopping centers and 10 land parcels for $382.1 million, out of which, $377.4 million marks the company’s pro-rata share. Disposition activity of the company in the year consisted of 38 shopping centers and three land parcels, for an aggregate gross value of $565.7 million, out of which, the company’s share included $430.4 million.Also, the holiday season turned out to be blissful for the retailers with upbeat consumer sentiment amid an improving economy, rising income and low unemployment level. Per government data, consumer spending remained robust during this season, with retail sales rising 0.9% and 0.4% in November and December, respectively.However, the retail real estate market continued to bear the brunt as mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference through online channels, resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies.These have emerged as serious concerns for retail REITs, as it is limiting demand for the retail real estate space considerably. Moreover, the choppy retail real estate market situation is said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which mall landlords find unjustified.Although retail REITs like Kimco are actively enhancing the omni-channel capabilities and heavily investing in redevelopment to draw customers, it may take a while for these efforts to offset the dent created in the operating results.Furthermore, as part of its portfolio-upgrade strategy, Kimco is aggressively disposing non-core assets. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the earnings dilution led by high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term. Therefore, these moves are expected to hurt the company’s growth momentum in the to-be-reported quarter.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $298.9 million for the quarter under review, reflecting projected growth of 0.6% from the year-ago period.Kimco’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the fourth quarter remained unchanged at 38 cents, over the past month. The figure also remains flat compared to the prior-year quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kimco will likely beat FFO estimates this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Kimco has an Earnings ESP of +0.16%.

454,EXR,"Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report) is a notable name in the self-storage industry. The company focuses on expansion of its geographical footprint through accretive acquisitions and third-party management platforms. It enjoys presence in key cities and opts for strategic joint ventures to drive long-term profitability.In fact, in recent years, the company has significantly expanded its business, growing its branded store count from 694 in 2008 to 1,513 in third-quarter 2017. Also, total stores managed for third-party owners increased from 185 in 2011 to 485 in the recently-reported quarter.In addition, over the past five years, Extra Space Storage acquired $4.8 billion in properties. These efforts have helped this Salt Lake City, UT-based self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) emerge as the second largest self-storage operator and the largest self-storage management company in the United States. Majority of this REIT’s stores are situated around large population centers which enjoy above-average population and income demographics for stores.Further, the self-storage asset category is basically need based and recession resilient in nature. This asset class has low capital expenditure requirements and generates high-operating margins. Additionally, the self-storage industry is likely to continue experiencing solid demand, backed by favorable demographic changes, and events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce.Extra Space Storage’s Return on Equity (ROE) is 14.4% compared with the industry’s average of 5.8%. This reflects that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry. Also, the company remains committed to boost shareholders’ wealth. It has achieved five-year total increase of a whopping 290% in dividend. Such shareholder-friendly efforts are encouraging.However, the company operates in a highly fragmented market in the nation, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. In addition, there is a development boom of self-storage units in many markets. This is likely to fuel competition for the company, curb its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.Moreover, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost, which might impede its ability to purchase or develop real estate and impact profitability. Furthermore, the dividend payout might become less attractive compared to the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Extra Space Storage currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past three months, shares of the company have outperformed the industry. While the stock has gained 7.6%, the industry has inched up 0.2% during this period.

455,EXR,"Kimco Realty (KIM  -  Free Report) is making efforts to concentrate its open-air center assets in key retail destinations across the United States. This will likely enhance the company’s portfolio. However, continued asset disposition is expected to hinder bottom-line performance.For third-quarter 2017, Kimco’s adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of 38 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. Concurrent with its third-quarter earnings release, Kimco announced a quarterly cash dividend of 28 cents, which reflects a 3.7% sequential hike. Given the company’s healthy financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend payout is anticipated to be sustainable.In order to achieve an optimal portfolio, Kimco is shifting its focus to the small-shops portfolio. The small-shops portfolio enjoys frequent customer traffic and is Internet-resistant. This diversification will help Kimco limit its operating and leasing risks.The company is also making solid progress to achieve its 2020 Visions, which outlines the concentration of assets in primary markets and a reduction in joint ventures. The company is channelizing the proceeds from portfolio reduction to Signature Series assets which offer scope for redevelopment. In fact, since 2010, the company has reduced its portfolio size from more than 900 assets to 508 assets by disposing real estate worth more than $6 billion. Such strategic measures are projected to drive Kimco’s bottom line in the long term.While such aggressive dispositions are aimed at simplifying its business structure, the dilution of earnings in the short term cannot be bypassed. In fact, during the recently-reported quarter, Kimco sold five non-core assets for $62 million and is expected to close another 19 dispositions by the end of the year.     Further, it is revitalizing assets that are accretive for long-term growth by investing in development and redevelopment projects. Recently, the company announced its plan to redevelop the Owings Mills Mall into an open-air shopping center — Mill Station. (Read more: Kimco Announces Plans to Refurbish Owings Mills Mall). However, these projects typically have a long gestation period and also expose the company to various risks such as rising construction costs, entitlement delays and lease-ups in the near term.  Also, shift in consumers’ shopping preferences and pattern, and shrinking footfall at the brick-and-mortar outlets amid the e-commerce boom continue to thwart the performance of this retail real estate investment trust (REIT). Retailers that are not being able to cope with competition are shutting doors as well as filing bankruptcies.Amid the gloomy retail environment, shares of Kimco have underperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date. During this time frame, shares of the company have declined 27.3%, whereas the industry registered 9.6% growth.Kimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksBetter-ranked stocks in the real estate investment trust space include Clipper Realty (CLPR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage (EXR  -  Free Report) and Urstadt Biddle Properties (UBA  -  Free Report).

456,EXR,"Ushering in good news for Highwoods Properties’ (HIW  -  Free Report) shareholders, Moody's Investors Service recently affirmed the company’s ratings, including the Baa2 senior unsecured debt rating, with a stable outlook.Per the rating agency, the move is backed by Highwoods’ well situated, premium-quality portfolio of office properties. The company has assets in major Sunbelt markets which enjoy decent growth in jobs that fuel demand for office space. Also, supply is manageable in these markets and vacancy rates are low.Moreover, the rating agency cited the company’s adherence to a conservative capital structure. Highwoods resorts to non-core assets disposition, and reinvests the proceeds in strategic acquisitions and development efforts. Such moves helped reap decent cash rental-rate growth over the past four years, according to Moody's. The company also enjoys a healthy liquidity position and manageable debt maturity schedule.Further, the rating agency expects the company to maintain its conservative capital structure even while pursuing growth through ground-up development and this is reflected in the stable rating outlook.Notably, the latest rating affirmation reinstalls the company’s creditworthiness in the market and is likely to boost investors’ confidence in the stock. In fact, such moves provide companies an opportunity to enjoy favorable costs on debts and solid access to capital.Highwoods has a diverse portfolio and a well-capitalized tenant base. Particularly, the company’s efforts to enhance its office asset portfolio in best business districts (BBDs) through strategic acquisitions position it for long-term growth.Additionally, the company’s third-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share of 86 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. It also came in higher than the year-ago quarter figure. Results were backed by solid growth in straight-line rental income and improved leasing activity.However, the company has concentration of assets in Raleigh, Atlanta and Tampa which generates a major portion of its annualized cash revenues. This geographic concentration of properties remains a risk. Rate hike remains another concern.Highwoods currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Nonetheless, its shares have edged down 1.6%, thereby underperforming 2.1% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to, in the past three months.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the REIT space are Cedar Realty Trust (CDR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage (EXR  -  Free Report) and Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc.

Therefore, amid an improving economy, these retail properties have the capability to generate decent cash flows, given its cluster of renowned tenants.However, the retail real estate market has been crippling with issues like bankruptcies and downsizing of retailers. This is because mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences to online retail, resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon and reconsidering their footprint.These have emerged as serious concerns for retail REITs, as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably. Moreover, the choppy retail real estate market situation is also said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which mall landlords are finding unjustified.Given this, GGP Inc. has been making efforts to counter such pressure through various initiatives. However, implementation of such measures requires significant upfront costs, which might limit near-term growth in profit margins.Amid these, the company’s revenues are expected to record modest growth. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $565.6 million, reflecting projected growth of 2% from the year-ago period.For third-quarter 2017, the company estimates FFO per share in the range of 35-37 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 37 cents.However, GGP Inc.’s activities during the quarter could not gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged in a month’s time.GGP Inc.'s shares have lost 15.0% of its value in the past three months versus the 5.7% decline of its industry. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that GGP Inc. will likely beat FFO estimates this time around.

While the company’s funds from operations (FFO) per share are anticipated to be up year over year, revenues might decline.In the prior quarter, this Pasadena, CA-based urban office real estate investment trust (REIT), which primarily focuses on collaborative life science and technology campuses, delivered in-line FFO per share.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions, met in one and missed in the other, with an average beat of 0.35%.Alexandria’s shares have climbed 9.5% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 3.3%.Note: All EPS numbers presented here represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAlexandria focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for the life science and technology entities. These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit, and a limited supply of available space. This highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants, and will enable the company to enjoy steady rental revenues in the third quarter.The company follows the strategy of rotating capital from high-value assets, and the sale of non-core operating assets and non-strategic land parcels in order to finance pre-leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects. The near-term dilution impact of such moves is anticipated to weigh on its third-quarter earnings.In addition, Alexandria’s exposure to Canada and Asia through its subsidiaries makes it susceptible to currency fluctuation risks. In the to-be-reported quarter too, we expect unfavorable currency fluctuations to dent the company’s bottom-line performance.Also, over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the third quarter remained unchanged at $1.50, reflecting lack of any solid catalyst for being positive on the stock’s expected performance.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Alexandria will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

461,EXR,"UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, after the market closes.Last quarter, this Denver, CO-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered in-line result with respect to funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results reflect growth in revenues from same-store and stabilized, non-mature communities.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion and met estimates in the other three, the average beat being nearly 0.6%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteFor the third quarter, the company projects FFO per share in the range of 46-47 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 47 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for UDR prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderUDR boasts a vast experience in the residential real estate market. The company has a superior portfolio in targeted U.S. markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation. These are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter.Specifically, the company is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographic trends. There is steady demand for rental apartments from both new millennial households and empty nesters. Along with this, the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments.In fact, according to a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the U.S. apartment market recorded stable rent growth, while occupancy remained encouraging in the third quarter. However, these growth levels have moderated from the earlier years. For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the nation’s top 100 metros.However, we remain apprehensive about UDR’s performance as the company has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail a landlord’s ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption. As such, concession levels are likely to remain at the higher end, while pricing power of UDR is expected to remain limited in the quarter.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $250.1 million, denoting estimated growth of 2.8% year over year.Also, prior to the third-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter under review remained unchanged at 47 cents over the past two months.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that UDR will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for UDR is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 47 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: UDR’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 26, has an Earnings ESP of +1.19% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

462,EXR,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (""FFO"") of 49 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. Adjusted FFO per share also matched the year-ago tally.Results reflect growth in comparable hotel revenue per available room (RevPAR) and improvement in margin. The company also raised its full-year 2017 outlook.The company posted total revenue of nearly $1.44 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43 billion. However, the figure was down 1.2% from the prior-year number, as a result of revenue loss from sale of 12 hotels in 2016 and 2017.Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Quarter in DetailsDuring the reported quarter, comparable hotel revenues remained nearly flat year over year at $1.3 billion. Although, the company witnessed improvements in RevPAR, it was marred by a decline in food and beverage revenues.Comparable RevPAR (on a constant dollar basis) was up 1.7% year over year, driven by a 0.8% increase in average room rate and 70 basis points (bps) expansion in occupancy to 83.2%. At its domestic properties, comparable hotel RevPAR inched up 1.8%. However, the same at its comparable international properties was down 3.1% on a constant-dollar basis.Nevertheless, improvements in RevPAR aided GAAP operating profit margin growth of 50 bps for the quarter.During the quarter under review, the company invested around $16 million for redevelopment, and return on investment (ROI) capital expenditures. It also deployed approximately $47 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures.In the second quarter, the company accomplished the sale of the Sheraton Memphis Downtown for $67 million, recording a gain of around $28 million.Finally, the company exited second-quarter 2017 with around $644 million of unrestricted cash and $775 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver part of its credit facility. Moreover, as of Jun 30, 2017, total debt was $4.0 billion, having an average maturity of 5.5 years and an average interest rate of 3.9%. Notably, the company did not buy back any shares in 2017. It has $500 million of capacity available under its current repurchase program.OutlookHost Hotels raised its outlook for full-year 2017. The company now expects adjusted FFO per share in the range of $1.64–$1.68 compared to the prior guidance of $1.60–$1.68. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $1.66.This is backed by comparable hotel RevPAR (constant U.S. dollar basis) growth expectations of 1.00–1.75%, against the prior outlook of 0.0–2.0%.In ConclusionWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance of Host Hotels in the second quarter. The company’s solid portfolio of upscale hotels across lucrative markets, strategic capital-recycling program and a healthy balance sheet bode well for long-term growth. However, supply growth, specifically in the company’s key markets, remains a concern. In addition, dilutive impact of asset sales cannot be bypassed. Also, rate hike add to its woes.Host Hotels currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

463,EXR,"Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, after the market closes.In the last reported quarter, this Salt Lake City, UT-based self-storage real estate investment trust (“REIT”) delivered a positive surprise of 5.10% in terms of funds from operations (“FFO”) per share. Results indicated an improvement in same-store net operating income (NOI).The company has a decent surprise history. In fact, over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the quarters, with an average beat of 4.12%. This is depicted in the graph below:Extra Space Storage Inc Price and EPS Surprise Extra Space Storage Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Extra Space Storage Inc QuoteHowever, Extra Space Storage’s shares have climbed 2.9% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 3.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderExtra Space Storage is a notable name in the self-storage industry. The company offers a wide array of well-located storage units to its customers, including boat storage, recreational vehicle storage and business storage. In addition, the self-storage industry is anticipated to experience solid demand, backed by favorable demographic changes and events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce. As such, in the to-be-reported quarter, the company is anticipated to benefit from steady demand in the self-storage industry, and witness growth in same-store revenues and NOI.However, there is an increasing supply of storage units in certain MSAs, which can adversely affect its pricing power. In fact, Extra Space Storage operates in a highly fragmented market in the U.S., with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. Amid this, occupancy levels are also likely to remain nearly flat in the quarter under review.Amid these, prior to the second-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at $1.05 over the past seven days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Extra Space Storage will likely beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

464,EXR,"Ushering in good news for shareholders of Realty Income (O  -  Free Report), Moody's Investors Service recently upgraded the company’s senior unsecured rating to A3 from Baa1. The outlook is stable.Per the rating agency, this move highlights Realty Income’s efficiency in maintaining conservative balance sheet metrics for a long time as well as ability to get financing for long-term at low costs. The rating agency also acknowledged the REIT’s geographically diverse net-lease retail portfolio that has been able to deliver steady performance throughout the real estate cycles. The depth and experience of management team has also been recognized by the rating agency.Further, the rating agency anticipates Realty Income to grow in a disciplined fashion without negotiating financial flexibility and leverage. It also expects management to keep up the solid operating performance backed by high occupancy levels and strong earnings growth. Notably, this is reflected by the company’s stable outlook.The rating upgrade enhances its creditworthiness in the market and is likely to boost investors’ confidence in the stock. In fact, such moves provide companies an opportunity to enjoy reduced costs on debts and better access to capital.Notably, this freestanding retail REIT derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions, as well as competition from Internet retailing. The company also enjoys high occupancy levels consistently.However, substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises risks associated with tenant default. Further, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hikes add to woes.Realty Income currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The deal is anticipated to generate approximately $292 million cash proceeds for SL Green.Located in the centre of the Plaza District, at the corner of 52nd Street and Lexington Avenue, this property is a 36-story office tower spanning 303,515 square feet of space. SL Green bought this office space in May 2010, through a joint venture, for $193 million and eventually acquired full ownership in December 2015.SL Green strategically improved the building by putting an extensive renovation plan in place. The overhaul upgraded the entire building, including modernization of the lobby and elevators.Such transformative redevelopments helped enhance the building’s profile and attract new tenants. Currently, this building is 99% leased. Its impressive tenant roster includes companies such as Element Capital Management, MKP Capital Management and Hawkins Parnell Thackston & Young.Per management, the above-mentioned sale is in line with the company’s efforts to improve its capital position and focus on other assets which exhibit strong occupancy and rental growth. It also reflects the demand for office assets in the Midtown area.Further, on Nov 14, the companyentered into a contract to sell 43% stake in 1515 Broadway to Allianz Real Estate — the real estate investment division of German-based company Allianz Group. The deal values the Class-A Times Square office property at $1.95 billion and is anticipated to generate $416 million in cash proceeds for SL Green. (Read more: SL Green Signs Deal to Sell 43% Stake in Office Tower)Shrinking its ownership in non-core assets gives SL Green an opportunity to channelize the proceeds in high-growth properties. The company is New York City's largest commercial landlord, which primarily acquires, manages, develops and leases commercial office properties in the New York Metropolitan area, especially mid-town Manhattan.However, several big companies are choosing to resize their businesses and contain cost, which are adversely affecting demand for office space. In addition, there is growth in supply of space for office use in the market. These challenges in the office real estate market are expected to have an adverse impact on the company’s shares which have underperformed its industry, year to date.

466,EXR,"SL Green Realty (SLG  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into a contract with Allianz Real Estate, pursuant to which the commercial property owner will sell 43% stake in 1515 Broadway to the real estate investment division of German-based company Allianz Group.The above-mentioned deal values the Class-A Times Square office property at $1.95 billion and is expected to generate $416 million in cash proceeds for SL Green. Notably, 70% of the transaction will likely close on Nov 30, 2017, while the balance is slated to close in the first quarter of 2018.Per SL Green’s management, the agreement reflects the confidence of foreign investors in New York City’s office realties. Per Allianz Real Estate, this joint venture is a strategic move as well as consistent with the company’s plan of expanding its footprint in the city. Moreover, this trophy asset is anticipated to add significant value to Allianz’s portfolio in the future.Spanning 1.86 million square feet of space, the 57-storeyed building is well placed between the 44th and 45th street of New York's Times Square. This enables the property to boast an enviable tenant roster and enjoy high leasing activity. The building is currently 98% leased to well-known tenants such as Skechers, Milano, Line Friends as well as the Minskoff Theater, which hosts the top grossing show — The Lion King — in Broadway.SL Green initially owned interest in the building through a joint venture in 2002 after which it gained full ownership in 2011. The company then redeveloped the property in 2012 by adding new elevators, signage and a lobby, as well as repositioning the retail spaces. This enabled the company to sign a lease renewal with Viacom. Per a long-term lease renewal, the media giant will occupy the building's office space through 2031.Increasing demand associated with job growth is helping reverse the persistent office-space efficiency trends which have continued to limit robust growth in the office sector fundamentals. Further, with corporate sectors renting more space to accommodate the increased workforce, we anticipate a healthy revival in office leasing activities. The aforementioned joint venture further reaffirms strength of the retail and office real estate market in the Times Square locality.Shares of SL Green have underperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date. The company’s shares have declined 7% as against the industry’s growth of 7.3%.

467,EXR,"Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report) has been putting in efforts to expand its business around large population centers and attain geographical diversity.The company has significantly expanded its business in recent years, growing its branded store count from 694 in 2008 to 1,513 in third-quarter 2017. Also, total stores managed for third-party owners increased from 185 in 2011 to 485 in the recently-reported quarter.Moreover, over the past five years, Extra Space Storage acquired $4.8 billion in properties. The company gained an increased scale in several core markets on the back of these acquisitions as well as fortified its presence in a number of new markets.These efforts have helped this Salt Lake City, UT-based self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) emerge as the second largest self-storage operator in the United States and the largest self-storage management company in the nation. Majority of this REIT’s stores are situated around large population centers which enjoy above-average population and income demographics for stores.In addition, the self-storage asset category is basically need based and recession resilient in nature. This asset class has low capital expenditure requirements and generates high-operating margins. Additionally, the self-storage industry is likely to continue experiencing solid demand, backed by favorable demographic changes and events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce.Also, Extra Space Storage’s Return on Equity (ROE) is 14.4% compared with the industry’s average of 5.8%. This reflects that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry. Further, the company remains committed to boost shareholders’ wealth. It has achieved five-year total increase of a whopping 290% in dividend. Such shareholder-friendly efforts are encouraging.Also, the industry is characterized by fragmented ownership and only around 20% of the total self-storage square footage is under REIT’s ownership. This creates solid scope for consolidation at some level in the future and with a solid balance sheet, Extra Space Storage remains well poised to compete for acquisitions.Encouragingly, in the just reported quarter, Extra Space Storage delivered a positive surprise of 2.73% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share.

470,EXR,"Mack-Cali Realty Corporation’s (CLI  -  Free Report) operating partnership — Mack-Cali Realty, L.P. —recently experienced a rating downgrade from Moody's Investors Service. Specifically, its senior unsecured debt rating has been downgraded to Ba1 from Baa3. Further, the rating outlook remains negative.Continued fall in portfolio lease rate, weakness in leverage metrics and decline in the company’s unencumbered asset base are responsible for this rating downgrade. Though Mack-Cali has a huge development pipeline, its liquidity position remains modest. Moreover, per the rating agency, the REIT has considerable near-term lease expirations. Therefore, portfolio lease rate and earnings might suffer if renewals and new lease volumes are not proportionate with lease expirations.Notably, rating upgrades and downgrades are important for investors because these indicate a company’s creditworthiness in the market. Such movements denote the company’s accessibility to capital and determine borrowing costs on debts.In fact, Mack-Cali has been making progress in the 2015 strategic plan, aimed at transforming the company by focusing on waterfront and transit-based office holdings, and luxury multi-family portfolio growth. As part of the company’s portfolio-transforming efforts, it has been aggressively disposing its assets. While such measures are a strategic fit for the long term, the dilutive impact on earnings from huge asset sales cannot be bypassed in the near term.Nevertheless, Mack-Cali has been able to improve its overall portfolio mix and lower the company’s exposure to suburban office assets. Also, its expanding multi-family portfolio with solid leasing performance augurs well for long-term growth.Mack-Cali currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).However, the stock has declined 6.0% in the past three months, underperforming 3.3% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

The figure compared unfavorably with 22 cents recorded in the year-ago period.The quarter witnessed considerable improvement in rental property revenues, which aided results to quite an extent.

The figure also came in a penny higher than the year-ago quarter tally. Results reflect improved property performance and accretive investments.Further, the company posted revenues of $895.5 million which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $869.4 million. The figure compared favorably with the year-ago number of $867.1 million.For the third quarter, same-store cash net operating income (NOI) growth for total portfolio (1,045 assets) climbed 2.1% year over year. Segment wise, same-store cash NOI for the triple net leased portfolio grew 3.8%, seniors housing operating portfolio inched up 0.6% and medical office building portfolio rose 1.5%.Quarter in DetailDuring the third quarter, Ventas funded investments of around $80 million. This included $67 million of funding for its share of development and redevelopment projects for projects presently in progress.Furthermore, the company disposed properties and obtained final repayments on loans receivable for proceeds of $650 million.LiquidityAt present, the company enjoys liquidity with $2.9 billion of available borrowing capacity and $100 million of cash on hand.2017 OutlookVentas updated its outlook and estimates 2017 normalized FFO per share in the range of $4.13-$4.16. The mid-point of the guidance remained unchanged from the prior guidance as the Kindred skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) sale offsets improved property performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.17. The company anticipates same-store cash NOI growth of 2-2.5% in 2017.Our TakeWe are encouraged with the in-line performance of Ventas in the third quarter. We believe the company’s adequate size and scale would help it capitalize on opportunities such as increasing healthcare spending and aging population.Also, university-based life science real estate is a new zone of investment which has grabbed attention and Ventas has already committed substantial amount to this segment.  The company acquired a 262,000-square-foot class-A life science building, which is currently 82% occupied. Such investments will likely offer scope to capitalize on growing health-care-driven research and development.In addition to this, sale of the SNFs enabled the company to realize around $570 million in sale proceeds. Also, the transaction lowered the company’s exposure to this particular healthcare real estate category which is becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the change in medical billing procedure.However, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company, considering its substantial exposure to long-term leased assets.Currently, Ventas carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

477,EXR,"Brandywine Realty Trust (BDN  -  Free Report) recently earned the final approval from the Austin City Council for the rezoning and extensive redevelopment of the Broadmoor Campus in North Austin. Brandywine bought the community in 2015 and now plans to revamp the property with a “mixed-use, transit-oriented and highly-amenitized urban environment.”Notably, the campus occupying one million square feet of space on 66 acres is conveniently located in the population center of the greater Austin area, east of The Domain. It serves as a campus for technology giant IBM Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) and will likely be pitched as Austin’s bid for Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) second headquarter.The zoning change request will permit a high-density construction and also enable the company to build taller structures of height 360 feet from the existing 120 feet. Further, the floor-to-area ratio would be raised from 5:1 to 8:1, with up to 80% of impervious cover limit. This will enable the developer to significantly expand the campus’ capacity.A relocation of the Kramer Metro Rail Station from Kramer Lane and addition of bus stops in the Broadmoor campus are also in the cards. In addition, the redevelopment plan includes the construction of 2,000 housing units, accommodation of addition of parking space, two hotels and more office space.The focus on mixed-use space with convenient transit facilities will open up new opportunities for the company. In fact, with increased size and easy transportation access post redevelopment, the Broadmoor campus will be fully equipped to support the online giant’s demand.Further, the company plans an overhaul of buildings 906 and 908 in order to suit needs of new tenants. Per management, the site is already witnessing strong demand, and leasing activity from prospective tenants and anticipates the site to be fully leased by 2018.   Moreover, the company has significant presence in the Austin area with more than 2.6 million square feet of Class A office space. Additionally, the company has two upcoming projects at Four Points Centre and Garza Ranch, which are expected to further strengthen its foothold in the area.Nonetheless, this massive redevelopment is a capital-intensive plan and may impact the company’s liquidity. In fact, Brandywine will incur higher expenses relating to the relocation of the Kramer Metro Rail Station.

478,EXR,"Outfront Media Inc. (OUT  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has installed the first ON Smart Media liveboards at the Caltrain Station in the San Francisco transit system. This deployment marks the first step in the comprehensive implementation of the On Smart Media technology throughout the San Francisco Bay Area transit system.  Notably, the displays have been installed at the northern terminus of the line at 4th and King streets. The station has a wide reach, experiencing a footfall of more than 62,000 riders daily. This will help Outfront Media promote outdoor advertising extensively. Further, the station already has numerous static displays and 17 liveboards consisting of seven back-to-back and a triple display to provide a unique experience to commuters. Monterey Bay Aquarium, Sparkpost, American Express and Sharepost will utilize the newly-installed digital displays to advertise their respective brands. Per the Monterey Bay Aquarium management, the new technology will add a sparkle to brand marketing.Notably, Outfront Media has partnerships with other Bay Area transit agencies and this installation will likely enable the company to fortify its presence in the tech capital of the nation. In fact, on Apr 25, the company was awarded the advertising franchise of the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) for 10.75 years, with two additional one-year options to extend the duration. In sync with this, it will start deployment of 600 ON Smart Liveboard digital displays, along with four large-format LED displays, this October.These installations will offer an extensive digital display system and help outdoor advertising in California. Further, transformational upgrade of the transit system will enable brands to provide a dynamic experience to the city’s tech-savvy commuters.   These initiatives by the company reflect its aim to continuously improve rider experience in the transit across the nation. In fact, expansion of its portfolio in San Francisco marks Outfront Media’s presence in eight out of the 10 largest DMAs across the United States, according to Nielsen Media Research.Of late, Outfront Media has been focusing on the expansion of its out-of-home (OOH) advertising business. Recently, the company partnered with Frisco Fresh Market, in line with its efforts to focus on the OOH advertising business. With this campaign, the company announced the inauguration of Frisco’s new outdoor farmer’s market.Notably, the OOH advertising is growing at a rapid pace and continues to increase its market share compared with other forms of media. Therefore, the company is expanding its footprint and providing a unique technology platform to marketers in order to tap growth opportunities.It offers advertisers additional data analytics features and helps draw more audiences. Additionally, the company’s digital platform offers real-time geo-location audience data to advertisers. This will help advertisers channelize their funds efficiently to Outfront Media’s assets. This is anticipated to serve as a major growth driver for the company.However, Outfront Media faces stiff competition from other outdoor advertisers, regarding customers, display locations and structures. It also competes with other media, including conventional platforms along with online, mobile and social media platforms. This might affect the company’s pricing power in the market.Amid soft market concerns, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed the industry in the past three months.

479,EXR,"Summit Hotel Properties, Inc. (INN  -  Free Report) announced the opening of Hyatt House Across From Orlando Universal Resort in Orlando, FL.Notably, with the inclusion of this hotel in its portfolio, the company expects to generate additional earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for real estate of approximately $1 million during the rest of 2018. The cost of constructing the hotel was $32.7 million or about $194,500 per key, which excluded the price of the land.This 168-room hotel is located very close to the Universal Orlando Resort and next to the company’s Hyatt Place hotel. It provides easy access to Orlando International Airport. Further, the property is in the vicinity of the new Volcano Bay water park, Walt Disney World Resort, SeaWorld Orlando, ICON Orlando 360 and SEA LIFE Orlando Aquarium.

480,EXR,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) may be considering the shedding of a huge portfolio of non-core hotels, per news from Bloomberg. Although the properties that are expected to be sold off have not been finalized yet, the value of the same, in aggregate, is likely to cross $2 billion, per the report.Notably, Host Hotels has a strategic capital-recycling program to improve its portfolio quality and strengthen the company’s position in vibrant markets. Furthermore, the company has been monetizing a considerable part of real estate in Washington D.C. and lowering its exposure in New York.Particularly, during first-quarter 2018, Host Hotels completed the acquisition of the 301-room Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, 668-room Grand Hyatt San Francisco and 454-room Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa, for $1 billion.Moreover, during the first quarter, the company expended around $115 million on capital expenditures — $29 million was return on investment (ROI) capital projects, and $86 million for renewal and replacement projects. Also, the company continues to expect capital expenditures of $475-$550 million for the year. This comprises $185-$220 million in ROI projects, and $290-$330 million in renewal and replacement projects. Such investments are likely to help the company enhance its portfolio quality and bolster revenues as well.Host Hotels is expected to benefit from its solid portfolio of upscale hotels across potential markets and strategic capital-recycling program, going forward. Further, its productivity-improvement efforts are anticipated to drive the company’s performance over the long term. In addition, the company has a healthy balance sheet with ample liquidity that augurs well for its growth endeavors. Nevertheless, elevated supply in some of the company’s key markets might affect its pricing power.Furthermore, in the past three months, shares of Host Hotels have gained 13.0%, outperforming its industry’s growth of 6.4%.

481,EXR,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) is rumored to be selling the company’s 22 Brookdale-managed senior housing properties for $428 million to New York firm — Apollo Global Management LLC (APO  -  Free Report) — per a Bloomberg news. Earlier this June, the company announced that it has entered into definitive deals for selling those 22 properties, having 2,781 units, to an institutional investor.This healthcare REIT has been selling several of its senior housing assets in a bid to improve the quality of the company’s senior housing portfolio, strengthen balance sheet and lower the Brookdale Senior Living Inc. operator concentration.  Particularly, HCP has reaped $332 million of proceeds through completion of the disposition of its residual investment in the RIDEA II senior housing joint venture (JV) to an investor group led by Columbia Pacific Advisors, LLC. Notably, this JV owned 49 communities and 46 of those were managed by Brookdale. Moreover, HCP completed the sale of six assets to Brookdale for $275 million. This was done through disposition of one asset in January and five in April. Last year, HCP also accomplished the sale of a portfolio of 64 triple-net assets leased to Brookdale to affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate Partners VIII L.P., for $1.125 billion.Further, this March, the company announced the transition of management of a portfolio of 24 HCP-owned senior housing communities from Brookdale to Atria Senior Living, Inc., and has already transitioned 18 of those.These efforts are expected to benefit HCP’s senior housing portfolio in a number of ways. Specifically, the operator diversification of the portfolio will improve and the revamped portfolio will have stronger demographics, while the company’s balance sheet is likely to strengthen with the sale proceeds.On the other hand, HCP is focused on making opportunistic acquisitions to enhance its overall portfolio mix. The company acquired Hayden Research Campus in the Boston life-science market in December 2017 and is experiencing strong leasing velocity. Moreover, in March 2018, the company acquired development rights at Hayden for $21 million and its planned 214,000-square-foot Class A development is expected to improve the company’s scale in this leading life-science market.Also, the company started the Phase I of Sierra Point, which marks its next key life-science development in the South San Francisco market. In fact, increasing longevity of the aging U.S. population, along with biopharma drug development growth opportunities, has promoted life science and medical-market fundamentals, and this trend will likely continue in the upcoming years, giving significant impetus for growth to HCP.Over time, with the diligent measures, the company aims at having more than half of its business comprising specialty office segments of medical office and life science, and lower senior housing concentration to around 40%.HCP currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

482,EXR,"SL Green Realty (SLG  -  Free Report) has been making solid strides to revamp its portfolio by acquiring interests in potential properties and disposing non-core assets.In fact, this real estate investment trust is expected to acquire stake in the 245 Park Avenue office tower in New York City from Chinese conglomerate, HNA Group, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.  While details of the deal remain undisclosed, the report citing people familiar with the matter stated that SL Green will likely enjoy operating control of the skyscraper, along with a preferred position in the joint venture for the property.  Citing others knowledgeable of the deal, the report mentioned that the deal for the 1.8-million-square-foot tower will likely close in multiple stages.Notably, the sale is part of HNA’s restructuring activity, which was on a buying spree for the past two years, and is now realigning its operations and trimming assets to repay debt. Moreover, the office tower was purchased by the company last year for $2.21 billion, with $1.8 billion of debt. It was among the highest price paid for a Manhattan office building during the time of purchase.Importantly, SL Green’s sale of non-core assets offers the company an opportunity to channelize the proceeds in high-growth properties. The company is the largest commercial landlord of New York City that primarily acquires, manages, develops and leases commercial office properties in the New York Metropolitan area, especially in mid-town Manhattan.The above-mentioned purchase will further strengthen its foothold in the New York market. Further, the company is likely to experience decent demand for its properties amid recovering economy and healthy job market environment.Nonetheless, increased supply of office space in some of its markets is a concern. There is intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, and other commercial real estates, which is likely to restrict the company’s ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors.In the year-to-date period, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed its industry.

483,EXR,"The net lease real estate investment trust — W. P. Carey Inc. (WPC  -  Free Report) — has recently agreed to merge Corporate Property Associates 17, Global Incorporated (""CPA:17""), in a stock-for-stock deal valued at around $6 billion.The move would substantially enhance W. P. Carey’s size and scale with pro forma equity market capitalization of around $10.9 billion and pro forma enterprise value of about $17.3 billion. Also, it would improve earnings quality and significantly boost the company’s real estate adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) derived from long-term, recurring lease revenues.Per the terms of the agreement, shareholders of CPA:17 would receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.16 shares of W. P. Carey common stock for each share of CPA:17 they hold. Based on W. P. Carey's closing share price of $67.03 as of Jun 15, 2018, this equals $10.72 per share. Expected to close at or around Dec 31, 2018, the deal will see CPA:17 being merged with and into a subsidiary of W. P. Carey. While the board of directors of both W. P. Carey and CPA:17 has given their nod for this transaction, its closure is now subject to approval from their stockholders.According to Jason Fox, W. P. Carey's chief executive officer, ""This transaction simplifies our business and effectively transforms W. P. Carey into a pure-play net lease REIT with earnings derived almost entirely from higher-multiple lease revenues"".Particularly, the higher-multiple real estate segment is estimated to generate around 96% of total pro forma AFFO, up from its current level of 83%. Moreover, the deal seems a strategic fit because it would increase tenant and industry diversification besides extending the weighted-average lease term to 10.4 years. Further, it would improve the overall credit profile, lower debt to gross assets, and is expected to place W. P. Carey with better capital access.Notably, New York-based W. P. Carey has an enterprise value of more than $10 billion and a portfolio of commercial real estate, aggregating 886 properties, spanning around 85 million square feet of space. On the other hand, CPA:17 is the largest fund advised by W. P. Carey and owns a high-quality, diversified, primarily net lease portfolio. Particularly, CPA:17’s portfolio includes 411 properties across 44 million square feet of space.The combined portfolio would have 26% of its total portfolio belonging to the office category, 24% industrial, and 19% each of warehouse and retail properties.

Therefore, with this authorization, the repurchase program now stands at $2 billion.Up till now, SL Green has repurchased 15,067,975 shares.According to the chief executive officer, Marc Holliday, the company continues to make the best use of its capital by buying back its common stock at considerable discounts compared with the value of its assets.SL Green has robust fundamentals to back its share repurchases. Notably, this reputed New York City-based landlord enjoys high-quality office properties, solid balance sheet as well as a diverse tenant base.Moreover, SL Green has been following an opportunistic investment policy to enhance its overall portfolio. This includes divesting its non-core assets and using the proceeds for share buybacks as well as long-term core asset acquisitions. The proceeds will also be used for investing in debt and preferred equities. Additionally, its leasing activity is likely to remain decent amid an improving economy and job market environment.The company observes stringent financial policies and has considerable access to capital. Also, it has manageable, well-balanced debt-expiry schedules. This will likely help the company sustain its dividend payout to equity investors.However, SL Green faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, and other commercial real estates, which limit its pricing power.

485,EXR,"Welltower Inc. (WELL  -  Free Report) has entered into a definitive agreement with its lessee and joint-venture (JV) partner — Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (BKD  -  Free Report) — for the comprehensive restructuring of the triple-net lease obligations on 63 communities of the latter. This move will significantly cut short Welltower’s association with Brookdale, as well as offer the former higher flexibility to form new JVs with preeminent senior housing operators. Importantly, Brookdale will pay $58 million in termination fees for the early suspension of its triple-net lease obligations on 37 communities. Nonetheless, it will continue to operate the properties until these are handed over to new operators. The firm will also sell 20% of its equity stake in the existing RIDEA JV with the senior housing operator, for a gross amount of $74.2 million. This indicates a per unit value of $189,000 and a cap rate of 7.2%.The lease discontinuance has enabled Welltower to enter into a separate RIDEA JV with Pegasus Senior Living, led by industry aces Steven Vick and Chris Hollister. Notably, the 37 properties will be managed by Pegasus through this alliance.Further, extending its relationship with Cogir, Welltower has transitioned the management of 12 properties through a JV with the operator. Cogir’s investment of $68.2 million represents a 15% stake in the venture.Moreover, 11 properties will be distributed amongst Welltower’s existing six operators. The remaining three non-core assets are slated to be sold in the tertiary markets.The companies have also entered into an agreement to improve the quality of the remaining Brookdale portfolio. The agreement will enable Brookdale to identify and sell numerous communities that have annual base rent of up to $5 million. Welltower will receive 6.25% in rent credit equating to sale proceeds of nearly $80 million. This will also enable Brookdale to increase the lease coverage of tis remaining portfolio.  All in all, the downscaling will effectively bring down Welltower's Brookdale concentration from 7.6% of in-place net operating income (NOI) to approximately 2.9%, on a pro-forma basis. Nonetheless, pro-forma lease coverage is expected to improve.  At present, the portfolio to be restructured is 83.6% occupied.Notably, management anticipates loss of income due to the operator restructuring to be nearly $5 million in the first year. This is expected to be recovered by the third year post the transition. In addition, this deal is projected to provide higher cash-flow growth opportunities.The above-mentioned transition will result in nominal volatility in Welltower’s income performance, courtesy the high-quality Brookdale portfolio, as well as some other reliable operators in its portfolio. Additionally, amid the heightening competition with national and local healthcare operators, such efforts will enable the company to improve property leasing and result in better management of its properties.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months.

Amid the ever-changing developments in new technology that could reduce demand for site leases and inflate expenses, such business diversification augurs well for long-term profitability.  The company has been making strategic buyouts to fortify its position as one of the largest fiber network operators in the United States. Its acquisition of LTS Group Holdings LLC in November 2017 enabled the company to gain around 32,000 route miles of fiber located mainly in top metro markets in the Northeast, including Boston, New York and Philadelphia. Further, such strategic deals offer higher opportunities for small-cell network deployments in these markets.Moreover, deployment of 5G aid wireless carriers to expand and improve their networks by providing coverage, capacity and speed which is needed to support mobile video, Internet of Things (IoT) and fixed wireless broadband. This, in turn, is anticipated to fuel revenues for Crown Castle’s tower and small cell assets.Additionally, a hike in the 2018 outlook by management in Q1 instills confidence in the company. The raised outlook primarily reflects the expected impact of the recently-signed customer agreements. Specifically, the company expects site-rental revenues of $4,639-$4,684 million, denoting a projected increase of $57 million at the mid-point from the previously issued outlook. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the band of $3,097-$3,142 million, reflecting an uptick of $48 million at the mid-point. In addition, AFFO is guided in the band of $2,255-$2,300 million, marking a rise of $36 million at the mid-point.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past year. Crown Castle has gained 5.1%, while the industry has declined 2.2%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share has remained unchanged in a month’s time.However, further advancement of technology is expected to reduce demand for site leases. In fact, recent developments in satellite-delivered radio and video services will likely reduce need for tower-based broadcast transmission, while changes in demand for network services might expose Crown Castle’s revenues to volatility. Moreover, as mobile handset manufacturers and wireless carriers increasingly adopt the Voice over WiFi network technology, its revenues are feared to be impacted.In addition to the above, high customer concentration remains a headwind. While the company’s top four customers — Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile — account for majority of its total revenue, AT&T contributes a handful of site rental revenues. Hence, loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly impact the company’s top line.Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same space include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Columbia Property Trust, Inc. (CXP  -  Free Report) and Extra Space Storage (EXR  -  Free Report).

Nonetheless, if the transaction is completed after Oct 15, 2018, EdR stockholders will be entitled to receive 0.435 cents per share of per diem amount for each day from Oct 15 until the closing date.This deal, subject to fulfilment of customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the second half of 2018. The merger is also conditioned upon the approval of EdR’s stockholders, who are yet to vote on the will transaction at a special meeting. However, the transaction is not contingent on receipt of financing by Greystar.Per the terms of the deal, Greystar, in a joint venture with the real-estate unit of Blackstone, will also buy a portfolio of EdR’s off-campus student housing assets situated adjacent to best-in-class university campuses. The real-estate unit of Blackstone will acquire a portfolio of income-generating properties, worth $10 billion, concentrated in the U.S markets offering decent growth opportunities. Furthermore, the Greystar-led fund has acquired a letter of commitment for the debt financing of the merger from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. — a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report).The above-mentioned alliance will enable EdR to maximize the company’s shareholders’ value by providing an impressive premium over its share price.

488,EXR,"Shares of Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report) have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past three months. The company’s shares have gained 10.8%, while the industry recorded 5% growth, during this time period.Notably, there are enough reasons to expect a solid upside for this self-storage REIT stock. Particularly, the earnings outlook and fundamentals of Extra Space Storage appear assertive enough to drive its stock higher in the near term.The company has been making concerted efforts to expand its business around large population centers and diversify geographically. Extra Space Storage has significantly expanded its business in recent years, growing its branded store count from 694 in 2008 to 1,523 in first-quarter 2018. Also, total stores managed for third-party owners increased from 185 in 2011 to 456 in the reported quarter.Moreover, over the past five years, Extra Space Storage acquired $4.5 billion in properties. The company gained an elevated scale in several core markets on the back of these acquisitions, as well as fortified its presence in a number of new markets.As a result, this Salt Lake City, UT-based self-storage REIT emerged as the second largest self-storage operator, as well as the largest self-storage management company in the United States. Majority of this REIT’s stores are situated around large population centers which enjoy above-average population and income demographics for stores.In addition, the self-storage asset category is basically need-based and recession-resilient in nature. This asset class has low capital expenditure requirements and generates high operating margins. Additionally, the self-storage industry is likely to continue experiencing solid demand, backed by favorable demographic changes, and events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce.Extra Space Storage enjoyed a historical cash flow growth (3-5 years) of 27.9%, which comfortably exceeded the industry’s growth of 17.3%. Additionally, the company’s current cash flow growth of 16.3% is way ahead of the industry’s rate of 6.2%.Also, its Return on Equity (ROE) is 18.9% compared with the industry’s average of 4.9%. This reflects that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry. Further, the company remains committed to boost shareholders’ wealth. It has achieved five-year total increase of a whopping 212% in dividend.Moreover, in May, ushering in good news for its shareholders, Extra Space Storage announced a 10.3% hike in its quarterly cash dividend. The company will now pay a dividend of 86 cents per share, up from 78 cents paid earlier. The raised dividend will be paid on Jun 29, to shareholders of record as of Jun 15, 2018.  Such shareholder-friendly efforts are encouraging.Furthermore, the industry is characterized by fragmented ownership, and only around 20% of the total self-storage square footage is under REIT’s ownership. This creates solid scope for consolidation at some level in the future and with a solid balance sheet, Extra Space Storage remains well poised to compete for acquisitions.Moreover, the trend in estimate revisions indicates a solid earnings outlook for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share has witnessed 0.4% upward revision in a month’s time. Given its progress on the fundamentals, the stock is likely to perform well in the quarters ahead.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors can also consider other similarly-ranked stocks in the real estate space like Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

489,EXR,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) has undertaken strategic portfolio-repositioning measures in a bid to improve the quality of its senior housing portfolio and lower the Brookdale Senior Living Inc. operator concentration. The company, recently, provided an update about such efforts and it seems right on track to achieve its target.Particularly, HCP has reaped $332 million of proceeds through completion of the disposition of its residual investment in the RIDEA II senior housing joint venture (JV) to an investor group led by Columbia Pacific Advisors, LLC. Notably, this JV owned 49 communities and 46 of them were managed by Brookdale.Regarding the Brookdale 25 asset sales, the company noted that it has already accomplished the disposition of five communities for $32 million and is under contract to sell another 15 communities for $98 million. Slated to take place in three separate deals, these transactions are likely to be completed by the third quarter of 2018. The remaining five assets are expected to be either sold or transitioned this year too.Further, with regard to the Master Transactions and Cooperation Agreement (MTCA), HCP announced a deal to sell or transition 68 Brookdale communities in November 2017. Of this, the company has already clinched a deal for the sale of a portfolio of 22 Brookdale-managed senior housing communities, for $428 million, to an institutional investor. Subject to customary closing norms and regulatory license transfer nods, this deal is likely to be completed by the third quarter.Further, the company opted for transition of management of a portfolio of 24 HCP-owned senior housing communities from Brookdale to Atria Senior Living, Inc., and has already transitioned 18 of those. Another community has been transitioned to existing operating partner — Sonata Senior Living. For the rest 21 Brookdale-managed communities, the company is settling deals to transition to other operators and opting for sale of select assets.These efforts are expected to benefit HCP’s senior housing portfolio in a number of ways. Specifically, the operator diversification of the portfolio will improve as the company is targeting to lower Brookdale exposure to 16% of overall portfolio income from 34% in fourth-quarter 2016.  The revamped portfolio will have stronger demographics, while the company’s balance sheet is likely to strengthen with the sale proceeds.In fact, over time, with the diligent measures, the company aims at having more than half of its business comprising specialty office segments of medical office and life science, and lower senior housing concentration to around 40%. The focus on having a diversified private pay portfolio is likely to drive long-term growth.HCP currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

490,EXR,"Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report), along with its operating partnership subsidiary, has entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with various investors, for a private placement of 4.39% senior unsecured notes worth $300 million, to be issued by the operating partnership.  The notes, subject to the fulfillment of customary closing conditions, are expected to be issued on Jul 17, 2018. The notes will mature on July 17, 2028, and pay semi-annual interests on Jan 17 and Jul 17 each year.All of these notes are guaranteed by Extra Space Storage.The operating partnership intends to utilize the proceeds from this agreement to refinance its existing indebtedness.  The remaining proceeds from the issue will be channelized for general corporate purposes.Per management, this move is a strategic fit to further ladder the company’s debt maturities, reduce secured debt and expand size of unencumbered pool of properties. Further, access to capital from various sources will improve diversity of its balance sheet and maintain an impressive growth trajectory.The company exited first-quarter 2018 with lower liquidity as compared to Dec 31, 2017. In fact, its cash and cash equivalents of roughly $35.5 million was lower than $55.7 million reported at the end of 2017. Also, its percentage of fixed-rate debt to total debt was 74.4%. Hence, these efforts will strengthen its balance sheet.Importantly, the above-mentioned move provides flexibility to the company and helps meet its financial obligations efficiently. This is because the unsecured note issuance offers capital at lower cost to the real estate investment trust (REIT). Furthermore, reduction of secured debt is anticipated to bring down the company’s annualized interest expenses significantly. The move will improve the company’s cash flow and alleviate its bottom-line pressure as well.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed the industry it belongs to over the past year.  In fact, the company’s shares have logged in a gain of 30.8% compared with 1.3% growth recorded by the industry.Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Lamar Advertising Company (LAMR  -  Free Report) and Prologis, Inc.

492,EXR,"Mack-Cali Realty Corporation (CLI  -  Free Report) enjoys a strong presence in high barrier-to-entry markets and has been focusing on the waterfront and transit-oriented office properties. Further, large commercial tenant base and diversification into the apartment sector is expected to drive its long-term growth.Nevertheless, elevated expenses and the dilutive impact on earnings from huge asset sales remain concerns for the company. Rate hikes also add to its woes.Notably, Mack-Cali, with around 750 commercial tenants from diverse industries, enjoys a dominant presence in high barrier-to-entry markets in the United States, especially in the Northeast region. A diversified tenant base helps the company to enjoy a steady revenue stream while avoiding shortcomings related to any particular sector.Further, Mack-Cali has been making concerted efforts in recent years to transform from a sub-urban office real estate investment trust (REIT) to a residential and geographically-focused office REIT. The company announced a three-year strategic initiative in September 2015. The initiative is aimed at transforming the company into a more concentrated owner of New Jersey Hudson River waterfront and transit-oriented office properties as well as a regional owner of luxury multi-family residential properties.The company is targeting an increased lease percentage for office portfolio and aiming to curb expenses in office operations as well as reduce debt levels. Further, Mack-Cali is focusing on upgrading its present amenities and improving offerings with major capital investment programs. With such strategic efforts, the company plans to improve cash flow and achieve better margins in both office and multi-family apartment portfolios while strengthening its balance sheet position. Such efforts augur well for its long-term growth.Also, shares of Mack-Cali have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. Its shares have gained 14.3% compared with 4.6% growth recorded by the industry. Moreover, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share remaining stable in a month’s time. However, as part of portfolio-streamlining efforts, Mack-Cali has been aggressively disposing of its assets. The company completed $528-million property sales in 2017, and in first-quarter 2018, it accomplished the disposition of 20 properties, comprising 1.7 million square feet of space, for $232 million. Further, the company expects additional dispositions of $170 million to be completed by the end of the year. In fact, it anticipates $375-$425 million of dispositions for full-year 2018. This will mark the completion of the company’s major disposition program. Sales will occur on a select one-off basis in future. While these measures are strategically fit for the long run, the dilutive impact on earnings from such huge asset sales cannot be bypassed in the near term.Moreover, Mack-Cali continues to pursue multi-family residential investments. While this strategy is encouraging from the long-term perspective, it involves significant upfront operating expenses and hence, limits the company’s growth momentum.Also, any hike in interest rate can pose a challenge for Mack-Cali. This is because the company’s ability to refinance existing debt would be restricted while the interest cost on new debt would increase. This could adversely impact the company’s financial results and consequently dent its dividend payout.Mark-Cali currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
