0,ZBH,"Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria didn't just devastate Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico: Medtech players Medtronic (MDT), K2M Group (KTWO) and Wright Medical Group (WMGI) were flailing in the headwinds on Monday.XIn afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's 116-company Medical-Products industry group, which Medtronic leads by market cap, fell a collective 1.1% after K2M and Medtronic acknowledged the impact the hurricanes had on their quarterly metrics.But they won't be alone, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro wrote in a note to clients. News reports indicate 70% of Puerto Rico's hospitals were not operational at the end of the third quarter. Those that were operational may not have been running at full capacity, he said.""We assume two lost weeks of procedures at the end of the third quarter (in Puerto Rico) for device manufacturers,"" he said. ""Also, we conservatively estimate that no elective procedures will be performed in Puerto Rico in the fourth quarter.""On Friday, Medtronic said it expected a $250 million impact to both revenue and earnings in its fiscal second quarter. The firm said it's too early to determine whether there will be an impact in the latter half of the year. At least three analysts cut their price targets on the stock.K2M followed Medtronic on Monday, pre-announcing negative Q3 results and sustaining at least two price-target haircuts. For the quarter, K2M expects to report $62.7 million in sales, up 6% vs. the year-earlier period, but below analysts' views for $67 million.The firm also trimmed its 2017 sales outlook to $255 million to $257 million, which would grow 8% to 9%.Shares of K2M were among those hardest hit in the Medical-Products group, plunging 18.4% to close at 17.77 Monday. Wright, NuVasive (NUVA) and Globus Medical (GMED), which make medical implants, dove a respective 5.2%, 4.9% and 3.9%.But Novarro says there could be opportunities for investors in NuVasive and Wright. NuVasive is capable of accelerating organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and 2018, and Wright has a strong product portfolio plus operating-margin expansion opportunities, he said.""We expect management teams to cut guidance due to hurricane-related revenue shortfalls, which the sell-off over the past several weeks is already discounting,"" he said. ""While NuVasive and Wright are each dealing with specific short-term issues, the setup for 2018 looks attractive.""In a separate report after K2M's pre-announcement, Novarro noted that investor sentiment on spine stocks remains negative. He cut his price target on K2M to 22 from 26, but kept his outperform rating and said he would be a buyer on any pullback in the stock. The worst is already priced in, he argued.Needham analyst Mike Matson is more bearish still on spine players. Outside of the hurricanes, K2M was impacted by weaker degenerative and deformity procedure growth in August and September, Matson wrote in a note to clients. It's likely Globus and NuVasive will miss estimates in the third quarter.Matson lowered his 2017 view on K2M to $256 million from $267 million. For 2018, he now sees $279 million, down from earlier expectations for $300 million. He also trimmed his price target on K2M to 27 from 29, though kept his strong-buy rating.Medtronic toppled to an eight-month low Monday on a series of price-target cuts after it announced Hurricane Maria's damage in Puerto Rico could hit earnings and revenue by up to $250 million. Also last week, Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) said the hurricanes will be a headwind against its third-quarter earnings.Novarro expects Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) to chip away at sales of Medtronic's implantable heart devices. Several newly launched products are on back-order status or had lower inventory levels before the hurricane, the firm said in a press release.IBD'S TAKE: Medtronic has an IBD Composite Rating of 48 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it underperforms more than half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at stronger performers.""Competitors may be able to take advantage of such a supply shortage, which is hard to quantify at this stage,"" Novarro said. ""Therefore, we see downside risk to both revenue and (earnings) guidance for the second half of 2018.""For the second fiscal quarter, Novarro trimmed his model to $6.8 billion in sales and 92 cents earnings per share, down from $7.05 billion and $1.07.Novarro also slashed his views for fiscal 2018-19. For 2018, he models $28.9 billion in sales and $4.55 earnings per share. He forecasts $5.13 in EPS on $29.8 billion in sales in fiscal 2019. This resulted in his price target cut to 85 from 90, though Novarro kept his outperform rating.At least two other analysts cut their price targets on Medtronic stock. Wells Fargo downgraded Medtronic to a market perform from outperform. Medtronic toppled 3.6% to finish at 76.93.Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) appeared to sustain ""minimal damage"" to its Janssen unit Gurabo facility, which makes Remicade, Xarelto, Prezista and a number of other drugs, according to UBS analyst Carter Gould, who viewed satellite images of the facilities.""Based on utilization of most of the lots on site it appears that activity is returning to the facility,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Fellow drugmaker Amgen (AMGN) had visible damage to the roofs of two buildings and flooding on an access road to a manufacturing site in Puerto Rico. But by Oct. 4, both roofs appeared to have been fixed and the parking lots were at 80% capacity, Gould said.Amgen confirmed to Gould it's using diesel generators on site and contracted fuel providers have been making shipments. In the meantime, the first shipment from its inventory on Puerto Rico has already flown off the island, Gould said.It's unlikely the Food and Drug Administration will require an inspection before allowing Amgen to restart production.""While we would ultimately expect some accounting charge related to this, we are incrementally less concerned on potential disruptions to product supply,"" he said.RELATED:Medtronic Sinks After Sales Lag, Though Earnings Beat ViewsThis Robotics Player Neared 1,000, Then Toppled — Here's WhyThis Drug Bellwether's Sales Miss Actually Bodes Well For The Sector

1,ZBH,"David Dvorak's departure from Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) is likely to excite the stock, analysts said after the chief executive's exit was announced alongside disappointing second-quarter metrics on Tuesday.Needham analyst Mike Matson called the second-quarter disappointment Dvorak's ""third strike.""""Zimmer noted that while the troubled plant in Warsaw, Ind., increased output in the second quarter, production of certain brands still fell short of expectations and it had trouble recovering the market share it lost in prior months,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Still, Matson kept his strong buy rating and 153 price target on Zimmer stock.Zimmer Biomet stock dipped a fraction to 126.36 on the stock market today. Earlier in the trading session, it was up as much as 2%. Shares remained in a buy zone after hitting a 125.52 buy point in early June out of a cup-with-handle base that began forming in October.Dvorak has headed up Zimmer since May 2007. His departure follows the recent exits of other managers, including a senior vice president and a vice president of quality assurance. In the interim, senior vice president and chief financial officer Dan Florin will take Dvorak's place.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro imagines Zimmer looking outside the firm to recruit a new chief executive officer. The search could span two to three quarters, he said.IBD'S TAKE: Zimmer stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 79, meaning it has outperformed more than three-quarters of all stocks in key growth metrics over the past 12 months. See better-rated stocks at IBD Stock Checkup.The announcement of Dvorak's exit followed a disappointing second-quarter pre-announcement. For the period, Zimmer reported $1.95 billion in sales, down a fraction year over year.Zimmer also said it expects adjusted income to come in at the low end of its $2.08-$2.13 per share guidance. The company didn't adjust its 2017 guidance, though Novarro is uncertain the company will meet its initial guide.""Given continued supply issues, uncertainty associated with leadership changes and a recent lack of new product innovation, we no longer have confidence in management's guidance for a return to market revenue growth in the second half of 2017,"" he wrote.Novarro has an outperform rating and 140 price target on Zimmer stock.RELATED:This Medtech Stock Crashed Below 3 Technical Levels; Can It Get Up?

2,ZBH,"Bellwether Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) second-quarter report bodes well for the biotech sector, an analyst said Tuesday, after the Dow component topped profit expectations and narrowly lagged sales views.On the stock market today, J&J stock climbed 1.8% to 134.46, as biotech stocks dropped nearly 1% as a group. Generic drugmakers inched down 0.3%.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges remains bullish on the biotech sector and Needham analyst Mike Matson says J&J's second-quarter results point to a stable period for medtech players like Boston Scientific (BSX), Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH).During the quarter, J&J's drug sales grew 4.7% sequentially, though they fell 2.6% vs. the year-earlier period. Porges partially blamed a one-time positive rebate adjustment in 2016 which eliminated 4% of year-over-year volume/price growth in the second quarter.Sales of J&J's immunosuppressant Remicade declined 14% year over year. But rivalry from biosimilars contributed to just 5% of that decline, which is lower than guidance for a 10%-15% decline in 2017, Porges wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Cancer and rare-disease specialists are expected to do well in the second half of 2017 as positive sentiment returns to the biotech space. Visit IBD's Industry Snapshot for a look at who may outperform in the second quarter.J&J also expects currency headwinds to subside in the second half of 2017 and called for acceleration in its pharmaceutical unit as well as positive trends in sales outside the U.S. Based on the presumed currency impacts, the firm raised its outlook for adjusted profits to $7.12-$7.22 a share.Outside the U.S., drug sales grew 7% sequentially in the second quarter, beating views for 3% growth, Porges said.""(This) supports our expectations for sequential outside-U.S. revenue growth for our companies due to a weakening dollar in the second quarter,"" he said.Porges expects guidance increases for biotechs during the second quarter. Earlier in the week, he called for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to easily beat June quarter sales views and for Gilead Sciences (GILD) to handily top profit expectations.""Our covered companies will not be negatively impacted by the same prior period adjustments as J&J, and those with current or imminent biosimilar competition may surprise consensus if the Remicade market dynamics can be viewed as a proxy,"" he said.AbbVie (ABBV) could see some pain, though. Sales of cancer drug Imbruvica grew 40% in the U.S. and 64% outside the U.S., J&J said. J&J is partnered with AbbVie on Imbruvica in the U.S. J&J typically books 40% of U.S. Imbruvica sales, Porges said. This translates to about $501 million for AbbVie's Imbruvica sales.This would be a ""miss vs. consensus of $514 million and our estimate of $537 million,"" he said. ""For AbbVie, Imbruvica is considered the largest growth driver beyond the Humira patent cliff, but continued missed consensus expectations repeated in the second quarter would be a negative for the stock.""RELATED:'Stars Align' For These Biotechs To Crush Earnings ConsensusThese 2 Drug Giants In Buy Range Just Beat Earnings ViewsHow Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its Rivals

3,ZBH,"Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) shares gapped down sharply Thursday despite beating first-quarter forecasts, after the musculoskeletal device maker shrank guidance for the year.The orthopedic device maker now expects full-year revenue to rise 2%-3% to $7.835 billion to $7.915 billion for 2017, notching down prior outlook for $7.855 billion to $7.930 billion. And the upper end of adjusted per-share profit got a significant haircut; it now sees $8.50 to $8.60 vs. previous views for $8.50 to $8.68.Analysts are currently forecasting $8.60 EPS on $7.887 billion in revenue.Zimmer's shares plunged as low as 115 on the stock market today, tumbling from a six-month high to below a 120.51 entry point from a cup-with-handle base and gapping below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. But Zimmer pared losses to a still-hefty 5.8% at 118.10, close to session highs.For the first quarter, the Warsaw, Ind.-based company posted a 6.5% profit gain to $2.13 a share on 4% revenue growth to $1.98 billion, topping estimates for $2.11 a share and $1.96 billion in sales.Ahead of its earnings report, Zimmer had been pegged by RBC analysts as a hot medtech stock to own, alongside Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and others.RELATED:Which Medtech Stocks Should You Buy Ahead Of Q1?Medtronic, Edwards Among Five Best 'Stocks To Own': Analyst
"
4,ZBH,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) are medtech stocks to own going into earnings season, but several others could be put on buy lists on pullbacks, an analyst says.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said Wednesday that among large-cap medtech stocks, Johnson and Zimmer offer the best risk/reward into the first-quarter earnings season. Zimmer is the cheapest in its arena and Johnson has lagged the group.""While investor sentiment has turned more favorable for Johnson in recent weeks, we anticipate further multiple expansion on the back of strong first-quarter results, and consensus estimates moving higher throughout the year,"" he wrote in a research report.The consensus of analysts polled by Yahoo (YHOO) broadly expects Johnson to report $18.01 billion in sales, up 3% year over year, and $1.76 a share in adjusted earnings, dipping 1.7%.Johnson is also on the cusp of closing its acquisition of Actelion Pharmaceuticals in the second quarter. It and Sanofi (SNY) were locked in a battle late last year to take over the Swiss biotech. Johnson's $30 billion bid won it the company.For Zimmer, the company ""just has to hit consensus estimates for the stock to move higher,"" Novarro said. The consensus models 3% year-over-year sales growth to $1.96 billion and $2.11 adjusted earnings per share, up 4.5%.Novarro, however, says Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Boston Scientific (BSX), Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and Stryker (SYK) may be attractive on pullbacks. He sees all delivering solid results and reaffirming 2017 guidance. Investors will likely track ongoing litigation for Abbott with Alere (ALR), and heart-valve replacement sales for Edwards.Boston likely will comment on its voluntary recall of its Lotus heart-valve replacement. The company recalled the Lotus device after discovering a malfunction that resulted in the premature release of a pin during implantation.""Medtronic's (MDT) Onyx stent launch represents near-term challenges"" for Boston, but ""we still want to own Boston for 2018,"" Novarro said.In the small- and midsize-cap world, Novarro recommends NuVasive (NUVA), Wright Medical Group (WMGI) and K2M Group (KTWO). The potential for a takeout is likely baked into the stock prices for NuVasive and Wright, he said.IBD'S TAKE: This isn't the first time Edwards has been listed as a best ""stock to own."" Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive on why Edwards is holding strong.K2M remains his top pick in the small-and-midsize medtech group.""We expect K2M to play catch-up to the group as investor focus shifts to the company's impressive new product lineup and improving international sales growth after the company experienced some distributor issues in 2016,"" he wrote.Like Novarro, Needham analyst Mike Matson also prefers K2M and Zimmer, but also has strong buy ratings on shares of Inogen (INGN) and MiMedx (MDXG). He sees the cardiovascular and orthopedic markets as slowing while the diagnostic market improved in the quarter.Matson models cardiovascular market growth as decelerating to 6.3% from 7.3% in the fourth quarter, and the orthopedic market advancing by 3.5%, vs. 4% growth in the prior quarter. In diagnostics, sales likely grew 3.6% from 2.1%, he said.But there were some standouts, Matson said. He models the transcatheter aortic valve-replacement market — where Boston, Edwards and Medtronic operate — as having grown 23%. In orthopedics, Matson models 9% growth for the extremities market.RELATED:Medtronic Does Heart-Valve Study And Rivals Reap The BenefitsBoston Scientific Makes Acquisition To Battle Medtronic, Edwards
"
5,ZBH,"Medtronic (MDT) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) stocks dipped Monday despite a series of bullish reports, including one that called the heart-valve replacement rivals ""stocks to own near term.""In midday trading,Shares of Medtronic ended virtually flat at 81.03 on the stock market today while Edwards closed up 0.3% at 95.87. But RBC analyst Glenn Novarro expects both to have strong catalysts in the near term.In a note to clients Sunday, Novarro said he sees Edwards, Medtronic, Stryker (SYK), Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) and K2M Group (KTWO) as ""stocks to own near term."" He calls Edwards and Medtronic the ""best ideas in cardiovascular."" Both work in heart-valve replacements.A recent study by Medtronic, showing that a new method of inserting a heart valve could be superior to open-heart surgery, is encouraging, Novarro said. The results could help stoke growth in the transcatheter aortic valve replacement market, he said.Check Out The IBD Best Mutual Fund AwardsFollowing Novarro's report, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar upgraded Edwards stock to a buy rating and raised his price target to 110 from 98.50. Needham analyst Mike Matson reiterated his buy rating and 91 price target on Medtronic stock.Matson expects Medtronic to maintain mid-single-digit sales growth and double-digit earnings growth after overcoming ""temporary"" product cycle and competitive issues in the fiscal third quarter.""We believe Medtronic's product cycle remains very strong and that it can effectively fend off competitive product launches despite investor concerns,"" Matson wrote in a note to clients.Medtronic competes against Edwards Lifesciences, a smaller outfit, in heart-valve replacements. Boston Scientific (BSX) also is looking to break into the transcatheter aortic valve replacement market in the U.S., but doesn't yet have FDA approval.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific is working to catch up with Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences via a strategic acquisition. Read on in Sector Leaders.Over the next 18 months, Medtronic has a number of launches that should help boost growth. The company sees strong growth in its emerging markets segment, which makes up 14% of total sales and has seen double-digit growth in recent quarters.""We believe Medtronic can sustain double-digit growth in these markets, driven by market development, channel optimization and public/private partnerships,"" Matson said. Saudi Arabia should see a return to growth soon.RBC's Novarro expects Medtronic to continue gaining share in the implantable cardioverter defibrillator market. The devices are used to manage tachycardia. He expects transcatheter aortic valve replacements and drug-coated balloons to perform well in 2017.Novarro calls for in-line to slightly better first- and second-quarter metrics for Edwards. He expects Medtronic's launch of its CoreValve Evolut-R to drive growth also for Edwards' Sapien XT.Both devices are transcatheter aortic valve implants for patients with hardened heart valves unable to undergo open-heart surgery. Novarro recommends owning Edwards stock going into the second half of 2017 on expectation for market growth.Evercore's Kumar notes that Edwards stock is a growth stock and therefore volatile by nature.""With lowered investor expectations, we believe Edwards shares are poised for a 'catch-up' trade and offer asymmetric risk-reward at current levels,"" he wrote in a research report. He sees 15% upside at current stock levels.Kumar was previously sidelined on Edwards stock with competition from Boston Scientific in international markets. But Boston pulled its Lotus valve off the market in late February, giving Edwards ""its first break in six months.""Still, the companies are likely at a patent standoff until the first half of 2018.RELATED:Medtronic Does Heart-Valve Study, And Rivals Reap The BenefitsBoston Scientific Wins In Patent Battle Vs.

6,ZBH,"Fake News: For eight  years, it was virtually impossible to get reporters interested in legitimate Obama administration scandals. Now, they are so eager to run scandal stories about the incoming Trump administration that they are making them up.Two stories from major news outlets demonstrate this.First is the New York Times hit piece on Trump's pick for Energy Secretary, Rick Perry. It claimed that until days after Perry accepted the job, he ""knew almost nothing about"" the fact that a key function of the Energy Department is the stewardship of the nation's nuclear arsenal.The story spread like wildfire, with journalists falling over each other to tweet out clever Perry put downs.What was the Times' alarming claim based on? Nothing more than a twisted interpretation of a single quote from one person: Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who was canned from the Trump transition team before Perry was picked. McKenna himself has since said the Times misinterpreted what he said.Apparently, the Times reporters and editors were so eager to get this bogus story out before Perry's nomination hearings started that they didn't bother to read the statement Perry himself issued on the day he accepted the nomination: ""I look forward to engaging in a conversation about the development, stewardship and regulation of our energy resources, safeguarding our nuclear arsenal, and promoting an American energy policy that creates jobs and puts America first."" (Emphasis added.)Does that sound like someone who didn't know about this part of the Energy Department's portfolio?The story was so egregiously wrong that even the liberal New York magazine took the Times to task for spreading a false rumor.Just days before, CNN ran a hit piece on Rep. Tom Price — Trump's pick to head the Health and Human Services Department — for supposedly engaging in insider trading last year.A ""bombshell"" story published on Tuesday — titled ""First on CNN: Trump's pick invested in company, then introduced a bill to help it"" — said Price had bought as much as $15,000 worth of shares in Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), a company that makes knee and hip replacements. Then, the story goes, he introduced the HIP Act, which would have delayed an ObamaCare regulation that would, if implemented, hurt Zimmer Biomet and other device makers.This, CNN reporter Manu Raju asserted, raised ""new concerns among ethics experts that Price may have inappropriately used inside information while purchasing shares in a company.""""When you look at the timeline, this raises significant questions,"" CNN's Erin Burnett said about the story.Sen. Charles Schumer responded to the CNN report with a call to delay Price's confirmation hearings until the congressional ethics office does a ""thorough investigation.""It's not as though this sort of self-dealing hasn't gone on in Washington. Peter Schweizer's 2011 book, ""Throw Them All Out,"" was full of such examples, including lucrative stock trades by Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry and other prominent Democrats. Schweizer's book led to the STOCK Act in 2012, which tried to combat insider trading by lawmakers.But the only ""significant questions"" CNN's story about Price raises have to do with CNN's credibility as a news source.It's worth noting at the outset that the HIP Act had zero chance of making it into law. In fact, it didn't even make it out of committee, and would have been promptly vetoed if it had managed to make it to President Obama's desk. Anyone involved with the legislation at the time would have known this, including Price. (Congressmen introduce bills all the time that they know aren't going anywhere.)The rest of the CNN story falls apart with just a cursory look at the facts.First, Price didn't buy those shares. His portfolio was managed by Morgan Stanley, which designed the account's investment strategy and directed all trades. As part of a routine rebalancing of Price's account in early 2016, Morgan Stanley bought 26 shares in Zimmer Biomet, worth a grand total of $2,697.74. (Price's net worth is on the order of $10 million.)The timing of that transaction doesn't implicate Price in any way, either. Morgan Stanley bought those shares in mid-March, but didn't tell Price about that trade, or any of the others it made during its rebalancing, until April 4.That was nearly two weeks after Price introduced the HIP Act, which, because everyone knew it was a dead letter, had no impact on Zimmer Biomet's stock price anyway.In other words, there is no story here, much less a scandal.The fact that CNN pretended that there was one says nothing about Price's ethics. It does, however, say plenty about the blatant partisan bias of today's ""independent"" press.NOTE: This was updated to include the New York Times story about Rick Perry.RELATED:Fake News: Trump Did Not Mock Disabled Reporter And Other Lies From The LeftThe Washington Post Takes Anti-Trump Bias To A New LevelMedia Misreport Gallup Poll Results About Trump's Abilities

7,ZBH,"Stocks bled again on Thursday, and losses were weighted more heavily in technology and certain medical sectors.Meanwhile, long-term government bond prices rose on both sides of the pond, sending the yield on the U.S. 10-year bond to around 1.8%. The 10-year U.K. bond yield edged back below 1.20% to around 1.18%, according to Tradeweb, after British judges ruled that only the U.K. Parliament can formally begin the process of the country's exit from the EU.Commodities fell, led by a 1.2% slide in West Texas intermediate crude oil futures to $44.78 a barrel. Gold edged 0.4% lower on the Comex, while silver slid 1.9%.The Nasdaq 100 fell 1%, a touch worse than the 0.9% drop by the Nasdaq composite.Apple (AAPL) fell slightly more than 1% to 109.83, dipping back below its 110.33 cup-with-handle breakout point for the first time since its Sept. 14 breakout in towering volume. That's a sell signal. Watch to see if the stock can hold close to that proper entry and begin a fresh rebound.With the market still in a pressured uptrend and distribution still heavy recently on both key indexes, it's not a surprise that other growth stocks have joined Apple in stumbling back near or below their prime entry points, especially in the field of medical devices.Abiomed (ABMD), down 1.6% to 102.51, has fallen nearly 30% in just four weeks. The heart pump innovator is back below a 105.05 cup-with-handle entry.Also in the medical sector, artificial joint replacement maker Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) edged 0.5% higher to 102.54, but only after having fallen more than 20% below its 52-week high; it's now hovering near 102, roughly 3% below a 105.58 entry in a long bottoming base. Zimmer earlier this week plummeted 14% after reporting a 9% rise in Q3 earnings to $1.79 a share. That marked the second quarter in a row of decelerating profit growth.Sales rose just 4% after the Warsaw, Ind., firm notched gains of 59%, 58%, 68% and 66% in the prior four quarters, thanks to a merger with Biomet that completed in June 2015.The S&P 500 dropped 0.4% as generic drug, medical services, drug wholesale, biotech and gaming stocks paced the decline. The Dow Jones industrials lost 0.2%. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is another market leader that has recently drifted back to prior buy point. In the regular session, the stock gained 1.8% to 43.37, returning back above a recent flat-base buy point at 43.25. The stock is also trying to reclaim its 50-day moving average.Wall Street saw the video game creator's quarterly profit doubling to 42 cents a share on a 51% pickup in revenue to $1.57 billion. After the close, Activision met that consensus estimate and exceeded its prior outlook of $1.49 billion, while non-GAAP earnings vaulted to 49 cents, crushing Wall Street's view by nearly 17%.The company reported 482 million monthly active users who logged more than 10 billion hours of play during the three-month period. CEO Bobby Kotick noted in a news release that its newest futuristic battle game franchise, ""Overwatch,"" has ""incredible player engagement"" and has topped 20 million players in four months.Activision also forecast Q4 net revenue at $1.86 billion, up 38% vs.  year ago. The stock initially fell nearly 3% in extended-hours trading but later rebounded to nearly break-even.Elsewhere in the stock market today, solar firms got trampled after former huge market winner First Solar (FSLR) reported a 46% plunge in third-quarter sales to $688 million, its worst year-over-year decline in more than three years.Earnings beat Wall Street views, yet still dropped 64% to $1.22 a share. The stock tanked 15% to 34.51, notching the lowest level since April 2013.Starbucks (SBUX), down 2% to 51.77, gained more than 1% after hours following news that the coffeehouse chain posted a 16% rise in non-GAAP earnings to 56 cents a share, including 6 cents stemming from an extra week of operation in the September-ended fourth quarter. Revenue grew 16% to $5.7 billion, and the company opened 690 net new stores, raising the total to 25,085 in 75 countries.The stock has been struggling since gapping lower on April 22 and losing support at both its 50- and 200-day moving averages.

8,ZBH,"Three medical device companies with Composite Ratings in the top 10% of all stocks were building on recent gains with strong quarters Thursday morning.Cardiac device giant Boston Scientific (BSX) hit a 10-year high in early trading Thursday after its Q2 sales growth and guidance beat expectations, making up for weaker-than-expected margins.Boston Scientific's sales grew 15% over the year-earlier quarter to $2.12 billion, its strongest growth in nearly a decade and more than $50 million above analysts' consensus. It also added some $150 million to its full-year sales guidance, implying an 11% increase over last year.""Boston Scientific outperformed across the board, beating revenue estimates in all of its businesses and driving organic sales growth acceleration in all businesses and all geographies except Cardiology and emerging markets, where 2Q16 organic sales growth was stable vs. 1Q16,"" wrote Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy in a research note.She noted that gross margins were weaker than expected, which was why EPS of 27 cents a share was merely in line with views despite the top-line beat. The company did add a penny to its full-year EPS guidance, however, which she sees as a promise of margin expansion.Boston Scientific stock, holding an excellent Composite Rating of 97, hit 24.79 in early trading on the stock market today, its highest point since February 2006. At the close Thursday, shares were up 2.9% to 24.34.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific's strong financial and stock performance has put it at No. 8 on IBD's Big Cap 20, a list of growth stocks too big for the volatility associated with smaller growth stocks.Another medical device stock, Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), hit an all-time high Thursday after it also topped expectations and raised guidance. Gross margins missed expectations also, but the company has managed to trim its tax bill and says that foreign-exchange headwinds will be softer than initially feared, which along with strong sales growth drove a hike in its full-year earnings guidance.Zimmer's sales have grown upward of 50% in the last four quarters thanks to acquisitions, but on a pro forma basis its guidance implies 3% to 3.5% growth this year.Zimmer stock peaked at 129.58 in early trading Thursday, and ended the day up 3.9% to 127.47. Its Composite Rating is 96.Finally, heart-pump maker Abiomed (ABMD) also reported a strong quarter, which marked a return to profit growth after two negative quarters.Abiomed stock nonetheless dipped, which analyst Antalffy warned might be the case in a note before the market opened.""This quarterly performance should drive share outperformance today from a fundamental perspective, but we would note that investor expectations going into these results were high, which could mitigate some of the potential outperformance,"" she wrote.Abiomed shares finished the day down 0.8% to 115.03. With a Composite Rating of 94, the stock hit an all-time high of 119.90 last week.

11,ZBH,"IShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI) is one of the year's top ETF Leaders as it rides some of the best parts of a mixed health care sector.This year, the medical sector has diverged, with some of its industries faring much better than others. Biotechs and other drugmakers are down roughly 20%. But IBD's medical products and equipment industry groups are up about 14%. Only the diversified medical companies are doing quite as well in 2016 in health care.Much of the outperformance in medical devices owes to superior results at some of the top manufacturers, where innovation has played a key role in igniting industry leaders.Of 47 stocks in the ETF, Medtronic (MDT) is the largest holding, with more than 12% of the portfolio. Shares have climbed as much as 12% from the 79.60 buy point of a breakout in April.The stock has performed decently despite the fact that earnings have been basically flat for five quarters. The outlook is improving, though: Analysts expect profit to rise 7% in the fiscal year ending in April and 11% the next year. At its investor day in June, Medtronic forecast mid-single-digit revenue growth as it develops its product pipeline and draws on its diversified markets.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is another stock that has shouldered the ETF's advance. Shares are near all-time highs. The main move this year was on April 4, after the company announced that its Sapien 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement was shown to reduce deaths from heart attacks in patients at moderate risk from open-heart surgery. Shares soared 17% on the news.Medtronic's CoreValve competes with Edwards in heart valve replacements for patients not able to have open-heart surgery. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity remained bullish on the stock following the earnings report, saying it dominates the market for transcatheter aortic valve replacements and shows potential for market expansion.Shares of Stryker (SYK) -- which has the broadest range of orthopedics products among its peers -- have climbed as much as 34% this year, but fell sharply after its July 22 earnings report. There was no clear explanation for the slide, other than some softness in emerging markets.Other key contributors to iShares U.S. Medical Devices are Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), which makes equipment for medical research, and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), which just posted its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade. Becton Dickinson (BDX) had been trending higher, but fell sharply Thursday after it cut its full-year sales forecast, citing currency headwinds.The ETF is extended from a breakout in April and from a pullback to the 50-day moving average in June. But it remains near the 142.47 buy point of a three-weeks-tight pattern that formed during July. The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market. A computer algorithm selects the ETFs based on relative strength and other objective performance ratings, with periodic adjustments for market trends and conditions.

The U.S. economy is growing a lot slower than expected, and oil prices are nearing $40 a barrel.The Nasdaq composite rose 1.2% to its best levels since early December, fueled by strong earnings from Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon. The S&P 500 hitting a new record high Friday but closed the week down fractionally. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7%, also snapping a four-week uptrend, as weaker oil prices and earnings reports hit the energy sector. The Federal Reserve's statement that the ""near-term economic risks"" have ""diminished"" seemed to have little impact on investors.The iPhone maker earned $1.42 a share, down 23% year over year, on sales of $42.4 billion, down 15%. It was Apple's second straight declines in earnings, revenue and iPhone sales -- but they were still better than expected. Apple's current-quarter revenue target is $46.5 billion at the midpoint, off 10% but above Wall Street consensus of $45.71 billion.

Facebook stock rose 2.4% to 123.94, hitting a record high and still within range of a 121.18 buy point.Twitter (TWTR) reported Q2 EPS that topped views. But revenue fell short, and Q3 revenue guidance also missed estimates. Twitter stock fell 9.4% but closed the week above its 50-day line.Bouncing back from a Q1 miss, Alphabet reported Q2 EPS and revenue that blew past expectations. The Google parent's earnings minus items rose 20% to $8.42 a share. Total revenue climbed 21% to $21.5 billion.

The No. 2 U.S. automaker's Q2 earnings per share and revenue rose, but EPS growth was weakest in five quarters, sales growth was the slimmest in three quarters, and Ford cited ""downside risk to global growth."" Offering further evidence of slowing, auto parts maker Lear (LEA) missed on sales and warned on 2016 revenue, while Gentherm (THRM) earnings missed. Volkswagen (VLKAY) Q2 sales edged up 1.7%, but its net profit plunged 57% vs. a year early as it struggled to recover from an emissions test cheating scandal involving diesel-engine models.Ford stock fell 8.5%.The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged after its two-day policy meeting, as expected. Policymakers said ""near-term economic risks ... have diminished,"" suggesting a baby step to raising rates, and some analysts said it opened the door, slightly, to a September rate increase. But after the Fed meeting and weak GDP data, investors pushed back their expectations for the next hike beyond the next 12 months.The U.S. economy rose at a 1.2% annual rate in Q2, less than half of what Wall Street expected, after Q1's downwardly revised 0.8% pace. Consumer spending was very strong, climbing 4.2%.But residential investment fell, even as separate reports show new- and existing-home sales hitting multiyear highs. Business investment contracted for a third straight quarter. With oil prices falling back toward $40 a barrel, corporate spending may remain weak going forward.U.S. crude oil futures tumbled 5.9% to $41.60 a barrel, hitting three-month lows as the crude tumbled 13.9% for July. U.S. crude and gasoline supplies rose again, according to the Energy Information Administration, which also reported higher U.S. production. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a fifth straight week, suggesting further production gains.

That news sent Mobileye down 8% on Tuesday, but the stock pared losses for the week to 3.4%. Tesla rose 5.6%.Boeing (BA) reported its first quarterly loss in years due to various charges, but it wasn't as deep as feared. Free cash flow was better than expected on big jet deliveries. Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported modest earnings and sales growth that topped views, but weaker tech services revenue hurt margins. Raytheon (RTN) beat views and raised profit guidance. General Dynamics (GD) topped on earnings and raised EPS guidance, but Q2 revenue missed.McDonald's earned $1.45 a share, beating analysts' expectations for $1.38. Total revenue fell 3.6% vs. a year earlier to $6.265 billion. Analysts had expected $6.27 billion. Global same-store sales, excluding currency effects, rose 3.1% vs. estimates for about 3.6%. U.S. same-store sales rose just 1.8%. Management said they were ""not immune"" to consumer unease -- be it over finances, the election or, in general, ""an unsettled world"" -- that may have hurt other restaurants during the quarter.Shares fell 8.3% to 117.60 for the week, tumbling through their 50-day and 200-day moving averages -- and a 124.18 buy point.Stifel Nicolaus downgraded a large number of restaurant stocks, while Jefferies predicted a U.S. recession would hit the sector. Top-rated Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which reports earnings in the coming week, fell 6% on Wednesday. But the steakhouse chain found support at its 50-day line and closed the week down 2.3%.United Technologies (UTX), maker of Pratt & Whitney brand aircraft engines, Otis elevators and other products, reported second-quarter earnings per share and revenue that beat estimates and raised its Q3 EPS estimate. Its stock hit a one-year high at 108.49, above a 107.07 buy point. Caterpillar's (CAT) Q2 EPS and revenue both fell as the mining and construction equipment giant deals with an energy and mining downturn.

Citrix was already planning to spin off Go To Meeting.Verizon Communications acquired struggling the core assets of Yahoo for nearly $6 billion, including $1.1 billion in stock compensation costs. ""Despite the massive execution challenges ahead, the Yahoo acquisition demonstrates that Verizon recognizes its own limitations as a consumer brand,"" said research firm The Diffusion Group. Verizon reported Q2 revenue that missed views and in-line EPS, and added fewer wireless postpaid phone subscribers than expected.T-Mobile US (TMUS) in Q2 added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers, topping Sprint (S) at 173,000 and Verizon's 86,000. AT&T (T) lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers. T-Mobile's earnings fell 40% but still beat expectations. Revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion.

But shares tumbled 7.9% for the week.Amgen (AMGN) beat and raised, but its stock slipped as its growth continued to be driven by price increases rather than volume. Celgene (CELG), meanwhile, jumped as only a third of its growth was price-driven, making up for a hit earlier in the week when its drug Revlimid failed a lymphoma trial. AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also rose on solid reports. AstraZeneca (AZN) was the biggest winner stock-wise when it jumped 9% Thursday on rumors that Swiss pharma Novartis (NVS) was thinking of acquiring it. The biggest loser was Gilead Sciences (GILD), which trimmed its guidance as its hepatitis C franchise continued to decline.Meanwhile, top-rated medical device companies Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and orthopedics giant Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) each hit new highs after beating estimates and raising guidance.

The Street's consensus estimate was 523,000, but the economy posted 619,000 -- a stunning 18% beat and the highest level in more than eight years. The figure easily topped the entire range of estimates, which ran from a low of 510,000 to a high of 530,000.Homebuilder stocks rose in response, with gains mostly in the 3% to 5% range, but many of the stocks remain far off their highs.

26,ZBH,"The medical industry has a lot to prove in the upcoming Q1 earnings season, as the last round of earnings and guidance didn't do much to reassure investors who were already nervous for other reasons. However, some major stocks in the sector have been hitting new highs lately, especially on the hardware side of the group. Here are three such companies reporting earnings this week:• Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) takes its traditional place at the head of the line as it reports its earnings early Tuesday, the first of the big drug companies to report in this cycle. Its growth is expected to be modest, due to both its gigantic size and the foreign-exchange headwinds that have been dragging on global companies' earnings this year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that Q1 revenue rose 0.7% over the year-earlier quarter to $17.5 billion. Earnings are estimated at $1.66 a share, up 6%.Despite its muted growth, Johnson & Johnson stock hit a record high of 110.40 in trading Friday (closing the day at 110.18, up a fraction), and has maintained an IBD Relative Strength Rating in the 80s for the last six weeks.The mood on Wall Street going into the quarter seems bullish. Late Thursday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro raised his estimates based on his reading of drug-prescription and foreign-exchange trends.""IMS (IMS) script trends for several key drugs suggest another strong pharma quarter in 1Q (+9% year-over-year ex-FX and Olysio),"" Novarro wrote. (Olysio is a hepatitis C treatment.) ""Additionally, our analysis of currency movements since the beginning of the year suggests the negative FX impact on full-year results should be less than initially expected.""Novarro noted that one likely topic of conversation on the conference call will be this month's FDA approval of Pfizer’s (PFE) Inflectra, a biosimilar version of J&J's blockbuster immunology drug Remicade.• Robotic-surgery specialist Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is due to report after the close Tuesday. Analysts estimate that its Q1 earnings rose 21% over last year's Q1 to $4.33 a share, with sales up 11.5% to $593 million.Intuitive Surgical has also been a top-performing stock lately, as the company has been making a comeback financially with the rollout of its da Vinci Xi surgical system and improving procedure growth. Intuitive Surgical stock hit a new high of 630.67 on Wednesday, up more than 15% this year, and boasts an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 98. It closed Friday at 624.22.""Heading into 1Q, the key question for investors is whether the stock is baking in too much optimism or is this the start of a new product cycle,"" Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar wrote in an email to clients Friday. ""We expect procedure volumes to be healthy, with growth in general surgery leading the way (extra day from leap year should also help).""• Similar concerns about an over-optimistic market seem to be dogging orthopedics giant Stryker (SYK), which is due to report after the close Wednesday. The stock has also been on a roll, on Wednesday hitting a new high of 110.40 that was 19% above where it wound up last year. Shares closed Friday at 109.80.Stryker stock kept climbing last week even though Robert W. Baird downgraded it to neutral and Barclays resumed coverage at underweight. The latter wrote that Stryker's valuation appears to be full going into its Q1 and that it's facing more competition from a rejuvenated Zimmer Biomet (ZBH).Analysts covering Stryker estimate that sales rose 3.9% in the quarter to $2.47 billion, with earnings up 8% to $1.20 a share.

27,ZBH,"With artificial intelligence now firmly entrenched in many hospital operating rooms, the field of robotic surgery is starting to get competitive.Giant companies like Alphabet (GOOGL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Medtronic (MDT) are training their sights on Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), the king of robotic surgery companies. But analysts say the booming medical technology segment has lots of room to run.Robotic surgery is an area that could grow by billions of dollars as more machines are used to treat patients. Intuitive commands the space with $3.3 billion in annual sales. Its signature da Vinci robotic surgeons, however, are limited in the types of procedures they handle. The multi-limbed da Vinci can be used in a variety of procedures — including cardiac, colorectal, gynecological, head and neck, thoracic and urologic surgeries — but only as long as they're minimally invasive.How big the market could be is still unclear, yet analysts agree the potential has yet to be tapped. So more players are moving in, and quickly.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""I think investors need to understand that the robotics and AI (artificial intelligence) revolution is happening, and it's touching every sector of the economy,"" said Jeremie Capron, the director of research and managing partner for Robo Global, an index and advisory firm specializing in robotic industry investments. ""This is a technological revolution that investors can't afford to miss.""Analysts say that in March, Auris Health became the first company to pose a formidable threat to Intuitive when its catheter-based Monarch Platform gained U.S. approval. Intuitive will counterpunch by seeking approval for a flexible catheter similar to the Auris device, likely this year, RBC analyst Brandon Henry said in a recent report.Meanwhile, others are working in areas where Intuitive Surgical doesn't have a foothold. Smith & Nephew (SNN) has a robotic assistant for knee replacements. Stryker (SYK) has a robotic joint replacement system. Mazor Robotics (MZOR) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) have robotic offerings in brain and spinal surgery. Mazor alone could see around $3 billion in sales just from its systems.But these players have a long way to go to take Intuitive Surgical's throne.In 2005, Intuitive had a market cap of $1.3 billion. Today, it's worth nearly $52 billion. Capron calls Intuitive ""an amazing stock.""""I think the investment community has been scratching their heads trying to figure out the impact of those new entrants for Intuitive Surgical,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""We feel pretty relaxed about it. The size is big enough for small players to come in.""Shares of medical tech companies have been relatively insulated from the woes frustrating biotech and pharmaceutical stocks of late. The stocks of medical equipment makers such as Intuitive and Mazor have collectively spiked 15% year to date.Intuitive's ""blowout quarter"" in April helped to spur excitement, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said in a recent note to clients. Recent investor days from J&J and Medtronic are helping to drive that frenzy.""Robotic surgery is the topic currently in medtech with a blowout quarter from Intuitive Surgical hinting that the pace of manual-to-robotic transition might be picking up,"" Kumar said. ""The topic of competition elicits various responses from investors.""Intuitive Surgical stock is up 33% this year, after climbing 78% in 2017. Kumar expects Intuitive Surgical's competition to become more apparent over the next 12 to 18 months. Intuitive's da Vinci Surgical System now boasts ""five million patients and counting.""The da Vinci systems are also moving deeper into hernias and are seeing early-stage adoption in bariatrics surgery performed to induce weight loss.Myriam Curet, executive vice president and chief medical officer for Intuitive, noted in an email to IBD that an estimated 82% of prostatectomies in the U.S. are performed via robotic-assisted surgery. The same is true for about 80% of malignant hysterectomies.""General surgery is our fastest-growing specialty, and one where we are still in early stages of adoption for procedures such as ventral and inguinal hernia repair, colorectal and bariatric surgery,"" she said. ""We believe there is substantial opportunity to expand robotic usage in these categories, and we are developing additional tools and technologies to do so.""For the year, Intuitive guided on its first-quarter earnings conference call to 12%-15% growth in the number of procedures performed with its systems this year. That followed what many considered a strong fourth quarter in which recurring revenue — including instruments and accessories for its da Vinci systems — grew 11%. Recurring revenue represents 73% of the sales pie.Still, even Intuitive Surgical sees itself in the early innings and expects robotic surgery to present a huge total addressable market. The number of da Vinci procedures performed each year grew nearly 68% from 2013 to 2017.Among other robotic surgery companies, Intuitive's closest competitor, Auris, doesn't trade publicly. Until recently it was in ""stealth mode,"" Kumar said. But in May the medical technology company signed a commercialization agreement with a division of J&J. The agreement came two months after Auris' Monarch system grabbed approval in the U.S.Monarch is a flexible catheter. Surgeons thread it through a patient's mouth and into the lungs by remote control. Before its approval, investors believed ""credible competitors"" to Intuitive would be years away, Kumar says. But Monarch got approval months ahead of views. Intuitive Surgical plans to seek approval of its own flexible catheter later this year.On its website, Auris says Monarch's first target is lung cancer. Some experts estimate half a million lung biopsies are performed in the U.S. each year. Surgeons could also use flexible catheters in urinary tract procedures, which number roughly 400,000 procedures a year.Intuitive isn't sweating the competition. Auris' chief executive, interestingly, is Frederic Moll, who founded Intuitive Surgical in 1995. Intuitive's current CEO, Gary Guthart, joined the medical technology firm in 1996 and took over as CEO in 2010.""We have built technologies and made decisions about our architecture based on first principles, not by looking over our shoulder at what other people are doing, but by really engaging customers deeply and understanding their clinical needs,"" Guthart said on a recent earnings call.RBC's Henry notes Auris' Monarch has a 25% larger catheter than Intuitive's to allow for its camera. Intuitive sees a benefit in a smaller catheter that can move deeper into the lungs, Henry wrote in a recent report. That would allow surgeons to potentially use it to remove diseased tissue.Meanwhile, J&J has teamed up with Google on a company called Verb Surgical. Analysts are unsure what system the team is creating. They do expect it to enter the robotic surgery market in 2020, though.At the same time, Medtronic is partnered with Mazor. Medtronic also expects its own robotic surgery system to launch in 2020.It's not unreasonable to suggest Intuitive could keep 80% of the market, Evercore's Kumar told IBD. New robotic surgery companies will have to differentiate themselves.""They can't have a straightforward, 'me too' product,"" he said. ""Investors have put a pretty punchy marketable valuation on Intuitive Surgical because we're still in the early stages of this robotic conversation.""But, he added, ""This market is big enough to sustain multiple players.""That's where companies like Mazor and Zimmer Biomet, which makes systems called ROSA, come in. Both have systems that surgeons use in brain and spinal procedures.Like others, Mazor CEO Ori Hadomi says sizing the opportunity for robotic surgery companies is difficult. Surgeons use the $1.1 million Mazor X system in spinal surgeries. The company's Renaissance system can perform spinal and brain surgeries and costs $500,000.Disposable instruments and materials comprised 40% to 60% of Mazor's revenue, Hadomi told IBD. For each surgery performed with the Mazor X, the list price is $1,500 in terms of disposable items. An estimated half a million procedures would generate $750 million.Stakeholders expect spine procedures to grow rapidly.""People are being more and more active,"" he said, meaning they will suffer more injuries and require surgery more often. ""The procedures will become less invasive. The safer the procedures will become, the more patients will be willing and interested to be treated, to be operated on.""The benefits of robotic surgery are plentiful, Hadomi says. Revision surgery — surgery to correct mistakes or tweak prior surgeries — are significantly lower with a robot assisting. The precision of the robot helps to curb potential errors, he says.Last October, Mazor unveiled the results of a 379-patient study. It found a fivefold reduction of complications for surgeries performed with its Mazor robotic surgery technology. Notably, there was also a sevenfold reduction in revision surgery compared with freehand lumbar fusion surgeries.""There's no doubt from the patient's perspective, I would not consider going to surgery without the robot there knowing the chance of going through revision (surgery) is seven times higher,"" he said. Revision surgery is also costly for the hospital, which can face reimbursement hurdles.All agree that robotic surgery won't replace human surgeons. Hadomi likens his system and others like it to ""the toolbox of the surgeon"". These are simply medical technology tools that make operating easier on the surgeon and safer for the patient, he says.The benefits are also growing for investors, says Robo Global's Capron.""What's really exciting is the fact that we are at an inflection point where the technologies that enable robotic surgeries and the price point are attractive,"" he said. ""Now there's a lot of action around J&J and Medtronic. I see that as confirmation that this is a substantial, addressable market.""RELATED:Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

28,ZBH,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH) on Monday plunged 14% Monday to a seven-month low after the medical supplier lowered its full-year forecast on a weak third-quarter earnings report.The Warsaw, Ind.-based maker of orthopedic devices said it now sees diluted earnings at $1.50 to $1.60 a share, down from its previous forecast of $1.50 to $1.75. Adjusted earnings estimates were cut to a range of $7.90 to $7.95 a share, bringing down the upper end of that spread from $8.Shares ended the day tumbling by 17.15 to 105.40. Zimmer's violent stock reaction parallels that of other medical suppliers who have reported in recent days. Edwards Lifesciences (EW) plunged more than 17% on Wednesday after its earnings disappointed, while Abiomed (ABMD) stumbled by more than 15% over two days last week.Boston Scientific (BSX) slipped a few points when it reported earnings, but Stryker (SYK) saw a healthy uptick after it reported, gaining more than 4%.Zimmer expects its revenue growth to be down as well. Excluding the company's acquisition of LDR Holding, growth is expected run between 1.65% to 1.9%, instead of the previous forecasts of 2.5% to 3%.The company said net income for the quarter was $158.8 million. Adjusted earnings were $1.79 a share, in line with analyst estimates. But revenue of $1.83 billion fell short of forecasts. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected $1.84 billion.Zimmer expects full-year earnings in the range of $7.90 to $7.95 per share, with revenue in the range of $7.63 billion to $7.65 billion. Analysts were predicting earnings of $7.97 a share on sales of $7.7 billion.

Nike (NKE) was down more than 3% in big volume after Bank of America downgraded the athletic apparel brand to underperform from neutral.Volume was tracking lower across the board.Utilities were strongest in the day's trading. The sector has been on the mend since the early part of October, and IBD's utility industry groups today made the best gains of that bounce. Water utilities were up 1.4%, gas 1.8%, electric 2.1% and diversified 2.3%.While there was no specific trigger for today's rally, it appeared to be a snap-back move after a period in which the difference in yields between utilities and bonds got stretched, says John Bartlett, a utilities analyst at Reaves Asset Management.The energy sector was the weakest, accounting for seven of the 10 worst performing industry groups. Exploration, oil field services, drilling and pipeline groups were down 1% to 2.5%. Crude oil fell nearly 3% to $47.39 in early afternoon trading.But Chevron (CVX) was up more than 1% after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to its conviction buy list from neutral.

31,ZBH,"U.S. stock indexes battled to overcome turbulence midday Wednesday after a slew of issues suffered bearish gap-down moves at the open.The Nasdaq itself gapped down as much as 0.7% and then backfilled the gap to a 0.3% loss. The early dunking took the composite back to its 50-day line, where it found support and bounced up. The S&P 500 was flat, while the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.3%.Volume in the stock market today was running modestly higher on both major exchanges compared to the previous session.An unusually high number of blue chip stocks suffered gap downs at the open. A gap down occurs when a stock opens and stays below the lowest price in the previous day's range. In the S&P 100, which is comprised of the biggest blue chips in the S&P 500, a dozen stocks gapped down. This is unusual for conservative stocks.S&P 100 gap downs included Simon Property Group (SPG), Apple (AAPL), and home-improvement chain Lowe's (LOW).Some of the early gap downs reversed to fill in all or part of the gap as the session continued.IBD'S TAKE: The gap downs ought to make individual investors think twice before buying a stock, but Northrop Grumman gapped up into a buy zone Wednesday.In some cases, the negative reactions seemed a bit excessive. Dow transports member Southwest Airlines (LUV) gapped down 11% in torrid volume despite earnings that topped the consensus estimate by about 6%. Revenue fell shy of expectations by 0.6%, and guidance was weak. The company said it expected Q4 unit revenue to decline 4% to 5%.A strong market might have shrugged off the negatives and focused on the earnings beat, or at least contained the damage. But this market is clearly under pressure.Growth stocks also suffered gap downs.

36,ZBH,"In a global market starved for growth, lead manager Justin Kelly thinks his $14.7 billion MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund (MLAAX) is about to feast like a shark amid a school of tasty fish.After losing more than twice as much ground in the first quarter than its average large-cap growth rival tracked by Morningstar Inc., the fund doubled its peer group's Q2 gain. And so far this quarter it is ahead 5.49% vs 5.21% for its peer mutual funds, going into Thursday.So what's behind the fund's sudden burst of speed? The market has tilted back toward the types of stocks favored by the fund. That includes stocks like UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which is up about 20% this year.And lead manager Justin Kelly thinks the party for growth stocks is still ramping up.""Growth stocks underperformed this year vs. what I call safety stocks,"" Kelly said. ""Safety stocks do best when the 10-year bond is declining in yield. Those are utilities, staples, telecom and REITs. They all did well in the first half of the year. But since June 30, this fund has been on a tear.""The fund focuses on stocks that grow faster than the broad market. And in the current global market, where growth overall is slow, stocks that can manage to generate above-average growth will be in greater demand, Kelly says. ""If that happens, growth stocks will do better than value, and this fund will rip!""One key to how the fund maneuvers through various markets phases: It adjusts its allocations among three types of growth stocks the managers seek.One bucket contains stocks that the fund sees as long-term sustainable earnings growers. The second bucket contains quality cyclical growers. And the third holds stocks in newer industries with rapid growth.Sustainable growers have some competitive advantage that lets them grow year after year. UnitedHealth Group is an example. Revenue for the provider of health care coverage and benefits services has grown at a double-digit pace for six quarters in a row.Broadcom (AVGO) is one of the fund's cyclicals.""They have radio frequency filters that are highly desirable and the best in the market to allow mobile phones to jump from one frequency to another,"" Kelly said. ""That gives them pricing power that few other vendors in their semiconductor industry have.""Broadcom's filters, Kelly adds, enable phones to work on networks in different countries and as a user moves from one cell tower to another.Facebook (FB) is in their bucket of stocks in newer industries with rapid growth. A top-10 holding as of June 30, its rapid growth comes from market-share gains in advertising. ""Its return on investment (for advertisers) is better than they get on other platforms like television and print,"" Kelly said. ""As more advertisers shift their dollars to the higher ROI on Facebook, we think growth will continue for years.""Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is also in the rapid-growth bucket.""Intuitive's robot (system) was starting to catch on in new surgical markets, especially for hernia cases,"" Kelly said. ""They had become widely used for prostatectomies and hysterectomies, but growth there has lagged since their heyday. Our estimate of earnings growth was above the Street's for 2016 and '17 and perhaps '18.""In the current slow-growth economic environment, the managers think their best prospects are companies with fast or steady earnings and sales growth.""We see the best opportunities in newer, faster-growing companies,"" Kelly said. ""We also like consistent growth. We are substantially overweight in newer, faster-growing companies and consistent growers, and we are underweight in cyclicals.""Still, the managers -- Clark Winslow and Patrick Burton also run the fund -- don't hibernate during markets that tilt away from their strategy. ""We took advantage of the broader pullback in the market in the spring,"" Kelly said. That's when the fund started its position in Intuitive Surgical.Also, the fund increased its stake in UnitedHealth, another top-10 holding. It was taking market share in the Medicare Advantage and Medicaid markets, said Steve Hamill, health care analyst for Winslow Capital, the fund's subadvisor. And Optum, its health services business, ""has been a tremendous growth business,"" Hamill said. It generates about 40% of UnitedHealth's earnings.Among other holdings, Activision Blizzard's (ATVI) earnings per share jumped 44% and 315% the past two quarters. The company is shifting to online gaming, away from reliance on console-based video games. That boosts margins, Kelly says.""Their next growth will come through e-sports, turning video gaming into a sport with spectators, such that people will go to Madison Square Garden to watch other gamers,"" he said.Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) is a newcomer to the portfolio. The fund began its current stake in the spring. ""Our thesis here is that this is a steady grower,"" Hamill said. ""They're the leading company in orthopedic implants and some related surgical categories.""Fundamentals slid after the merger of Zimmer and Biomet, which closed in June 2015, due to redundant sales forces and other inefficiencies, Hamill says. But now the company has cut costs. And surgeons like Zimmer Biomet's products, Hamill adds.Earlier this year, many Wall Street analysts expected the company to continue to lose share, especially in the hip and knee markets. ""We think they will grow at least as fast as the market,"" Hamill said. He thinks the company's growth will be even better in the spine and trauma markets. Revenue growth and margin expansion will be key drivers, he adds.The fund's institutional shares (MLAIX) carry no load and a 0.74% expense ratio. The $5 million minimum investment can be met at the plan or brokerage level. RELATED:Will Danoff Plus John Roth Equal Top-Performing Fidelity New Insights FundJanus Forty Managers Win With Bets On Proven Champs, Up-And-Comers And Calculated Risks Hot Hodges Mutual Fund Shines As Several Leading Stock Holdings ClimbWhy This Winning MFS Fund Prefers Stocks With Durable Growth Over Fastest Growth

GDP rose at a 1.2% annualized rate in the second quarter, nearly double Q1's 0.8% pace.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance""Those create conditions that could lead to the long-anticipated recovery in earnings in the second half of the year,"" Joy said. ""And we're half through Q2 earnings season. They're not great. But they're a little better than expected.""The S&P 500 is trading at a multiple of about 20 times trailing corporate earnings but only a multiple of 17 on forward earnings. ""That disparity tells me that the market is looking down the road, seeing positive earnings growth, maybe in Q3 or Q4 and into next year,"" Joy added.His team's only sector overweights are in technology and telecommunications.Precious metals funds rose 10.46% last month, topping science and tech funds' 7.50% gain and health/biotech funds' 7.24% advance.""Our attraction to tech varies,"" Joy said. ""A couple of themes include: e-payments, return of capital, dividend yield and quality growth."" Apple (AAPL) and VeriFone Systems (PAY) are examples of companies helped by consumers' increasing use of e-payments, Joy says. Also, Apple boosted its share buyback program in April to $175 billion from $140 billion. Oracle (ORCL) said in March it is buying back $10 billion of shares this year. Cisco Systems (CSCO) carries a 3.4% dividend yield. And Alphabet (GOOGL) has shown durable earnings growth.Telecom is largely a yield play, he said.His team is also overweight in alternative investments to lessen its risk of volatility. ""Also, for investors who have the wherewithal and qualify, we want investments that might produce better returns, like private equity and venture capital,"" he said. ""You give up liquidity, but over time you have the opportunity to outperform.""And Joy warns investors to expect volatility in the run-up to the election, based on past election years. ""If the market is true to history, that will be the case again,"" he said.Volatility could also be fed by coming votes in a number of European nations that could hurt European Union cohesion, he added.Justin Kelly, lead manager of $15.4 billion MainStay Large Cap Growth (MLAIX), says prospects for outperformance are best in three traditionally growth-oriented sectors -- technology, health care and consumer discretionary.In tech, his fund has bet on Alphabet, Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V).""We like Alphabet based on continued strong market share gains in the global advertising market and improved cost discipline and capital deployment,"" he said.""Facebook is rapidly gaining share of the global advertising market as (advertisers find that) return on investment is much better in online than traditional offline media advertising spending,"" Kelly added. His team likes Microsoft because ""we think (Satya Nadella's) new management team will accelerate the company's earnings per share growth profile as they shift business to the cloud.""Visa (V) has a long-duration growth opportunity as we move from cash and checks to electronic payments, Kelly said. ""And we think they can grow at an above-average rate for a long time,"" he said.In health care, he holds orthopedic and dental implant maker Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) and medical-device maker Boston Scientific (BSX). ""Both have new products that are accelerating their growth and expanding their operating margins,"" he said.In the consumer discretionary sector, his team's bet on Home Depot (HD) reflects optimism about the U.S. housing cycle. ""Home Depot is the best way to play it because they're gaining share. And expanding their margins, they can grow earnings at attractive rates for years to come.""Larry Pitkowsky, co-manager of midcap value $270 million GoodHaven Fund (GOODX), likes sectors and stocks that have been out of favor. Barrick Gold (ABX) edged up 2% in July and was up 196% this year through month end.Q2 earnings per share were up, the second quarter in a row of growth after 12 straight stanzas of declining EPS. The price of bullion has trended higher since December.Barrick Gold has trimmed $968 million in debt year to date and said it is on track to cut debt by $2 billion this year. ""They have reduced leverage and costs,"" Pitkowsky said. ""They are generating earnings and cash flow. There are many ways for them to grow intrinsic value from here.""He also likes Birchcliff Energy. Shares of the Canada-based oil and gas explorer and producer, which are trading below 10, rose 37% in July and were up 134% this year through July 29.EPS has fallen for six quarters, falling faster the two most recent quarters.Click Here To See A List Of New Buys Of Top Mutual FundsClick Here To See A List Of Latest Sells Of Top Mutual Funds

It's rallied nicely since hitting a low of 6.14 in January, but it's been getting resistance at its 10-week moving average for several weeks as it consolidates gains. That's a sign of slack buying demand, which is confirmed by a weak Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D-.

44,ZBH,"Stocks saw modest gains fade heading into the close, after the major indexes huddled just above and just below previous resistance levels.The Nasdaq dipped 0.1% with 15 minutes left in Tuesday's regular session. The S&P 500 rose about 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today was higher on the Nasdaq but lower on the NYSE.The S&P 500 on Monday climbed above old resistance at 2100 and added a small cushion Tuesday. The Nasdaq is lingering just under old resistance at 5000.Blue chips were mostly up, with winners leading losers by a 9-2 ratio in the Dow. With U.S. oil closing above $50 a barrel, Chevron (CVX) popped 2% higher in brisk trade while Exxon Mobil (XOM) added nearly 2% in below-average volume.The integrated oil stocks group has done well recently. Eight weeks ago, the integrated oil stocks were No. 143 among 197 industry groups. The group was No. 16, as of Monday's ranking on Investors.com.Chevron has had its troubles. Earnings on a year-ago basis have declined for six consecutive quarters. The Street expects earnings to decline 50% this year but rebound 275% next year.In the IBD 50, Five Below (FIVE) thrust 3% higher in volume about 25% above average. Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) dropped 4% in first 10 minutes of trade but then made a steady recovery. The loss stood at less than 2% as the market headed toward the final hour of trade. Zimmer Biomet's action could be seen as a bounce off the 50-day line, which can be a buying opportunity.Zimmer Biomet announced before the open that it would buy LDR Holding (LDRH) to expand its reach into the spine market. Austin-based LDR does not make money, but it scored $164 million in revenue in 2015.
"
45,ZBH,"Stocks opened higher Tuesday morning, despite some dramatic premarket losses among drugmakers.The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.4% gain. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq held on to a fractional gain.Stocks in motion included Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), United Natural Foods (UNFI), Zillow Group (Z) and Biogen (BIIB).One test for the stock market today will be volume. Monday's gains felt good, but took place in relatively weak trade. As IBD's Big Picture on Monday noted, that suggests institutional investors remained on the bench -- not a bullish sign. Gains in rising trade provide the markets' uptrend with more momentum. Still, the S&P 500 opens just 1% off its July 2015 high, and a move above that level would be psychologically important.Another point to watch: small caps. The Russell 2000 and the S&P SmallCap 600 both outperformed the market on Monday.The Labor Department said productivity declined 0.6% in the first quarter, in line with expectations and an improvement over an initial estimate of a 1% decrease. Unit labor costs rose 4.5%, above consensus forecasts for no change from the department's initial estimate of a 4.1% rise.The Federal Reserve is on deck to deliver April consumer credit data at 3 p.m. ET.Oil and natural gas stocks crowded the top of the S&P 500: Williams Companies (WMB) and Marathon Oil (MRO) were up about 2% each.Pharmaceutical plays were taking a beating, however. Valeant crumbled 20% after its first-quarter revenue topped analysts' views, but earnings stopped well short of targets, and management slashed its full-year sales and earnings guidance to far below expectations.Alexion nose-dived 10% after reporting late Monday that a late-stage study of its neuromuscular disease treatment Soliris missed expected goals. Alexion shares have been trying to climb the right side of a deepening 11-month consolidation.Biogen skidded 10% after preliminary data of a phase 2 clinical study showed multiple sclerosis treatment opicinumab missed primary endpoints in the trial.A bright spot in the medical picture was LDR Holding (LDRH), which spiked 63% at the open, after Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) said it would acquire the cervical surgery products company in a deal valued near $1 billion. IBD 50 stock Zimmer was down 4%.Recreational vehicle maker Thor Industries (THO) scratched out a 2% gain at the open. The Elkhart, Ind.-based company reported Q1 earnings just above estimates, but with revenue just below analysts' consensus target. The stock ended Monday in a buy range, 3% past a 63.09 cup-base buy point.Overseas markets traded higher, boosted by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's pushback on Monday of expectations for a rate hike. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index took a 1.4% gain. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 added 0.6%. In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX and the CAC 40 in Paris carried gains of 1% or better.Oil prices climbed, with West Texas Intermediate up nearly 1% to $50 a barrel. Europe's Brent crude benchmark climbed close to 1%, topping $51 per barrel. Gold slipped less than 1% to $1,240 an ounce. The dollar rose. The 10-year Treasury yield lost 1 basis point, to 1.73%.

49,ZBH,"The stock market held strong gains early Tuesday, helped by strength in European markets overnight. The Nasdaq led the way, up 1.3%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average added around 1% each. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly higher than Monday's levels.In Europe, the CAC 40 was up 1.9% in late trading Paris, Germany's DAX gained 1.7%, and London's FTSE added 1%.In economic news, April new-home sales spiked 16.6% to an eight-year high. IBD's home-building group performed mostly in line with the market on the news, up about 0.9%.In the stock market today, John Deere (DE) added more than 1.5%, thanks to a BMO Capital upgrade and a price target hike to 96 from 70. Volume was running already more than double its usual pace. But the stock is still more than 19% below a 98.23 52-week high, so it's not yet close to a potential breakout.Early big movers in the Dow included American Express (AXP) and Visa (V), up about 2% each.Inside the IBD 50, Universal Display (OLED) followed through after Monday's strong move, rising another 3%. China names NetEase (NTES) and New Oriental Education (EDU) also outperformed.Meanwhile, earnings reports were once again in focus. Toll Bros. (TOL) jumped 6%. Better-than-expected earnings and revenue were fueled by strong sales of luxury homes in California. Toll is a laggard in the group, though, still deep in base-building mode and trying to regain its slumping 50-day moving average.See who the leaders are in IBD's home-building group with IBD Stock Checkup.In the health care space, Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) picked up 1% in heavy volume. It's still in buy range from a 117.87 cup-with-handle buy point.The market's performance was impressive in light of some weak retail reports. Best Buy (BBY) and DSW (DSW) slumped after reporting sluggish earnings, down 7% and 10%, respectively.
"
50,ZBH,"This year's teeter-totter market has posed special challenges for all investors. The managers of $1.3 billion USAA Aggressive Growth (USAUX) are no exceptions.Over the past year going into Wednesday, the fund has outperformed 72% of its rival large-cap growth mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. by losing less than most of them. The fund has gained 4.99% in the volatile past three months, but that only tops 28% of its peers.The fund could be primed for strong performance when the stock market strengthens if the quality of its top holdings are an indication. Aggressive Growth's top 10 holdings as of March 31 included six stocks with IBD Composite Ratings of 80 or higher. The highest Comp Rating is 99. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating.In addition, holdings include Adobe Systems (ADBE), which sports a 92 Comp Rating.Trading around 95, Adobe is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 98.10 buy point. Volume has dried up as the handle forms, which is positive. But as IBD's Leaderboard analysis of the stock points out, Adobe's earlier breakout past an 88.65 handle entry within the base was successful, and from that point of view the stock is extended. Still, you could make a case that the right side of the base needed more work.Adobe has succeeded in morphing into a company that lets customers receive products through the cloud and pay a subscription fee.Is Adobe a buy or a sell? Take a free trial of IBD Leaderboard today to find outRevenue growth has sped over the past three quarters, from 9% to 21%, 22% and 25%. The fiscal second quarter ends this month. Wall Street currently expects earnings to rise 42% to 68 cents a share. That would extend the slowdown in EPS gains of 30%, 93%, 59% and 50% in the prior four quarters. It's still vigorous profit growth.Facebook (FB), another Leaderboard stock, is one of those top holdings. It has a 99 Composite Rating.EPS gains are accelerating, rising 16%, 33% 46% and 83% the past four quarters. The 83% earnings jump to 77 cents a share easily beat Wall Street estimates as did the 52% jump in revenue to $5.4 billion. The stock responded to the upbeat results by gapping up 7% April 28 and clearing a 117.09 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. It got as high as 121 before easing to just below the buy point.Facebook has gifted investors with a big 300%-plus return since it broke out past a 29.17 buy point of a double-bottom base in the week ended July 26, 2013, as IBD pointed out recently.Electronic Arts (EA) is a top new buy, which has a 95 Comp Rating.The video game publisher delivered better-than-expected earnings and sales growth last week.Q4 EPS rose 28%. That profit got a boost from EA's growing digital sales, which made up over 70% of all fourth-quarter revenue, as IBD reported on Tuesday.Also, EA had no debt last year and a solid 32% return on equity. That, plus a 46% average annual EPS growth rate over the past five years, has attracted a rising number of funds as investors. Two typically better-performing funds own shares in Electronic Arts: $12 billion Fidelity OTC (FOCPX) and $12 billion MFS Growth (MFEGX).Among other holdings, Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH) has a 99 Comp Rating and is up 16% so far this year.The maker of orthopedic and dental reconstruction implants, trauma products and related surgical products has seen EPS rise in each of the past four quarters, climbing from -2% to 30% in that span. Revenue grew 59%, 58% and 68% in the past three stanzas. The company beat consensus estimates for both EPS and revenue in Q1.The company was born from last year's $14 billion merger of Zimmer Holdings and Biomet. That created a global leader in musculoskeletal health care, which does business in more than 100 countries, IBD recently reported.Last month, Zimmer said it would take over Cayenne Medical to strengthen its sports medicine offerings.Trading near 117, the stock is within 1% of the 117.87 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base.The portfolio is run by two separate subadvisors. Winslow Capital and Wellington Management each manage about 50% of the fund. When one side's outperformance skews the split by too much, USAA rebalances by funneling inflow into the lagging portion. It also takes any shareholder redemptions from the larger portion.Winslow's Clark Winslow, Patrick Burton and Justin Kelly are somewhat more aggressive in their style, says USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the subadvisors. Wellington's manager is Paul Marrkand. ""Wellington is more conscious of valuation,"" Latif said.The subadvisors' sleeves share many names. ""But Winslow has more FANG stocks,"" said USAA analyst Julius Barnes, referring to 2015 high-flyers Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, now Alphabet (GOOGL).As of Jan. 31, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Starbucks (SBUX) were in the Winslow sleeve only.Going into Thursday, UnitedHealth was up about 11% for the year. It had an 86 Comp Rating but a weak D+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is a sign of more recent selling than buying by mutual funds over the past 13 weeks. Starbucks was down about 9% for the year. It has a so-so 70 Comp Rating and worst-possible E Accumulation/Distribution Rating.Oracle (ORCL) and PepsiCo (PEP) were two names in Wellington's sleeve only.Oracle was up 8%, but has a weak 55 Composite Rating and a D Accumulation/Distribution Rating. EPS fell the past four quarters and were flat in the two frames before that.Pepsi was up less than 1%, with a 59 Composite Rating and E Accumulation/Distribution Rating.""When we have a high-growth, bullish market, Winslow does better,"" Latif said. ""The opposite happens when the market is not led by growth and is challenged."" Wellington's sleeve has outperformed Winslow's so far this year, Latif says.

As per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings of these companies have increased 25% on a year-over-year basis on 10.7% higher revenues. Further, a whopping 82.8% of these companies have surpassed earnings estimates, while 67.8% beat the revenue mark.However, the number of positive revenue surprises this season is lagging the preceding year’s numbers. By the end of this week, 178 S&P 500 companies are set to release results.Medical, one of the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to deliver strong results. The Medical Product space has lately seen a slew of favorable developments. The changing market dynamics toward Artificial Intelligence (AI) & big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment, abolition of taxes and increased business investments have been driving growth in the sector.So, it would rather be interesting to see how the major Medical Product companies are placed ahead of the reporting cycle and what are the major factors shaping up the releases.Inside the Medical SectorMedical Products has been a very profitable investment space of late.Favorable consumer behavior, growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model are the supposed growth drivers.The latest Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was finally signed by President Trump on Dec 22, has finally cheered the US healthcare fraternity. The Act has lowered corporate tax rates to 21% from the earlier 35%, which buoys optimism. Additionally, the Senate’s decision of postponing the Medical Device tax, which will be put into effect on Jan 1, 2020, has instilled confidence in investors. The bill also delays the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% tax on employer insurance, until 2022.Let’s take a look at the major Medical Product companies, which are set to release results on Apr 26.Per the Zacks quantitative model, stocks with the advantageous combination of a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP have higher chances of beating estimates.

67,ZBH,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the markets open.Last quarter, the company posted earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, Zimmer Biomet missed the consensus mark in two of the preceding four quarters, the average being 0.29%. .Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsThe company is expected to report strong topline numbers within its S.E.T. (Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) arm in the to-be-reported period. Last quarter, revenues at S.E.T. were driven by solid quarterly sales of the company’s surgical portfolio. Also, within upper extremities business, the company saw solid demand for a comprehensive shoulder line.In this regard, we note that since last November, the company has received several FDA clearances within S.E.T. and is particularly, excited about the approval of the Sidus Stem-Free Shoulder system. We expect all these developments to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the first quarter itself.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Quote On the flip side, the company’s business within S.E.T has been in the recent past, massively ailed by supply issues and a continued pricing pressure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $435 million for S.E.T. revenues reflects a decline of 4.2% from the last quarter.We are also upbeat about the Spine, Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic (Spine & CMF) segment, which is expected to deliver another quarter of promising performance. Under the spine category, Zimmer Biomet should continue to gain from a strong uptake of Mobi-C Cervical Disc. Also, we are looking forward to top-line contributions from the company’s recent launch of products like the Avenue T TLIF Cage and Vitality + and Vital Spinal Fixation Systems in the United States.However, we are apprehensive about the ongoing revenue dissynergies related to the company’s U.S. spine sales force integration. Although Zimmer Biomet is working to resolve the impact of these dissynergies, chances of any near-term resolution are bleak.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $186 million for Spine revenues indicates a 4.1% decrease from the year-ago quarter.Overall, first-quarter revenues are projected at $2.03 billion, up 0.9% sequentially.Other factors likely to influence Zimmer Biomet’s first-quarter results are:Looking at the focused execution of Zimmer Biomet’s sales teams, we expect the global adoption rate of the flagship personalized knee system — Persona — to be impressive. We are also enthusiastic about the launch of the Persona Partial Knee System last September. The knee system marked the latest addition to the company’s portfolio of personalized and anatomically designed knee implant systems.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $700 million for Knee revenues registers a 4.2% reduction from the last quarter.Within Hip business, we expect the company to once again demonstrate a sturdy performance in the Asia Pacific region. Notably, in the previous quarter, the company registered double digit sales growth within Hip in the aforementioned geography. The company is anticipated to produce improved quarterly sales from Taperloc G7 and Arcos systems. However, like all other segments, supply constraints should continue to limit Zimmer Biomet’s ability to meet demand of these high-growth brands.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $478 million for Knee revenues represents a 4.2% dip from the last quarter.Emerging markets have always been a significant revenue generating source for Zimmer Biomet. Despite the recent economic downturn in Latin America, the company managed to drive growth through its operations in the other emerging markets, especially the Asia Pacific and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) zones. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from EMEA of $477 million denotes an improvement of 0.8% from the last quarter.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $300 million from APAC in the quarter to be reported translates into a 6.5% fall from the last quarter. We believe, macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable currency fluctuations have been denting the company’s sales for over the past few quarters. The company has also been burdened with pricing woes.As a result, Zimmer Biomet struggled with a negative pricing pressure of approximately 2.5% in 2017. In absence of any favorable changes on these lines, these headwinds might be mirrored in the company’s first-quarter results.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Zimmer Biomet has a Zacks Rank #4, which lowers the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%. We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Therefore, the combination does not suggest that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around.Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.61% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Henry Schein, Inc.

68,ZBH,"On Apr 6, we issued an updated research report on Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report). Issues like macroeconomic uncertainties, pricing pressure and unfavorable currency fluctuations adversely impacted Zimmer Biomet’s sales over the recent past. The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Over the last three months, shares of this leading musculoskeletal healthcare company have underperformed the broader industry on the above-mentioned headwinds. The stock has lost 15.3% versus the broader industry’s 5.8% gain. We are still disappointed with Zimmer Biomet's persistently declining core Knee sales performance of the recent past, primarily due to slower pace of supply recovery and sales recapture of certain key brands, particularly in the United States. We are also worried about the channel integration of LDR going against plans because of dissynergies associated with it. Additionally, pricing pressure remains a major woe.Estimate revision trend for 2018 is also unfavorable with 17 estimates moving south and none in the opposite direction over the past month. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 20 cents downward to $8.04 per share.On a positive note, the company’s 2018 operational plan looks promising. In order to address several near-term challenges, management has recently started to review the plan to clearly define its go-forward strategies in a number of key areas. In this regard, the company has identified several immediate opportunities to improve its operational execution.Moreover, the emerging markets opportunity is expected to reach a value of $10 billion by 2018 for the Reconstructive and Trauma markets. We also note that despite the recent global economic downturn, which has massively affected Zimmer Biomet’s business in Latin America, the other parts of the emerging markets, especially the Asia Pacific and EMEA continue to drive growth for the company. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company witnessed an accelerated upside in its Asia Pacific business, strongly benefiting from distributor orders. Particularly, Japan and China demonstrated a marked improvement.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are athenahealth, Inc. (ATHN  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report) and Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

69,ZBH,"Technological progress has been a constant for decades, making lives easier. Currently, the global mantra to success is adapting and upgrading to trending technologies.The latest craze in the digital world is 3D printing, opening up new avenues in different spheres of application, starting from automobiles to healthcare. Also known as additive manufacturing, 3D printing is the process of turning a digital model into a solid three-dimensional physical object by adding material layer by layer (per an article on 3D Hubs).From Reebok’s latest Liquid Floatride Run footwear, featuring 3D printed laces, to the switching of bigwigs like Porsche and Bugatti to 3D printing for manufacturing rare or complex parts, the phenomenon has spread far and wide. Research firm Markets and Markets expects the 3D printing market to grow to a value of $32.78 billion between 2017 and 2023, at a CAGR of 25.76%.3D printing has also received a warm response from the MedTech space within healthcare. Notably, research firm Future Market Insights expects the global 3D printed medical devices market to see a CAGR of 18.1% between 2017 and 2027.Let’s delve into details on how 3D printing has been creating new opportunities in MedTech for investors who are keen on putting their money in the healthcare space for longer-term gains.3D Printing Changes MedTech LandscapeGrowing prominence of innovative 3D printing solutions has lent a Midas touch to the MedTech space. The FDA as well as healthcare professionals are fast adopting 3D technologies to enhance long-term patient outcomes. We encouragingly note that, Materialise NV (MTLS  -  Free Report) was the first company to receive FDA approval for software designed for 3D printing anatomical models for diagnostic use.While all major sub-industries are trying to utilize their resources to come up with the best in the burgeoning 3D printing market, we have zeroed in on three that are making the most of the trend.Orthopedic ImplantsOrthopedic implant and device manufacturers are switching to 3D printing techniques to cater to the rapidly growing demand for customized implantable devices. Through 3D printing, manufacturers are being able to develop implants of customized sizes and shapes in a short time, improving efficacy and lowering the overall cost of surgeries.Research firm Future Market Insights expects the orthopedic implants market to reach a worth of around $970 million between 2017 and 2027, at a CAGR of 19.2% (according to a report published by CISION PR Newswire). Here, we appreciate Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.’s (ZBH  -  Free Report) FDA-approved Unite3D Bridge Fixation System. Quebec City-based Bodycad and Texas-based 4WEB Medical are some of the leading names in the 3D printed implant technology space.Hearing Aid Devices3D printing is fast taking over the hearing aid devices market, which is expected to see a CAGR of 5.1% between 2017 and 2023 (per a OrbisResearch.com report published by Reuters). 3D printing enables manufacturers to develop devices based on 3D images of defective ear canals. Sonova Holding AG — a leading provider of hearing solutions — has been actively using 3D printing to come up with next-generation hearing aid devices. The company’s customized titanium 3D printed hearing aid deserves a mention here.Dental Implants3D printing is also gaining popularity in the dental industry as it allows dentists to carry out procedures with more precision and efficiency, saving patients excess trauma. Notably, dental 3D printing is a process of creating three dimensional solid dental models such as implants, surgical guides, braces, dentures, crowns and bridges. Research firm Transparency Market Research expects the global dental 3D printing market to see a 16.5% CAGR from 2017 to 2025, reaching a value of $3,427.1 million.A global leader in high-accuracy dental 3D printers and materials — EnvisionTech — has been actively strengthening its hold in the niche market. The company recently announced the launch of two orthodontic materials at the LMT Lab Day Chicago 2018.Stocks in FocusWe have selected four companies, which we believe are well poised to provide impressive long-term returns banking on the 3D printing trend.Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) has been one of the early adopters of the 3D printing technology. The company’s FDA-approved Tritanium TL Curved Posterior Lumbar Cage is a 3D-printed interbody fusion cage intended for use as an aid in lumbar fixation.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.8%.  The current-quarter estimate revision trend for the stock has been encouraging with four estimates moving upward, compared to two downward movement in the past two months.

70,ZBH,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 30, before the markets open.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 1.2%. However, Zimmer Biomet has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 0.1%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, the company is expected to gain from strength in the S.E.T. (Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) arm. In the last reported quarter, revenues at S.E.T. were driven by surgical business and sports medicine offerings such as Gel-One, Subchondroplasty and Quattro Link. Moreover, solid uptake of the A.L.P.S. Plating System within the foot and ankle portfolio boosted the segment’s performance. The company witnessed strength in IntelliCart System for fluid waste management.Historically, strong performance by key brands and 2016 acquisitions along with increasing focus on sales force specialization have been partially offsetting adverse impacts from supply issues and continued pricing pressure within the segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for S.E.T. revenues of $443 million reflects an increase of 3% from the year-ago quarter reported number.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Quote We are also upbeat about the Spine, Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic (Spine & CMF) segment, which is expected to deliver another quarter of promising performance. Under the spine category, Zimmer Biomet should continue to gain from strong uptake of Mobi-C Cervical Disc. Also, we are looking forward to top-line contributions from the company’s launch of products like the Avenue T TLIF Cage and Vitality + and Vital Spinal Fixation Systems in the United States in October 2017.Moreover, although the LDR Holdings acquisition had insignificant contribution to the top line (30 basis points) in the third quarter at the initial phase of integration, it is expected to contribute 120 basis points to full-year revenues at CER. Also, management is hopeful of gaining from significant cross-selling opportunities that the acquisition provides on the back of a strong spine sales force in the United States.Continued uptake of Trauma One Plating System, SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems as well as the RibFix Blu Thoracic Fixation System within the craniomaxillofacial and thoracic arm buoys optimism.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Spine revenues of $192 million indicates a rise of 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.Overall fourth-quarter revenues are projected at $2.03 billion, up 0.9% from the prior-year quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Zimmer Biomet’s fourth-quarter results:Looking at the focused execution of Zimmer Biomet’s sales teams, we expect the global adoption rate of the flagship personalized knee system — Persona — to be impressive. We are also upbeat about the launch of the Persona Partial Knee System last September. The knee system marked the latest addition to the company’s portfolio of personalized and anatomically designed knee implant systems. Also, Zimmer Biomet’s release of X-ray-based Patient Specific Instrument, X-PSI Knee System, in the first half of 2017 buoys optimism. This is the world's first CE-Marked surgical planning system that allows for patient-specific implant positioning, solely utilizing the X-ray technology. These developments are expected to boost the fourth-quarter revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Knee revenues of $723 million indicates an uptick of 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.Emerging markets have always been a significant revenue generating source for Zimmer Biomet. Despite the recent economic downturn in Latin America, the company managed to drive growth through its operations in other emerging markets, especially the Asia Pacific and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from EMEA of $467 million indicates an improvement of 5.2% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from APAC of $313 million indicates a rise of 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable currency fluctuations have been denting sales for the company over the past few quarters. The company has also been dealing with pricing pressure. In this regard, Zimmer Biomet faced a negative pricing pressure of approximately 2.1% in the last-reported quarter. In the absence of any favorable changes on these lines, these headwinds might reflect in the company’s fourth-quarter results.For the second half of 2017, management continues to expect impact from reduced sales expectations, continued spending on critical programs and rising manufacturing costs from the Warsaw North Campus facility.Earnings Whispers    Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Zimmer Biomet this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Zimmer Biomet has an Earnings ESP of +0.38%.

73,ZBH,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report) recently announced positive results from PROGRESS II for treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Data from the study (based on 46 patients with symptomatic knee OA pain from the four trial sites across Europe) demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the nSTRIDE Autologous Protein Solution (APS) Kit for the therapy.Per the company, investigators prepared APS by using Zimmer Biomet's nSTRIDE APS Kit, which concentrates anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors from a sample of the enrolled patient's blood for delivery via a single intra-articular injection into the knee joint. The outcome showed a significant improvement in the percentage change from baseline in pain scores along with comparable safety to saline.Notably, nSTRIDE APS Kit is marketed in Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific as well. However, the kit is commercially unavailable in the United States. It is under clinical evaluation in the country. Furthermore, positive findings confirm the basis for two more trials namely, PROGRESS IV and PROGRESS V. Developments in Knee BusinessLast quarter, revenues derived from Knees were down 1.7% year over year. However, the company is putting in consistent efforts to improve its knee business. In this regard, we note that Zimmer Biomet announced the global launch of the Persona Partial Knee System on Aug 31, an advanced addition to the company’s portfolio of personalized and anatomically designed knee implant systems.Another major development in Zimmer Biomet’s Knees business is the unveiling of an X-ray-based Patient Specific Instrument known as X-PSI Knee System in June. This is the world's first CE Marked surgical planning system, enabling patient-specific implant positioning through the sole use of X-ray technology.Market ProspectsPer a report by GlobalData, the OA market is expected to reach a value of $3.5 billion by 2026 across the seven major markets at a CAGR of 8.1%. The United States will continue to dominate the OA market even at the end of that target year as 75% of the total sales will be accredited to the country’s accounts. Taking the growing OA market into consideration, we believe this latest development to boost the company's sales in the segment.Solid Stock Performance In the last 30 days, Zimmer Biomet has been trading above the broader industry. The company has gained 5.9% versus the broader industry’s 0.3% decline. Also, the company has outperformed the S&P 500’s 3.1% gain over the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Key PicksZimmer Biomet carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked medical stocks are Bruker Corporation (BRKR  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc.

Adjusted earnings also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. Reportedly, net earnings came in at 48 cents per share, marking a 38.5% slash from the year-ago figure.Revenue DetailsZimmer Biomet’s third-quarter net revenues came in at $1.82 billion, marking a 0.8% drop (down 1.2% at constant exchange rate or CER) year over year. The recently included LDR Holding contributed 30 basis points (bps) to the top line. Excluding the contribution from LDR Holding in the quarter, revenues declined 1.1% (down 1.5% at CER) year over year. Revenues, however, remained in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Quote Revenues generated in the Americas during the quarter were $1.14 billion (down 3% year over year at CER) while the same in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) grossed $381 million (down 0.4%). Asia-Pacific, however, registered a 5.2% growth at CER to reach $295 million.SegmentsRevenues derived from Knees were down 1.7% year over year at CER to $624 million. Hips too recorded a 1.7% decline at CER from the prior-year quarter to $434 million. Revenues from S.E.T. (Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) were up 1.1% year over year to $407 million.Among the other segments, Spine & CMF recorded a marginal improvement of 0.3% at CER to $185 million while Dental was down 4.4% to $93 million in the quarter. Other revenues dropped 5.3% to $75 million.MarginsA dismal topline performance along with a 4.5% rise in cost of products sold (to $500.9 million) resulted in gross margin contraction in the third quarter. Zimmer Biomet’s gross margin deteriorated 140 bps to 72.4% in the quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses were down 4.6% to $694.5 million. Research and development expenses also declined 4.6% to $91.2 million. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin expanded 30 bps to 29.2% during the quarter.Cash PositionZimmer Biomet exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $480.8 million, as compared to $450 million as of the second-quarter end. Total long-term debt was $10.4 billion compared with $10.7 billion at the end of the second quarter.Year to date, operating cash flow was $1.18 billion compared with $1.01 billion in the year-ago period. The company also paid $48.5 million in dividends during the third quarter.2017 Outlook Based on a dull topline show, Zimmer Biomet has lowered its full-year 2017 guidance. The company currently expects to register revenue in the range of $7.76 billion–$7.80 billion representing growth at CER in the range of 0.9–1.4% (earlier prediction was growth of 1.8–2.7%). This includes a contribution of approximately 120 bps from the LDR transaction. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.84 billion, above the guided range.The adjusted EPS expectation has been forecast within the range of $8.01-$8.07, lower than the earlier range of $8.20–$8.30 for the year. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 EPS is pegged at $8.24, much ahead of the current guidance.For the fourth quarter, the company expects revenue in the range of $2.01 billion–$2.05 billion, representing growth of negative 1.8% to positive 0.2% year over year at CER.  Additionally, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be in the range of $2.08–$2.14.Our TakeZimmer Biomet ended the quarter on a dismal note. While earnings remained below the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues were marginally in line with the same. We are disappointed by the company’s declining sales performance within most of its core segments. According to the company, the challenging top-line result was due to the pace of supply recovery of certain key brands, softened domestic market conditions and slower than anticipated sales recapture, particularly in the United States. The lowered 2017 guidance also added to our concerns indicating little chances of recovery ahead.However, we look forward to the ongoing synergy from the LDR Holding acquisition, which should broaden and complement the company’s musculoskeletal offering. We are also impressed by the strong strategic and financial goals which the combined entity expects to reach.Zacks Rank & Key PicksZimmer Biomet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report).

77,ZBH,"On Jun 4, we issued an updated research report on NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report). We are upbeat about the company’s flourishing international business, which holds immense opportunity. However, a highly competitive landscape is a concern for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.This leading global medical device company in the global spine market, focused on developing minimally-disruptive surgical products and procedurally-integrated solutions for the spine, has been outperforming its industry over the past month. The stock has gained 5.8% compared with the industry’s 4.5% rise.We are upbeat about NuVasive’s international business recording above 20% growth for the sixth consecutive quarter in the first quarter of 2018. The company saw strong sales growth across all geographies. Emerging markets also performed well, with strong growth in South Africa and Saudi Arabia. Asia Pacific grew in double-digits with strong results from Japan's reintroduction of XLIF. Further, NuVasive’s healthy cash balance should support its plans to pursue acquisitions and develop products.Meanwhile, the presence of a large number of players has made the medical devices market intensely competitive. The orthopedic industry, in particular, is extremely competitive with the presence of bellwethers like Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH  -  Free Report) and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), among others.Also, margin drag, pricing pressure and reimbursement issues continue to be other major headwinds.Key PickA better-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

79,ZBH,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.  (ZBH  -  Free Report) recently announced the receipt of 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its Zyston Strut Open Titanium Interbody Spacer System, which is expected to revitalize the Spine division. Notably, the product is the company’s first titanium spinal implant to be built using the 3D printing technology.Zyston Strut Open Titanium System in DetailsThe Zyston Strut Open Titanium System is a family of lumbar cages which are available in various sizes to meet patient’s requirements. Further, this system has been developed to increase the strength, capacity of the graft and visualization of the interbody spacer in spinal fusion cases. It also encompasses surgical instruments which enable insertion, manipulation and elimination of the implants.What is 3D Printing Technology?Also known as additive manufacturing, 3D printing is the process of turning a digital model into a solid three-dimensional physical object by adding material layer by layer (per an article on 3D Hubs). Further, 3D printing has also received a warm response from the MedTech space within healthcare. Notably, research firm Future Market Insights expects the global 3D printed medical devices market to see a CAGR of 18.1% between 2017 and 2027.Zimmer Biomet’s latest offering Zyston Strut Open Titanium System, which is built using the 3D printing process, will allow physicians to develop a unique cage architecture that will maximize graft volume before implantation.In 2016, Zimmer Biomet had announced the receipt of 510(k) clearance for the Unite3D Bridge Fixation System, under its Foot & Ankle business. Notably, this innovative product was a result of the combination of the company’s OsseoTi porous metal technology and the 3D printing process.A Glimpse at the Spine DivisionZimmer Biomet’s Spine, Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic (Spine & CMF) segment revenues were down 3.8% at CER in the first quarter of 2018. The company has been facing revenue dissynergies related to its U.S. spine sales force integration. Meanwhile, we are upbeat about the recent FDA nod that is expected to expand the company’s lumbar spacers portfolio, which includes PEEK-Optima, Trabecular Metal Technology and allograft. We note that, Zimmer Biomet has been gaining from a strong uptake of Mobi-C Cervical Disc.Also, the company recently launched products like the Avenue T TLIF Cage as well as Vitality + and Vital Spinal Fixation Systems in the United States.Market PotentialPer a report by Market Research Future, we can safely conclude that this latest development will help Zimmer Biomet to cash in on the opportunities in the spinal implants markets. According to the report, the global spinal implants market is expected to see a CAGR of roughly 5.5% between 2017 and 2023.Price PerformanceOver the past three months, Zimmer Biomet has been observed to underperform its industry. The stock has declined 5.8% compared with 3.1% rise of the industry. We believe the latest FDA 510(k) approval may boost investor’s faith in the stock. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderZimmer Biomet currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc.

80,ZBH,"On Sunday, the U.S. and China put trade tensions aside in hopes of reaching a stable and broad trade agreement. With previously at-risk stocks beginning to rise, there seems to be room for profit in these formerly questionable markets. Read on for three stocks that investors should reconsider as the trade war is put on hold.Stocks to BuyNorbord (OSB  -  Free Report), a manufacturer of wood-based panels, is the first company investors should keep on their radar. Earlier this year, the U.S. had enacted a 25% tariff on imported steel and 10% tariff on imported aluminum. Between President Trump’s announcement and enactment of Tariffs in late February through mid-March, many construction companies reliant on steel for everyday processes were thought to fail. Other construction companies, such as Norbord—a Canadian company that could have been caught in the crossfire if tariffs on other imported goods were imposed, were thought to be the hardest hit, reflective of the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at the time. Still, Norbord continued to thrive, with shares increasing 25% from March 1 to date.Recently, things have become even more bullish for OSB. Current-quarter and next-quarter EPS estimate revisions have seen 100% agreement to the upside, pushing the company to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).On top of this, OSB could considered a great value stock. The company currently sports a P/E ratio of 9.2 and cash flow of $5.74 per share, which compares favorably to industry averages of 23.2 and $3.17 per share.Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) was another company thought to struggle in the face of trade tensions. From late February to late March, share prices dropped 11%, largely due to the Chinese government’s announcement that it may order planes from Boeing’s largest international competitor, Airbus. Boeing was also considered to be in the crosshairs of Chinese retaliation to new U.S. tariffs.But since this point in late March, shares have rebounded 14% to date. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a strong growth stock. With proven historical cash flow growth and a current cash flow growth of an astonishing 37%, the company deserves its “A” grade in the Growth category of our Style Scores System. Boeing also sports a net margin of 9.6%, more than double the industry average of 3.9%.Stocks to ReconsiderWhile investors might consider buying these stocks, options such as Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH  -  Free Report), have potential but are not as clear cut. The medical company saw massive drops in March due to its Chinese ventures and the risk of retribution to U.S. tariffs. During this time period, Zimmer was a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Since this point, the company has risen to a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Zimmer’s share prices had steadily been decreasing before looming trade wars were present, and ultimately were aggravated by threats to U.S.-Chinese relations. Since early April, the stock has fought back slightly, increasing 7.4%.The company’s “B” grade for Value in our Style Scores comes from a drop in share prices relative to a lowering of guidance released in its Q1 earnings report. But when Zimmer’s P/B, P/CF, and P/E ratios are now trading at massive discounts to their industry averages, so we can that this drop has brought the stock to an interesting value territory.Considering the trade war stall, this could be a stock that bounces back and continues to see improvements in share prices. But investors should be worried about continued tension and U.S. action, which would most likely result in fresh volatility.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

82,ZBH,"The trade war cacophony has spread far and wide, not sparing the investment world. The conflict between two of the world’s biggest economies has led Dow to fall more than 1,100 point in just two days last week. Although it is gradually recovering, the market is still fraught with possibilities of other outbreaks.The 10 sectors that have been identified by Trump for imposition of higher tariff are now on investors’ radar. Healthcare, including medical equipment, is one of the sectors which might face the brunt of the trade dispute.Current ScenarioUnlike what most economists had initially expected, China is fast adopting stances to square off America’s advantage points in this import tariff game.In response to Trump’s proposed imposition of $60 billion in annual tariffs on Chinese products, Beijing has announced the initial $3 billion of reciprocal tariff on 128 (roughly) imports from the United States and is supposedly preparing a bolder counter-attack.In the wake of the tariff threats, Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller has warned of an impending economic crisis.Meanwhile, a Bloomberg report states that the United States will maintain a lead in the trade conflicts with China. This is because the United States, to some extent, is a monopsony market with a large number of buyers. Thus, if the nation stops purchasing Chinese products, China will not be able to channelize that surplus to Canada or Indonesia at the same price. However, China will not be able to adopt a tit-for-tat strategy as it does not import on the same scale from the United States.Accordingly, following last week’s crash, the market is slowly looking up. The news that the nations are likely to resolve the issue mutually is fuelling the recovery. However, whether the talks will extinguish the possibilities of a trade war completely is yet to be seen. Meanwhile, investors are caught in the “America First” and “Made in China 2025” web.Is Medical Device Caught in the Storm?As stated earlier, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has identified healthcare as one of the 10 sectors which are subjected to the $60 billion U.S. tariff. More specifically, Trump has considered biomedicine and high-performance medical devices, which include China’s advanced chemicals and medical equipment, respectively.Needless to say, this has triggered a decline in the sector. Following the news and with chances of China’s retaliation, losses were widespread in the Medical device sector with bigwigs taking severe blows. We note that, the sector has gained significantly from profits earned by a number of medical device companies from the BRIC nations.Going by a Market Realist report, companies like Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report), Abbott and others saw considerable weakness on Mar 23 as talks of a U.S.-China trade war started doing the rounds.Although these stocks are gradually reviving on rising chances of the two nations negotiating certain terms, investors consider them still extremely vulnerable and widely exposed to the trade conflict given their huge business network in Mainland China.We have shortlisted three stocks that are facing the brunt of the tumultuous market conditions.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) lost 6.5% on Mar 23. We note that, the company has been investing heavily to cash in on the Chinese Reconstructive and Trauma markets. Strategic investments in these regions over the past several quarters to improve operational and sales performance are yielding results. In the fourth quarter, the company witnessed improvement in its Asia Pacific business on solid distributor orders. China particularly demonstrated strong growth. Thus, any form of retaliation by China will impact the company.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price  Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. QuoteMedtronic: In the last reported quarter, Medtronic’s businesses in China showed strength, growing double digits. According to the company, within the next decade, China is expected to be its biggest health care market. Needless to say, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is expending large amounts of cash to strengthen its business in this market. The company is focused on developing public and private partnerships as well as executing channel optimization strategies.

This Zacks Rank #3 stock’s core Established Pharmaceuticals Division (""EPD"") business operates solely in emerging geographies, with leading positions in Chinese pharmaceutical markets for branded generics. In the last reported quarter as well, China demonstrated double-digit growth in EPD. Trade war or not, these stocks are in an extremely vulnerable position with a broad network and diversified business base in China.Abbott Laboratories Price  Abbott Laboratories Price | Abbott Laboratories QuoteBreaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

87,ZBH,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has commenced on a positive note for most sectors, with a decent picture from the 133 S&P 500 participants that have reported till Jan 26. Total earnings for these companies are up 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating earnings estimates and 78.9% surpassing top-line expectations.Notably, about 121 S&P 500 companies are reporting their earnings this week.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to increase 11.6% on 7.5% growth in revenues. This indicates an improved growth projection from the previous quarter driven by a corporate-tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data. These factors have boosted corporate earnings and stoked investments.Based on this pattern, the fourth quarter is expected to register modest double-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis.MedTech Earnings So FarMedical, one among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to stand out this quarter. The sector benefits from favorable consumer behavior, growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.This is evident from the results of MedTech heavyweights Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report). The companies exited the fourth quarter on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. An upbeat FY18 guidance also instills confidence.For the fourth quarter, the earnings growth rate for the medical sector is pegged at 4.2% on 4.9% revenue growth.Upcoming ReleasesLet’s take a look at three major other MedTech stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Jan 30, 2018:Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) results are scheduled for release after the market closes. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.46 billion, up 9.5% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is $1.95, up 9.6% on a year-over-year basis.Stryker recently announced better-than-expected preliminary net sales results for fourth-quarter 2017. For full-year 2017, net sales are estimated at $12.4 billion, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter on a constant-currency basis. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.38 billion.Buoyed by these prospects, our quantitative model indicates an earnings beat for Stryker this quarter.

88,ZBH,"“At some point in every person's life, you will need an assisted medical device … as you age and you have a hip replacement or a knee replacement or a pacemaker.”In the current context, nothing appears to be more apt than this remark made by Aimee Mullins (an American athlete). Considering the growing prominence of the orthopedics industry, it seems that the ''prosthetic generation is indeed all around us!''Per a new market intelligence report by BIS Research published by CISION, the global orthopedics devices market was worth $40.20 billion in 2016. It is estimated to be worth $61.02 billion by the end of 2023, at a CAGR of 6.1% with joint reconstruction and replacement devices segment being the highest revenue generator.In 2015, North America (51.4%) had the highest share in the orthopedics devices market and is expected to lead the same through 2024. Encouragingly, Asia Pacific is also estimated to catch up with a CAGR of 8.6% through 2024 in the niche space (per a Grand View Research report published by Becker's Healthcare).Thus, for investors who are keen on placing a bet on the healthcare space for long-term gains, the orthopedics market undoubtedly holds immense potential.Here, we take a look at five major factors that have been driving  the global orthopedic industry in the last couple of years.Major Market MoversAgeing PopulaceOne of the major factors driving the orthopedic market is aging population. Per a WHO report published by Global Market Insights, the population above 60 is expected to be 2 billion globally by 2050.Poor Life StylePoor eating habits, smoking, drinking and lack of physical activity will also drive demand for orthopedics market. Rising healthcare expenditures, unhealthy lifestyle practices along with expanded treatment options have been driving demand. Per a report by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services published by Advisory Board, U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of GDP (based on the assumption that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).Rising Incidence of DiabetesDiabetes and obesity will also fuel growth of this market. Globally, the diabetes market is expected to touch $66,053.1 million, at a CAGR of 6.7% between 2016 and 2025 (per a Transparency Market Research report).Positive Tidings on the Regulatory FrontThe orthopedic market is riding high on recent FDA nods and product launches. Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report)  reached a new milestone in the field of total shoulder arthroplasty with the recent FDA approval for its SidusStem-Free Shoulder system. Furthermore, the company launched the Vitality+ and Vital Spinal Fixation Systems in the United States, along with the global launch of Persona Partial Knee System.NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) announced the receipt of FDA clearance for the company's PRECICE system from NuVasive Specialized Orthopedics (NSO). Further, Smith & Nephew (SNN  -  Free Report) announced the full commercial release of bi-cruciate retaining JOURNEY II XR total knee arthroplasty (“TKA”) in the United States and Japan recently.Robotic Surgery Boosting OrthopedicsMedical technology companies are trying to expand through robots rather than complex surgeries. Per a report by Technavio, the global orthopedic surgical robots market is estimated to witness CAGR of around 47% by 2021. In view of the abovementioned factor, a number of bigwigs are spending a lump sum on R&D to continuously innovate and develop devices with improved efficacy and no side effects.In this regard, one of the most noteworthy is Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report). Mako is Stryker’s robotic-arm assisted surgery platform. Recently, Stryker launched the robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty application for use with its Mako System.Medical device major Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of Orthotaxy. This is a privately-held developer of software-enabled surgery technologies, including a differentiated robotic-assisted surgery solution.3D Printing in ActionAnother technology which orthopedic device companies are trying to leverage is 3D printing. Per a report by Future Market Insights published by CISION, orthopedic implants in the application category of the global 3D printed medical devices market are expected to be worth $970 million in the 2017-2027 time frame at a CAGR of 19.2%. In this regard, Stryker’s Tritanium TL Curved Posterior Lumbar Cage is a 3D-printed interbody fusion cage intended for use as an aid in lumbar fixation. This device recently won FDA nod.3 Stocks in FocusWe have selected three companies, which we believe are well poised given the encouraging prospects of the orthopedics market.Stryker Corporation: This company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.8%.  The current-quarter estimate revision trend for the stock has been encouraging with five estimates moving upward, compared to two downward movements in the past two months. Resultantly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate increased around 0.6% to $1.60 per share. The company’s five-year historical growth rate is also favorable at 10.1% compared with the industry’s 5.7% and the S&P 500’s 2.8%. Stryker's share price movement over the past year has been favorable. The company yielded a return of almost 26.3%, better than the industry's 17.1%. Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report): This company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The company’s five-year earnings growth rate  of 14.3% also compares favorably with the S&P 500’s 9.4%. Over the past three months, shares of Orthofix have outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has gained 51.9% compared with the industry’s 17.1% rise. This company recently announced FDA approval and U.S. limited market launch of the FORZA XP Expandable Spacer System.Johnson & Johnson: This company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.8%.  Estimate revisions for the current year have been solid with 10 estimates moving upward, compared to one movement in the opposite direction over the past two months. Resultantly, the consensus estimate increased around 3.2% to $8.11 per share. The company’s five-year historical growth rate  of 7%  also compares favorably with the industry’s 3.1% and the S&P 500’s 2.8%.Shares have increased 8.3% in the past month, comparing favorably with a 0.4% increase witnessed by its industry. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process.

(ZBH  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Zimmer Biomet has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.5. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Zimmer Biomet’s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 15.8) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 22.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Zimmer Biomet has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.0, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Zimmer Biomet’s stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Zimmer Biomet has a P/S ratio of about 3.1. This is marginally lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Zimmer Biomet currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ZBH a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Zimmer Biomet is just 1.5, a level that is noticeably lower than the industry average of 2.6. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 8.9, which is considerably better than the industry average of 19.2. Clearly, ZBH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Zimmer Biomet might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of D. This gives ZBH a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen eleven estimates go lower in the past sixty days, compared to none higher, while the full year estimate has seen fifteen downward and no upward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 1.1% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has dipped 0.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus  Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineZimmer Biomet is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 37% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

93,ZBH,"In a bid to expand its advanced materials science range, NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) recently announced the Vertera Spine buyout. However, the terms of the acquisition agreement have been kept under wraps.NuVasive, a pioneer in applying procedurally-integrated solutions for minimally disruptive spine surgeries, aims to market and distribute Vetera Spine’s FDA-approved COHERE Cervical and COALESCETM Lumbar Interbody fusion devices in the United States. This deal will also lend the company a three-dimensional porous interbody technology across both polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and titanium materials. Notably, the company has introduced a few new features in its Modulus XLIF built on a fully-porous titanium implant created in a three-dimensional manufacturing process and designed to match the porosity and stiffness of bone.We encouragingly note that the company’s U.S. Spinal Hardware business, comprising implants and fixation products, MAGEC-EOS spinal bracing and lengthening system and the PRECICE limb lengthening system, registered 3% growth in the last reported quarter. NuVasive is leaving no stone unturned to gain traction in the fast growing spine market. In this regard, the company has been steadily focusing on product development.  Moreover, the company claims to have an active corporate development pipeline that includes a number of strategic investments, acquisitions and partnership opportunities. Notably, during the first quarter of 2017, the company launched the first two interbody devices, MLX and TLX, used in lumbar fusion procedures.Per a report from BECKER’s SPINE REVIEW, the global minimally-invasive spine surgery market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.6% between 2017 and 2021. Also, per a report by Technavio, the global spinal implants market is expected to witness a CAGR of roughly 6% in the 2016-2020 period.Thus, given the current market potential, we believe that the company is on the right track to gain traction.We believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the minimally-invasive spine surgery market. However, this market is dominated by many well-established players like Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report). Notably, Stryker provides a range of products with ES2 Spinal systems, MANTIS implants, LITe Decompression tubes and many more under its minimally invasive spine surgical solutions portfolio. Moreover, Zimmer Biomet’s range of thoracolumbar products forms a comprehensive portfolio for minimally-invasive spine surgery.Over the past three months, NuVasive has underperformed the broader industry. In this period, the company has lost 24.1%, as compared to the 0.8% gain of the broader industry. We expect the company to make a comeback with the latest developments.Zacks Rank & Key PickNuVasive carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

95,ZBH,"On Dec 22, we issued an updated research report on Warsaw, IN-based Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report). The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Over the last six months, this leading musculoskeletal healthcare company has been trading below the broader industry on macroeconomic uncertainties, pricing pressure and unfavorable currency fluctuations. The stock has lost 6.3% of its value versus the broader industry's 2.3% gain.Per management, Zimmer Biomet is grappling with headwinds such as supply delay of certain products — causing its inability to win back lost customers in the United States and tap the new ones — softened domestic market conditions, the impact of consecutive hurricanes and a significant price reduction in the Indian knee market. The trimmed 2017 guidance, issued last quarter during the result announcement, adds to our concerns indicating little chances of recovery ahead.The estimate revision trend for 2017 also remains unfavorable with 17 estimates having moved south and none in the opposite direction over the past couple of months. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 21 cents downward over this period to $8.03 per share.On a positive note, we look forward to the synergies expected to be drawn from the recently completed LDR Holding acquisition, which should broaden and complement the company's musculoskeletal offering.

We also pin high hopes on the strong tactical and financial goals the combined entity aims to reach, now that the deal has been sealed.Zimmer Biomet has been of late working to fortify its foothold in the emerging markets with potential to provide long-term opportunities.

99,ZBH,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report) is expected to beat earnings when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.95%. However, it reported an average beat of 0.36% for two of the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, the company is expected to gain from strength in the S.E.T. (Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) arm. Revenues at S.E.T. were driven by surgical business and sports medicine offerings such as Gel-One, Subchondroplasty and Quattro Link in the last reported quarter. Moreover, solid uptake of the A.L.P.S. Plating System within the foot and ankle portfolio boosted the segment’s performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for S.E.T. revenues of $411 million reflects an increase of 2.2% from the year-ago quarter. Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Quote We are also upbeat about the Spine, Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic (Spine & CMF) segment, which is expected to deliver another quarter of promising performance. Under the spine category, Zimmer Biomet should continue to gain from strong uptake of Mobi-C Cervical Disc. Moreover, though at the initial phase of integration, the LDR Holdings acquisition is expected to contribute approximately 30 basis points to the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, management is hopeful of gaining from significant cross-selling opportunities that the LDR acquisition provides on the back of integrated spine sales force in the United States.Also, continued solid uptake of SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems as well as the RibFix Blu Thoracic Fixation System within craniomaxillofacial and thoracic arm buoys optimism.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Spine & CMF revenues of $188 million indicates a rise of 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Zimmer Biomet’s third-quarter results:Looking at the focused execution of Zimmer Biomet’s sales teams, we expect the global adoption rate of the company’s flagship personalized knee system — Persona — to be impressive. In this regard, in September, the company announced the launch of the Persona Partial Knee System. This is the latest addition to its portfolio of personalized and anatomically designed knee implant systems. Also, in June, Zimmer Biomet announced the release of its X-ray-based Patient Specific Instrument, X-PSI Knee System. This is the world's first CE-Marked surgical planning system that allows for patient-specific implant positioning, solely utilizing X-ray technology. These developments are expected to boost the top line in the third quarter.Emerging markets have always been a significant revenue generating source for Zimmer Biomet. Despite the recent economic downturn which affected Zimmer Biomet’s business in Latin America, the company managed to drive growth through its operations in other parts of the emerging market, especially the Asia-Pacific and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from EMEA of $379 million indicates an improvement of 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, Zimmer Biomet expects third-quarter revenues in the range of $1.815-$1.845 billion, reflecting a negative impact from foreign exchange of 0.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter total revenues is pegged at $1.83 billion.However, factors like macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable currency fluctuations have been adversely denting Zimmer Biomet’s sales over the past few quarters. Moreover, the company has also been dealing with pricing pressure issue. In this regard, Zimmer Biomet faced a negative pricing pressure of approximately 2.6% in the second-quarter. Thus, in absence of any favorable changes in this line, the company may continue to face these headwinds in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Meanwhile, for the second half of 2017, management continues to expect the adverse impact from reduced sales expectations, continued spending in critical programs and rising manufacturing costs from Warsaw North Campus facility to persist.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Zimmer Biomet does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Zimmer Biomet is -0.38%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Zimmer Biomet carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.75 reflects a 2.2% decline on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.

102,ZBH,"NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) received an expanded 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its TLX interbody system. The TLX interbody system is inserted through a conventional transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) approach. TLX implants can be placed easily into the disc space due to their low profile, bulleted design. TLX is designed for a minimally-invasive spine surgery approach.TLX interbodies were available in 15 degree lordotic options and were only indicated for use with allograft before the receipt of the approval. According to the company, new clearance includes an expandable 20 degree interbody and broader indications for use, including use with allogeneic bone graft and in additional levels of the spine. The TLX system's size offers many options for varying patient size and anatomic considerations.The TLX interbody system, combined with the Integrated Global Alignment (iGA) suite of the company’s software, has the ability to improve overall TLIF procedures.Notably, NuVasive is currently leaving no stone unturned to cash in on the rapidly-evolving spine market. During the last reported second quarter of 2017, the company’s core U.S. spinal hardware business maintained the bullish trend with 3% growth. The upside was driven by strong adoption of ReLine posterior fixation system within the company’s iGA platform. The company also witnessed a steady uptake of its recently-launched expandable interbody cages and base TI interfixated within the ALIF procedure.Meanwhile, the company recently closed the acquisition of Vertera Spine, a start-up company in the spine space. NuVasive also announced the commercial launch of LessRay software technology system. It particularly works to help address overexposure to radiation in hospital operating rooms (O.R.), mostly in the case of minimally invasive spine surgery (MIS).According to a report by GlobalData, the global market for spinal fusion is expected to rise around $9 billion by 2023, at a CAGR of 3.4%. Considering the substantial potential of the market, we believe the latest development is a strategic one.The spine market is dominated by many well-established players like Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report) and RTI Surgical (RTIX  -  Free Report), among others.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

104,ZBH,"Per a Sep 18 article published on Duke University website, NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) has reportedly closed another acquisition. This time, it is a start-up company called Vertera Spine, created through research at both Duke University and the Georgia Institute of Technology. However, financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.NuVasive, which has just extended its global headquarter in San Diego, currently focuses on applying procedurally-integrated solutions for minimally disruptive spine surgeries. The latest development remains part of this strategy, having steadily strengthened NuVasive’s global position.The company aims to market and distribute Vetera Spine’s FDA-approved COHERE Cervical and COALESCETM Lumbar Interbody fusion devices in the United States.This acquisition has also lent the company a three-dimensional porous interbody technology across both polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and titanium materials. Notably, the company has introduced a few new features in its Modulus XLIF, built on a fully-porous titanium implant and created in three-dimensional manufacturing process as well as designed to match the porosity and stiffness of bone.It is encouraging to note that the company’s U.S. Spinal Hardware business, comprising implants and fixation products like MAGEC-EOS spinal bracing and lengthening system plus the PRECICE limb lengthening system, registered 3% growth in the recently reported quarter. NuVasive is therefore leaving no stone unturned to gain traction in this fast-growing spine market.In this regard, the company has been steadily focusing on product development.  It claims to possess an active corporate development pipeline that includes a number of strategic investments, acquisitions and partnership opportunities. Notably, during the first quarter of 2017, the company launched the first two interbody devices, MLX and TLX, used in lumbar fusion procedures.Per a report from Becker’s Spine Review, the global minimally-invasive spine surgery market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.6% between 2017 and 2021. Also, per a report by Technavio, the global spinal implants market is expected to witness a CAGR of roughly 6% in the 2016-2020 period.Thus, given the current market potential, we believe the company is on the right track to gain traction. We also believe that an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle, rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in this minimally-invasive spine surgery market.However, this market is also dominated by many well-established players like Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report) and RTI Surgical (RTIX  -  Free Report) among others. Notably, Stryker provides a range of products with ES2 Spinal systems, MANTIS implants, LITe Decompression tubes and many more under minimally-invasive spine surgical solutions portfolio. Zimmer Biomet’s collection of thoracolumbar products forms a comprehensive portfolio for minimally-invasive spine surgery.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

105,ZBH,"Indiana-based Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report), a leading player in the global musculoskeletal space, recently announced second-quarter 2017 preliminary results. The company is slated to report its consolidated quarterly results on Jul 27, before the market opens.Zimmer expects second-quarter net revenues at around $1.95 billion, up 1.1% over the prior-year quarter and 2.1% on a constant exchange rate (CER) basis. The assessed revenues for the quarter, however, were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  Moreover, the figure falls within the company’s second-quarter revenue guidance of $1.94–$1.96 billion, reflecting a rise of 2.4–3.4% at CER. Per management, favorable foreign currency exchange rates have driven the numbers.Without considering the 240-basis point contribution from the LDR Holding Corporation acquisition, adjusted expected revenues will decline by 0.3% at CER. This remains below the company’s earlier-projected guidance growth of 0.0–1.0% on CER basis. The company also expects adjusted earnings for second-quarter 2017 within or around the bottom end of its projected guidance range of $2.08–$2.13. The company’s expectations are almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.10.Per management, the company is still grappling with headwinds such as the shortage in supply of some products which have led to the inability to recapture lost customers in the U.S. and gain new ones. On a positive note, the production levels at the Warsaw facility witnessed considerable improvement.In this regard we note that, over the recent past, the company has been working toward enhancing its performance and boosting market share. Thus, the company launched its CE marked X-ray-based Patient Specific Instrument – X-PSI Knee System – in Jun 2017. This latest development was part of the lucrative knee business. Notably, the knee segment contributed 35.51% to total revenues in the reported first quarter of fiscal 2017.Considering Zimmer’s net EBIT synergies, the company is steadily moving toward its goal to achieve a cumulative target of $350 million by mid-2018, with roughly $310 million of cumulative net benefit derived by year-end 2017. This demonstrates $85 million of incremental synergies in fiscal 2017.The preliminary numbers and promising prospects have however failed to boost market sentiments. Moreover, the market seems to be apprehensive about the departure of Zimmer’s decade old CEO David C. Dvorak. However, Mr. Dvorak will continue to serve in an advisory role along with the interim CEO Daniel P. Florin, currently the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, till the company selects a suitable person for this position. Thus, Zimmer’s shares were down 0.71% to $126.49 on the day of announcement of both the news.Zimmer has been lagging the broader Medical Instruments market, gaining 5.7% as compared to the industry’s 10.0% over the last three months. However, the company has outperformed the 4.4% gain of the S&P 500 market over the same time frame. The latest positive news is expected to provide some impetus to the company in the niche market. Zacks Rank & Key PicksZimmer currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few other better-ranked medical stocks are ABIOMED, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report), Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report).

Thus, the company’s effort to solidify its global footprint seems to be strategically aligned.Per a report from BECKER’s SPINE REVIEW, the global minimally invasive spine surgery market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.6% between 2017 and 2021.

The 2017 IDEA contest noted hundreds of entries from 54 countries in six continents.A significant development in the company’s knee segment Truliant Knee System offers advanced approaches to total knee replacement surgeries, with a clinically-recognized platform of proven implants and personalized surgical workflows.Exclusivity of the Truliant System is embedded in its ergonomic instrumentation design, which enables surgeons to make appropriate bone cuts and adjustments to the joint during total knee arthroplasty.

This is an advanced software application that provides systematic computer guidance to orthopedic surgeons during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures.Though Exactech might benefit from the solid prospects in the Total Knee Replacement market, it will face tough competition from the likes of Zimmer Biomet Holdings, INC. (ZBH  -  Free Report), which offers the iASSIST knee Personalized Guidance System for knee replacement procedures.Exactech plans a complete commercial launch of TKA PLUS software application in 2018. This product development is in line with the company’s objective to gain traction in the huge and untapped Total Knee Replacement market.

108,ZBH,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on Warsaw, IN-based Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report), a leading musculoskeletal healthcare company. It designs and distributes orthopedic reconstructive products, spine, bone healing, thoracic products, dental implants and related surgical products.Over the last three months, Zimmer Biomet was trading below the industry on factors like macroeconomic uncertainties, pricing pressure and unfavorable currency fluctuations. The stock has till now lost 4.5% compared against the industry’s 4% gain.With the company delivering a dull second-quarter result, we expect this downside to continue in the upcoming period. Per management, the company is still fighting headwinds such as slump in knee business, shortage in supply of some products, thus leading to inability to recapture the lost customers across the United States and gain new ones. Also, the trimmed 2017 guidance adds to our concerns indicating slim chances of recovery ahead.The market also seems to be apprehensive about the departure of Zimmer Biomet’s decade-old CEO David C. Dvorak. Notably, during his 10-year tenure, Zimmer Biomet has transformed into a global leader in musculoskeletal healthcare. Through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions, the company’s revenue has doubled in this phase and it has introduced a broad portfolio of technologies, solutions and personalized services.Only time will tell if the stepping down of Drovak leaves an adverse impact on the company’s business. Currently, we remain on the sidelines until further visibility is obtained on this matter.On a positive note, we look forward to the ongoing synergy from the LDR Holding acquisition, which should broaden and complement the company’s musculoskeletal offering. This is in line with the strategy to grow through inorganic means by focusing on mega mergers.Management is also striving to develop a strong spine portfolio in order to cash in on the opportunities. The company’s spine offerings such as Mobi-C Cervical Disc prosthesis and Vitality Spinal Fixation System showed a considerable progress in performance.Zimmer Biomet has been of late working to strengthen its foothold in the emerging markets providing long-term opportunities. The company’s strategic investments in these regions over several quarters with a view to enhance operational and sales performance are yielding results.Zacks Rank & Key PicksZimmer Biomet currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some of the better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 EPS is pegged at $8.51, much ahead of the current guidance.Our TakeZimmer Biomet ended the quarter on a mixed note. While earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues remained in line with the same. We are disappointed by the company’s declining sales performance within several of its core segments. The trimemd 2017 guidance also added to our concerns indicating little chances of recovery ahead. Nevertheless, improved gross and operating margin performance was encouraging.We look forward to the expected synergy from the LDR Holding acquisition, which should broaden and complement the company’s musculoskeletal offering. We are also impressed by the strong strategic and financial goals which the combined entity expects to reach, now that the deal has been closed.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, Zimmer Biomet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.
