1,HFC,"After missing out on the 2017 stock market rally, the energy sector is having a better 2018, and now several oil ETFs are providing some of the opportunities that eluded them last year.First Trust Energy AlphaDEX (FXN) is trying to capitalize on the new trend with a portfolio of nearly 50 stocks in oilfield services, refinery, production, drilling and related companies.IBD's international oil exploration and production industry group — where four of the ETF's stocks reside — has climbed about 9% year to date.More than 20 of the companies in First Trust Energy AlphaDEX are part of IBD's U.S. exploration and production industry group, which is up about 8%. Refineries and gas stations (seven in the ETF) are up about 8% as a group and include some of the ETF's best picks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHollyFrontier (HFC) has rallied about 45% since April 5, when the stock broke out to new highs. PBF Energy (PBF) also broke out in early April and is up nearly 24% from a 37.11 buy point.IBD's energy sector is up about 5% year-to-date after finishing 2017 barely 1% higher, missing out on most of the S&P 500's 19.4% gain. To be sure, the sector's returns lag software, semiconductors, internet, apparel and other sectors.Energy stocks also are sensitive to the price of crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas, which adds an element of risk that is lacking in other sectors. On Friday and Saturday, the energy sector faces potential volatility as OPEC and other major oil producers meet to discuss output targets.First Trust Energy AlphaDEX's performance has roughly correlated with the price of U.S. crude, and both are up almost the same in 2018. The connection to oil prices is a big reason why the ETF has underperformed in the long term. Through the end of March, the ETF was down 10.8%, 7.3% and 3.6% in three-, five- and 10-year periods.The $389.6 million fund has about a 9% gain for the year, and it is finding support in a pullback to the 50-day moving average. This leaves shares in a buy area, one in which it's best to buy as close as possible to the 50-day average (now around 16.30).First Trust Energy AlphaDEX uses a selection methodology that grades stocks on three-, six- and 12-month price performance, one-year sales growth, certain valuation factors, and other items. All stocks are chosen from the Russell 1000, which makes the fund primarily a mid- and large-cap asset. The median market capitalization for all holdings is $11.9 billion.RELATED:Best Oil Stocks: Top Oil And Gas Producers Make Case For More GainsU.S. Crude Inventories Fall, Output Flat; Iran, Saudi Arabia Clash LoomsEnergy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

2,HFC,"More than $1 billion a day. That's the price tag for a Permian Basin pipeline crunch that's increasingly affecting investors as much as it is West Texas oil drillers.Eight of the top explorers focused on the booming U.S. shale region have lost $15.6 billion in combined market value in about two weeks, as shipping constraints devour the profit they can fetch for a barrel of crude. Parsley Energy (PE) shares have wilted 16% in that time; Diamondback Energy (FANG) has been defanged, down 18%.Even as production soars, dwindling pipeline space and a rail and trucking shortage have raised shipping costs, boosting the discount Permian producers take to offload their oil. The bottleneck benefits refiners who can buy cheaper crude and pipeline owners with extra space, but it's dragging down explorers.""You just don't want to touch these Permian names,"" said Gabriele Sorbara, a Williams Capital Group analyst in New York. ""They are falling off a cliff.""Relief may not come until 2020, when new pipelines are expected to be up and running. For now, here's a rundown of winners and losers amid the space crunch:Being a ""pure play"" shale producer, even a Permian stalwart, is no longer the ticket to success for energy equities.Since May 21, the price of benchmark West Texas intermediate crude has fallen about 10% and companies focused primarily on the Permian have been shunned. The hardest fall: Concho Resources (CXO), which has lost $4.1 billion off its market capitalization as of Tuesday.As of Wednesday, oil in Midland, Texas, was trading for about $19 a barrel below Brent crude, the global benchmark price.Even Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), with relatively strong finances and secure pipeline contracts, has been swept up, Williams Capital's Sorbara said by phone. It's lost $3.2 billion in market value, or 9%, since May 21.While the shortages are real, he deems much of the market sell-off ""overblown,"" since even discounted Permian crude is selling for well above where many producers set their budgets earlier this year.Investors, though, are fleeing to the relative safety of larger names with more diverse portfolios such as Occidental Petroleum (OXY), whose shares are flat over the past couple weeks. The Permian's biggest oil producer also pumps in the Middle East and Colombia, with roughly 40% of its output this year based on higher international crude pricing, Capital One Securities said in an analyst note.The company also operates pipelines and a Gulf Coast export terminal that will benefit from cheaper U.S. crude prices. ""The largest companies or companies with diverse portfolios can rotate capital around,"" Sorbara said. ""If you're a pure play, the only thing you can do is step on the brakes.""With bottlenecks between the Permian and major Gulf Coast refiners, operators in other parts of the country served by less-congested pipelines have a relative advantage, analysts say.That includes Delek US (DK), CVR Refining (CVRR) and HollyFrontier (HFC), with refineries in New Mexico, Arkansas and northeastern Texas, among other locations, according to Barclays. Delek gets about 78% of its crude from the Permian, HollyFrontier gets 39% and CVR gets 14%, the bank said in a June 5 analyst report.Delek shares have climbed 7.5% in the past two weeks while CVR is up 3.3% and HollyFrontier is up 1%.""Simply put, we think U.S. refiners win big with lower input costs,"" analysts including Justin Jenkins at Raymond James & Associates said in a June 4 note.Enterprise Products Partners and Magellan Midstream Partners also stand to benefit from the blowout in Midland prices as they own crucial pipelines in the Permian and dock space on the Gulf used for exports — and have plans to add more.""The very idea of congestion is beneficial,"" said Sandy Fielden, director of oil research at Chicago-based Morningstar. ""If I'm going to pitch my new pipeline or expand my pipeline, and I'm going to hold my open season, I can expect to see a full crowd there anxious to sign up quickly.""Enterprise started full service in April on its 416-mile Midland-to-Sealy pipeline, which can carry some 575,000 barrels per day of crude from the heart of the Permian to key export facilities in Houston. They also own the lion's share of crude storage tanks and docks along the Gulf.Magellan operates and owns part of the 400,000-barrel-a-day BridgeTex pipeline, transporting oil from the Permian to Corpus Christi, Texas. That route is scheduled for expansion in early 2019 because of added interest. The company said last month that almost all existing customers on its Longhorn pipeline, connecting the Permian to Houston, have renewed their contracts for two years.

3,HFC,"With an oil renaissance underway in the United States, it's a good time to be a refiner, especially when you're HollyFrontier (HFC) and at the forefront of American energy stocks.As favorable economic conditions fatten margins, HollyFrontier's shares are surging. It's sitting in a sweet spot, reaping the benefit of low acquisition costs for crude oil. Yet it sells refined petroleum under a higher pricing standard.""The whole refining space is the beneficiary of a fairly wide spread between Brent crude oil in Europe and the North American-based WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil,"" CFRA analyst Stewart Glickman told Investor's Business Daily.The current pricing dynamic for Dallas-based HollyFrontier is simple. The company says 100% of its purchased crude barrels are WTI-based. That means its local crude acquisition costs are driven off what is now a low WTI price. But once it refines the product and sends it out to customers like Shell (RDSA) — one of its biggest customers — it's able to sell into global markets under the more costly Brent standard under which overseas refiners operate.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseRight now, that gap is roughly $5 a barrel, and Glickman says the spread is widening. That can be attributed to ""fairly good"" compliance with output cuts by OPEC and Russia. Further, U.S. shale production that has ""surprised to the upside,"" Glickman said.Another thing working in HollyFrontier's favor is the location of its refineries, mostly in the middle of the U.S. Analysts say it's unusual compared with other refiners, many of whom are centered in the Gulf Coast region.""Although it's smaller than its Gulf Coast peers, (HollyFrontier's) refineries are competitively well positioned,"" Morningstar analyst Allen Good said in a Feb. 22 report.HollyFrontier operates five refineries across the U.S., located in Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. In particular, a competitive advantage for HollyFrontier is its proximity to the Canadian border.""Canadian crude is extremely price disadvantaged right now,"" Glickman noted. ""If you are a Canadian producer trying to export your crude to the U.S., there's an awful lot of production and very little take-away capacity.""That results in even lower initial crude prices, and ""that disadvantage for Canada works in HollyFrontier's favor,"" Glickman said.Of the 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day HollyFrontier refines, some 80,000 to 100,000 barrels of that are from Canada. The other base oil comes from the Bakken shale formation, Permian Basin and other hot shale-drilling spots.HollyFrontier stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 50.60 buy point on April 4. Volume on the breakout was lighter than average, which isn't ideal. Heavy volume on a breakout indicates institutional support.Still, the relative strength line hit a new high before the stock hit a new price high, which is bullish. The line is continuing higher along the run. The relative strength line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500.Shares are now extended roughly 15% from the buy point, and were flat in Friday trading to near 58.25.While energy stocks have been on a steady climb as of late, oil refining is a ""volatile and competitive"" industry, Glickman said in a March 22 report.For now, that volatility has been to the upside. Crude oil prices hit a more than three-year high of $69 per barrel Thursday. According to S&P Global Platts-owned PIRA Energy Group, the projected price for WTI is $68 per barrel this year and $63 per barrel in 2019.The volatility of the price of crude has an impact on energy stocks. Glickman says, though, it's less important if WTI ""slips a bit"" than if the spread between it and Brent remains high.""As long as that spread remains high, (HollyFrontier) should be fine,"" he said.Morningstar's Good expects the spread ""to remain wider than historical levels (before 2010) when WTI and Brent traded close to par. Ultimately, we think the transportation costs to move light crude from the midcontinent to the Gulf Coast result in a long-term WTI average differential to Brent of $5 per barrel.""HollyFrontier primarily plays in the downstream, or refining, space. Through its majority stake in master limited partnership Holly Energy Partners (HEP), it also has midstream, or transportation and storage, operations.Glickman notes that the MLP model itself is not a concern. But the increasing level of distributable cash flow, which HollyFrontier benefits from as the general partner, could potentially result in Holly Energy Partner's abandonment of the MLP structure.Aside from its relationship with Holly Energy Partners and crude-margin tightening, another potential concern for HollyFrontier is regulatory risk. A new regulation that makes it more difficult for HollyFrontier to obtain, ship or refine product could weigh on margins, Glickman said. But he also noted that risk is ""part and parcel"" for any investment in the oil and gas industry.The shale boom in recent years has no doubt reinvigorated the oil and gas industry in the United States.""Shale has a seat at the big-boy table,"" Maynard Holt, chief executive of energy industry-focused investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., told IBD at the CERAWeek oil and gas conference in Houston earlier this year. ""Shale is here, it's in a politically stable place which just improved its tax regime, where services are plenty, were labor is plenty, where you deal with landowners and not governments. It is arguably the best place on the planet if you're choosing where you want to invest (in the oil industry).""HollyFrontier is seeing a big benefit from corporate tax reform, with its rate shrinking to 21% from 35%.""The reforms to the U.S. tax code encourage capital investments and lower the corporate rate to better enable manufacturers to compete in the global market,"" HollyFrontier Chief Executive George Damiris said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Feb. 21.HollyFrontier is increasing its capital expenditures this year to $450 million from $275 million in 2017. While that is a ""big step up,"" Glickman says this is a ""very acceptable problem"" since the company is generating over $1 billion in cash flow.Another way HollyFrontier could get more competitive vs. other energy stocks would be through an acquisition. But the company is being decidedly conservative on that front.""We've seen a number of deals in 2017 that we participated in the process but didn't end up winning, obviously, otherwise we'd have announced the deal. We're going to continue to look and only pull the trigger when we see value,"" Damiris said on the call.HollyFrontier is set to issue first-quarter results before the open on May 2. The company is expected to swing to a profit of 38 cents a share vs. a loss of 19 cents a share last year, according to analysts with Zacks Investment Research. Revenue is projected to rise 9% to $3.36 billion, a deceleration from the prior quarter's 35% sales growth.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksCrude Oil Prices Are Up Sharply, But Is The Bakken Shale Play Back?

5,HFC,"Energy is perhaps beginning to gain a larger presence in IBD's new highs list, be it oil and gas or alternatives such as solar energy. And SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and ConocoPhillips (COP) are making some noise in the form of sharp new highs.SolarEdge cleared a narrow, tight consolidation as shares got as high as 59.20, up 4.7%, before retreating. Despite the reversal, gains for the week are still robust.Notice on a weekly chart how the expert in inverters, which turn photovoltaic power into usable electricity, has not touched its 10-week moving average since its breakout during the week ended Feb. 16. A first or second test of the 10-week line usually presents a lower-risk opportunity to add shares to a winning position in the stock.So, what can you do when the stock refuses to come close to even pricking the 10-week moving average?For aggressive investors, one suggestion is to engage in an advanced buying technique. In SolarEdge's case, a move past 58.30, 10 cents above the March 27 peak, in strong volume offers a place to add a very small number of shares. Never buy the same amount as you normally would at a proper breakout point. The reason? To avoid your overall cost per share from running up too fast.This advanced follow-on entry point is based on the method that IBD founder Bill O'Neil used to find ways to buy more shares in some of his biggest stock market winners, including Pic N Save (now known as Big Lots (BIG)) and Amgen (AMGN). After a stock wages a strong run-up, find a period of two to four weeks in which the stock does not fall much and trades relatively tight. Volume should be dull. Then buy as the stock clears the highest price within such a narrow consolidation.In the case of SolarEdge, the stock fell 0.8% and 2.6% during the final two weeks of March. Those are paltry declines compared with the 37% ascent achieved in the prior five weeks. Plus, volume shrank below average during both of those down weeks.SolarEdge is No. 1 in the IBD 50.On Feb. 15, the stock catapulted past a 39.75 buy point in a somewhat stretched-out double bottom. In this key chart pattern, the stock makes two lows, and the second low must undercut the first one.SolarEdge passes this test as the 30.80 low easily went below the first low of 32.90 seen on Dec. 1. Add 10 cents to the middle peak in between the lows to mark the proper buy point.ConocoPhillips, meanwhile is busting out of a nine-week cup with a 61.41 entry. At midday, volume was running bullishly strong, 61% above usual levels. No proper handle was formed, so one can find the buy point by adding 10 cents to the cup's left-side peak.The 5% buy zone goes up to 64.48.The Houston-based member of IBD's international oil and gas E&P group is expected to earn $2.78 a share in 2018, up 363% from 2017 and the biggest profits since 2014, when it earned $5.30 a share. The large-cap firm has significant interests in the North Atlantic waters and Norway, as well as in the Asian-Pacific region.Wall Street sees Conoco's revenue growing 14% to $8.88 billion in the first quarter of this year and 8% overall in 2018 to $35.11 billion.On Tuesday, West Texas intermediate crude oil prices rose 3.1% to $65.39 a barrel and are up 8% year to date.HollyFrontier (HFC) — maker of diesel, jet fuel and other light derivatives from petroleum — raced into new high ground Tuesday.

Here are five energy stocks with compelling chart action: ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero Energy (VLO), Hollyfrontier (HFC), Wildhorse Resource (WRD) and Viper Energy Partners (VNOM).U.S. crude rose 0.5% Friday to settle at $67.39 a barrel, marking a weekly gain of 8.6% and hitting the highest level since late 2014. Brent crude gained 0.8% to $72.58 a barrel for a weekly increase of 8.2%.U.S. crude futures fell 1.7% to $66.22 a barrel on Monday as investors saw Syria tensions contained following U.S.-led airstrikes on Saturday. If oil prices retreat significantly, crude-related stocks will struggle to advance or even maintain current levels.But the five stocks cited here continued to rally.Small-cap shale play Viper Energy, a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy (FANG) leads the group with a near-best Composite Rating of 98. Wildhorse Resource, another shale play, earns a 97.

Wildhorse came public in December 2016.The three other energy stocks, ConocoPhillips, Viper Energy Partners and Hollyfrontier, are now further extended from buy range. While you never want to chase a stock more than 5% past a buy point, many leaders will pull back into buy range. Keep in mind, however, that you want to see light volume on the pullback, rather than rapid selling.ConocoPhillips rose 1.3% on Monday to 65.73, further extended from a 61.41 buy point cleared several sessions ago.Viper Energy Partners cleared a 26.29 entry point on April 5, becoming extended on Friday. Shares rose 2% to 28.71 on Monday. It also has a strong RS line. Parent company Diamondback has been trending lower since an attempted breakout in late March that ultimately failed.Hollyfrontier is continuing to rise steadily since its April 4 breakout from a cup-with-handle base with a 50.60 buy point.

42,HFC,"Gasoline prices across the U.S. are expected to climb even higher as the remnants of Hurricane Harvey continue to pound Houston and keep much of the Gulf Coast's refining capacity offline.XThe U.S. national average gasoline price was $2.31 per gallon Monday, up five cents from a week ago and up a penny from Sunday, according to GasBuddy.Prices are expected to go higher, from 7 to 15 cents the next two weeks with another increase if refineries are closed longer than two weeks, Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy, told MarketWatch.The price spike comes after 10 refineries, including Exxon Mobil's (XOM) Baytown, Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSA) Deer Park and Valero's (VLO) Corpus Christi refineries, responsible for an estimated 2.2 million barrels of daily capacity were closed ahead of the hurricane, according to S&P Platts.Gasoline futures for September delivery was up 2.7% to $1.712 a gallon, after spiking 5% earlier. Meanwhile, U.S. crude futures fell 2.7% to $46.57 per barrel, as refinery shutdowns lift stockpiles of unprocessed oil.Shares of Exxon, which has production and refining operations, fell 0.3% on the stock market today, while Shell, also an integrated oil major, dipped 0.4%.

44,HFC,"With a mellifluous name suggesting bucolic tranquility, Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, is an unlikely object of the caterwauling recently directed at him and the House Freedom Caucus he leads. The vituperation was occasioned by the HFC's role rescuing Republicans from embracing an unpopular first draft of legislation to replace Obamacare.A decisive blow against the bill was struck by the quintessential Republican moderate, New Jersey's Rodney Frelinghuysen, chairman of the Appropriations Committee whose family has included a member of the Continental Congress, four U.S. senators and, in 1844, a vice presidential nominee: ""Hurrah! Hurrah! The country's risin', for Henry Clay and Frelinghuysen.""Although just a little over two years old, the HFC signals a revival of congressional resistance to the dangerous waxing of executive power under presidents of both parties. The HFC is a rarity, a heartening political development: People giving priority to their legislative craft and institution rather than to a president of their party barking at them.The HFC's 30 members, and six others informally affiliated, are barely 8% of the House, but their cohesion is a force multiplier. The cohesion comes, Meadows says, from its members being ""here for a purpose."" And, he adds dryly, from the fact that, for many, ""This is not the best job they've ever had."" Among the never more than 537 people who are in Washington because they won elections, none are more threatening to tranquility than the few who are not desperate to be here. They do not respond to the usual incentives for maintaining discipline.The HFC has rules, bylaws and weekly meetings, often featuring experts on particular issues. HFC members have, Meadows believes, ""a competitive advantage"" in the House because they hone their arguments together in what Meadows calls ""the best debating club on Capitol Hill."" If 80% of the HFC agree on an issue, it votes as a bloc, although members can receive two exemptions per Congress.Meadows was contented as a businessman for whom politics was an avocation. About 30 years ago, he was the only person to attend a precinct meeting, thereby becoming the precinct's chair. He rose in Republican ranks until redistricting after the 2010 census produced a congenial district, which he won in 2012.In December 2014, he and a few others were disgusted by what was called ""cromnibus."" This testimony to Congress' normal dysfunction was a combination of a continuing resolution to keep the government running and an omnibus spending bill. Cromnibus was another of those ""this is a binary choice, so you have no choice"" moments. He and eight other conservatives chose to form a group of kindred spirits.Meadows came to the nation's attention by doing something eccentric: He read the House rules. Therein he learned about a ""motion to vacate the chair."" Such a motion requires a vote on the Speaker. John Boehner resigned as speaker and from the House rather than rely on Democratic votes to make up for lost votes from the HFC, whose members had felt the sting of his disapproval of their insufficient docility.In last month's dispute about Speaker Paul Ryan's health care bill, the president thought it was wise to tweet a demand that the HFC ""get on the team."" And for Steve Bannon to summon HFC members to reportedly be instructed by him that ""this is not a discussion. This is not a debate. You have no choice but to vote for this bill."" And for the White House director of social media — your tax dollars at work — to tweet that an HFC member, Michigan's Justin Amash, ""is a big liability"" who should be defeated in a primary.The 32nd president, a somewhat more accomplished politician than the 45th, tried to purge some members of his party's congressional caucus. Franklin Roosevelt became angry when some conservative Southern Democrats helped to defeat his plan to break the Supreme Court to his saddle by enlarging it and filling the new seats with compliant liberals. He recruited and supported primary opponents against the offending Democrats.All survived. One of them, Georgia's Sen. Walter George, told that FDR was ""his own worst enemy,"" replied: ""Not as long as I'm alive."" Republicans gained eight Senate seats in 1938 and their House ranks almost doubled, from 88 to 169. FDR never again had a liberal legislating majority in Congress. Today's president should have second, or perhaps first, thoughts about a purge.RELATED:Why Aren't Liberal Republicans Being Blamed For RyanCare's Demise?ObamaCare And The Myth Of Democratic ModeratesTrump News & Tweets

45,HFC,"SolarCity (SCTY), First Solar (FSLR) and SunPower (SPWR) could bloom under Hillary Clinton, but her goal of 500 million solar panels cumulatively installed by 2025, along with the potential for higher gasoline taxes, could slam Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and Valero Energy (VLO), S&P analysts said Wednesday.But that doesn't mean a Donald Trump presidency would boost gasoline to the detriment of solar, S&P analyst Stewart Glickman says.""We think efforts to rein in gasoline consumption would dissipate"" if Trump were president, Glickman wrote in a research report. ""A potential loss of incentives for renewables could push incremental demand for refined products, which we think would be a mild tailwind for these oil and gas companies.""Solar and oil/gas both depend heavily on subsidies, Glickman notes. In December, Congress voted in a five-year extension to the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), a key subsidy underpinning the solar industry. But stocks have plunged on net-metering actions in Arizona and Nevada that reduce financial incentives for solar installations.IBD's 20-company Energy-Solar industry group is down 45% this year and ranks No. 196 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. Conversely, the Oil & Gas-Integrated industry group is up 17% since January and ranks No. 14.Clinton could spell the difference for solar stocks, Glickman says. During her hypothetical two-term presidency, she plans to reduce U.S. oil consumption by a third by reaching 500 million in solar panel installations.To date, the U.S. has installed 25 gigawatts to 30 GW, or roughly 100 million to 120 million panels installed cumulatively. So, Clinton's goal would require a 20% compound annual growth rate over eight years, or 45% over four years.""Generating that kind of growth is possible but highly contingent, in our view, on the continued extension of the ITC, which is now slated to expire in 2021,"" he wrote. And strong demand for green energy could depress the fundamentals for fossil fuels, which run best at high utilization, he said.In Q1, the International Energy Association estimated U.S. crude oil demand stood at 19.5 million barrels per day, the highest globally, with No. 2 China at 11.5 million barrels daily. A one-third reduction under Clinton would eliminate 6 million barrels per day, contributing to ""markedly weaker utilization and earnings power,"" Glickman said.Trump, on the other hand, has argued in favor of all forms of energy, ""but doesn't want to pick favorites."" Glickman expects Trump to reduce or eliminate the ITC. S&P analyst Angelo Zino says a reduction to 10% from the current 30% would force solar demand to fall 60%.A Clinton victory would help Canadian Solar (CSIQ), First Solar, SolarCity and SunPower, but hurt Valero, Phillips 66 (PSX), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), HollyFrontier (HFC) and Tesoro (TSO), Glickman says.""We think the new administration could pursue enhanced environmental protection efforts or higher gasoline taxes, both of which could curb gasoline demand and thus cut throughput at these refining companies,"" he said, adding that global integrated oil companies like Exxon and Chevron could feel some heat.

46,HFC,"Republican House leaders closed ranks behind Speaker John Boehner following another internal challenge for his leadership position. He seems safe for now, but the conditions that created the palace revolt remain — signaling something out of whack.
"
47,HFC,"Nothing against Speaker Boehner, who embodies the Republican establishment of Ohio, a historically powerful political machine that gave America many dynamic leaders, at least in 19th and early century, including the not-irrelevant presidency of William McKinley. Boehner's conservative credentials are sterling.
"
48,HFC,"But he's not fighting the Democratic Party of that past. He's up against the ends-justifies-the-means Democratic Party merged with the fight-dirty Chicago political machine now embodied in the Obama administration. Boehner's sterling credentials are producing results like lead.
"
49,HFC,"Thursday, an insurgent group of about 30 lawmakers led by the House Freedom Caucus, tried to oust Boehner over what they saw were his wimpy tactics to defund Planned Parenthood, which has been accused by witnesses on tapes of ghoulishly harvesting and selling body parts from live babies who survived abortion.
"
50,HFC,"A situation like that howls for legislative action, and yet there's a same-old, same-old business as usual in the results. Why indeed has Planned Parenthood not been stripped of $500 million in public funds over those acts? The House vote Friday that froze Planned Parenthood's funding was an alternative to a government shutdown, yet it is certain to be gummed up in the Senate — where the real wimps of the GOP roost, and after that, face a veto from the president. It's a fairly reasonable tactic for putting President Obama on record for a veto. And from Boehner's point of view, better than a government shutdown. But it's not as satisfying as a victory that enacts real change. Hence, the revolt, coming at a bad time, right as the presidential season kicks off.
"
51,HFC,"It's things like these that pit principle against the importance of putting on a united front.
"
52,HFC,"The group that tried to throw Boehner out was the same one that misguidedly tried to stop trade promotion authority, and forced Boehner to abandon a vote on a Resolution of Disapproval of the disastrous Iran nuclear agreement, the only legally binding action available to Congress under the terms of the Corker Act. Both acts, and others, in the end have aligned committed conservatives with Democrats in a pattern strong enough to force Freedom Caucus member Tom McClintock to resign his membership on Wednesday. ""I feel that HFC's many missteps have made it counterproductive to its stated goals and I no longer wish to be associated with it,"" he wrote in his letter to them.
"
53,HFC,"Not only has the HFC broken up the united front; it's fractured among itself. It was perfectly predictable, because high expectations have gone unfulfilled, House sources tell IBD. Again and again, voters have given the GOP victories without results.
"
54,HFC,"From the surprise Senate election of Scott Brown in deep blue Massachusetts in 2010 along with the GOP House victory the same year, to the Senate takeover in 2014, the GOP has successively taken greater parts of the government based on arguments that only more power to the GOP would make a difference. The Boehner camp knows it erred in overselling to the public on the impact of victories, our sources say. Yet the House often doesn't get credit for what it does do and, worse still, gets blamed for the actions of Mitch McConnell's Senate.
"
55,HFC,"But Boehner has contributed to his problems. It pretty well stands out in voters' minds that just days after the sizzling 2014 GOP takeover of the Senate, Boehner came out for ""finding common ground"" with Democrats and called for ""comprehensive immigration reform,"" meaning amnesty, instead of taking action to checkmate Obama on his illegal executive orders. The teeth shown by the Democrats against Ronald Reagan's Contra War were not in evidence in this House.
"
56,HFC,"Wait till January for results, conservatives were told. Wait till there's a supermajority. Wait till Republicans hold the presidency. It sounds like excuse-making after a while.
"
57,HFC,"Where are the results of the various House hearings on sanctuary cities? Or Hillary Clinton's emails? The White House's Fast and Furious gunrunning scandal? The IRS attack on political dissidents? The EPA ecological disaster in Colorado? And now Planned Parenthood. Citizens ask again and again about the victories their votes should bring — and get nothing for their votes.
"
58,HFC,"Sure, Obama plays as dirty as a Chicago machine pol — demagoguing, illegally going after political opponents, governing like a dictator through executive orders, playing the race card, breaking laws on government transparency. But something here shows a lack of creativity with the GOP opposition — and the fire needed to counter it.
"
59,HFC,"It's not for nothing that outsiders — Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina and Donald Trump — are leading in the presidential polls. They form de facto third-party candidates as they challenge the conventional order and tout their absence of connection to Republicans. What's needed is for Speaker Boehner and his counterparts in the Senate to reinvigorate themselves through imaginative means of political jousting, focusing on victories. In the absence of that, the revolts will continue.

""I feel that HFC's many missteps have made it counterproductive to its stated goals and I no longer wish to be associated with it,"" he wrote in his letter to them.Not only has the HFC broken up the united front; it's fractured among itself. It was perfectly predictable, because high expectations have gone unfulfilled, House sources tell IBD. Again and again, voters have given the GOP victories without results.From the surprise Senate election of Scott Brown in deep blue Massachusetts in 2010 along with the GOP House victory the same year, to the Senate takeover in 2014, the GOP has successively taken greater parts of the government based on arguments that only more power to the GOP would make a difference. The Boehner camp knows it erred in overselling to the public on the impact of victories, our sources say. Yet the House often doesn't get credit for what it does do and, worse still, gets blamed for the actions of Mitch McConnell's Senate.But Boehner has contributed to his problems. It pretty well stands out in voters' minds that just days after the sizzling 2014 GOP takeover of the Senate, Boehner came out for ""finding common ground"" with Democrats and called for ""comprehensive immigration reform,"" meaning amnesty, instead of taking action to checkmate Obama on his illegal executive orders. The teeth shown by the Democrats against Ronald Reagan's Contra War were not in evidence in this House.Wait till January for results, conservatives were told. Wait till there's a supermajority. Wait till Republicans hold the presidency. It sounds like excuse-making after a while.Where are the results of the various House hearings on sanctuary cities? Or Hillary Clinton's emails? The White House's Fast and Furious gunrunning scandal? The IRS attack on political dissidents? The EPA ecological disaster in Colorado? And now Planned Parenthood. Citizens ask again and again about the victories their votes should bring — and get nothing for their votes.Sure, Obama plays as dirty as a Chicago machine pol — demagoguing, illegally going after political opponents, governing like a dictator through executive orders, playing the race card, breaking laws on government transparency. But something here shows a lack of creativity with the GOP opposition — and the fire needed to counter it.It's not for nothing that outsiders — Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina and Donald Trump — are leading in the presidential polls. They form de facto third-party candidates as they challenge the conventional order and tout their absence of connection to Republicans. What's needed is for Speaker Boehner and his counterparts in the Senate to reinvigorate themselves through imaginative means of political jousting, focusing on victories. In the absence of that, the revolts will continue.Follow Monica Showalter on Twitter: @IBD_MShowalter.

63,HFC,"In this group, Valero Energy (VLO), Tesoro (TSO), HollyFrontier (HFC), Alon USA Energy (ALJ) and Northern Tier Energy (NTI) hit 52-week highs Thursday, although many reversed lower by the close.Investors by and large gave top refiners a thumbs up for second-quarter earnings results. According to a Barclays research note on Aug. 7, U.S. and global refining margins continued to march higher in Q2, significantly topping market expectations and building on an already impressive first quarter.Also noteworthy in the U.S. market, reported July margins were higher than even May, which is typically the strongest month.Valero Energy is the group leader by Composite Rating and the second-largest by market cap at $35 billion. The stock is extended, though, up 8% from a 64.59 flat-base breakout on July 1.Sales for the refining giant have dropped sharply over the past four quarters, but that hasn't stopped big gains in earnings per share. Lower oil prices have hit Valero's revenue hard, but helped margins expand.Tesoro fell hard Thursday despite a positive open, but is still extended from a flat-base breakout at 94.93 on July 10. The stock is up about 40% year to date and enjoys growing mutual fund sponsorship, including a position by the well-regarded Fidelity Contrafund .On Aug. 6, HollyFrontier topped a 51.41 buy point from a deep consolidation. The pattern had an awkward shape and ran 41% deep, which is a flaw. Aggressive investors may also have spotted an earlier handle entry at 43.81.The handle passes the midpoint test, which means it formed in the upper half of the overall pattern. To test, compare the mathematical midpoint of the base to the midpoint of the handle. The midpoint of the handle should be higher.Western Refining (WNR) is approaching a 51.41 buy point in a new cup pattern.Second-quarter earnings for the El Paso, Texas-based refiner rose 12%, down sharply from a triple-digit gain in the prior period. For the full year, analysts see per-share earnings climbing just 2%.Alon USA Energy reached as high as 35% past a 17.25 cup-with-handle buy point Thursday before reversing.Buyers from the latest breakout should consider taking profits on part or all of their position. Analysts see full-year profit climbing 144% for the Dallas-based refiner, but forecast a 31% slide in 2016.Northern Tier Energy, meanwhile, is a downstream energy limited partnership that debuted in July 2012. The stock has followed through sharply since breaking out past a 25.40 handle buy point on Aug. 10 in heavy volume.

134,HFC,"Is the party over for oil and gas refiners? HollyFrontier (HFC) shares tumbled early Tuesday after the oil and gas refiner surprised Wall Street with lower-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. The bar was high. The refiner had reported six quarters in a row of double- or triple-digit profit growth. And investor hopes were raised further after it announced a 50% quarterly dividend…

135,HFC,"On Jun 29, oil prices rose for the fourth consecutive day in anticipation of an increase in demand against disruptions in supply. WTI crude jumped almost 1% on Friday to end at $74.15, it highest closing since Nov 2014.The rise marks robust weekly, monthly, quarterly and half-yearly gains. Oil prices have been increasing after the United States imposed sanctions on Iran to stop exporting oil from that country in order to cut off substantial finances.A multitude of factors are raising the specter of supply shortages at a time when global demand could rise exponentially. Against this backdrop, it makes sense to bet on select oil stocks likely to deliver strong profits in the second half of 2018.Trump Further Closes in on IranIn May, President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and imposed sanctions on that country. This immediately led to fears of a rise in oil price. Imposition of sanctions means Iran could cut down on its oil production thus impacting oil exports.  Moreover, according to reports, the United States is urging other countries to stop importing oil from Iran by Nov 4. This is part of the President’s efforts to isolate Iran economically and politically, per a senior U.S. State Department official.Big Challenge for Other OPEC Members The United States’ sanction on Iran comes with expectations that other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) including Russia will make up for the shortage in oil supply. The OPEC members have promised to raise oil production but it is unlikely that they will be able to achieve the supply target.However, concerns have emerged over Saudi Arabia’s ability to step up production at a pace quick enough to combat supply shortages. And even if Saudi Arabia does pump oil at an all-time high level, it will cross its production quota and place the excess in storage. This in all likelihood will only move oil prices higher.Libya, Venezuela Crude Supplies Deepen CrisisUnited States’ sanctions on Venezuela coupled with that country’s ongoing economic crisis have been the key concerns of late. Venezuela is embroiled in an oil supply crisis and is entering a dangerous new phase. According to reports, Venezuela is shutting oil production to cope with nearly replete terminal shortage that is resulting in a decline in output.Libya, on the other hand, has added to supply bottlenecks. According to a report from Reuters, forces led by Eastern Libya’s military commander Khalifa Haftar have handed over control of the country’s eastern oil ports to a National Oil Corporation (NOC) based in the east. The internationally recognized NOC has dismissed the move, terming it as illegal.  Our ChoicesMultiple supply concerns are serving to boost crude prices at this moment. The supply crisis has been aggravated after the United States recently told that it would sanction those countries that do not reduce their crude imports from Iran to “zero” by Nov 4. This tough stance on Iranian imports could lead to prolonged supply concerns.Moreover, the situation in Libya and Venezuela remains unpredictable. Meanwhile, questions have been raised on Saudi Arabia’s ability to boost production quickly.  Investing in stocks of oil companies looks like a smart option at this point.

139,HFC,"Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ  -  Free Report) recently announced that it started the commercial operation of its 56.3 megawatt-peak (MWp) solar project located in Japan in May 2018. The plant is expected to annually generate around 66,000 megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity via solar power.Details of the ProjectThe company has converted an abandoned 27-hole golf course into a 56.3 MWp solar plant, likely to provide solar power energy to thousands in the region for many decades to come. The electricity generated from this project will be bought by Chugoku Electric Power Company, Inc. through a 20-year feed-in-tariff contract at the rate of ¥36.0 (32 cents) per kWh.This is the largest solar project built by the company in Japan, reflecting its capability and demand for its services in the East Asian island country. Currently, the company operates 141.9 MWp solar power plant in Japan.International Portfolio: An UpsideCurrently, the company has multiple late-stage 2.3 gigawatt-peak (GWp) utility-scale solar power projects in its pipeline including those under construction. On the global front, the company caters to a geographically-diverse customer base spread across the key markets in the United States, China, Japan, the U.K. and Canada as well as the emerging market opportunities in Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa and the Middle East. To further diversify its utility scale of solar power project pipeline, Canadian Solar has been setting its foothold in Australia, South Korea and Argentina on realization of additional growth opportunities across these countries.To that end, this May, the company announced acquisition of the exclusive rights to develop 8 MWp solar photovoltaic (PV) project in Gangwon Province, South Korea. Earlier in March, Canadian Solar announced that it acquired a 97.6 MWp solar photovoltaic project in Cafayate, Salta Province, Argentina.Also, the company informed that it introduced three of its next generation solar modules at Intersolar Europe held from Jun 20 to Jun 22 in Munich, Germany. The three modules introduced are BiKu, HiKu poly and HiDM (High-Density Module) modules.Such a robust portfolio expansion is likely to boost the company’s revenue generation capability, evident from its recently released first-quarter results wherein Canadian Solar witnessed a skyrocketing 111% top-line improvement. Considering the commencement of its latest project in Japan as well as other project mentioned above coupled with the launch of new solar modules, we may anticipate the company to continue with a strong revenue growth momentum in the upcoming quarters as well.Prospects of the Project in JapanWith the United States having walked out of the Paris accord last year and President Donald Trump directing his focus toward flourishing the country’s coal industry, the utility operators have shifted gears to concentrate more on availing of opportunities in the Asia-Pacific zone. Countries like China, Japan and India are currently dishing out a huge market for solar power expansion, which would emerge as a key growth-driver for all solar power developers.Per U.S. Energy Information Administration, Japan is setting sights on increasing usage of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, geothermal and biomass for power generation. In 2015, 3% of the total energy consumption and 8% of the total electricity generation came from the renewable source of energy in Japan. Japan has plans to drive energy generation via renewable to nearly 22-24% by 2030.Price MovementIn the past month, shares of Canadian Solar have underperformed the Zacks Solar industry.

141,HFC,"On Jun 26, U.S. crude price moved above $70 for the first time in more than a month. Several factors contributed to this increase, though all of them emanated from supply concerns. Reports emerged that the United States is urging countries to stop importing oil from Iran by November. Meanwhile, uncertainty hovered over the fate of Libyan crude supplies.Further, concerns have emerged over Saudi Arabia’s ability to step up production at a pace quick enough to combat supply shortages. The temporary closure of a production facility in Canada also served to boost U.S. prices. With no end to the sector’s supply concerns in sight, investing in oil stocks looks like a profitable option.Iran, Libya Crude Supplies Under CloudOn Tuesday, WTI crude increased 3.6% to close at $70.53 a barrel, the highest finish recorded since May 24. Brent crude also gained 2.1% to close at $76.31 a barrel, a near two-week high. Such gains came on the back of multiple factors boosting supply concerns.According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the United States wants all countries to stop importing oil from Iran by Nov 4. This is part of the United States’ efforts to isolate the country economically and politically, per a senior U.S. State Department official.Major purchasers of Iranian crude were expecting the United States to allow them to reduce such oil imports over an extended period. But the Trump administration has no plans of issuing any waivers for countries that are making efforts to cut Iranian oil imports.Meanwhile, a cloud is hovering over Libyan crude supplies. According to a report from Reuters, forces led by Eastern Libya’s military commander Khalifa Haftar have handed over control of the country’s eastern oil ports to a National Oil Corporation (NOC) based in the east. The internationally recognized NOC has dismissed the move, terming it as illegal.Saudi Concerns, Syncrude Breakdown Boost PricesAccording to Bloomberg, Saudi Arabia is preparing to boost crude production to a record level in July. The oil-rich country plans to produce 10.8 million barrels a day starting next month, which exceeds the earlier all-time high of 10.72 million barrels a day recorded in November 2016. The move would be in accordance with the recent agreement concluded between OPEC and its allies.But analysts feel that this report implies that oil prices can only move higher. If Saudi Arabia does pump oil at an all-time high level, it will cross its production quota and place the excess in storage.However, such a move comes at a time when global spare production capacity is languishing near all-time lows. This means that the country may not be confident enough about boosting production at a pace that is enough to make up for a likely shortfall.Also boosting oil prices on Tuesday was the temporary closure of Canada-based oil-sands facility Syncrude. Loss of power led to a shutdown on Jun 20 and even though power has been restored since then, no shipments have been forthcoming as of now. Since the facility produces 360,000 barrels of crude a day, the disruption has also contributed to the spike in oil prices.Our ChoicesMultiple supply concerns are serving to boost crude prices at this moment. While temporary disruptions like Syncrude are unlikely to leave a long-term impact, the United States’ tough stance on Iranian imports could lead to prolonged supply concerns.The situation in Libya is also likely to remain unpredictable. Meanwhile, questions surround Saudi Arabia’s ability to boost production quickly.  Investing in stocks of oil companies looks like a smart option at this point.

142,HFC,"Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. or Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) recently announced that the company has started production from the Green Turtle field, located in the southern part of the prolific Campos Basin. The company is using the Cidade de Campos dos Goytacazes floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel, chartered from MODEC, for this purpose.The company has positioned the vessel in Deep Waters of the Campos Basin, around 127 kilometers from the Rio de Janeiro, where water depth is 765 meters. The vessel has a processing capacity of 150,000 barrels of oil along with 3.5 million cubic meters of gas. Moreover, it compresses 5 million cubic meters of gas per day.The reservoirs in the field are at 3000 meters depth. The Green Turtle field includes the Tartaruga Verde and Tartaruga Mestiça deposits. Commencement of production in the area marks the company’s second platform coming online in 2018, with the first being FPSO P-74, installed in Búzios Field.SignificanceThe Brazilian state-run Petrobras has 100% stake in Tartaruga Verde and 69.35% interest in Tartaruga Mestiça. Notably, the company has 2017-2018 divestment goals of $21 billion to reduce debt burden, which also includes part of Tartaruga Verde. The commencement of production is expected to help the company in reaching its divestment goal. In spite of the divestment plan, production ramp up from the field is expected to largely help it reach its 2018 production target of 2.1 million barrels per day.Production came online in the Green Turtle field, in line with the company’s expectation to contribute heavily in Business and Management Plan (2018-2022).

144,HFC,"U.S. stocks tumbled at the beginning of this week as the trade dispute between America and China flared up, with both nations determined to impose import tariffs. Such heightened trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies initially spooked investors and sparked a sell-off in the share market.However, by the end of yesterday’s trading session, major market indexes recovered to some extent and ended well off their lows. In particular, a rise in oil price drove energy shares and thereby stopped the stock market from a bigger fall.Nevertheless, investors should take a lesson from this and maintain a relatively less risky portfolio so that at times of uncertainty, one can safeguard his/her portfolio from huge loss.  Herein comes the need for investors to remain well versed about leverage.   In the complex world of corporate finance, a company needs exogenous funds for smooth operations, meeting obligations and expanding business. The two financial resources often resorted to are debt and equity.A comparative analysis of the cost of capital theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity as debt is available at a lower cost compared to equity, especially in periods of low interest rates.However, debt financing has its own drawbacks. The problem arises when leverage, referred to as the amount of debt a company bears, becomes exorbitant. In particular, companies with large debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario.Therefore, for a safe investment strategy, understanding the amount of financial leverage that a company bears is crucial. This is because financial leverage multiplies the underlying business risk.Of course, entirely avoiding companies with debt load is virtually impossible as debt financing is an inherent feature of corporate financing. Still eliminating those bearing exorbitant debt loads might be a wise idea, since the more the company is leveraged the more it is prone to get hit at times of a financial crunch.Therefore, to safeguard their portfolio from losses, the real challenge for an investor is to determine whether the organization’s debt level is sustainable. Historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company.According to estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts are predicting earnings growth of 18.9% in the second quarter of 2018 and a continuation of double-digit growth for the rest of the year. Considering such projections, investors will most likely go for stocks that are exhibiting solid earnings growth. But if the stocks bear a high debt-to-equity ratio, in times of economic downturns, their so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.Considering this, it will be wise for investors to select companies with low leverage. These are financially more secure and immune to financial bankruptcy.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 27 stocks that made it through the screen.HollyFrontier Corporation (HFC  -  Free Report): The company produces and markets gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, asphalt, heavy products and specialty lubricant products.

145,HFC,"Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) recently disclosed its intention to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) through the east coast of Australia. The largest publicly traded energy company is one of the leading gas suppliers in the southeastern part of Australia and the move is expected to retain its hold in the market, while staying ahead of competitors. The primary reason for the import is gas shortage, which is anticipated to hit the market in 2021.The Requirement for LNG Imports Although Australia is presently the second-largest global LNG provider, the domestic market has witnessed a price hike due to lower supplies. Supply from coal-seam gas reserves has failed to keep up with growing demand. Moreover, plummeting supply from the Gippsland Basin Joint Venture between ExxonMobil and BHP Billiton Petroleum (Bass Strait) Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP  -  Free Report), is an added concern.As it is, long-term export deals have left reduced LNG for the domestic market. The market situation has made LNG import profitable for the companies, which ExxonMobil can address with its new plan.AGL Energy, an Australian utility, is also planning on a similar import project, which can come online in 2021. Moreover, a consortium between Australian Industrial Energy, JERA, a Japanese energy trader and Marubeni Corp. expects to start LNG import from 2020.Backup PlansTo address the shortage of LNG in the market, ExxonMobil is considering other measures including imports in Victoria, an Australian state. The company is intensifying exploration offshore Victoria. Additionally, it is also looking to develop the West Barracouta gas field, which can become a feasible remedy for gas shortage in Australia.ExxonMobil expects its new import facility to come online by 2022. Notably, the company also has the option of using its existing Longford infrastructure in Victoria for imports.Price Performance Irving, TX-based ExxonMobil has lost 2.5% of its value in the past year against 15.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, ExxonMobil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors interested in the Energy sector can opt for some better-ranked stocks like Delek US Holdings, Inc. (DK  -  Free Report) and HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Brentwood, TN-based Delek is an energy company.

For 2018, its bottom line is likely to be up 153%. In the last four reported quarters, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 41.3%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

148,HFC,"Investors looking for stocks in the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing sector might want to consider either HollyFrontier (HFC  -  Free Report) or Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.HollyFrontier has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Phillips 66 has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that HFC is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.HFC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.38, while PSX has a forward P/E of 15.45. We also note that HFC has a PEG ratio of 1.27. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PSX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.82.Another notable valuation metric for HFC is its P/B ratio of 1.93. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PSX has a P/B of 2.12.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to HFC's Value grade of A and PSX's Value grade of C.HFC stands above PSX thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that HFC is the superior value option right now.

149,HFC,"Uncertain trade policies have been weighing heavily on the stock market with tensions between the United States and China escalating right before the Q2 earnings season. This is especially true as Trump threatened to impose 10% tariff on further $200 billion Chinese goods and China warned of retaliatory moves.The latest round of tariff threats came following caution by Trump to impose additional tariffs on $500 billion in Chinese goods should Beijing retaliate against the U.S. tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods implemented on Jul 5.However, the optimism of double-digit growth has lifted investors’ sentiment amid intensifying fears of a full-scale global trade war.

This would represent the third consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year.

151,HFC,"Trump’s protectionist stance on trade led to sluggish trading on Wall Street. This is especially true, as a series of tariff talks between the United States and its other major allies are intensifying fears of a trade war and could even trigger a global recession.Tariff TalksTrade war fears surfaced in March when Trump levied a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports on countries around the world. The action has prompted a retaliatory action from U.S. allies and tit-for-tat import tariffs.The turmoil intensified in recent weeks when Trump unveiled the list of Chinese goods worth $50 billion targeted for a 25% tariff, leading to retaliation from China with duties of “the same scale and strength.” In response, the United States again threatened to impose tariffs of up to $400 billion on Chinese goods on top of the $50 billion worth goods. Tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, the first of a potential total of $450 billion are due to take effect on Jul 6.Additionally, the latest report from the Wall Street revealed that Trump is seeking to bar many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block additional technology exports to China.The trade dispute with European Union (EU) also deepened on Jun 22 after Trump tweeted that he would impose another 25% tariff, targeting imported autos from the European Union. The response came following the EU’s threat of 25% duties on $3.2 billion worth of American goods exported to the 28-member bloc, starting Jun 22, against U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum.Canada and Mexico have also threatened against the use of American steel and aluminum imports. Canada is seeking duties on steel imports from the United States and on other goods including playing cards, inflatable boats, yogurt and toilet papers. The total value of American goods subject to tariff is $12.8 billion, effective Jul 1. Mexico plans to retaliate by targeting products from congressional districts that Trump’s Republican Party is fighting to retain in the November election. It would impose levies on a wide range of U.S. goods, some steel and pipe products, lamps, berries, grapes, apples, cold cuts, pork chops and various cheese products “up to an amount comparable to the level of damage” linked to U.S. tariffs.Market ImpactThe round of sanctions and retaliation has intensified the fears of a global trade war that would hurt the worldwide economy and corporate profits, particularly at big U.S. exporters. As such, large-cap stocks are struggling for the past three months given their substantial exposure to these countries.However, there are still winners in many corners of the large-cap space that are easily surviving the trade turmoil.

The United States is expected to halt oil exports from the fifth-biggest producer Iran by November though some waivers can be granted while production in Libya has halved in five months to 527,000 barrels per day. Venezuela’s worsening economic crisis has forced the country to curtail its output to below 2 million barrels per day, which has been halved since 2005.Now, the strike by hundreds of workers on Norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs has led to the shutdown of one shell-operated oilfield and escalated supply worries. A Canadian production outage at the 360,000-bpd Syncrude oil sands facility has reduced flows into Cushing, OK and is expected to continue doing so till September.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other top crude producers, agreed to raise output by about 1 million barrels per day from July in order to offset global production losses in countries including Libya and Venezuela. However, the move will not be able to make up for higher demand thus pushing the price higher.Demand RisingGlobal demand for oil has been picking up buoyed by improving economic growth since the financial crisis and continued to be strong during the peak summer season.However, demand from China may be curtailed by Trump’s tariff threats. President Donald Trump has threatened to levy new trade tariffs of 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, a move that will intensify trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies.Other FactorsOngoing geopolitical tension in the Middle East is also supporting the oil price. Further, the oil futures market is in a state of backwardation, where later-dated contracts are cheaper than near-term contracts. This signals that the oil market is tightening and demand is robust, paving the way for an oil rally. This trend is likely to persist at least in the near term, acting as the biggest catalyst for the commodity.Earnings OptimismPer the latest Earnings Trends report, the energy sector remains the largest contributor to Q2 S&P 500 earnings, having projected more than double the growth from the year-ago level at 138.2%. In fact, full-year earnings are expected to grow 101.7%.Given the barrage of bullish trends, energy stocks are set to explode higher heading into the Q2 earnings season.

153,HFC,"After being trapped in a narrow range between $45 and $55 per barrel for 12 months, oil prices finally broke out in November to hit their highest levels in more than two years. The commodity was supported by a variety of catalysts, including the OPEC-led production cut extension, lower inventory overhang and the temporary shutdown of a key pipeline connecting Canada to the United States.What’s encouraging is that the price appreciation extends an upbeat tone in crude trade into December following the third monthly gain in a row by the futures contracts, the longest such streak since early 2016. To be precise, the commodity rose about 5.6% in November to end the month at $57.40 per barrel. 3 Reasons for Oil's November SurgeProduction Cut Deal Extension: One of the significant reasons why the U.S. oil benchmark soared, revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. True to predictions, the coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018.The agreement, now renewed twice, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day (or 2% of global supply) off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut. While there are several question marks over the degree to which the cartel members are adhering to their quotas, there's no ignoring the fact that the cuts continue to narrow the market imbalances. What’s more,Sharp Inventory Drawdowns: Investors have pinned hopes of recovery over the recent U.S. Energy Department's inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles – pointing to a slowdown in shale output. The nation's oil stockpiles have shrunk in 26 of the last 33 weeks and are down almost 80 million barrels since April.Keystone Pipeline Spill: The temporary shutdown of TransCanada Corp’s (TRP  -  Free Report) 590,000 barrel-per-day Keystone oil pipeline – one of the largest from Canada to the United States – due to a leak and subsequent cleanup operations, was also bullish for oil prices.How to Identify the Outperformers?The strong November rally does not necessarily indicate that all energy scrips would be wise picks. Moreover, with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver attractive returns. While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, this is where the Zacks Rank, which justifies a company’s strong fundamentals, can come in really handy.In particular, we have shortlisted 5 companies that have outperformed oil prices over the past 4 weeks, and have a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Finally, the chosen ones have VGM Score less than or equal to B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best upside potential.5 ChoicesNorthern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report), a #1 Ranked stock, is our first pick. A non-operator explorer and producer with primary focus on the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana, Minnetonka, MN-based Northern Oil and Gas has a VGM Score of B. Also, shares of the company have gained 77.1% in the past four weeks.Our second choice is Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report) – a company engaged in the acquisition, development, operation and exploration of oil and natural gas properties in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions of the U.S. This Plano, TX-based Zacks Rank #1 stock, sporting a VGM Score of A, has risen 44.6% in past month.Then we have California Resources Corp. (CRC  -  Free Report). Headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, California Resources is an independent oil and gas company having operations mainly in the San Joaquin Basin. This Zacks Rank #2 stock, sporting a VGM Score of A, is up 36.5% in the past four weeks.WildHorse Resource Development Corp. (WRD  -  Free Report) is another company we recommend. Headquartered in Houston, TX, WildHorse Resource Development is focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and operation of unconventional, onshore oil and gas properties in the northeastern end of the Eagle Ford Play in South Texas. The company carries a Zacks Rank of #2 with a VGM Score of B. Also, shares of the company have gained 26.9% since the start of November.Finally, there is HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC  -  Free Report). Headquartered in Dallas, TX, is one of the largest independent refiners and marketers of petroleum products in the U.S. The Zacks #2 Ranked stock, which has gained 11.3% in past month, has a VGM Score of A.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

154,HFC,"Investors in HollyFrontier Corporation (HFC  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 15, 2017 $27.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for HollyFrontier shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, HollyFrontier is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry that ranks in the Top 48% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 24 cents per share to 76 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about HollyFrontier right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

155,HFC,"JP Morgan has launched a new fund focused on providing exposure to the U.S. equity space. It invests in companies offering high dividends.JPMorgan U.S. Dividend ETF JDIV tracks the JP Morgan US Dividend Index.Fund CharacteristicsThe fund utilizes a rules-based methodology to select stocks based on volatility and yield. It has AUM of $25.2 million and seeks to provide exposure to higher-yielding equities, while minimizing unsystematic risk. It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in Dowdupont Inc DWDP, Hollyfrontier Corp (HFC  -  Free Report) and Digital Realty Trust Inc DLR, with 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all just a little over 7.5% is allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Utilities, Financials and Consumer Goods, with 15.9%, 15.0% and 14.2% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017).Market ImpactMoreover, markets anticipate an interest rate hike in the December meeting of the Fed. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 91.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike and 8.5% chance of a 50 basis point rate hike in December. This fund is expected to be significantly impacted because higher interest rates reduce the appeal of dividend-focused funds. However, Janet Yellen has warned that faster rate hikes might cause inflation to go below the Fed’s 2% target. Moreover, newly elected Fed chair, Jerome Powell, is seen as a dovish lead, who will not steer much from the current policy.There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s tax reform and deregulation plans. This might increase investors’ appeal for safety and in turn make them shift to dividend-focused funds.CompetitionThe fund faces high competition from other funds focused on providing exposure to the same space. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to this corner (see all Total Market (U.S.) ETFs here).Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies providing high dividends.It has AUM of $26.1 billion and charges a fee of 8 basis points a year.

156,HFC,"Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define. There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new style score system we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let’s focus on HollyFrontier Corporation (HFC  -  Free Report)as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for HFC’s status as a solid momentum stock below:Longer Term Price Change for HollyFrontierWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics—such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful.And in the case of HFC, the results are quite impressive. The company has beaten the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 40.8% to 12%, while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year, putting up a gain of 52.8%. Clearly, HFC is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors.HollyFrontier Corporation Price HollyFrontier Corporation Price | HollyFrontier Corporation QuoteFiscal Year EPS Estimate Change for HFCIn addition to price performance, it is also important to take a look at earnings estimate changes for the full year. This can show if HFC is poised to make a run based on fundamentals, or if the company is simply moving on speculation.Over the past week, the full year earnings estimate for HFC has risen by 4%. On its own this is impressive, but it also beats the flat industry average move. The trend is undeniably in HollyFrontier’s favor right now, and it suggests that the momentum might be long-lasting for this stock.  HFC Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been seeing that with HFC as of late.Over the past two months, five earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year, while we are also seeing that six estimates have move upwards with one downward revision for the next year time frame. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate, as two months ago, HFC was expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of $2.17 for the full year, representing a solid increase which is something that should be welcome news to would-be investors.Bottom LineGiven these factors, investors shouldn’t be surprised to note that we have HFC as a security with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction, definitely keep HFC on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well-positioned to soar in the near term.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

159,HFC,"CNOOC Limited (CEO  -  Free Report)-owned Nexen Energy recently announced its intention of spending C$400 million (more than $300 million) to enhance its Long Lake oil-sands project, located in northern Alberta. The decision marks an improvement in Canada’s oil-sands industry, which had witnessed several foreign direct investments flying away from the projects.Nexen Energy, bought by CNOOC in 2013, plans to add oil production of 26,000 barrels per day (BPD) in the Long Lake oil-sands project. The expansion will include the addition of three steam-driven well-pads, which will transport bitumen to the company’s existing facilities. Moreover, the cost of the project is 50% less per barrel than the 2014 standards, marking immense improvement in efficiency of the company.The oil-sands expansion project is also expected to bring down emission intensity in the Long Lake development and thus complies with the Alberta government’s climate goals.The expansion project, likely to conclude by 2020, also asserts CNOOC’s long-term confidence in Alberta’s oil sands, denoting a positive sign for the sector.

161,HFC,"On Jun 12, Summit Midstream Partners, LP (SMLP  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?The midstream energy infrastructure company operates in five unconventional resource plays, namely the Appalachian Basin, Williston Basin, Fort Worth Basin, Piceance Basin and Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin. Its diversified presence within the United States gives the company an ability to earn attractive fee-based revenues. Moreover, the partnership is expected to largely benefit from growth projects in these basins. In the Utica shale formation, located in the Appalachian Basin, the partnership has two new Summit Midstream Utica pad connections, which are expected to come online in the beginning of 2019. Additionally, Summit Midstream has a 60 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) processing facility lined up in the DJ Basin, which will become operational in the fourth quarter of 2018.Furthermore, the partnership has entered in the Delaware Basin, its sixth basin, with a project of 60 MMcf/d processing and gathering facility, where operations are commencing this quarter. The estimated project expenditure is $110 million. Another Double E Pipeline project is being planned by the partnership in this basin, which is lined up for 2021, having an estimated budget of $400-$450 million. These growth projects can help Summit Midstream in boosting its cash flow.There’s MoreSummit Midstream’s current debt-to-capitalization ratio of 44.8% is way below 52.3% recorded by the industry it belongs to. Additionally, the partnership has $949 million borrowing capacity available under its $1.25 billion revolving facility. These strengths in Summit Midstream’s balance sheet can help it to execute the growth projects smoothly. Also, the partnership’s total capital expenditure budget for 2018 lies in the range of $175-$225 million, which is expected to be utilized for further igniting the partnership’s future earning abilities.   Zacks Consensus EstimateFor the second quarter of 2018, the partnership witnessed two upward revisions and no downward revisions, in the last 60 days. Earnings estimates for the current quarter have been revised upward from 14 cents per share to 16 cents per share, during this time.Moreover, the leading growth-oriented master limited partnership has an impressive earnings surprise history, with the average positive earnings surprise being 94.3% in the trailing four quarters.In terms of enterprise multiple or EV/EBITDA ratio — which is one of the best multiples for assessing oil and gas companies as energy firms usually have a large amount of debt — The Woodlands, TX-based partnership seems undervalued. The company currently has an average trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.2, much lower than its industry’s figure of 13.2. Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report), Delek US Holdings, Inc.

162,HFC,"The S&P 500 index witnessed steady growth in earnings over the last three quarters and will likely report earnings growth in the fourth quarter as well. As per our report, the index garnered a total of $277.3 billion, $293.4 billion and $303.2 billion in the first, second and third quarters, respectively. For the October-to-December quarter, we expect higher earnings for the S&P 500 at $310.9 billion.We note that the energy sector has been a major contributor to the S&P 500’s growth story. In fact, among all the 16 Zacks sectors in the index, energy is probably the only one which is expected to witness triple-digit earnings growth in Q4.Hence, it seems prudent for investors to choose stocks from a sector that has clearly crushed the S&P 500 in 2017.Healthiest Free Cash Flow Since Oil WeaknessBefore considering any particular stock or sector, investors should analyze the security’s free cash flow. Free cash flow measures the amount of operating cash flow remaining for business investments after deducting capital spending.   Our proprietary model shows that the Zacks Oil-Energy sector has witnessed almost a 161.1% rise in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months. Also, the sectors free cash flow has been the healthiest since the free fall in crude price in mid-2014.  Reflecting the bullishness, long-term debt for the sector declined over the first nine months of 2017. Short-term debt also plunged reflecting the sector’s improving financial strength.  What’s Driving the Energy Sector?The improving financial metrics were primarily supported by a partial recovery in crude price in 2017. Looking at the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) average crude prices for all the months in 2017, it is clear that the commodity pricing scenario has been much better than the prior-year period.                            The year 2017 has been a remarkable one for energy investors with the OPEC agreeing to extend the production cut deal beyond the first quarter of 2018, an imperative step to fight the global crude glut. On Nov 30, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting.As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Through the end of next year, Saudi Arabia, Russia and their allies pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market.Which Energy Stocks Beat the S&P 500? Year to date, the S&P 500 index rallied 20.6%. The U.S. stock market is regularly scaling all-time highs. Stocks have mostly rallied since last year’s election, with a booming U.S. economy, supportive monetary policy and robust corporate earnings being the key growth drivers. Expectations that the Trump administration’s proposed tax and regulatory reforms will help companies and consumers have boosted investors’ sentiments further. There are energy stocks that have rallied higher than the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. Before zeroing in on the stocks, let us take a look at how the upstream, midstream and downstream businesses have fared in 2017.The healthy oil price scenario was favorable for upstream business as explorers were able to sell the commodity at a higher price. This resulted in an increased number of drilling rigs at domestic oil resources, per the report of Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report). According to the report, from Jan 6 to Dec 15, rig count jumped from 665 to 930.Crude production surged on ramped up drilling which drove demand for midstream properties like pipeline and storage facilities. Companies engaged in refining and marketing businesses were major gainers as well. Free cash flow for the Zacks Oil Refining & Marketing industry rose 21.3% over the trailing 12 months. Higher refinery margins and utilization primarily supported the results.  Our ChoicesEmploying our proprietary Stock Screener, we found four energy stocks that have gained more than 20.6%, beating the S&P 500 index.The stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with market capitalization of more than $1 billion.Based in Sugar Land, TX, CVR Refining, LP (CVRR  -  Free Report) is a leading refining player. The partnership posted an average positive earnings surprise of 306.4% for the last four quarters. Also, we expect CVR Refining to post year-over-year earnings growth of an astounding 1,350% in 2017.This #1 Ranked stock has surged 29.8% year to date. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

164,HFC,"Fresh trade war issues between the United States and China may have dented global oil prices to some extent. But, in the long run, supply side constraints amid escalating demand will surely boost oil prices.Let us not forget that oil prices did touch a four-year peak on Jul 10 due to such supply-side outages. Fresh workforce strikes in Gabon and Norway affected supply. At the same time, there are production disruptions in Venezuela and Libya as well as anticipation of a massive Iranian export dip.As the long run bodes well for oil prices, energy companies are expected to come up with robust results. Hence, investing in some of the sought-after oil majors doesn’t seem to be a bad proposition.Oil Prices Nearly Hits $80-a-BarrelOn Jul 10, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 26 cents or roughly 0.4%, to settle at $74.11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The international benchmark Brent for September settlement rose 79 cents or 1% to end the session at $79.51 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Crude futures finished higher yesterday, with the global benchmark tapping a session-high close to $80-a-barrel mark.Meanwhile, a separate report issued by the U.S. Energy Information Administration yesterday disclosed that the WTI and Brent crude price forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have moved up 2.2% and 1.1%, respectively.Despite record-high domestic production, the oil benchmark in the United States has attained its highest settlement since November 2014 so far this year. Price appreciation in the first half extends the upbeat tone in crude trade into the final six months of this year.What Stokes the Crude Price Rally?Steeper WTI and Brent futures curves mirror a stretched oil market scenario.   Fresh Workforce Strikes in Gabon & NorwayTuesday’s record gain in oil prices primarily stemmed from small labor strikes in Norway and Gabon. A small workers’ strike on the platforms of North Sea reportedly led to a decline in Norway’s crude and natural-gas liquid production by 23,000 barrels per day (bpd) and 3,500 bpd, respectively. Similarly, a 15-day laborer’s strike in the facilities of the French oil producer Total is predicted to slash Gabon’s crude output by 54,000 bpd.Venezuela, Libya & Canada Output WoesOutages in Canada, Libya and particularly the crisis-riddled Venezuela have significantly shrunk the cushion of spare capacity in the global energy industry. Venezuela is on the verge of an economic breakdown, with oil output dwindling more than 40% since 2016. Furthermore, renewed U.S. sanctions on the Maduro regime will strangle the energy sector of this Latin American nation. On the other hand, Libyan crude production is sliding every day on account of oil port closures. Since February, the country’s crude production has dipped from 1.28 million bpd to 527,000 bpd. Moreover, Syncrude Energy’s oil sands production outages will continue to weigh on Canadian crude supplies until mid-September.Imminent Decline in Iranian ExportsTrump’s stance over Iran has outpaced Wall Street’s expectations. The United States’ refusal to issue any waiver on cutting crude imports from Iran by Nov 4 has largely fueled the ongoing oil price rally. Last month, the U.S. President withdrew from a nuclear deal with OPEC’s third-largest producer and pledged to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has spurred worries over an expected cut in Iranian oil exports – at 2.7 million barrels a day – by around one million barrels and led to a supply shortage in an already tight oil market.Other DriversRobust demand is also propelling oil prices lately. Crude consumption continues to rally on the back of sturdier global economic growth. Per the International Energy Agency (IEA), worldwide oil demand for 2018 will be 99.3 million bpd, up 1.5% year over year.Moreover, a break in U.S. share boom might also drive prices going forward. Shortages of skilled and pipeline workers is currently troubling the country’s shale facilities. Notably, the IEA predicts that American share boom will plateau in the 2020s.Top Five Energy PicksMultiple supply concerns and an upbeat demand side picture are serving well to boost crude prices at this moment. Investing in stocks of oil companies looks like a smart option at this point.On a year-to-date basis, the Zacks Oils-Energy sector rallied 5.5%, outperforming 4.4% growth recorded by the S&P 500 group.In sync with this, we have handpicked five top-ranked energy stocks that will likely add a sparkle to your portfolio.These stocks currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and flaunts a VGM Score of A.

168,HFC,"In a bid to create a fully-vertically integrated company, McDermott International, Inc. (MDR  -  Free Report) is set to merge with Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V.  in a $6 billion all-stock deal. Shareholders of Chicago Bridge & Iron will receive 2.47221 shares of McDermott for each Chicago Bridge & Iron stock they own, unless McDermott completes its 3-to-1 reverse stock split ahead of the closing, which will reduce the number to 0.82407 shares.Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, the transaction is set to complete in the second quarter of 2018. Upon the closure of the deal, McDermott will be owning 53% of the stake in the combined company, while Chicago Bridge & Iron will hold 47% interest.McDermott’s current CEO and president David Dickson will head the new entity which will be headquartered in Houston. McDermott’s CFO and executive vice president will continue to hold office in the combined company. The new company’s board of directors will comprise 11 members, including Dickson and five independent directors from McDermott along with five from Chicago Bridge & Iron.Deal RationaleBoth companies provide infrastructure and other products for oil and gas industries. McDermott in particular, focuses on offshore operations whereas Chicago Bridge & Iron’s strength lies in onshore projects. The combination of the two entities will lead to the creation of a fully-integrated onshore-offshore company offering engineering, procurement, and construction and installation services to the energy sector.Chicago Bridge & Iron has been struggling in the wake of low commodity prices generating lower revenues and earnings in the past four quarters. Shares of the company has also declined about 44% year to date. Accordingly, the company resorted to cost cut and divestment initiatives to improve the leverage metrics. While the energy infrastructure services firm is leaving no stone unturned to shore up financials, the merger deal comes at an opportune time and is surely to boost up the credentials of the company.On the other hand, while we appreciate McDermott’s broad product portfolio, diversified geographical footprint,the company’s exclusive focus on the offshore oil and gas business amid the current commodity price scenario limits its growth. The company seeks to effectively counter this limitation with its merger with Chicago Bridge & Iron which focuses on onshore business. The increased scale and diversification will thus position the company to capitalize effectively on growth opportunities.Deal BenefitsThe merger of complementary assets will boost the revenues and expand the customer base of the new entity and lead to various commercial, operational and financial synergies. The new entity is likely to benefit from increased cost efficiencies by providing a broader set of product offerings driven by technology and innovation. The opportunity to leverage the technology through a wider distribution network provides significant growth prospects.The combined company expects to generate annualized cost savings of about $250 million by 2019.The company is expected to have pro-forma annual revenues of about $10 billion and a robust backlog of 14.5 billion.The merger is expected to create sustainable and profitable business model delivering best-in-class solutions for customers.Zacks Rank and Key PicksBoth McDermott and Chicago Bridge & Iron carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the energy space are Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report) and HollyFrontier Corporation (HFC  -  Free Report).

170,HFC,"Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock's ability to offer considerable returns. But these are also essential in determining whether a stock’s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average.If the stock’s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples, then something must be wrong.It’s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks.

Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth, and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies.

171,HFC,"U.S. stock markets are now hitting all-time highs on a daily basis. Stocks have mostly rallied since last year’s election, with a booming U.S. economy, supportive monetary policy and robust corporate earnings being the key triggers. Expectations that the Trump administration’s proposed tax and regulatory reforms will help companies’ and consumers, have given investors further reasons to put their money in stocks. As a matter of fact, the S&P 500 crept further into record territory Tuesday. The index eked out a gain of 0.2%, to an all-time closing high of 2,664.11. What’s Driving the S&P 500 Higher?What's Sending the Index to a String of Records? It’s fairly simple: investors have driven up equities on evidence of economic growth. As per the Commerce Department’s second estimate, the U.S. economy expanded at a 3.3% pace in the third quarter. This represents an improvement from the annualized growth rate of 3.1% in the April to June period and the strongest performance since the third quarter of 2014. Moreover, the latest figure represents the best back-to-back quarters of at least 3% growth since 2014. Further, the November payroll report showed that the domestic labor market continued its recovery from the effects of hurricanes, while jobless rate ticked stayed at a 17-year low of 4.1%. The central bank’s lifting of short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point can also be interpreted as a by-product of rising economic growth and optimism. The expected 'policy normalization' simply indicates that the economy is ready for the ‘quantitative easing’ tap to be turned off. Though higher interest rates raise the cost of debt capital, an expanding economy supersedes low-borrowing costs in the grand scheme of things. Meanwhile, President Trump’s proposals to overhaul the tax law and make it business friendly, added to the positive sentiment and powered stocks higher. Finally, strong earnings reports from corporate biggies, which has helped support high valuations, boosted sentiments. Following two successful quarters of earnings numbers, U.S. companies posted all-time record earnings in the third quarter. Total earnings for S&P 500 companies were up 6.9% from the same period last year on 6% higher revenues. Energy: The Only S&P 500 Laggard While the S&P 500 equity index has been on a tear, it has been a wild ride for the energy market in 2017, setting pulses racing of even the steadiest investors. In fact, energy is the only sector to give negative returns to investors this year. A strong third quarter notwithstanding, energy – which was the best S&P sector performer in 2016, with a market-thumping 24% return – has not exactly had a great year. The Zacks Oil-Energy sector is down more than 1% year-to-date versus 21.9% growth for the broader S&P 500.  With U.S. drillers ramping up their output quickly in response to the extension of OPEC-led supply cuts until the end of 2018 and rising rig count pointing to further jump in American production, the tightening of global oil market is getting undermined and prices are under constant pressure. The steady trend of rising domestic oil production continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. As per the U.S. Energy Department's latest inventory release, U.S. output rose by 73,000 barrels per day (for the week ending Dec 8) to 9.8 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. Market participants argue that fundamentals point to a looming oil supply growth despite WTI crude currently staying above the $55 per barrel mark. A Handful of Companies Defied the Downturn Even amid the volatile, declining market, some companies have stood firm, indicating investors’ confidence in them. If bought now, these stocks are likely to outperform others and create long-term wealth. However, selecting stocks to buy could be a tricky proposition, especially with oil prices moving like a roller-coaster. One should focus on picking up stocks that have a sound business, good management and is not pricey. Amid the uncertainty, it is necessary that investors adopt a cautious approach. It is prudent to opt for large cap stocks. These have a market capitalization of over $5 billion, and also have further room for upside. These companies enjoy leading market positions, have a global footprint, strong cash positions and are large enough to stay strong even in the face of unfavorable events. While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, this is where the Zacks Rank, which justifies a company’s strong fundamentals, can come in really handy. In particular, we have shortlisted 5 companies that have outperformed oil prices over the year, and have a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Our Choices BP plc (BP  -  Free Report), a #1 Ranked stock, is our first pick.

173,HFC,"In corporate finance, leverage, otherwise termed as debt financing, is the use of exogenous funds by corporations to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. While there is option for equity financing, if a company wants to avoid debt, historically debt financing has been preferred over equity.Such a choice is driven by the cheap and easy availability of debt compared with equity financing. However, one should keep in mind that debt financing remains a feasible option as long as the companies succeed in generating a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. Exorbitant debt financing might even lead to a corporation’s bankruptcy in a worst case scenario.This is because while debt brings with it the capacity to spend a little bit more, it also carries the burden of repayment with additional interest in the future. As a result, prudent investors try to avoid companies with large debt loads since they are more vulnerable during economic downturns.Empirically it has been found that in periods of low interest rates, debt financing has gained more traction. At present, with robust parameters supporting growth across the U.S. economy and thereby favoring interest rate hike, the market is not very attractive for hugely burdened companies. Naturally, investors would like to avoid debt ridden stocks and seek those bearing low debt levels. Debt-free stocks are, however, rare.Therefore, to safeguard one’s portfolio from losses, an investor should prudently determine whether the stock’s debt level is sustainable. Historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company.With the second quarter earnings season approaching, investors must be eyeing companies that exhibited solid earnings growth in the prior quarters. However, blindly pursuing high earnings yielding stocks might drain all your money before you know, especially if the stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio.Considering this, it will be wise for investors to select companies with low leverage. These are financially more secure and immune to financial bankruptcy.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 30 stocks that made it through the screen.HollyFrontier Corporation (HFC  -  Free Report): The company produces and markets gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, asphalt, heavy products and specialty lubricant products.

175,HFC,"The first-quarter reporting cycle is almost over. During a reporting cycle, investors keep a tab of the companies delivering earnings beat. Earnings theoretically determine the growth or contraction of companies as well as their stocks. Speculations regarding earnings beat or miss can either cheer investors or upset them to the point of a hasty sell-off.  Q1 Earnings Season Wrapping UpAs of May 17, 461 S&P 500 members reported Q1 results that combined account for 95.2% of the index's total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Outlook report, total earnings for these companies increased 24.2% from the same period last year on 8.7% higher revenues, with 77.7% delivering positive earnings surprises and 74.6% beating revenue estimates.Energy Sector Tops the ChartsTrue to our expectations, energy sector’s first-quarter 2018 earnings managed to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors.

While 66.7% of the companies beat earnings estimates, 70% outperformed on the top line.What’s Behind the Rally?The first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite record high domestic production. Per EIA data, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. It goes without saying that all oil-related stocks are thus poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices, as the companies will be able to extract more value for their products.

In particular, geopolitics and a historic output deal are playing the most important role in driving oil price higher. Below, we have discussed them in detail below:VenezuelaVenezuela is the latest catalyst given the new sanctions by the Trump administration on the OPEC-member, following the second six-year term victory for president Nicolás Maduro that would further curtail oil output in the country. Output in Venezuela has already been halved since 2005 to below 2 million barrels per day due to an economic crisis.Iran Donald Trump finally withdrew from the Obama-era 2015 nuclear deal and has vowed to reimpose powerful economic sanctions against the OPEC nation waivered within the deal as well as introduce new ones. Since Iran is OPEC's third-largest oil producer and exports about 2.5 million barrels a day, renewed sanctions would reduce Iranian oil exports, further tightening global supplies.Historic Output DealThe historic output cut deal, wherein OPEC, Russia and other producers have agreed to curb production by 1.8 million barrels per day is paying off. The group started reducing production in last January and is poised to continue throughout 2018. As the group restrains crude output for the second year, oil inventories in the world’s richest nations have now fallen 1 million barrels below the five-year average, the level targeted by OPEC and its partners.Mediocre Demand OutlookAlthough accelerating economic growth across the world has been raising demand for the commodity, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that it is likely to moderate as crude nears $80 per barrel. The agency cuts its forecast for global demand growth to 1.4 million barrels per day for 2018 from the previous estimate of 1.5 million barrels per day.Impressive Zacks RankThe upside to the energy sector is confirmed by a solid Zacks Sector Rank in the top 25% with about 60% of the industries ranking in the top 43%. This suggests continued outperformance in the sector for the coming months.Solid Earnings Energy sector earnings have shown impressive growth of 75.7% in the first quarter, being the largest contributor to earnings growth for the S&P 500. The solid trend is likely to continue into the second quarter with expected earnings growth of 121.1%, representing the highest growth.Top Stocks to BuyIn view of the reasons discussed above, we strongly believe that investors should consider energy stocks.

177,HFC,"Following the easing of tensions between the United States and China, U.S. stock markets hit a two-month high on May 21. Notably, President Trump’s imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports and retaliatory tariffs by China aggravated the market volatility which commenced in February.However, the two rounds of meetings between the two countries’ high level delegates have prevented tensions from escalating. This positive factor along with robust first-quarter 2018 earnings and strong fundamentals of the U.S. economy signal the persistence of uptrend in the market. Consequently, it will be a prudent decision to pick good growth stocks at the moment to enrich your portfolio.Wall Street Gains Big on MondayOn May 21, the Dow 30, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2%, 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively. The blue-chip Dow 30 index gained 298.2 points to close at 25,103.29, its highest since Mar 12. The benchmark index S&P 500 closed at 2,733.01, the index’s highest point in almost nine weeks. Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also followed suit closing at 7,394.04. All three major indexes are currently in the green year to date.Trade War Fears EaseOn March 2018, the United States levied tariffs worth $50 billion on China. Nearly 1,300 Chinese products which were utilized in high-tech sectors bore the brunt of the tariffs. China also retaliated by imposing tariffs worth of $50 billion primarily on U.S. agricultural exports. The Trump administration also gave indications of releasing a list detailing tariffs worth $100 billion on China, fueling fears of a full-fledged trade war.However, on May 20, the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the prospect of a trade war was ""on hold"" following two rounds of meetings between high-level delegations of the two countries. China agreed to buy larger amounts of U.S. goods, especially energy and agricultural products, in order to reduce $375 billion per annum trade surplus with the United States.Robust Earnings Momentum   First-quarter earnings results have been exhibiting strong momentum so far. Total earnings are expected to be up 23.9% from the same period last year on 8.5% higher revenues. This is the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in seven years. For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 19.4% on 5.8% higher revenues. (Read more: Strong Retail Sector Earnings Growth)A big driver of these positive revisions is obviously the direct impact of the massive $1.5 trillion (including corporate and personal) tax cuts. The full effect of the tax overhaul is yet to appear in the economy as the measures were implemented in January only.Our Top PicksStock markets momentum remained largely unhindered despite recent volatility.

178,HFC,"Investors in HollyFrontier Corporation (HFC  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 6, 2018 $79.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for HollyFrontier shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, HollyFrontier is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry that ranks in the Top 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.44 per share to $1.63 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about HollyFrontier right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

179,HFC,"Comstock Resources, Inc.

Founded in 2010 and backed by the private equity firm, Riverstone Holdings, Enduro Resource was hit by low oil price environment that shook the industry a few years back.Comstock Resources, through its subsidiary Comstock Oil & Gas-Louisiana LLC, placed the bid for Enduro Resource’s Cotton Valley and Haynesville Shale assets for $20 million. Notably, Comstock Resources has acreages in Texas and Louisiana and if the purchase of Enduro Resource’s properties materializes, it will strengthen the Frisco, TX-based upstream company’s position in the region.Comstock Resources’ low-risk high-return properties in the Haynesville Shale are expected to bring about natural gas output growth of around 30% for this year and 50% for the next year. Moreover, growth in the company’s 2017 natural gas output and proved reserves were primarily derived from the horizontal well-drilling program in the Haynesville shale. Additionally, the company has several producing fields including Blocker, Beckville and Waskom fields in its portfolio, which produces from the Cotton Valley formation.

180,HFC,"Wall Street is finally showing signs of stabilizing despite the lingering presence of destabilizing elements. For the week ended Jun 8, all three major indexes – The Dow 30, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite – closed in the positive territory. Robust first-quarter 2018 earnings and strong fundamentals of the U.S. economy foreshadow the persistence of uptrend in stock markets.Robust labor market data for May, recovery of il prices due to supply concern, anticipation of interest rate hike by the Fed which will bode well for the financial sector and easing of trade war fear are primary reasons behind the stabilization of the markets. Major indexes are likely to maintain their northbound movement in the near term. Consequently investment in growth stocks with favorable Zacks Rank will be a prudent move.Wall Street’s Big Weekly GainFor the week ended Jun 8, the Dow 30 increased 2.8%, its biggest weekly gain since March. Notably, the index closed at 25,316.53, on Jun 8. This was blue-chip index’s highest level of closing since Mar 12. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite recorded weekly gains of 1.6% and 1.2%, respectively. These reflect third straight weekly advances for both indexes.Strong weekly gains have placed all three indexes in the green year to date.

Strong international demand for crude oil, an impending supply shortage from Iran if the Trump administration imposes sanctions and a gradually declining output from Venezuela will bolster oil prices in the near term.Trade War Fear OverblownIt seems that investors have decided not to attach too much significance to the G-7 summit which took place in Canada on Friday. A strong U.S. macro economy allowed investors to shrug off G-7 trade conflicts.Meanwhile, China has offered to purchase nearly $70 billion of U.S. farm and energy products if the United States refrains from imposing further tariffs on the country.

183,HFC,"Chinese oil and gas giant PetroChina Company Limited (PTR  -  Free Report) announced third-quarter 2017 earnings of RMB 4,690 million or RMB 0.03 per diluted share, compared with RMB 1,200 million or RMB 0.01 per diluted share a year earlier.The positive comparisons can be primarily attributable to higher oil prices and strict cost control, which helped its biggest unit — exploration and production — to swing to profitability. Moreover, China’s dominant oil and gas producer’s total revenues for the three months under consideration rose 17.1% from the year-ago period to RMB 481,795 million.However, PetroChina’s earnings per ADR of 45 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny on deteriorating results at its refining unit.PetroChina Company Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  PetroChina Company Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | PetroChina Company Limited QuoteChinese Oil Majors’ Profit RisesPetroChina followed other big energy names from the country — CNOOC Ltd. (CEO  -  Free Report) and Sinopec (SNP  -  Free Report) — in reporting higher third-quarter numbers.CNOOC, China’s dominant producer of offshore crude oil and natural gas, reported surging profits on higher commodity prices.Meanwhile, Sinopec also experienced a jump in its income as the largest petroleum and petrochemical company in Asia saw strong product demand amid stringent cost controls.Nine-Month Segmental Performance    Upstream: PetroChina posted disappointing upstream output for the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017.In particular, crude oil output, accounting for 61% of the total, fell 5.2% from the year-ago period to 660.1 million barrels (MMBbl). On the other hand, marketable natural gas output was up by 4.5% to 2,539.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf). Overall, PetroChina’s total production of oil and natural gas declined 1.6% year over year to 1,083.4 million barrels of oil equivalent.However, average realized crude oil price during the first nine months of 2017 was $48.76 per barrel, representing a 36.2% jump from the year-ago period. Further, natural gas price rose 8.6% year-over-year to $5.07 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). This helped PetroChina’s upstream (or exploration & production) achieve an operating income of RMB 10,983 million — turning around from the year-ago operating loss of RMB 3,949 million. A tight leash on oil and gas lifting costs that decreased 1.9% from the same period last year, also helped results.Downstream: The Beijing-based company’s Refining & Chemicals business generated an operating income of RMB 27,732 million. This is down 19.2% from the year-earlier period’s earnings of RMB 34,311 million. The deterioration can be attributed to government-capped prices of refined-products (particularly gasoline and diesel) that do not allow PetroChina to pass high refining costs on to consumers. This was partly offset by the group’s strict cost control initiatives.PetroChina’s refinery division processed 744.5 MMBbl of crude oil during the nine-month period, up 5.2% from 2016. The company produced 6,880 thousand tons of synthetic resin in the period (reflecting a rise of 1.5% year over year), besides manufacturing 4,280 thousand tons of ethylene (up 3.2%). It also produced 67,591 thousand tons of gasoline, diesel and kerosene during the period compared with 63,669 thousand tons a year earlier.Natural Gas & Pipelines: Revenue rose 18.3% to RMB 206,578 million on improving natural gas volumes. However, PetroChina lost RMB 16,990 million on sales of imported natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Central Asia and Burma, RMB 6,420 wider than the first nine months of 2016.Nevertheless, a rise in natural gas prices, optimal utilization of its marketing channels and resources, together with pipeline transportation profitability, helped the Chinese behemoth’s segment earnings, which came in at RMB 18,045 million in the period under review.

186,HFC,"Suncor Energy Inc.’s (SU  -  Free Report) shares have scaled a 52-week high of $41.26 in yesterday’s trading session, before closing a tad lower at $41.15, generating a healthy year-to-date rate of more than 12%.Notably, the stock has had a good run in the market over the past year with its shares increasing 28.6%, outperforming its industry’s growth of more than 24.2% in the same time frame. We believe that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company still has upside potential, as is apparent from a VGM Score of A and long-term earnings growth rate of 8.50%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s delve deeper to analyze what’s driving the stock.Suncor Gains Traction from Solid 1Q’18 Results Since the release of Suncor’s results on May 2, 2018, its shares have moved up 8.4%. The integrated oil company delivered better-than-expected earnings in the first quarter on strong refining margins and remarkable refinery utilization of 98%, along with rebounding crude prices. Both the bottom and top lines witnessed year-over-year growth of 29.7% and 16.8%, respectively.Investor-Friendly MovesOne of the factors that is essentially fueling the company’s outperformance is its commitment toward dividend payouts and share repurchase programs. The Canadian oil giant ended 2017 on a high note owing to operational efficiency and recovering energy landscape, thereby generating enough to fund its full-year buyback to more than C$1.4 billion.Amid the industry downturn, while many energy companies slashed their dividend payouts, Suncor has remained a notable exception, continuing to hike its dividend for 16 consecutive years. Early this year, the company brought in good news for the shareholders by announcing a 12.5% dividend hike. Being confident of its strong cash-flow generation ability, it also authorized another C$2 billion of stock buybacks.In the last reported quarter, the company returned C$590 million to its shareholders through dividends and bought back C$389 million of outstanding shares.Robust Portfolio and Prudent ManagementSuncor boasts an impressive supply chain network, owning to significant oil sands and conventional production platform, along with a strong downstream portfolio, having a network of more than 1500 Petro-Canada retail and wholesale outlets. This makes the company less exposed to the volatile commodity market.Following the $15 billion Petro-Canada acquisition in 2009, Suncor has become one of the largest owners of oil sands in the world. The company’s asset base includes substantial conventional reserves and production at offshore Eastern Canada and in the North Sea, which generates strong margins and should provide free cash flow to fund future oil-sands expansion.With Suncor’s business model focused on upstream oil sands operation, midstream as well as refining/marketing, the company has been one of the most resilient energy players even during the oil slump. Notably, the company surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the last four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 10.35%.Management has done a good job strengthening its financial metrics during the downturn, through its aggressive expense management. This has helped the company to cash in on the recovering oil market more effectively. The company’s modest leverage ratio of around 23% has provided it financial flexibility to tap on the growth opportunities.Strategic Buyouts and Sell-OffsSuncor is making smart moves through a serious of acquisitions of late that are expected to further strengthen its growth momentum. In 2016, the company’s acquisition of rival Canadian Oil Sands, in a $6.6 billion deal, has helped Suncor further expand in the region and increase its hold in the Syncrude project.Early this year, the company expanded its ownership in the Syncrude project by buying additional 5% interest from its partner Mocal Energy for C$920 million, raising Suncor’s total stake to 58.74% and adding 17,500 barrels of oil equivalent to its production portfolio.Suncor further acquired 17.5% interest in the Fenja Development from Faroe Petroleum this year, adding a lesser-risked asset in its offshore portfolio. Finally, it also acquired additional working interest in the Fort Hills oil sands project from TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report).Notably, the Fort Hills project netted 29,800 barrels per day to Suncor in the recent quarter. The second extraction train at Fort Hills came online at the end of the first quarter, which is expected to further ramp up the production capacity. The project’s third train will also come online by the end of May, allowing Suncor to reach full 190,000 barrels per day capacity earlier than expected.Further, the company has not been shy of divesting assets, particularly those that do not fit into the company’s long-term growth plan. Last year, the company sold off its Petro-Canada lubricants business to Dallas-based HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC  -  Free Report) for more $1.13 billion.Wrapping UpAmid the uncertain regulatory environment in Canada, the company does not have many new projects in the pipeline. However, its focus on ramping up its production to wring more oil especially at its Fort Hills and Hebron projects throughout 2018 bodes well.Moreover, with oil sands cash operating costs falling drastically in the recent years (from $37 a barrel in 2013 to $23.80 a barrel in 2017), it has room for growth owing to smart buyouts and diversified business model. Its dividend and buyback programs also give it an edge over most of its rivals including Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE  -  Free Report) among others.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

187,HFC,"The old adage “Sell in May and Go Away” is unlikely to hold true this year. Following a two-month long chain of losses earlier in the year, stocks ended April marginally higher. Now, markets seem set to surge ahead in May and the rest of the summer. The resurgence of tech stocks, which had powered market gains for some time now, is a clear indicator that this rally is set to continue.Also, the strong performance of small-cap stocks indicates that investors are willing to take on more risk. Meanwhile, trade-related fears are receding. Investors are also choosing to ignore the surge in oil prices. Investing in stocks which have surged over the year and which sport strong fundamentals looks like a smart option at this point.Tech Stocks Rebound on Strong Earnings Tech stocks, which constitute nearly 25% of the total market capitalization, have rebounded strongly in recent weeks. The category had been weighed down by a string of headwinds, including persistent concerns over poor demand for Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhones.The data privacy scandal which hit Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) also triggered a broad selloff in tech shares. But a flurry of strong earnings performances, particularly from the dominant FAANG group of stocks, has powered a rebound in recent weeks.As of May 9, 2018, we have Q1 results from 84.3% of the Technology sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these companies are up +29.4% on +12% higher revenues, with 91.5% beating EPS estimates and the same proportion beating revenue estimates. (Read: A Critical Look at the Q1 Earnings Season)Small-Caps Remain PopularOn May 14, the small-cap heavy Russell 2000 index closed 0.4% lower. The decline came despite the index nearly breaching an intraday record created on Jan 24. Further, this also went against a trend which has built up over the last three months, where small-caps have outperformed their larger peers.A variety of factors have confabulated to create this phenomenon. Firstly, small-caps are viewed as U.S. focused companies. This perception allows them to be insulated from trade-related fears and other geopolitical tensions. Further, factors like a surging dollar are unlikely to impact companies with domestically focused operations.Trade Fears Receding, Oil Spike IgnoredMeanwhile, trade-related tensions between the United States and China seem to be receding. Firstly, it is increasingly clear that a new NAFTA deal is likely to be concluded. Additionally, in a rare overture to China, Trump announced on Sunday that he would be working with President Xi in order to save phone maker ZTE Corporation.Also, investors seem to be ignoring the fact that oil prices are close to a four-year high. Instead, markets are enjoying the current rally in energy stocks. Energy stocks gained 0.6% on Monday and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) is up 6.2% year-to-date.Our ChoicesThe rebound in tech stocks and continuing gains in small-cap stocks have ignited a new rally for the markets. With trade war fears receding and investors choosing to ignore the recent spike in oil prices, this stretch of gains is likely to continue over most of this summer.These factors are likely to negate the old adage of “Sell in May” this time around. Picking stocks with strong fundamentals which have surged over the year looks like a prudent choice at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

188,HFC,"We issued an updated research report on independent petroleum refiner, HollyFrontier Corporation (HFC  -  Free Report) on Aug 24. We believe that the company’s holding of fee-based assets through its partnership company, Holly Energy Partners, with limited commodity price exposure is a positive. However, increasing operating expense is a concern.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that the stock will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.HollyFrontier is one of the largest independent oil refiners in the United States with a combined crude oil processing capacity of approximately 457,000 barrels per day. A major advantage for the company is the high complexity index or the capability to process a wide mix of crude. It will also gain access to some of the fastest growing domestic markets afforded by its portfolio of five refineries.Through its 36% interest in Holly Energy Partners, the company maintains fee-based assets with limited commodity price exposure. Moreover, the partnership boasts of durable long-term contracts with major refining clients.Investors should know that the company has been returning cash to shareholders on a regular basis. The company has returned more than $4 billion to shareholders since the July 2011 merger between Holly Corp. and Frontier Oil - an extremely impressive track record. The downstream operator also pays a competitive dividend with a healthy yield of over 5%.The company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the prior four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.41%. Also, HollyFrontier’s price performance looks lucrative as reflected by its 16.7% gain over the last three months as compared with the 3.6% improvement of the industry.However, HollyFrontier and other refiners have been pegged back by margins that remain significantly lower than 5-year averages. Increasing operating costs per barrel have further narrowed the spread.Moreover, we are concerned about the company’s escalating expenses over the first six months of 2017. Increase in direct cost associated with unplanned outages and the heavy turnaround schedule continue to plague HollyFrontier. High maintenance levels during the most recent quarter also led to lower refinery segment production and sales volumes.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked players in the energy sector include TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report), Transmontaigne Partners LP (TLP  -  Free Report) and Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report) . All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

189,HFC,"HollyFrontier Corporation (HFC  -  Free Report) has been in investors' good books for quite some time now, owing to its refining strength, diversified operations and strategic strides. The downstream operator has had an impressive run on the bourses, with its shares surging by a whopping 208.8%, handily outperforming the industry’s growth of 64.5%.Let’s take a look at some of the factors that have been aiding this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s growth and helping it to sustain as a lucrative bet. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Refining Segment: The Real Needle-MoverHollyFrontier is one of the largest independent oil refiners in the United States, with a combined crude oil processing capacity of approximately 457,000 barrels per day. A major advantage of the company is the high-complexity index — the capability to process a wide mix of crude — and its access to some of the fastest-growing domestic markets, afforded by its portfolio of five refineries.While the company has successfully diversified its business by investing in the midstream activities, along with Lubricants and Specialty Products unit, its refining segment still remains the strongest, being the main contributor to its earnings. In the last reported quarter, net income from the segment was $309.3 million, reflecting a massive turnaround from the year-ago quarter’s loss of more than $94 million.In spite of the recovering crude strength, refining environment has been favorable for the company, as it has been taking advantage of the pricing discrepancies of various crude oils. Since HollyFrontier has the capacity to refine heavy or sour crude, unlike many other refiners, the company can purchase crude at discounted prices, thereby securing higher margins. Along with that, the company has also managed to run its facilities at high utilization rates, thereby helping it to reduce per-barrel operating costs.IDR-Simplification Deal Bodes WellWith the completion of the incentive distribution rights (IDR) deal with its partnership last October, HollyFrontier now owns more than 59% stake and a non-economic general partner interest in Holly Energy Partners L.P. (HEP  -  Free Report). The IDR deal has incentivized the company to manage operations efficiently, tap acquisition opportunities and improve payout for both HollyFrontier and Holly Energy. Holly Energy helps the company achieve fee-based revenues with limited commodity price exposure. In the last reported quarter, the segment profitability was $64.4 million, up from $52.1 million in the year-ago period.Strategic Acquisition Boosts ProfitabilityThe Petro-Canada Lubricants acquisition of 2017 helped HollyFrontier expand into the high-margin, less competitive business of producing specialty lubricants. While being immediately accretive to the company's earnings and cash flows, the deal was a smart one as it allowed HollyFrontier to inherit a strong brand portfolio with growing market demand.Healthy Financials Spur Investor-Friendly MovesThe company possesses a robust balance sheet with a manageable debt-to-capital ratio of 28%, providing it with ample financial flexibility.  As a show of confidence in its cash flow generating ability, HollyFrontier resumed its planned buyback activity during the first quarter, shelling out $25.2 million in stock repurchases. The downstream operator also pays a competitive dividend with a healthy yield.Other Favorable ReadingsIn addition to a favorable Zacks Rank, the stock has a VGM Score of A, which highlights its attractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.Its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 10.2% compares favorably with 9.6% for its industry. This reflects the fact that it is efficient in using its shareholders’ funds.HollyFrontier has also been witnessing solid activity in the earnings estimates front, which further boosts analysts’ optimism in the stock.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has increased around 7.5% to $5.28 per share over the past seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 has also moved up 16.5% over the same time frame to $5.93.HollyFrontier is also valued attractively. The company’s forward P/E ratio of 14.9 (versus the industry’s 22.42) and P/S ratio of 0.9 suggest that HollyFrontier is a pretty good value pick, as investors have to pay a relatively lower price for each dollar of earnings, and that it has decent revenue metrics to back up its earnings.Final ThoughtsThe company has set ambitious growth plans for itself, aiming to double the size of each of its segment to gain economies of scale. As it is, the mega-merger news of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) and Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) has left investors wondering which companies could be the next in line. With HollyFrontier’s growth goals, it comes as no surprise that the company is in the lookout for prudent acquisitions that can further boost its long-term prospects and add economies of scale.While the company is bearing the brunt of increasing costs, we believe that HollyFrontier can easily tide over this limitation backed by its solid financials, refining strength and diversified operations.As it is, the company’s strategic initiatives to enhance growth are expected to carry the momentum forward. HollyFrontier expects to deliver year-over-year growth of 127.59% in 2018 earnings. Moreover, it seems to be an impressive choice for the growth investors, with an expected earnings improvement rate (next three to five years) of 8.93%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

190,HFC,"Are U.S. stock markets finally stabilizing after being plagued by extreme volatility in the last three months? The answer seems to be in the affirmative. Two major indexes – S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite - are trending upwards for four consecutive trading days. Barring minor fluctuations on Tuesday, the Dow 30 index has also been largely trading in the green for trailing four days.Robust labor market data for May, easing of trade war fears, tech stock boom and hike in the U.S. government bond yields resulting in gain for the banking sector are the primary reasons behind this encouraging performance of stocks. These positives are likely to remain constant in the near-term and consequently investment in momentum stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank will be a prudent move.Indexes Moving NorthOn Jun 6, the Dow 30 closed at 25,146.39, after gaining 346.41 points or 1.4%. This was blue-chip index’s highest level of closing since Mar 12. Likewise, the benchmark S&P 500 closed at 2,772.35, up 0.9% reflecting its highest level of closing since Mar 12.The teach-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed at 7,689.24, up 0.7%. The index also recorded its third consecutive all-time closing high after hitting a fresh record high for the first time in almost three months on Jun 4.Robust Labor Market DataOn Jun 1, The Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in May, exceeding the consensus estimate of 190,000. The unemployment rate declined from 3.9% in April to 3.8% in May, the lowest in 18 years. The decline in the unemployment rate indicates the extent to which the labor market has tightened. However, most economists think job additions will continue and that the unemployment rate will decline further. (Read more: Unemployment Falls to 18-Year Low: 6 Winning Picks)Trade War Fear EasesAccording to a report by ABC News, on Jun 4, the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin urged President Donald Trump to exempt Canada from metal tariffs during a trade meeting. The U.S. government has imposed 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminum on Canadian imports since Jun 1.  Meanwhile, China has offered to purchase nearly $70 billion of U.S. farm and energy products if the United States refrains from imposing further tariffs on the country. Moreover, President Trump is scheduled to meet his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-Un on Jun 12 in Singapore to reach an amicable solution about North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.Bank Stocks Gain on Higher Bond YieldsOn Jun 6, the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury Note rose 5.9 basis points to 2.975%, its highest since May 24. The hike in U.S. government bond yield is a result of strong sell off of Eurozone bonds following a senior European Central Bank (ECB) official’s remark that the ECB remained on track to debate next week the timetable for ending its monthly bond purchase scheme.Hike in bond yield was also supported by the market sentiment that the Fed will raise interest rate as labor market is tightening and wage growth will result in inflation.

191,HFC,"We have closed the book for the Q2 earnings season with releases from all S&P 500 Oil/ Energy companies already out. From our article, it is clear that the Energy sector contributed the most to year-over-year earnings growth in the S&P 500 Index.Among the major industries in the Energy sector, we found Q2 performances of the Oil Refining & Marketing industry the most impressive. The refining industry generated huge cash flow from core operations for investors in second-quarter 2017. Also, the industry’s dividend yield is higher than that of the S&P 500 Index. Thus, it is a good time to consider stocks from the oil refining industry.Oil Refining IndustryThis industry mainly deals in downstream operations. Companies belonging to this space have plants that help refine raw crude to produce end products like gasoline, heating oils and diesel. In other words, refining companies buy raw crude from the exploration and production players and sell the refined products.The industry has a good industry rank and is undervalued as compared to the S&P 500 index. Industry RankIn terms of Zacks Industry Rank,Oil Refining Industry is among the top performing industries.The industry is ranked #100 and lies in the top 39% of industries. The industry rank is impressive as the top 50% of the Zacks Ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Undervalued as Compared to S&P 500Compared to the S&P 500, the Oil Refining Industry is undervalued. This implies that the industry has more potential to grow in the near future compared to the index. The Oil Refining industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.57, which is below the index’s mark of 10.69. The EV/EBITDA ratio is one of the best multiples for valuing oil and gas companies because energy firms have a large amount of debt and EV (Enterprise Value) has included the parameter.Terrific Q2 Performance With the help of our proprietary model, we picked up key parameters that highlighted the terrific performance of the Oil Refining Industry during the second quarter of this year.Beats S&P 500 The performance of any stock or industry over a specified period of time gets reflected in the pricing chart. The April-to-June quarter has clearly shown that the Oil Refining & Marketing industry has surpassed the S&P 500 Index.During the aforesaid period, the industry has gained 4.4% as compared with the 2.8% improvement of the index. We are highlighting the positive price movement of the Oil Refining industry as many major industries in the Oil/Energy sector have seen negative movements.Cash Flow & Earnings Skyrocket During second-quarter 2017, net cash flow from operations from the Oil Refining industry jumped more than 200% sequentially to $973 million. In other words, the industry saw a marked improvement in cash flow in Q2 from the decline in Q1.On top of that, earnings out of core operations – as measured by earnings before income, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) – was registered at $776 million, highlighting almost 60% improvement from the prior quarter.Lucrative Dividend Yield for Q2Along with improved earnings, the Oil Refining industry also recorded a lucrative dividend yield which outpaced the S&P 500 Index.During the April-to-June quarter of this year, the industry reported dividend yield of 3.35%, which is far better than 1.9% yield of the S&P 500 Index.Refining Stocks in FocusPicking the prospective energy stocks can be a daunting task. To simplify the screening process, we have resorted to our proprietary stock screener.

192,HFC,"It was a week where both oil and natural gas prices suffered losses.On the news front, upstream biggies Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD  -  Free Report) and Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) came up with contrasting second quarter results, while pipeline firm Genesis Energy L.P. (GEL  -  Free Report) is set to enter the chemical industry with the acquisition of the alkali business of Tronox Ltd.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged down 0.3% to close at $49.58 per barrel, while natural gas prices declined 5.7% to $2.7740 per million Btu (MMBtu).Following the year’s best week, oil prices logged a slight drop this time around. The commodity was affected by lingering concerns over OPEC and its allies' success in rebalancing the market after a survey showed that the cartel's output climbed to the highest level of the year in July and its exports were at record levels. Meanwhile, domestic production rose to a 2-year high.However, most of the negativity was offset by the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release that showed a sharp increase in refinery demand. Investors also cheered a lower rig count as it pointed to the softening of shale drilling activities.  Natural gas also turned lower amid worries over the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of bearish weather predictions and a steady increase in production.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Leading upstream energy company Pioneer Natural Resourcesreported second-quarter 2017 earnings, excluding one-time items, of 21 cents per share. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents per share. Notably, the company had incurred adjusted loss of 22 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Significantly high commodity price realizations along with the Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program resulted in the strong quarterly performance.Total production in the reported quarter averaged 259.1 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), up 12% year over year. The Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program of the company led to the outperformance. On an oil equivalent basis, average realized price was $32.56 per barrel in the reported quarter as compared with $28.95 a year ago.For 2017, Pioneer intends to spend $2.7 billion, lower than the prior projection of $2.8 billion. Of this, it has planned drilling and completion capex of $2.4 billion and spending budget for water infrastructure, vertical integration and field facilities of $275 million. Pioneer expects production in the range of 274 MBOE/d to 279 MBOE/d for the third quarter of 2017.(Read more: Pioneer Natural Q2 Earnings Top on Increased Drilling.)2.    U.S. energy firm Apache Corp. reported second-quarter loss per share – excluding one-time items – of 21 cents against the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a profit of a penny. The underperformance stems from a dip in output due to a conservative capital budget over the past two years. However, the bottom line improved from the year-ago loss of 26 cents amid higher realizations.The production of oil and natural gas (excluding divested assets and non-controlling interests) averaged 387,562 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d) (65% liquids), down 16% from last year.The average realized crude oil price during the second quarter was $46.89 per barrel, representing an increase of 9% from the year-ago realization of $43.14. Moreover, the average realized natural gas price during the Jun quarter of 2017 was $2.60 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 27% from the year-ago period.After aligning its spending plans with the low-price environment during the oil rout, Apache is now looking to increase its capital investment after achieving cost rationalization. With returns-focused growth in mind, Apache announced a 2017 capital budget of $3.1 billion, representing a 60% increase over its 2016 spend.Keeping with the company’s planned shift in strategic objective, Apache’s oil and gas capital investments totaled $738 million during the Apr-Jun period, 85% higher than the $400 million incurred a year ago. (Read more Apache Reports Q2 Loss on Reduced Production.)3.    Oil and gas transportation and refining partnership, Genesis Energy, L.P. recently announced that it will enter the chemical industry with the acquisition of the alkali business of Stamford, CT-based Tronox Ltd. Per the deal, Genesis Energy will be shelling out $1.325 billion in cash to the chemicals and minerals maker for the assets.Investors should know that Tronox's alkali business, located at its Green River, WY. facilities, which is one of the biggest in the world, includes the trona and trona-based marketing, mining, exploring, processing, producing, and selling operations. It produces approximately 28% - 4 million tons - of the world's natural soda ash (sodium bicarbonate) output every year. It is used for various purposes like glass making, baking of goods, detergents, industrial chemical production, etc.Genesis Energy – carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) – believes the alkali business has a reserve life of more than 100 years. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The buyout will help Genesis Energy in terms of its current asset base and aid the partnership to serve the refineries and petrochemical facilities connected with its pipelines better. It is in line with Genesis Energy’s strategy to diversify its business.Per the partnership, the soda ash assets generate stable cash flow, which might help with its $3.02 billion debt, as reported in second-quarter 2017. The estimated EBITDA from the business for the last 12-month period, which ended on Jun 30, 2017, was $166 million. (Read more: Genesis Energy Eyes Chemical Industry with Alkali Unit Buyout.)4.    Houston, TX-based leading upstream energy firm Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter adjusted loss of 24 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. Lower-than-expected production from the U.S. land markets impacted results.Marathon Oil reported North American production available for sale of 222,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d), down from 224,000 BOE/d in the second quarter of 2016. The deterioration was mainly due to reduced drilling and completion activities mainly in the Eagle Ford and Bakken Basins.Marathon Oil’s total quarterly cost and expenses declined by 10.1% to $1,085 million in the reported quarter compared with the prior-year figure of $1,207 million. The decrease is attributed to the lower exploration, production, marketing and general/administrative costs. However, the decrease was partially offset by higher depreciation expenses and other operating costs.Marathon Oil has raised its production guidance for the full-year 2017 and expects the production available for sale from the combined North America and International E&P segments, excluding Libya, to average 345,000–360,000 BOE/d, about 7% higher than 2016. (Read more: Marathon Oil Q2 Loss Wider than Expected, Revenues Beat.)5.    U.S. refiner HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC  -  Free Report) reported strong second-quarter results, helped by improving refining margins, higher production and contribution from the newly acquired PCLI unit.Net income from the Refining segment – which is the main contributor to HollyFrontier earnings – was $86.6 million, turning around from the loss of $436.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The improvement reflects wider gross margins, which jumped 29% to $11.47 per barrel.Total refined product sales volumes averaged 483,210 barrels per day (bpd), up 9% from the 442,660 bpd in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, throughput increased from 428,590 bpd in the year-ago quarter to 467,090 bpd. Capacity utilization, at 102.13%, was up from 101.7% in the second quarter of 2016.Income from the newly acquired Petro-Canada Lubricants Inc. (or PCLI) business – bought from Canadian oil and gas giant Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) earlier this year – totaled $12.6 million. Product sales averaged 23,720 bpd, while production and throughput came in at 20,880 bpd and 21,470 bpd, respectively.

193,HFC,"Strong performance from Wellbore Technologies and Completion and Production Solutions segment helped energy equipment maker National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) report narrower-than-expected third-quarter 2017 loss.Loss per share (excluding one-time items) came in at 7 cents compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 8 cents. The bottom line also improved considerably from the year-ago period’s loss of 34 cents.Despite challenging market conditions and the disruption caused by Hurricane Harvey, the strong acceptance of National Oilwell Varco’s new launches meant that adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $167 million, reflecting an improvement of $25 million from the second quarter.Third-quarter revenues of $1,835 million increased from $1,646 million a year ago but were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,869 million as customers continue to restrict capital spending to only bare essentials.Segmental PerformanceRig Systems: Revenues came in at $330 million, down 29.8% from the year-ago quarter and below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $356 million. The unit’s adjusted EBITDA plunged 44% year over year to $28 million on deferred deliveries and scarcity of new equipment orders. However, it was ahead of the $25.3 million envisioned by analysts polled by Zacks as an amended agreement with a client resulted in wiping off around $100 million from the segment’s backlog and a small gain.Rig Aftermarket: The segment generated revenues of $311 million, down 3.4% from the year-ago period and unable to beat our projection of $349 million. Adjusted EBITDA dropped 14.8% from the third quarter of 2016 to $69 million and failed to match our projection of $87 million. Spare parts demand remains tepid due to weak market conditions, while an unfavorable product mix played its part too.Wellbore Technologies: The segment’s revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $672 million and rose 31.7% year over year to $693 million. Importantly, the unit improved significantly from last year’s adjusted EBITDA of $26 million to clock $94 million this time. The figure also managed to edge past our guidance of $93 million on higher volumes stemming from greater market adoption of the unit’s new technology introductions.Completion & Production Solutions: Revenues for the segment were recorded at $682 million, up 25.6% from $543 million in the year-ago quarter and just ahead of our $679 million estimate. The unit recorded adjusted EBITDA of $97 million, up from $43 million in the corresponding period last year and outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $93 million. Heightened land activity in North America and the Middle East impacted profitability.BacklogCapital equipment orders’ backlog for Rig Systems was $2,010 million as of Sep 30, including $84 million in new orders during the third quarter.Moreover, Completion & Production Solutions segment reported a backlog of $974 million in capital equipment order as at the end of the third quarter. The figure – which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $898 million – included $463 million in new orders.Balance SheetAs of Sep 30, the company, which last year teamed up with General Electric Co. (GE  -  Free Report) to provide industry-leading standardized interfaces, had cash and cash equivalents of $1,722 million and long-term debt of $2,707 million.

195,HFC,"Looking for broad exposure to the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market? You should consider the SPDR S&P 400 Mid Cap Value ETF (MDYV  -  Free Report), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 11/08/2005.The fund is sponsored by State Street Global Advisors. It has amassed assets over $742.90 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Mid Cap ValueMid cap companies have market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. They usually have higher growth prospects than large cap companies and are less volatile than small cap companies. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.15%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.80%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 19% of the portfolio. Industrials and Information Technology round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Hollyfrontier Corporation (HFC  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.29% of total assets, followed by Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and Reinsurance Group Of America Incorporated (RGA  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 10.71% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskMDYV seeks to match the performance of the S&P MidCap 400 Value Index before fees and expenses. This Index measures the performance of the mid-capitalization value sector in the U.S. equity market. The Index consists of those stocks in the S&P MidCap 400 Index exhibiting the strongest value characteristics based on: book value to price ratio;earnings to price ratio & sales to price ratio.The ETF has added about 0.79% so far this year and was up about 10.94% in the last one year (as of 05/14/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $92.76 and $106.43.The ETF has a beta of 1 and standard deviation of 14.56% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 298 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR S&P 400 Mid Cap Value ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, MDYV is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Mid Cap ETFs area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF (VOE  -  Free Report) and the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF (IWS  -  Free Report) track a similar index. While Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF has $8.45 B in assets, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF has $10.58 B. VOE has an expense ratio of 0.07% and IWS charges 0.25%.Bottom-LineAn increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

201,HFC,"Shares of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) have scaled a new 52-week high of $74.92 in yesterday’s trading session, before eventually closing at $72.88, generating a healthy year-to-date rate of more than 10%. The stock displays impressive price movement both in absolute and relative terms. The company has had a great run over a year with its shares rallying in excess of 48%, outperforming its industry’s gain of 22.8% in the same time frame.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectation of 14.49% and looks poised to touch new highs in coming period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)  stocks here.The company fared well in 2017, delivering a net income of $3.4 billion and marking a whopping year-over-year surge of more than 192%. Marathon Petroleum — whose peers include HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC  -  Free Report) and Delek US Holdings, Inc. among others — pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 182.62% in the trailing four quarters on the back of improved performance in all its segments — Refining, Retail and Midstream.The company’s strategic initiatives to enhance growth are expected to boost performance in the future. Marathon Petroleum expects to deliver year-over-year growth of 24.21% in its earnings in 2018.Let’s delve deeper to analyze what’s driving the stock.Drop-Down Deals Leading to Cash InfluxTo accelerate value accretion for shareholders and boost growth, Marathon Petroleum has been actively engaged in drop-down transactions lately. As part of that effort, the company divested some of its terminal, pipeline and storage assets to its midstream subsidiary, MPLX L.P. (MPLX  -  Free Report). The $8.1 billion dropdown deal with MPLX that closed last month has resulted in huge cash influx and increased equity participation in the partnership. Moreover, the transaction also ensures the generation of a steady revenue stream for the company.The cash influx has bolstered the share buyback and dividend programs of the company, boosting investors’ confidence. Marathon Petroleum returned more than $3 billion of capital to its shareholders through dividends and buybacks in 2017. The downstream operator is known for raising dividends since it became a standalone public company in mid-2011. Notably, the dividend hikes and buybacks, since the company's inception, have totaled in excess of $13 billion.Midstream Segment Set to GrowthIn 2017, the MPLX unit generated income of more than $1.3 billion compared with more than $1 billion in 2016. MPLX’s robust portfolio of projects in the Permian, Marcellus and STACK shale plays offers significant growth opportunities. The drop-down deals have enhanced MPLX’s scale and increased its distributable cash flow per unit. It will also enrich its earnings by diversifying it with fee-based stable revenue streams, which will get reflected in the profitability of its parent company in the future.MPLX’s new Cushing-to-Patoka Expansion project concluded its binding open season late last month and garnered a substantial interest from potential shippers. The expansion process is expected to be over by the second quarter and come online in the third quarter of 2018. Moreover, the expansion project is expected to increase the partnership’s revenue opportunities and augment its distributable cash flow in the long term.Speedway a DriverMarathon Petroleum’s retail unit, Speedway — the second largest gasoline and convenience-store chain in the United States — achieved a robust full-year performance in 2017, generating revenues of $19,033 million, up 4.1% from $18,286 million recorded in 2016. The segment remains primed for solid earnings and growth on healthy merchandise margins, and its marketing enhancement opportunities and acquisition synergies, including the retail arm of Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report).Notably, Marathon Petroleum intends to make an investment of around $530 million in Speedway in 2018 by the construction of new stores and remodeling the existing ones, thus focusing on organic growth opportunities. Marathon Petroleum intends to strengthen the geographical foothold of its Speedway unit by entering new markets including Georgia, South Carolina and upstate New York. The company believes that the improving market conditions are likely to boost margins and the financial position of the Speedway unit in the coming quarters.Refining Margins Fuel IncomeOperating income from the Refining & Marketing segment surged 71% year over year in 2017. The jump was led by wider crack spread leading to stronger refining margin and higher capacity utilization. Refining margins averaged $12.60 in 2017 against $11.16 in 2016.We expect the margin strength to continue in the near-to-medium term, thus boosting the overall performance of the company.Other Growth CatalystsMarathon Petroleum's financial flexibility and strong balance sheet are its real assets.  As of Dec 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $3,011 million and a manageable debt-to-capitalization ratio of 38.4%.The corporate rate cut from 35% to 21% has also benefited the company, reducing its cash burden. Notably, earnings for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 included a tax benefit of around $1.5 billion.We expect Marathon Petroleum’s impressive asset quality, extensive midstream/retail network along with its commitment to return more value to investors to keep the stock poised for growth trajectory for the remainder of 2018.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

204,HFC,"The latest job data reflected a decline in Unites States’ unemployment rate to an 18-year low in May 2018. This led to a sharp rally in domestic securities last weekend. In fact, the optimism over the U.S. job data helped the market to shrug off the lingering concerns over global trade on Jun 1. Evidently, a swift rally in technology and consumer discretionary stocks led the broader market indices to record highs. With other fundamental data indicating a healthy economy, the stage is set for the U.S. market to remain on an upward trajectory, raising hopes for more such upswings in the future.However, considering the fact that uncertainty can hit the global equity market anytime, it is better to be prepared than repent later. This is why investors need to be aware about leverage.In the world of investment, leverage is a popular investment strategy, through which companies borrow funds to finance business expansion, purchase inventory and other assets as well as support different aspects of business operations. However, for a safe investment strategy, understanding the amount of financial leverage that a company bears is crucial. This is because financial leverage multiplies the underlying business risk.Of course, entirely avoiding companies with debt loads is virtually impossible as debt financing is an inherent feature of corporate financing. Still, eliminating those with exorbitant debt load might be a wise idea, since the more a company is leveraged, the more prone it is to get hit at times of a financial crunch.Therefore, to safeguard their portfolio from losses, the real challenge for an investor is to determine whether the organization’s debt level is sustainable. Historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company.According to estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts are predicting earnings growth of 18.9% in the second quarter and a continuation of double-digit growth for the rest of the year. Considering such projections, investors will most likely go for stocks that are exhibiting solid earnings growth. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio, in times of economic downturns, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.Considering this, it will be wise for investors to select companies with low leverage. These are financially more secure and immune to financial bankruptcy.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 25 stocks that made it through the screen.HollyFrontier Corporation (HFC  -  Free Report): The company produces and markets gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, asphalt, heavy products and specialty lubricant products.

206,HFC,"With gasoline price inching upward in recent weeks, the cost to fill up over Memorial Day weekend this year will be dearer than it was a year ago, and the costliest it has been in more than four years. Agreed, gasoline prices usually rise during this time of the year as motorists take to the roads for summer travel but it seems that the fuel is starting to go up too much.What's Behind High Prices at the Pump?The rebound in crude has markedly raised the average price of U.S. gasoline, the most widely used petroleum product.Gasoline prices are dependent on four factors: crude oil price, taxes, refining costs and marketing and distribution expenses. According to The Association for Convenience & Fuel Retailing, or NACS, crude oil costs account for about two-third of gasoline prices. Therefore, the worldwide demand and supply for crude oil is a major factor in deciding gasoline prices.Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. weekly regular gasoline retail prices per gallon reached an average of $2.92 per gallon on May 21, more than 50 cents up from the same time last year. Importantly, this marked the highest average price going into the Memorial Day weekend – the traditional start of the summer driving season – since 2014.The ongoing rally in crude prices have seen the U.S. Energy Department boost its summer average pump price projections to $2.90 per gallon. To put things in perspective, gasoline prices averaged $2.41 per gallon during April-September 2017.Another reason for the spike in gasoline prices is the combination of high demand and low supply. At 233.9 million barrels, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 2.5% below the year-earlier level, while demand recently hit an all-time high of 9.857 million barrels a day. Meanwhile, refineries are running at their maximum capacities and there is hardly any room for increasing supply.High Gas Prices Unlikely to Deter Travel Demand However, it seems that rising gasoline prices are not likely to stop people from taking to the highways for the Memorial Day holiday weekend. According to the American Automobile Association (AAA), about 36.6 million travelers are forecast to travel by road during the weekend, 5% more than last year. If the prediction is to be believed, then this Memorial Day weekend might be the busiest in more than a decade, with the highest travel volume since 2005. With the U.S. economy improving and consumer confidence remaining strong, more Americans are taking vacations. Further, consumers are benefitting from a much-improved job market and growing disposable income.The expectation for record driving numbers is welcome news for U.S. refiners, who sell gasoline through independent retailers and their own units.Three Refining Stocks to BuyAmong the handful of refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the U.S., we have shortlisted three of them that might fetch you outstanding returns.

It has amassed assets over $749.16 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Mid Cap ValueMid cap companies have market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. They usually have higher growth prospects than large cap companies and are less volatile than small cap companies. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.15%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.78%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise.

208,HFC,"On September 11, the United Nations Security Council declared fresh sanctions against North Korea. It took only eight days after North Korea’s sixth and most powerful nuclear test for the UN to pass this resolution.The United States was initially demanding a complete oil embargo to fully paralyze the North Korean economy, but later softened its demands. The UN, meanwhile, ended up imposing restrictions on the rouge nation’s oil imports. The toughest-ever UN sanctions against North Korea also call for a complete ban on its import of natural gas liquids and condensates. Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said imposing restrictions on fuel and oil supplies will restrict North Korea from funding programs related to nuclear and missile tests. The aggressive step taken by the UN to partially paralyze the North Korean regime is indeed commendable. But tensions within North Korea may indirectly hurt global demand for crude.U.S. Seeks to Freeze China’s Oil Exports to North KoreaNorth Korea imports nearly all of its crude supplies from China. In fact, China meets 90% of North Korea’s oil demand, according to media resources. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), North Korea’s average daily crude import is roughly 10,000 barrels. These volumes are sent to the Ponghwa Chemical Factory, which is North Korea’s only oil refinery. So, if China stops exporting oil, the economy of North Korea may bear the brunt. And if refined fuels like gasoline and diesel become scarce, public transportation and logistics costs will significantly rise.UN Refrains From Complete Oil EmbargoThe UN has decided not to allow North Korea’s crude imports to exceed its last 12-month average, restricting the annual export of refined petroleum products to 2 million barrels. This is less than half the volumes — 4.5 million barrels of refined petroleum products — that the country imports annually, as per data provided by some U.S. officials. According to the U.S. estimate, these fresh sanctions will ensure that North Korea gets 56% less fuel from abroad.Moreover, import of natural gas liquids and condensates by North Korea has been totally banned.While producing natural gas, producers also get low density crud, which is referred to as condensates; natural gas also contains fuels like propane and butane in its raw state. With the total ban on natural gas imports, North Korea will not receive any substitute for refined petroleum products, supplies of which have now been capped.Textile Exports, Overseas Contracts Take a HitThe resolution also places a ban on North Korea’s textile exports. As per Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency, North Korea’s textile industry generated the second-highest export revenues of $752 million, second only to coal, in 2016.Also, the UN will not allow the renewal of contracts for overseas North Korean workers. Investors should note that North Korea makes $500 million annually out of taxing salaries of roughly 93,000 laborers working abroad, according to Nikki Haley.In fact, Haley believes that all these measures may not even fully paralyze North Korea’s economy, but will just take the country several steps backward from funding its weapons program. As per the estimate provided by the U.S., the resolution will likely lead to a revenue loss of $1.3 billion for North Korea.Crude Prices to Fall, Gasoline Prices to BenefitA debate has ensued regarding North Korea’s possible retaliation to these sanctions. Several market watchers think Pyongyang is preparing a strong response for the U.S.. Overall, the energy sector will be severely affected if North Korean tensions result in conflicts with neighboring countries like China, Japan and South Korea.According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, South China Sea is the route through which more than 33% of worldwide crude and 50% of global liquefied natural gas are transported every year. Hence, violence following military actions in and around North Korea may stop the flow of imported oil to South Korea, Japan, and China.According to energy consultancy group Wood Mackenzie, South Korea, Japan, and China are responsible for almost 34% of global trade for crude, transported by sea. Also, data provided by World’s Top Exports (WTEx), shows that China, Japan, and South Korea are among the top five oil importing countries in the world, accounting for almost 32% of worldwide crude import, with China being the largest oil importing nation. The total value of crude, imported by the three countries in 2016, was estimated at $211.2 billion by this independent education and research website.Hence, North Korean tensions will probably lower global crude demand to a great extent. Asia’s leading refining plants, accounting for 65% of the continent’s total refining capacity, are located in China, Japan, and South Korea, as per Wood Mackenzie. Therefore, any military action in North Korea might lead to significant reduction of oil demand by refiners. Either way, strong forces are working to push crude prices lower.  If the flow of imported crude is cut off, China, Japan, and South Korea will have to rely on their respective limited domestic crude reserves to carry out daily operations. As a result, there will be lower gasoline production by refiners. Scarcity of gasoline will likely flare up commodity prices.U.S. Oil Refiners to GainLower crude prices and higher gasoline prices will boost margins for U.S. refining players. This is because refiners buy raw crude to produce refined petroleum products like gasoline. The end products are then sold at fuel pump stations.This is why it is time for investors to focus on the refining industry. The Zacks Oil Refining industry is ranked #62 and lies in the top 24% of industries. This is a good industry rank, as the top 50% of the Zacks Ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

217,HFC,"BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) is expected to gain from the recently enacted changes to U.S. corporate taxes.BP expects future after-tax earnings to be favorably impacted owing to the cutback of the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%. This is effective from Jan 1, 2018.The change in the corporate income tax rate is subject to several provisions in the legislation, which is being reviewed by the company.BP’s U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities are required owing to the lowering of the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21%. BP projects a one-off non-cash charge of about $1.5 billion in fourth-quarter 2017 income statement. The earnings will be released on Feb 6, when the final actual charge will be recognized.As energy industry is capital intensive, the new changes in corporate taxes are beneficial to this sector. The companies will be able to deduct capital expenditures from taxable income, immediately, per the provisions of the tax reform bill. In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be deducted from the tax in the year they are incurred. Consequently, the domestic companies need to plan judiciously regarding capital expenditure.In 2018, the companies’ tax bills will be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. The companies will have more cash in hand to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Therefore, some oil majors with huge capital spending like ExxonMobil Corp (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) and Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) are likely to gain from these changes.Price PerformanceShares of BP have gained 9.5% compared with the industry’s rally of 6.3% in the last three months.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Operations is only restricted to putting the site in a secure state, end construction and close active permits.  SCE&G has offered to relinquish abandoned interest in the VCS Units 2 and 3 projects to Santee Cooper, for no consideration.

219,HFC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly draw to the lowest level since 2015. On a further bullish note, domestic oil production snapped its steadily rising trend and fell for the first time since October.But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was partly offset by another build in gasoline and distillate supplies.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged up 0.3% (or 20 cents) to end at $59.84 per barrel yesterday – within touching distance of the more-than-two-year highs reached earlier in the week.Energy Stocks on a RollWith the federal data showing the sixth consecutive week of U.S. stockpiles decline, energy stocks have been in a strong uptrend lately.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 2.9% and 7%, respectively, in the past month. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 during the period were oil and oil-related stocks like Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) and Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 4.6 million barrels for the week ending Dec 22, following a decrease of 6.5 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.5 million barrels.An uptick in refinery demand and decline in U.S. output for the first time in more than two months led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 30 of the last 38 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 431.9 million barrels, current crude supplies are 11.1% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 1.6 million barrels to 51.4 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 25.6 days in the previous week to 25.2 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.4 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the seventh straight week on strong production. The 591,000 barrels addition – less than the polled number of 1.3 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 228.8 million barrels. Following last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now up 0.6% year over year and is also above the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) was up 1.1 million barrels last week, as opposed to analysts’ expectations for 780,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The surprise weekly rise could be attributed to higher output. At 129.9 million barrels, current supplies are 14.3% below the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.6% from the prior week to 95.7%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products.

220,HFC,"Investors in HollyFrontier Corporation (HFC  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2018 $27 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for HollyFrontier shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, HollyFrontier is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry that ranks in the Top 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, six analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 33 cents per share to 93 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about HollyFrontier right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

221,HFC,"With just a few days left before we ring in the New Year, it seems to be the right time to reflect on how the Oils-Energy sector has fared so far in 2017 and how it’s poised for 2018.A Look at Energy Sector’s 2017 PerformanceAfter emerging as the top-performing sector in 2016, the Oils-Energy sector has had a relatively turbulent ride this year. Till September, commodity prices have remained volatile and have been hovering mostly within the $45-$55 per barrel range. In the June-August period, it has consistently traded below the threshold mark of $50 a barrel. Notably, in June 2017, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell to nearly $42 a barrel — the lowest in ten months.The lacklustre performance of the sector in the first nine months of the year can be seen from the graph below. The chart clearly indicates that the sector has declined over 5.8% underperforming the S&P 500 index, which appreciated 12.6% over the said period. The sector was plagued with increased domestic oil production which continues to be a potent headwind for the market. While OPEC is taking initiatives to trim output to address the supply gut, it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more. The tightening of global oil market is thus getting undermined and prices have remained under constant pressure. The latest rig count report by Houston-based Baker Hughes hints at an oversupplied market, wherein it reported increase in the total U.S. rig count from 665 to 931, year to date.However, things have started to look up for the sector over the past few months with the prices consistently trading at above the $55 a barrel mark. A number of factors have propelled this positivity. These include the OPEC-led production cut extension, lower inventory overhang and rising demand.Recently the commodity traded at $60 per barrel — the highest mark since Jun 25, 2015. We are optimistic about the fact that the sector has outperformed the S&P 500 index in a month. It has gained 5.72% compared with the S&P 500 index that advanced 2.19% over the same time frame.  Notably, energy has been the best S&P sector performer in the third quarter of 2017. Third-quarter reported earnings figures have been impressive and earnings estimates have started to move north. In fact, among all the 16 Zacks sectors in the index, energy is probably the only one which is expected to witness triple-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter. Reflecting the bullishness, the sector’s debt has been declining and free cash flow has been increasing, signaling overall improvement in finances.Can Energy Sector Tread on a Growth Trajectory in 2018?Crude supply has been normalizing, which has pushed the price of WTI and Brent to new two-year highs. The improving commodity pricing environment looks somewhat sustainable on the back of tailwinds like the OPEC production cuts which are expected to continue till 2018-end along with improved demand outlook.On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016. OPEC and fellow exporters also announced plans to remain open to extend their production-cut agreement beyond March, 2018 — an imperative step to combat the global crude glut. Some cartel members including less compliant nations like Iraq have also signalled another round of supply cuts.As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Through the end of next year, Saudi Arabia, Russia and their allies pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market.Investors have pinned hopes of recovery on the recent U.S. Energy Department's inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles — pointing to a slowdown in shale output. U.S. crude inventories have decreased by 6.5 million barrels to 436.5 million barrels last week, touching the lowest level since October 2015.Adding to the positive momentum, Energy bodies OPEC and IEA recently raised global oil demand forecasts for 2018, helping to tighten the market significantly. The booming crude oil and gas exports this year reflect the substantial demand for U.S. oil.All these factors point toward the growing stability and growth prospects for the energy sector in 2018.How to Identify the Potential Winners?Given the vast size of the sector, it is no mean feat to zoom in on the likely outperformers for the coming year. This is where the Zacks Rank, justifying a company’s strong fundamentals, can come in handy. In addition to a favorable Zacks Rank, the stocks have a sound VGM Score.

Notably, readings over 50% indicate more companies are expanding instead of shrinking.Robust Earnings Momentum   Second-quarter earnings results have been exhibiting strong momentum so far.

It is to be noted that the first quarter witnessed the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in seven years.

223,HFC,"Investing in energy is a complicated task as a majority of these stocks are influenced by the underlying commodity prices. The commodity prices are manipulated by several supply and demand factors. Global oil prices have been on an upward swing over the second half of this year after a few devastating years. The price range has been very varied ranging between a high of more than $64 per barrel earlier this month compared to a low of $30 early last year.Therefore, it is vital to choose the right stocks amid this ever-changing backdrop, considering capital spending, debt levels and production growth against free cash flow, costs and return of capital to stockholders through dividends and share buybacks.Volatility Rose for Oil in 2017The year 2017 has been full of ups and downs for the energy industry. Driven by improving fundamentals, oil priceis currently trading above $55 per barrel mark compared with 2014 levels of around $100.However, oil prices hit almost a two and a half year high in the trading session this week with U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled at $59.64.The partial recovery has been driven by improving fundamentals. Declining inventories and the extension of OPEC-led supply cuts are two major factors balancing the market and supporting the favorable uptrend.Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, global oil markets depicted less stability in 2016, while a slight supply deficit was witnessed in 2017. The data compilations show a shortfall of 180,000 barrels per day (bpd)in the first quarter of 2018.In an effort to limit prices by the OPEC and Russians, U.S. oil yield has improved by more than 16% since mid-2016 and is reaching 10 million bpd. Per the Chinese customs data, U.S. shipments to China have been the largest beneficiary from the OPEC-led output cuts. However, Russia was China's largest crude oil supplier for the nine consecutive monthstill November, beating Saudi Arabia also for the rest of the year.5 Stocks to Bet OnStrong fundamentals do not necessarily indicate that all energy companies are favorable picks. Moreover, with several companies crowding the investment space, it is not a simple task for investors to choose stocks that have the potential to deliver attractive returns.Though these attributes do not guarantee outperformance, the Zacks Rank, which validates the company’s strong fundamentals, is considered handy. In particular, we have shortlisted 5 energy companies having a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and companies having estimated EPS growth rate of 200% or more this year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.CVR Refining, LP (CVRR  -  Free Report), a #1 Ranked stock, is our first pick. Sugar Land, TX-based CVR Refining is an independent downstream energy partnership with refining and associated logistics properties in the Midcontinent United States.Shares of CVR Refining returned more than 56% year to date. The company’s increasing cash and declining debt shows the strength of its balance sheet. It continues to be a good investment option indicated by projected EPS growth (F1/F0) of 1,350.0%. Notably, the company’s EV/EBITDA ratio 7.1 shows that it is undervalued compared with the industry’s 12.7.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

227,HFC,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly draw to reach the lowest level since 2015. But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was partly offset by another build in gasoline supplies. On a further bearish note, domestic oil production maintained its steadily rising trend that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 0.9% (or 53 cents) to end at $58.09 per barrel yesterday. Energy Stocks JumpThe federal data sparked widespread buying in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – up more than 1.4% Wednesday. The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report). Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 6.5 million barrels for the week ending Dec 15, following a decrease of 5.1 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.2 million barrels. An uptick in refinery demand led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as U.S. output edged up 9,000 barrels per day last week to 9.8 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 29 of the last 37 weeks and are down nearly 97 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 436.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 10.1% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year. Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 754,000 barrels to 53 million barrels. The crude supply cover was down from 26.1 days in the previous week to 25.6 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.5 days. Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the sixth straight week on strong production. The 1.2 million barrels addition – more than the polled number of 1.1 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 227.8 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 0.4% below the year-earlier level but is close to the upper limit of the average range. Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) was up 769,000 barrels last week, greater than analysts’ expectations. The weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 128.8 million barrels, current supplies are 16.1% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year. Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.7% from the prior week to 94.1%. About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report The Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad. The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry. Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?
