0,BKNG,"Alcohol companies are focusing on spending millions of dollars to convince people that alcohol consumption could be a healthy habit, according to published investigations by Stat, The New York Times and Wired. In fact, per a 2015 Gallup poll, one out of five Americans consider that “moderate” alcohol consumption is actually a healthy practice. This belief clearly benefits the alcohol industry because moderation for drinkers varies significantly when it comes to alcohol.In this context, earnings of alcohol companies scheduled for release over the next week, assume greater significance. With both brewers, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report) and Ambev S.A. (ABEV  -  Free Report) scheduled to report earnings on May 9, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both AB InBev and Ambev S.A. carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings scheduled on the same day include Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG  -  Free Report) and Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceThe AB InBev stock has declined 19.9% in the last one year, while the Zacks categorized Alcoholic Beverages industry has gained 1.1%. However, Ambev has increased 7.1%, significantly better than competitor AB InBev and the industry.ValuationThe price-to-sales ratio is particularly relevant in a consumer-focused industry whose fortunes are dictated by the ebb and flow of sales. This ratio indicates the market value of each of the company’s sales dollars.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, both are undervalued compared to the wider industry, which has an exorbitant P/S ratio of 19.24. However, Ambev is the pricier of the two, since it has a P/S ratio of 5.59, higher than AB InBev’s reading of 2.74.Net MarginProfitability ratios acquire greater importance in an industry characterized by low margins. Net margin is a good metric to compare the profitability of companies within an industry, since they are bound by the same business constraints.With a net margin value of 14.11%, AB InBev is lower than the industry average of 21.6%. Meanwhile, Ambev, with net margin of 24.77%, is better placed on this count compared to its rival and industry.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. In the context of the beer industry, it is an indicator of the company’s long-term sustainability.Both AB InBev and Ambev have better leverage positions than the industry, which has a debt-to-equity ratio of 61.22%. Coming back to the individual companies, debt-to-equity ratio of AB InBev and Ambev is 1.45% and 10.36%, respectively. Clearly, with a low debt-to-equity ratio this round goes to AB InBev.Asset Turnover RatioSince the alcohol industry is essentially characterized by low margins and high volumes, activity ratios are extremely important when determining the health of a company. All activity ratios are geared toward gauging a company’s ability to convert various heads under its balance sheet into sales or cash. The asset turnover ratio examines the level of efficiency with which a company utilizes its assets to conduct sales.With an asset turnover ratio of 0.57, Ambev is comfortably placed with respect to the broader industry, whose value for this metric stands at 0.53. In this context, AB InBev has an asset turnover ratio of 0.45, which places it at a disadvantage to both the industry and Ambev.Quick Ratio Considered to be a conservative measure of liquidity, the quick ratio gauges as to how liquid the current position of a company is. In other words, it measures the extent to which liquid current assets can service current liabilities. The measure is conservative since it does not take into account current assets that are relatively less liquid such as inventory.With a quick ratio of 0.66, Ambev is better placed than the broader industry, whose value for this metric stands at 0.63. AB InBev is poorly placed on this count since its quick ratio stands at 0.54.Earnings History and ESPWhile considering Earnings ESP, there is nothing to choose from between the two stocks for the current quarter as both the alcohol giants having readings of 0. However, taking into account a more comprehensive earnings history, Ambev has delivered a negative surprise in only one of the four preceding quarters and has an average negative earnings surprise of 5%. Meanwhile, AB In Bev is at disadvantage, as it has not only delivered negative earnings surprises in three out of the four prior quarters, but also has an average negative earnings surprise of 12.3%.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that AB InBev holds an edge over Ambev when considering valuation ratio and leverage position. But on all other counts Ambev has a clear edge. Not only does it have a relatively better price performance and good earnings history, it is better placed when considering net margin, debt-to-equity, asset turnover and quick ratios. In this context, Ambev clearly holds an edge over AB InBev ahead of earnings.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2,BKNG,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 9.1% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is BKNG due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Booking Holdings Beats on Q4 Earnings & RevenuesBooking Holdings Inc. reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter of 2017.Non-GAAP net earnings of $16.86 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $2.74 and were better than the guided range of $13.4-$14.0 per share. Earnings increased 53% sequentially and 19% year over year.Revenues of $2.8 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $103 million. However, revenues were down 36.8% sequentially but up 19.4% from the prior-year quarter.On a year-over-year basis, both agency and merchant business showed strong momentum. Room nights, Rental cars and airline tickets, all performed impressively. On the call, management stated that the company will continue to focus on investments in people, systems and marketing with a long-term outlook.Overall, we remain positive about the secular growth trend in the online travel booking market, Booking Holdings’ strong position in international markets, growth opportunities in the domestic market, good execution, prudent marketing strategy and strong financial position.However, weaker average daily rates for accommodations (ADR), macro headwinds, increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax-related litigation remain overhangs. In a year’s time, the stock has surged 10.5%, significantly underperforming the industry’s gain of 66%.Let’s check out the numbers.Revenues in DetailsBooking Holdings generates the bulk of its revenues from international markets where the agency model is more popular. This is reflected in the merchant/agency split of revenues, which was 19/74% in the fourth quarter (previous quarter split was (16/77%).Merchant revenues were down 25.7% sequentially but up 15.6% year over year. Agency revenues decreased 41.2% sequentially but increased 19.4% from the year-ago quarter.Advertising & Other revenues were down 1.9% sequentially but up 29% from last year. These are basically non inter-company revenues from Kayak and OpenTable.On a year-over-year basis, room nights volumes increased 16.8%. Also, rental car days increased 5.4% and airline tickets were up 3.1%.Booking Holdings’ room night growth is attributable to geographically diverse inventory and brand recognition that tend to balance out macro uncertainties related to any one market, as well as growing competition from local and international players.BookingsBooking Holdings’ overall bookings were up 19% (14% in constant currency) year over year and above management’s guided range.Merchant bookings were up 39% from the prior-year quarter and agency bookings increased 15.7% from the year-ago levels.Margins and Net IncomeBooking Holdings reported pro forma gross margin of 98.8%, up 16 basis points (bps) sequentially and 189 bps year over year.Owing to the nature of its business and mix of agency versus merchant revenues, management usually uses gross profit dollars rather than margin to gauge performance during any quarter. Booking Holdings’ gross profit dollars were down 36.7% sequentially but up 21.7% (17% in constant currency) from last year. International gross profit grew 23% (17% on a constant currency basis).Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion, up 23% from the year-ago quarter.Booking Holdings’ operating income was up 24.8% year over year. Operating margin of 35.2% was up 150 bps from the year-ago quarter.Booking Holdings’ GAAP net loss was $5.6 billion or $11.41 a share against net income of $1.7 billion or $34.43 a share in the prior quarter and net income of $6.7 billion or $13.47 a share in the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetBooking Holdings ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $7.4 billion compared with $7.3 billion at the end of the third quarter.

3,BKNG,"The hotel industry continues to be one of the fastest growing industries. Even during the economic recession, it showed little sign of weakness. However, given the recent technological advancements, barriers to entry have decreased leading to an influx of new participants.In addition, unfavorable governmental policies, uncertainty in certain markets and RevPAR pressures pose challenges for industry players. The sum total of these headwinds will likely weigh on the industry’s growth trend this year.Below we discuss some of the headwinds that hotel stocks may face in the going forwardStringent Immigration and Tourism VisaPoliciesOn Dec 4, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed President Donald Trump’s travel ban barring inbound travelers from six Muslim-majority countries to go into full effect even in the face of legal challenges in lower courts.Continuous efforts to impose travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim nations, along with the ban on a broad range of electronic devices in the cabins of U.S.-bound aircraft from certain countries and talks of expanding the same to other regions threaten travel demand to and from the United States. The administration has also talked about building a wall along the southern border to stop Mexican immigrants from entering the country illegally.Trump’s stringent policies on immigration and tourist visas appear to have made international visitors rethink their vacation plans in the United States. Notably, there has been a continued slowdown in U.S.-bound air travel bookings ever since Trump took office. Also, online searches by prospective travelers to the United States have also been witnessing a sharp decline.In fact, per Tourism Economics, an industry research and forecasting firm, the drop in tourism is anticipated to result in 6.3 million lesser visitors in 2018. This adds up to a potential loss of $10.8 billion in revenues for the United States.Thus, as tourists plan to steer clear of America, the local travel industry is bearing the brunt of his unpopular policies.  With the United States losing some of its appeal as a destination, hotel businesses and the overall industry stare at billions in lost revenues.Increasing Supply and Lower Visitation Weigh on RevParMost of the hotel companies in the United States have been witnessing slowing revenue per available room (RevPAR) trends of late because of muted international visitation. Moreover, an increase in supply of hotels in the domestic market is limiting room rents, thereby hurting RevPAR.Operating margins for industry players are yet to reach the industry peak of 2007 in the United States, given the spike in costs. The companies are looking to differentiate themselves and keep pace with changing consumer taste through investments in technology, quick customer service and real-time marketing. These are denting margins even further.Additionally, most of these companies plan to gain competitive advantage and differentiate their brands through renovation. This will come at the cost of near-term margins.Meanwhile, as the economy improves and unemployment levels drop, the industry players will struggle to control their largest operating expense — labor costs. Rising salaries, wages and benefits, as well as increased staffing levels will add to their labor costs.Moreover, the companies are unable to increase room rates consistent with the rising cost of operations. This makes it all the more difficult to match up to growth rates achieved in the last four to five years.Additionally, online booking sites like The Priceline Group’s PCLN, TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) and Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) are limiting the pricing power of these hotels, thus remaining an overhang on margins. Higher commission rates charged on hotels are also hurting margins. With lower overhead costs and relatively less stringent regulations than hotel companies, home sharing companies like Airbnb, Inc. are competing head-to-head with traditional players in certain segments of the market and even seizing share from them.Uncertainty in Certain International Markets In spite of immense growth potential, industry players are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues like the social/political impact of Brexit and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia. Though Trump’s stringent policies might make travelers opt for Europe and Asia, instead of the United States, these regions have their own share of concerns.Notably, a sluggish economy and oversupply in Brazil are weighing on demand in the Latin American region and checked overall sales. In fact, a weak Latin American economy, aggravated by political turmoil led to softer tourism numbers in 2015, 2016 and 2017. This is not expected to change much in 2018. Continued uncertainty in Africa and macroeconomic factors in Venezuela are likely to limited revenues hotel industry players.In Europe, economic/political conditions are expected to be challenging after U.K.’s exit from the 28-member economic bloc. Business in Europe is clouded by economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone.Terror assaults in key European cities like London, Paris, Zurich and Brussels have also affected tourism. Challenging market dynamics in France is a potent headwind. Additionally, concerns of further terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting trade in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria.Meanwhile, in the Middle East, political unrest, lower government spending, new hotel supply and a tough oil market continue to hurt tourism and RevPAR trends. Any respite from these ills in the region is not expected in the near term.Most of the leading hotel companies have considerable presence in the abovementioned markets and are thus vulnerable to adverse economic conditions in these regions.Stocks to AvoidA player in the space that induces our cautious-to-bearish outlook is China Lodging Group, Ltd. (HTHT  -  Free Report). The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.To ConcludeContinuous efforts to impose inbound travel ban from certain countries and stringent policies on immigration and tourist visas are clouding the prospects of the U.S. hotel industry. Additionally, various geopolitical and economic woes, oversupply and higher costs are wreaking havoc on the hotel industry. Thus, softness in the lodging industry’s growth is expected to continue in the near term.A strengthening U.S. dollar may further add to the woes. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether improving economic indicators and initiatives undertaken by the industry players can offset these negatives.Let us see how these companies fare, brave the challenges and register profits in the coming days. In “U.S. Hotels Bank on Expansion, Unique Offerings for Growth,” we focus on the conditions that are expected to drive the industry forward.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

4,BKNG,"The year 2017 favored the U.S. hotel industry with moderate demand growth supporting increases in both occupancy and average daily rate (ADR).As a result, revenue per available room (RevPAR) witnessed a rise of 3% over 2016.This is further reflected in the industry’s stock-price performance. Over the past year, the Zacks Hotels and Motels Industry has fared better than the broader S&P 500 index. While the industry has gained 38.4%, the broader index has added only 16.7%.With fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth remaining decent at 2.6%, the economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.3%, better than the 1.5% growth rate recorded in 2016. We note that rising employment, higher real income, and increased household net worth reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment. This has resulted in a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, which are likely to continue.Going forward, consumer and business spending are expected to keep the mood upbeat, suggesting that the U.S. economy will remain on solid footing for 2018. In fact, the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model forecasts healthy 3.2% (annualized rate) GDP growth in first-quarter 2018.However, peaking supply continues to be a meaningful downside risk and is expected to put pressure on the pricing power, thereby tempering the performance somewhat.Number CrunchingStatistics underscore the expectation of moderating yet positiveperformance by the hotel industry. A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) shows that new supply is likely to rise 1.9% in 2018, flat with 2017. This is likely to result in a 0.1% decline in occupancy rates in 2018 to 65.5%.Though ADRand RevPAR are projected to climb 2.1% and 2%, respectively this year, the rate of increase will be less than the average growth recorded in the past few years.Meanwhile, the Baird/STR Hotel Stock Index, which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U.S. exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks, rose 3.3% in December 2017. In fact, year to date, the index is up 32%. Higher interest rates, tax reform and hurricane-related demand tailwinds aided the outperformance.Additionally, according to Smith Travel Research (STR), a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics, U.S. hotels continue to witness robust improvement across all metrics. While overall occupancy at U.S. hotels was up 1.4% year over year for the week ended Feb 3, 2018, ADR rose 2.2%. Resultantly, RevPAR grew 3.6% in the same time frame.Ongoing ObstaclesUncertainty, both international and domestic, may continue to weigh on the performance of the U.S. lodging industry.  Moreover, negative sentiment related to traveling to and from the United States given the Trump administration’s stringent policies on immigration and tourism visasis detrimental to hotels.While the anticipated weakening of U.S. dollar could boost inbound international travel, it would then have a negative impact on domestic consumer spending, forcing consumers to shift discretionary spending.Additionally, higher costs and increased supply along with pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown are likely to continue to pose  headwinds.Meanwhile, hoteliers have been focusing on renovation, and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers. However, to do so, steep costs incurred by leading hoteliers are taking a toll on profits. Moreover, high labor costs will continue to be a major concern for hoteliers, and as they won’t be able to boost ADRs as much as they would like, their profits may be dented further. In fact, online travel agents like The Priceline Group Inc. PCLN, Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) and TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) are also limiting the pricing power of these brands.Another major threat comes from home-sharing companies, like Airbnb, Inc., which offer digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations. With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with, these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) and Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report). Notably, both companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Potential Growth DriversThe hotel industry is particularly vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of economic conditions. So the present solid economic fundamentals that are likely to continue spurring consumer spending in 2018, raises optimism for hoteliers. Moreover, hoteliers will be able to counter any economic volatility better, if they keep moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services.Also, hoteliers must look for ways to sustain their growth as online private accommodation aggregators flood the marketplace with new inventory. In fact, Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. was being viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home-sharing companies. Other hoteliers like Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corp. WYN are also investing in home-sharing start-ups to combat Airbnb.In 2017, the hotel industry proved to be resilient to the marketplace shift. Going forward, too, the industry is expected to witness continued success.Thus, as hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness, industry-best practices such as sustainability, brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking, especially among millennials, will remain the priorities. Acute, focused investment in infrastructure to attract more business and leisure travelers will also hold the key to growth.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, hotel companies are broadly grouped under the Consumer Discretionary sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).We rank 265 industries into 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our X industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).In fact, ourback-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much. The Zacks Industry Rank for Hotels & Motels industryis currently #86 (top 32%).The ranking is available on the Zacks Industry Rank page.Earnings TrendsSo far, the fourth-quarter 2017 financial performance for hoteliers has been encouraging. While Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues, Wyndham beat the consensus mark for earnings but missed on revenues marginally.The Hotels & Motels industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector. If we look at the overall results of the sector, earnings grew 0.9% in the September quarter while total revenues rose 3.5%.  Meanwhile, for the December quarter, though revenues are expected to rise 4.2%, earnings are projected to record a decline of 0.5%. For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our Earnings Preview.ConclusionThe U.S. hotel industry has been benefiting from several factors like a strong economy, higher income, increased consumer confidence and a strong labor market. As people are steadfast on spending time with loved ones and keep looking for unique experiences at all price points, companies in the space believe that their diverse portfolio of offerings can continue to deliver on this growing demand.Consumer spending is expected to rise through 2018 backed by a favorable economic scenario. This raises optimism for companies in the leisure and recreation space. GDP grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017, following gains of more than 3% in the previous two quarters, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.This marked the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009. Improving economic indicators bode well for the industry as these lead to an increase in leisure and business travel demand.Meanwhile, consumer spending, the main engine of the economy, grew 3.8% in the fourth quarter after a 2.2% gain in the third. Again, there was a marked improvement in the Consumer Confidence Index in January, after a setback in December. Consumer Confidence rose 2.3 points to 125.4 in January. The momentum is expected to continue through 2018.Thus, we see no reason why the industry should not continue to enjoy gains on both the top and the bottom lines in the near-to-middle term, especially when the unemployment rate is at a 17-year low and wages are growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

5,BKNG,"The moderating but positive outlook on lodging demand growth raises hope. Then again, the so-called “Trump Slump” in travel -- the anticipated decline in foreign travelers to the United States due to Trump administration policies regarding immigration -- is a threat to the U.S. economy or the hotel industry.Additionally, increased supply coupled with macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies could keep hoteliers’ growth in check. This makes it important to take a closer look at some of the dampeners before investing in the hotel industry.Below we discuss some of the headwinds that hotel stocks may face in the near and the long term:Trump’s Policies Hover Over Hoteliers: President Trump’s efforts to impose a travel ban on inbound travelers from some predominantly Muslim countries along with the ban on a broad range of electronic devices in the cabins of U.S.-bound aircraft from certain countries has affected travel demand to and from the United States.Though the bans have been temporary, his stringent policies on immigration and tourist visas to deter foreigners from entering the United States appear to have made international visitors rethink their vacation in the country, thereby castinga pall on future travel demand. The President has also talked about building a wall along the U.S. southern border to curb Mexican immigrants entering the country illegally.Notably, since Trump took office, though there have been clear signs and data suggesting that though more people are traveling than ever before,the number of people willing to travel to the United Stateshas reduced dramatically thanks to his plans. In fact, there’s been continued slowdown in U.S.-bound air travel bookings ever since. Also, online searches by prospective travelers to the United States have also been witnessing a sharp decline.America is thus bucking the trend and not in a good way. Per new insights from the U.S. Travel Association, visitor numbers contracted in four out of the seven months for which data is available this year, materializing fears that Trump’s policies are putting tourists off visiting the United States. Notably, the declines were the steepest in February and March, immediately after the so-called “Muslim ban” came into force.In fact, as per Tourism Economics’ earlier estimations, the drop-off in tourism is anticipated to result in 4.3 million fewer visitors this year. This adds up to a staggering loss of $7.4 billion in revenues for the United States. Meanwhile, another 6.3 million visitors and the $10.8 billion that they would have spent is likely to be lost in 2018 due to these policies.Thus, as tourists plan to steer clear of Trump’s America, this is sure to be detrimental to the hotel businesses and the overall Leisure & Hospitality industry.Lingering Uncertainty in Certain International Markets: Despite immense growth potential, hoteliers are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues like the social/political impact of ‘’Brexit’’ and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia. Though Trump’s stringent policies might make travelers opt for Europe and Asia, instead of the United States, various concerns in these regions raise eyebrows.Notably, a sluggish economy and oversupply in Brazil are weighing on demand in the Latin American region and has checked overall sales. In fact, a weak Latin American economy, aggravated by political turmoil led to softer tourism numbers in 2015 and 2016. This has continued so far in 2017 and is not expected to change much for the rest of the year. Continued uncertainty in Africa and macroeconomic factors in Venezuela are likely to restrict hoteliers’ revenues.In Europe, economic/political conditions are expected to be challenging after U.K.’s exit from the 28-member economic bloc. Business in Europe is as it is clouded by economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone.Terror attacks in key European cities like London, Paris, Zurich and Brussels have also affected tourism. Challenging market dynamics in France is a potent headwind. Additionally, concerns of further terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting trade in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria.If these aren’t enough, a cooling economy in China — which might continue to hurt discretionary spending and travel — and concerns over Japan owing to a weaker yen and tax increases are adding to hoteliers’ woes.Meanwhile, in the Middle East, political unrest, lower government spending, new hotel supply and a tough oil market continue to hurt tourism and RevPAR trends. Any respite from these ills in the region is not expected in the near term.Most of the leading hoteliers’ have considerable presence in the above-mentioned markets and are thus vulnerable to the economic conditions in these regions as it might limit their business growth.Fluctuation in Exchange Rates: Most of the major hoteliers like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corp. WYN generate a substantial portion of their revenues from customers outside the country and are therefore highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. Thus, continued volatility in exchange rates would continue to hurt their results as it has been doing so over the past few quarters.Meanwhile, if the U.S. dollar strengthens against various other currencies, negative currency translation is going to be a major concern for these companies. Also, a strong dollar means that travel to the United Statesis becoming more expensive for visitors from other countries and they might look for alternative destinations. This, in turn, will likely thwart travel demand and length of stays. Both these factors would possibly be detrimental to the hotel industry.Slowing RevPar Trends & Operating Margins Under Pressure: Most of the hoteliers in the United States have been witnessing slowing revenue per available room (RevPAR) trends of late because of continued muted international visitation. Moreover, continued increase in supply of hotels in the domestic market is limiting room rents, thereby hurting RevPAR.Moreover, the majority of leading hoteliers expect soft demand in the oil producing regions, mainly parts of Texas, Houston, Louisiana, Houston, Oklahoma City and West Virginia, to continue taking a toll on RevPAR.Operating margins for hoteliers are yet to reach the industry peak of 2007 in the United States given the spike in costs. Hoteliers are looking to differentiate themselves and keep pace with changing consumer tastes through investments in technology, quick customer service and real-time marketing. These are denting margins even further. Additionally, most hoteliers plan to gain competitive advantage and differentiate their brands through renovation. This will, however, come at the cost of near-term margins.Meanwhile, as the economy improves and unemployment levels drop, hotel managers are expected to continue struggling to control their largest operating expense — labor costs. Rising salaries, wages and benefits, as well as increased staffing levels have been adding to hoteliers’ labor costs.Moreover, hoteliers are unable to match the rising cost of operations with the increase in room rates. This is lowering their ability to achieve levels of profit growth observed in the last four to five years.Additionally, online booking sites like Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) and The Priceline Group’s PCLN Booking.com are limiting the pricing power of these hotels, which contracts their margins. Higher commission rates charged on hotels are also hurting margins. Meanwhile, with lower overhead costs and less strict regulations than hotel companies, home sharing companies like Airbnb, Inc. are competing head-to-head with traditional players in certain segments of the market, and even seizing share from them.Stocks to AvoidA couple of players in the space that induce our cautious-to-bearish outlook are Wyndham and Red Lion Hotels Corp. (RLH  -  Free Report). Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.To ConcludeNegative sentiments related to traveling to and from the United States areacting as the major spoiler for the U.S. hotel industry. Additionally, various geopolitical and economic woes, oversupply and higher costs are wreaking havoc on the hotel industry. Thus, softness in the lodging industry’s growth is expected to continue in the near term.A strengthening U.S. dollar may further add to these woes. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether improving economic indicators and initiatives undertaken by hoteliers can offset these negatives.Let's see how these companies fare, brave the challenges and register profits in the coming days. In “U.S. Hotels Bank on Expansion, Unique Offerings for Growth” we focused on the conditions that are expected to drive the industry forward.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

6,BKNG,"So far, 2017 has been welcoming for the U.S. hotel industry with moderate demand growth supporting increases in both occupancy and average daily rate (ADR). Resultantly, revenue per available room (RevPAR) witnessed a rise of 3.4% and 2.7%, respectively, in the first two quarters.This is further reflected in the industry’s stock-price performance. Over the past year, the Zacks Hotels and Motels Industry has fared better than the broader S&P 500 index. While the industry has gained 36.1%, the broader index has added only 21%.Though first-quarter GDP growth remained moderate at 1.2%, the economy picked up pace in the second quarter, expanding at an annual rate of 3.1%, better than initially estimated. We note that rising employment, higher real income, and increased household net worth reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment. This has resulted in a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, which are likely to continue.Going forward, consumer and business spending are expected to keep the mood upbeat, suggesting that the U.S. economy will remain on solid footing for the balance of 2017. In fact, the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model forecasts gross domestic product (GDP) to grow a healthy 2.7% (annualized rate) in third-quarter 2017.However, peaking supply growth continues to be a meaningful downside risk and is expected to put pressure on pricing power, thereby tempering the performance somewhat.What Do the Numbers Say?Statistics underscore the expectation of moderating but positiveperformance by the hotel industry. A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) shows that new supply is likely to rise 1.9% in 2017, slightly below the anticipated demand growth of 2.1%. This is likely to result in a 0.2% rise in occupancy rates in 2017 to 65.6%.Though ADRand RevPAR are projected to climb 2.1% and 2.3%, respectively, in 2017, the rate of increase will be less than the average growth recorded in the past few years.Meanwhile, the Baird/STR Hotel Stock Index, which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U.S. exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks, rose 5.3% in September 2017. In fact, year to date, the index is up 16.6%. Higher interest rates, enhanced prospects for potential tax reform, and anticipated hurricane-related demand tailwinds aided the outperformance.Additionally, according to Smith Travel Research (STR), a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics, U.S. hotels continue to witness robust improvement across all metrics. While overall occupancy at U.S. hotels was up 2.4% year over year for the week ended Oct 14, 2017, ADR rose 5.3%. Resultantly, RevPAR grew 7.8% in the same time frame.Obstacles Facing HoteliersUncertainty, both international and domestic, may continue to weigh on the performance of the U.S. lodging industry.On the one hand, negative sentiment related to traveling to and from the United States given the Trump administration’s stringent policies on immigration and tourism visasis bad for hotels. On the other hand, if the U.S. dollar gains strength, this may keep the industry’s growth at check, given its impact on inbound, international travel.Additionally, higher costs and increased supply along with pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown are likely to continue to pose as headwinds.Meanwhile, hoteliers have been focusing on renovation and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers. However, to do so, steep costs incurred by leading hoteliers are taking a toll on profits. Moreover, high labor costs will continue to be a major concern for hoteliers, and as they won’t be able to boost ADRs as much as they would like, their profits may be dented further. In fact, online travel agents like Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report), TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) and The Priceline Group Inc. PCLN are also limiting the pricing power of these brands.Another major threat comes from home-sharing companies, like Airbnb, Inc., which offer digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations. With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with, these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report). Notably, both the companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.What Can Drive Growth?The hotel industry is particularly vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of economic conditions. So the present solid economic fundamentals that is likely to continue to spur consumer spending in the remaining of 2017, raises optimism for hoteliers. Moreover, hoteliers will be able to counter any economic volatility better, if they keep moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services.Meanwhile, keeping aside the necessary hotel renovation and reconstruction which could be costly and time-consuming, other post-hurricane dynamics could work to the advantage of the lodging industry.Also, hoteliers must look for ways to sustain their growth as online private accommodation aggregators flood the marketplace with new inventory. In fact, Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. was being viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home-sharing companies. Other hoteliers like Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corp. WYN are also investing in home-sharing start-ups to combat Airbnb.So far in 2017, the hotel industry has proved to be resilient during this marketplace shift. Going forward, the industry is estimated to witness continued success.Thus, as hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness, industry-best practices such as sustainability, brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking – especially among millennials – will remain the priorities. Acute, focused investment in infrastructure to attract more business and leisure travelers will also hold the key to growth.Why Hotel Stocks Still Have Some Upside LeftAs the industry has underperformed the broader market over the last five years, it seems there is a value-oriented path ahead. Looking at the industry’s EV/EBITDA ratio (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization), which is the best multiple for valuing hotels as they are highly capital intensive, investors might still want to pay more.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 11.7, which compares favorably with what it saw in the last five years. The ratio is lower than the average of 12.7x and the high of 17.8x over the last five years.Moreover, it compares somewhat favorably with the market at large, as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is 11.6x.Overall, the valuation of the industry from an EV/EBITDA perspective looks attractive when compared with its own range in the same time period. Moreover, its somewhat lower-than-market positioning calls for some more upside in the quarters ahead.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, hotel companies are broadly grouped in the Consumer Discretionary sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).We rank 265 industries into 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our X industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).In fact, ourback-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much. The Zacks Industry Rank for Hotels & Motels industryis currently at #86 (Top 32%).The ranking is available on the Zacks Industry Rank page.Earnings TrendsSo far, in third-quarter 2017, the performance of the hotel stocks have been a mixed bag. While Hilton surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues, Wyndham beat the consensus mark for earnings but missed on revenues.The Hotels & Motels industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.If we look at the overall results of the sector, earnings grew 4.7% in the June quarter while total revenues rose 8.8%.Meanwhile, for the September quarter, though revenues are expected to rise 2.8%, earnings are projected to record a decline of 1.1%.For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our ‘Earnings Preview’ report.ConclusionLooking at the recent economic indicators and the industry’s cheap valuation, growth prospects of the U.S. hotel industry appear bright.Though industry-wide headwinds continue to weigh on investor sentiment, hotel companies have good reasons to remain optimistic. Particularly, those willing to venture out of their comfort zones and be responsive to changing consumer expectations to provide a more holistic offering, are sure to emerge winners.Overall, despite the ongoing economic and political uncertainty, economic fundamentals appear strong enough to support more modest growth in the short-to medium-term without any additional stimulus.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

Total earnings for these small-cap companies are down -14.1% from the same period last year on +6% higher revenues, with 61.1% beating EPS estimates and 62.2% beating revenue estimates.•    This is a weak earnings performance from these small-cap companies relative to other recent periods. The earnings growth pace as well as the proportion of positive EPS surprises for Q2 is tracking below other recent quarters.•    2017 Q2 is on track to be the third quarter in the last four quarters of negative earnings growth for the small-cap index. Earnings growth is in negative territory for half of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines in the Energy (-163.2%), Medical (-93.5%), Retail (-20.2%), Consumer Discretionary (-12.9%) and Finance (-9.8%) sectors.•    The primary driver for the earnings weakness appears to be margin pressures for the small-cap space, with Q2 net margins below the year-earlier level for 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors.  •    On the positive side, we had double-digit Q2 earnings growth from Aerospace (+71.9%), Conglomerates (+73.3%), Construction (+19.2%), Autos (+17%) and Technology (+17.7%) sectors.   •    For the S&P 500 index, the Q2 earnings season has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from only 21 S&P 500 index members still awaited at this stage. Total earnings for the 479 index members that have reported are up +11.2% from the same period last year on +5.6% higher revenues, with 74.5% beating EPS estimates and 68.3% beating revenue estimates.•    While growth is a bit on the lighter side relative to the preceding period for these 479 S&P 500 members, the proportion of companies beating estimates, particularly revenue estimates, is notably tracking above other periods.•    For Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +10.9% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues. This would be the second quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth performance for the S&P 500 index.•    Beyond Q2, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to grow by +4% on +4.8% higher revenues in the September quarter and +8.8% on +5.6% higher revenues in Q4.  •    Estimates for Q3 have come down, but they appear to be following the moderate revisions pace we saw ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season. Estimates have fallen for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors in the S&P 500 index, with the Technology and Industrial Products sectors experiencing positive revisions.  •    For full-year 2017, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +7.5% on +4.2% higher revenues, which would follow +0.8% earnings growth on +2.1% higher revenues in 2016. Index earnings are expected to be up +11% in 2018 and +8.9% in 2019.The Small-Cap Scorecard (as of August 23rd, 2017)With results from 460 S&P 600 members or 76.5% of the index’s membership already out, total earnings for the small-cap index are down -14.1% from the same period last year on +6% higher revenues, with 61.1% beating EPS estimates and 62.2% beating revenue estimates.Any way you look at it, this is a weak performance from these 460 S&P 600 members relative to what we have seen from the same group of small-cap companies in other recent periods, as the comparison charts below show.Not only is earnings growth below other recent periods, but the proportion of companies beating EPS estimates is also tracking below historical periods. The weakness is broad based and not concentrated in one or two sectors, reflecting all-around margin pressures.Earnings growth has been in negative territory for the small-cap index for the third time in the last four quarters, but the growth picture is expected to improve in the current and following quarters, as the chart below reflects.S&P 500 Scorecard (as of August 23rd, 2017)We now have Q2 results from 479 S&P 500 members or 95.8% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these 479 index members are up +11.2% from the same period last year on +5.6% higher revenues, with 74.5% beating EPS estimates and 68.3% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below compare the results thus far with what we have seen from the same group of 479 index members in other recent periods.As you can see, the earnings and revenue growth pace is tracking modestly below what we saw from the same group of companies in the preceding period. But the growth pace is nevertheless a notable improvement over the four and 12-quarter averages. The proportion of positive surprises, particularly revenue surprise is notably tracking above historical periods.The Technology MomentumWhile the aggregate Q2 growth pace for the S&P 500 index is tracking below the preceding-quarter’s level, that isn’t the case with the Technology sector where both growth as well as the proportion of positive surprises are tracking above other periods. Total earnings for the 91.8% of the sector companies that have reported results are up +17.3% from the same period last year +9% higher revenues, with 82.1% beating EPS estimates and 85.7% beating revenue estimates.This is an improvement over what we have seen form the same group of Tech companies in other recent periods, including the preceding quarter when the sector’s results were very strong.Record Q2 Earnings & Expectations BeyondLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 479 index members with estimates for the still-to-come 21 companies, total earnings are expected to be up +10.9 on +5.4% higher revenues. This would follow +13.5% earnings growth on +7.5% higher revenue growth in 2017 Q1.Estimates for the current period (2017 Q3) have come down, with the current +4% earnings growth down from +6.3% at the start of the period, as the chart below shows.This is about in-line with the revisions trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season and a notable improvement over the trend we have been seeing over the last few years. Estimates have fallen for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with Energy, Basic Materials and Autos experiencing the most negative revisions. Estimates have gone up for the Technology and Industrial Products sectors, which can be seen in the revisions trend for operators like Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and others.While the earnings growth pace is decelerating from the prior-quarter’s level, the overall dollar tally of Q2 earnings is on track to reach a new all-time record for the S&P 500 index, surpassing the previous record achieved in 2016 Q4. The chart below shows the quarterly earnings totals for index, contrasting the highlighted Q2 tally with actual results from the last 4 quarters and expected tallies in the coming 4 quarters.As you can see, this record isn’t expected to last very long, with growth expected to ramp up notably in the coming quarters.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

11,BKNG,"The favorable Jobless Claims reading this morning is welcome, particularly given last week’s April non-farm payroll miss. The labor market is at the core of the economic recovery story, and the weak run of recent jobs reports has been raising questions about that narrative.
"
12,BKNG,"But this positive news is unlikely to cause a shift in the market’s focus from the continuing Greek saga. Even the soft outlook from Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report), a bellwether for global tech spending trends, and lower than expected Chinese trade growth numbers had European angles, highlighting that the region’s problems are more than just a headline risk for the broader global economy.
"
13,BKNG,"Last week’s soft jobs report for April, which came after a similarly disappointing reading the month before, appeared to confirm the fears of many that the labor market might be losing momentum. Today’s Jobless Claims data is reassuring in the sense that it runs counter to that trend. Initial Jobless Claims dropped 1K last week to 367K. The prior-week’s tally was revised higher by 3K from the originally reported 365K.
"
14,BKNG,"So, in a way, one could say that saw a 2K rise from last week’s level, while the expectation was for a roughly 5K increase. The four-week average, which helps smooth out the inherent week-to-week jumpiness of this number, dropped by 5.2K to 379K.
"
15,BKNG,"This is a reassuring read on the labor market as it helps confirm the much sharper fall last week and helps reverse the negative trend of the preceding weeks. If this trend remains in place over the next few weeks and the weekly claims tally drops back to the 360K level, then it will confirm that the seasonal distortions explanation for the recent weakness in the labor market. We are certainly not there yet, but this is a net-net good report.
"
16,BKNG,"Cisco’s weak guidance for the current quarter and its lack of visibility about the second half of the year is disconcerting given the company’s status as a proxy for global tech spending trends. Since the bulk of Cisco’s revenue each quarter comes from new sales, its outlook has long been viewed in the market as providing insights into corporate IT spending trends.
"
17,BKNG,"Europe was cited as key factor in the company’s soft outlook, which figures in the weak guidance from Priceline (PCLN). Priceline also reported strong earnings after the close on Wednesday, but its current quarter guidance fell short of expectations.RELATED ARTICLESPositive Jobless Claims ReportIs Rising Consumer Credit A Good Sign?1Q Better Than 4Q

90,BKNG,"This morning’s soft Durable Goods data will likely give investors no encouragement to cross the major psychological barrier that they have been struggling with in recent days. We also see data about home prices and consumer confidence on tap for release a little later, but the overall trading action today will likely be not much different from the tentativeness that we have been seeing lately.
"
91,BKNG,"With respect to Europe, all eyes are on the European Central Bank’s (ECB) second bank liquidity operation, scheduled for tomorrow. The German parliament passed the Greek bailout on Monday and we have a fairly successful government bond auction from Italy this morning, rounding out a fairly benign Euro-zone backdrop for today’s market action.
"
92,BKNG,"In today’s major domestic economic releases, the January Durable Goods Orders report came in significantly weaker than expected, though the prior month’s numbers were modestly revised higher. ‘Headline’ Durable Goods Orders dropped a greater-than-expected 4% in January, compared to the strong gains in the December reading when orders increased 3.2%.
"
93,BKNG,"The non-defense capital goods orders, which strips out defense and aircraft orders given their inherent ‘lumpiness’ on a month-to-month basis, was down 3.4% in January, after December’s 3.8% gain. The non-defense capital goods series is an excellent proxy for capital expenditure trends in the economy, but I wouldn’t read too much into this month’s ‘softish’ reading, due to seasonal factors. This series has a well documented tendency to drop or behave unusually in the first month of the quarter.
"
94,BKNG,"On the European front, the market is bracing for Wednesday’s second round of cheap long-term funding program by the ECB. The central bank’s first long-term refinancing operation (LTRO) for €489 billion back in December was instrumental in turning around the sentiment on the Euro-zone situation. Many in the market dubbed the LTRO program as a back-door quantitative easing program along the lines of the Fed’s bond purchase program.
"
95,BKNG,"There has been a consistent easing of pressure in the government bond markets of Italy and Spain ever since the December operation. The expectation is that Wednesday’s second round of LTRO, expected to be roughly of the same size as the first round, will further consolidate those gains.
"
96,BKNG,"On the earnings front, we have better-than-expected results from AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report) and Hovnanian Enterprises  this morning. Priceline.com (PCLN) came out with better-than-expected results after the close on Monday and guided higher for the first quarter.RELATED ARTICLESOil Prices and Oil Company ProfitsEarnings Season Almost DoneG-20 and What Else to Expect This Week
"
97,BKNG,"With the third quarter reporting season largely over and nothing major  on the domestic economic calendar, stock market movements today will  effectively reflect developments on the European front. The focus  remains on Italy, where a routine budget vote in parliament has the  potential to morph into a confidence vote on the government of prime  minister Silvio Berlusconi. The market is rooting for Mr. Berlusconi's  departure, but he appears in no mood to quit on his own.
"
98,BKNG,"By its sheer size, Italy is a big deal. Ever since the start of the  Euro-zone debt crisis, the market has been apprehensive of contagion  spreading from the peripheral and much smaller economies of Greece,  Ireland, and Portugal to the Euro-zone core of Italy and Spain. Those  fears are threatening to come to fruition now as the market loses  confidence in the Italian government's ability to manage the country's  finances. This lack of confidence is showing up in yields on Italian  government bonds, which have moved to a Euro-era high of above 6.5% and  are inching towards the critical 7% level -- beyond which lies bailout  territory.
"
99,BKNG,"A simple answer to rising Italian bond yields would have been for the  European Central Bank (ECB) to come up with its version of the U.S.  Fed's quantitative easing program, where the central bank purchases a  boatload of treasury bonds to keep yields (or interest rates) in check.  The ECB has been making some purchases, but the recent uptrend in  Italian bond yields shows that its effort is far from effective. German  reluctance to go this route has been a major hurdle.
"
100,BKNG,"The Euro-zone had provided for increasing the firepower of the rescue  fund (the EFSF), but many critical details of that plan still need to be  worked out. The initial hope of attracting contribution from China and  other cash-rich emerging economies to that end has also not panned out. 
"
101,BKNG,"The  bottom line is that the Euro-zone debt story refuses to go away. Last  week it was about Greece and now it is about Italy. The departure of the  Berlusconi government will likely improve market confidence and bring  down bond yields. But if the incoming government -- assuming there is a  change of political control -- fails to come up with a viable long-term  plan, then the respite will likely prove short-lived.
"
102,BKNG,"On the earnings front, we have results from Toyota Motors  (TM  -  Free Report), whose operations  have been hit hard by natural disasters -- first by the Japanese Tsunami  and now by floods in Thailand. The auto giant's global vehicle sales  for the six month period ending September 30th were down more than 18%  from the year-earlier level. 
"
103,BKNG,"In other earnings reports, Priceline (PCLN) came out with solid EPS and revenue beats after the close on Monday. WMS Industries (WMS), the maker of slot machines, came short of expectations. RELATED ARTICLESFocus Shifts to ItalyThe Earnings PictureMarket Waiting to Go Higher
"
104,BKNG,"With the economic calendar today and the rest of this week on the relatively thin side, the market will likely reflect developments in Europe. The Greek situation appears to have stabilized following the end of the referendum affair and the weekend decision by the prime minister, George Papandreau, to step down in favor of a unity government. Such a unity government is expected to rubber-stamp the latest bailout deal and get on with the politically unpopular act of implementing it.
"
105,BKNG,"Attention has now shifted to Italy, where the situation is no less dire. The market appears to be fast losing confidence in the Italian government's ability to take the structural steps needed to fix the country's economic outlook. These concerns have started showing up in heavy selling pressure on short-term government bonds, where yields have risen to Euro-era highs. Yields on longer-dated government bonds are also flirting with levels beyond which Ireland, Greece and Portugal had to ask for bailouts.
"
106,BKNG,"Italy is not in bailout territory yet, but the situation is not that good either. The only silver lining in the Italian situation is that it may force Silvio Berlusconi to let go of his hold on power. The prime minister is reportedly contemplating plans to step down. The Italians are not exactly famous for coming up with stable unity governments. But even then it is hard to find anything negative in Berlusconi's departure.
"
107,BKNG,"With respect to the domestic economic scene, we have few reports on the docket this week following last week's busy schedule. The broad take-away from the recent run of U.S. economic readings, including Friday's October jobs report, has been positive. In an absolute sense, the economy remains weak and soft. But relative to fears of another recessionary downturn, the data is pointing elsewhere.
"
108,BKNG,"The third quarter reporting season has turned out to be reassuringly strong relative to pre-season fears. Estimates for 2012 have been coming down. But even there, the revisions have been very orderly and not worrying. If anything, the negative revisions for 2012 have likely bottomed already.??
"
109,BKNG,"The bulk of the major earnings reports have come out, but some important ones still remains. After the close today, we have Priceline (PCLN) reporting results. In other corporate news, American Dental Partners (ADPI), a $160 million market-cap provider of services to dentists, was acquired by a private-equity firm. General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) is acquiring Force Protection (FRPT), a $300 million market-cap maker of blast-protected vehicles.

111,BKNG,"How many times have you missed the surge in a hot growth or momentum stock like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), or priceline.com (PCLN)? Remember saying to yourself, ""If I just had a system to scan and screen for these plays before they double and triple!""
"
112,BKNG,"Or, maybe you prefer a combination of value and cyclical growth but somehow missed the nice moves in Veeco (VECO  -  Free Report), SanDisk (SNDK), or Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) as they drifted in apparent neglect, under the radar, before they exploded for 25%+ gains once investors rediscovered their earnings stories.

"
114,BKNG,"And if it's all about the charts, there are dozens of indicators and software packages that all seem to have a couple of things in common -- either they try to predict future price based on subjective patterns, or they are trend followers that only get you in after a significant move.

"
118,BKNG,"What Happens If You Don't Have a Trading System
"
119,BKNG,"There are many ways to carve profits from markets. But all successful investors and traders use a coherent and consistent system. 
"
120,BKNG,"Such a system will contain a set of methods with clearly defined buy and sell rules that allow them to find winners, ride out rough patches, and come out ahead over the long run.
"
121,BKNG,"Lets explore the overwhelming evidence that proves investing and trading without a system is a loser's game.
"
122,BKNG,"The Proof from Trading ""Statistics""
"
123,BKNG,"The failure rate of entrepreneurs in any business is surely north of 80% -- and its even worse for one of the toughest occupations on the planet, day trading. Retail brokerage accounts for equities, options, futures, and currencies are opened with an average of $15,000 and drained to zero at an alarming rate within a few months as amateurs try and play a professionals game. 
"
124,BKNG,"And the ""pros"" here -- the ones who do survive over time -- are not simply those with Wall Street connections, money, and access to the best information and the fastest computers.
"
125,BKNG,"Successful professional traders will tell you that they can duplicate the returns of the big hedge funds from their home office, and with no ""connections,"" if they work hard and follow simple plans with clear rules and ruthless consistency.
"
126,BKNG,"Trading is difficult because it pits our emotional, reactive brains against rapid price movements and immediate threats of financial loss as players swing markets back and forth.
"
127,BKNG,"The emotional swings are exacerbated the greater the leverage involved, both for the individual speculator and the market as a whole. As they say in the Chicago trading pits, the secret to making a small fortune in commodities is to start with a large one.
"
128,BKNG,"Failure among the pros is even high. Many have gone for decades carving profits from a single type of ""edge,"" only to watch their fortunes vanish as they are blindsided by changing market conditions.
"
129,BKNG,"It takes some simple, yet uncommon, skills to succeed in both short-term trading and long-term investing. A disciplined and adaptable mind set and the ability to make and follow detailed plans are tantamount.

131,BKNG,"The head of one New York proprietary trading firm, who has actually turned away former investment bank traders from his shop, says that 95% of the traders who apply to trade for him, or even to enter his training program, never make it past the second interview.
"
132,BKNG,"He has high standards because he knows how hard it is to succeed and how rare the qualities are of the person who can be systematic and disciplined in their approach.
"
133,BKNG,"Everyone marvels over the master of so-called ""Market Wizards"" and wants to be just like them. And we think there's something wrong with us if we are not.
"
134,BKNG,"But the truth is that few successful traders are born. And the greats who achieved massive wealth may be statistical outliers. The reality is that, for most, trading is very hard work. A difficult, unnatural skill-set must be internalized with repetition, dedication, and discipline.
"
135,BKNG,"The only alternative to pouring over charts, research, and news all day is to have a proven system that gives you clearly defined buy/sell and risk management rules. Still, to follow this system requires dedication and discipline. Let's move on and see how the professional risk-taking houses do it.
"
136,BKNG,"The Proof from Hedge Funds
"
137,BKNG,"If you read all the Market Wizard books by Jack Schwager (there are 3 in total, full of interviews with self-made millionaire and billionaire traders), you will soon start to see a picture of the qualities and practices that lead to their extraordinary success.
"
138,BKNG,"There are components of proper psychology and discipline, exacting risk management and use of probability-weighted position-sizing and portfolio monitoring, and systematic market analysis and execution.
"
139,BKNG,"All these concepts and habits, honed to precision weapons through much trial-and-error testing, combine to create trading machinery that consistently produces outsized wealth-building returns for many years, if not decades.
"
140,BKNG,"In the early days, as these Wizards developed their craft, there wasn't much computer programming, back-testing, or automation involved. But as these practical tools evolved, ever-complex global markets were harnessed and continued to hand them profits as the ""quants"" and ""algos"" took over.
"
141,BKNG,"Now, every day, hundreds of hedge funds and new ""wizards"" are pulling outsized returns from the market through systematic execution of precision trading plans fed by deep data-mining of markets and methods.
"
142,BKNG,"They leave nothing to chance because they understand chance and how to use it systematically to build an edge, making sure that their super-fast computers are always buying or selling at predetermined entry and exit points. And they craft new edges as needed to exploit changes and shifts in market behavior.
"
143,BKNG,"The point of this description of hedge funds and other proprietary trading firm wizards is to emphasize where their success comes from. It's not simply the computers and algos coded by quants. Those are only the tools and architects of the money-making machines. It's the instructions and their systematic consistency that counts.
"
144,BKNG,"Rules-based trading where the rules are solid, and they are followed ruthlessly, is an unbeatable formula for market mastery. Many of the masters learned long ago that they could not rely solely on their intuition about a chart or a stock -- and they learned the hard way that they had to remove their emotions from the decision-making apparatus.
"
145,BKNG,"To make annual returns of 25% and more as many do requires strict allegiance to systematic trading. They define an edge and a set of methods for particular markets and they set out to exploit it every chance the market gives them with unfailing dedication. This is how the top incomes are made in the trading world on prop trading desks and it will always be thus.
"
146,BKNG,"Still Want to Learn the Rules of Success?
"
147,BKNG,"If I haven't discouraged you from pursuing an active trading career, give me some more time. I'm kidding, of course, but I do have two more areas of ""proof"" I want to share with you about why you need a trading system.
"
148,BKNG,"One is from science, where we look at human risk-taking behavior and decision-making under uncertainty and stress. And the other is straight from the dens of professional gambling. Casinos know a lot about systematic risk-taking and have something very valuable to teach us about how to win in markets. Both of these areas of research are on the risk appetite menu in part two of this article.
"
149,BKNG,"Then my goal is actually to encourage you to approach trading and investing with informed confidence and long-run sustainability. Once you are convinced why you need a trading/investing system, you will be more motivated to learn and follow the rules of any winning system you come across.
"
150,BKNG,"And you will save yourself a small fortune in the ""school of the markets,"" where the tuition is limited only by the size of your account.

"
152,BKNG,"September is an interesting month.
"
153,BKNG,"The Stock Trader's Almanac calls it the worst performing month of the
"
154,BKNG," year, but that is not always the case. During the late 1990s,
"
155,BKNG," September was great for stocks. The past couple of Septembers have also yielded
"
156,BKNG," positive returns.
"
157,BKNG,"The month corresponds with the peak of hurricane season, however. Though
"
158,BKNG," oil prices have pulled back from their record highs, any disruption to
"
159,BKNG," supplies could send crude prices gushing. Let's hope the damage from
"
160,BKNG," Gustav is minimal.
"
161,BKNG,"Regarding the current economic environment, the
"
162,BKNG," general expectation is that data will not be very good over the next
"
163,BKNG," several months. But, relative to other periods of weakness, the
"
164,BKNG," economy is in pretty decent shape. Hidden behind the headlines is the
"
165,BKNG," simple fact that unemployment remains at favorable levels. Plus, most
"
166,BKNG," homeowners are current on their mortgages.
"
167,BKNG,"On a technical basis, we are entering September in a low-volume trading
"
168,BKNG," range. Therefore the charts aren't telling us very much.
"
169,BKNG,"My best guess is that we will probably see more choppy markets in
"
170,BKNG," September and throughout the fall. Nonetheless, the U.S. markets appear to
"
171,BKNG," be the best game in town. Therefore, keep money allocated to U.S.
"
172,BKNG," stocks. Long-term investors will be rewarded for doing so.
"
173,BKNG,"The Markets
"
174,BKNG,"Since I've been talking about the late-summer trading environment
"
175,BKNG," during the past couple of weeks, I thought it might be more useful to show a
"
176,BKNG," chart of SPDRs (SPY  -  Free Report), the ETF
"
177,BKNG," that tracks the S&P 500, rather than the index itself. Doing so will
"
178,BKNG," allow you to view the volume trends that I have been noticing.
"
179,BKNG,"Recent Additions to the Focus List
"
180,BKNG,"On Thursday, we added four stocks to the Focus List - the most we have
"
181,BKNG," added on a single day in quite some time.
"
182,BKNG,"There were two primary reasons for this. The first was that the
"
183,BKNG," current market environment has discounted companies with positive
"
184,BKNG," business momentum and rising earnings estimates. The second was that we saw
"
185,BKNG," the opportunity to improve the diversification of the Focus List.
"
186,BKNG,"The new additions are Edison International (EIX  -  Free Report)- an
"
187,BKNG," electric utility, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) - a
"
188,BKNG," railroad, Fluor (FLR  -  Free Report) - a
"
189,BKNG," construction and engineering firm, and Metalico (MEA) - a scrap
"
190,BKNG," metal processor.
"
191,BKNG,"At 29 stocks, the portfolio is still a little smaller than I would
"
192,BKNG," prefer. My preference not to overweight basic materials and energy is
"
193,BKNG," keeping us out of several Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") and Zacks #2 Rank
"
194,BKNG," (""buy"") stocks. There are others, like Visa (V  -  Free Report), that we want
"
195,BKNG," to look at closer before making a final decision.
"
196,BKNG,"My intention is to use any additional market weakness as a buying
"
197,BKNG," opportunity. Of course, we will execute stop losses when necessary.
"
198,BKNG,"Priceline.com
"
199,BKNG,"We sold Priceline.com (PCLN), a stock
"
200,BKNG," that was added to the Focus List in Nov 2005. Our concern was that the
"
201,BKNG," weakening global economic environment has increased the downside risk
"
202,BKNG," for the stock. Given this scenario, we saw little reason not to lock in a nearly 300% return.

"
205,BKNG,"Priceline.com (PCLN) shares have been on a fierce rally for the last two days after the company reported awesome first quarter results that were far ahead of expectations. Revenue was up 33.8% from last year to $403.2 million. Net income totaled $18.2 million, a huge swing from last year's loss of $16.3, which was largely due to litigation expenses. This produced earnings of 37 cents per share. Priceline also boosted its guidance, and now expects to earn between $5.25 and $5.65 per share in fiscal 2008. The great quarter gave this stock a serious boost, breaking above a long standing level of resistance and gaining over 15% in just one session. Take a look at the chart below. 
"
206,BKNG,"Encore Acquisition Co. (EAC) shares are also in rally formation, as it too reported outstanding first quarter results on May 7. Natural gas and oil revenues increased 133% from the same period last year to $268.8 million. Net income totaled $31.2 million, compared to a loss of $29.4 million last year. Not only is Encore gaining from higher prices, it has also increased production, with a 19% increase in average daily wellhead production this quarter compared to last year. The market loved the news and sent Encore shares soaring, gaining over 13% in the session following the release. Take a look at the chart below. 
"
207,BKNG,"Priceline.com (PCLN) shares are currently in a large-scale wedge formation, as seen on the chart below. The current up trend began from the low on Jan 22, just above $86. Since then, shares have advanced as high $134, progressing along the previously mentioned trend. Over the last two months, shares have continued to log higher lows while pressuring the upper region of the current trading range. With shares now moving into a consolidation pattern on the top side of the range, they look very well positioned for an upside breakout. This activity comes ahead of the company's first quarter results, set to be released on May 8. Although estimates have remained steady for the last 90 days, Priceline is expected to post strong results. A solid report could be just what these shares need in order to push beyond the restrictive level of resistance just above $129. Take a look at the chart below. 
"
208,BKNG," Watson Syatt Worldwide Inc. (WW) shares have had an awesome year, posting consistently impressive gains when plenty of other companies stock prices have been getting hurt. After bottoming out on Jan 9 just below $42, this stock has advanced above $59, an impressive short-term gain of more than 40%. This previously mentioned level at $59 has been a challenging area for this stock. It has been tested numerous times during the month of April, but has yet to be breached. There is another very nice wedge formation that is in play in this chart, much like the formation in Priceline. Watson is scheduled to report its third quarter results on May 8. Although analyst estimates have been mostly steady for the last 30 days, a strong showing could provide this stock with the pop it needs to accelerate into higher territory. Take a look at the chart below.

209,BKNG,"Last week, on Bastille Day, I wrote ""The Seven C's of Recovery Optimism"" to highlight fundamental driving forces that would propel the S&P 500 to 1,500 in the first quarter of 2012. An investor wrote me a comment in response, asking the following questions...
"

"
211,BKNG,"Great question, and of course I have thoughts. Here's what I wrote in response:

"
213,BKNG,"The debt issues for both Europe and the US are serious matters. But they won't derail global growth in my humble, amateur-economist opinion.

"
215,BKNG,"Case in point, to prove my point, surfaced overnight with an official statement from the Chinese government. Writing for The Financial Times from Beijing, Simon Rabinovitch well summed-up the sentiments of the central bank with the world's largest foreign exchange reserves in his opening sentence:
"
216,BKNG,"""China has called on Washington to bolster international faith in its economic policies amid signs that Beijing has cut its purchases of US government debt."" 
"
217,BKNG,"This was part of a public response to questions on the website of the Chinese State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) about the impact on China's current Treasury holdings, and future purchases, if the US debt ceiling issue is not resolved and the risk of default, or even a country downgrade, becomes real.
"
218,BKNG,"China-US Trade and Debt Symbiosis
"
219,BKNG,"As I've said for years, the risk of China reacting to such threats with large-scale selling of Treasuries is very remote. They would only be hurting themselves by initiating a spiral collapse of the US dollar and Treasury debt. Since over two-thirds of China's massive $3.2 trillion in currency reserves is in dollars, it is always in their best interest to support the dollar and US Treasury securities.
"
220,BKNG,"This symbiotic relationship is largely an after-effect of the other two forces at play here: China's economic dependence on exports to the US, and the yuan currency peg which sustains their competitive trade advantage. They have to put dollars back into Treasuries because there isn't enough gold, oil, copper, or wheat to withstand their buying power. 
"
221,BKNG,"This said, China would still suffer even if they did no selling and were the victims of a downgrade to US debt by ratings agencies like Standard & Poor's and Moody's which have issued warnings of the possibility. Chinese financial leaders are very conscious of this threat, as evidenced by this direct call on the SAFE website:
"
222,BKNG,"""We hope the US government will earnestly adopt responsible policies to strengthen international market confidence, and to respect and protect the interests of investors.""
"
223,BKNG,"While this is a formal political posture to be sure, you can be sure that many back-room conversations between SAFE and the US financial authorities have been occurring to assuage and assure our biggest creditor. The full FT article, ""China calls on US to protect investors"" is worth reading for details on whether or not China has recently slowed its Treasury purchases.
"
224,BKNG,"Woe to the Underinvested Portfolio Manager
"
225,BKNG,"So, should I add ""Compromise"" as the eighth to my list of ""The Seven C's?"" I still don't think so.

"
253,BKNG,"In the first quarter of 2010, I wrote an article for The Options News Network titled ""Apple: Why You Buy the Dips."" My argument was based on four strong forces:
"
254,BKNG,"1) Outstanding maker of must-have gadget magic and productivity tools that captivated consumers
"
255,BKNG,"2) Sales growth and earnings growth appeared unstoppable from innovative new products and new markets
"
256,BKNG,"3) Institutional sponsorship of AAPL stock also appeared unstoppable and made it in constant demand by fund managers who could not be left behind
"
257,BKNG,"4) Strong technical price action on chart since credit crisis lows, which is always indicative of institutional support
"
258,BKNG,"I was on to something with Apple. But maybe I was just lucky. On the currency trading desk where I worked for ten years, after someone had a good day we used to say ""Even a blind squirrel finds a nut... now and then.""
"
259,BKNG,"So I was always in search of a robust system for my stock-picking to reinforce my intuitive skills and protect me from my own random methods, and occasional blindness. Then in 2011, I discovered a system that used earnings estimate revisions to predict stock trends and momentum.
"
260,BKNG,"I didn't know it at first, but this was exactly what I was looking for because it simplified so many other fundamental metrics. And it actually preceded and predicted a lot of the technical work I was already a fan of. In essence, it created a solid foundation upon which to build all my other analysis.
"
261,BKNG,"Front-Running the Elephants
"
262,BKNG,"The primary achievement of this focus on earnings estimate revisions (EER) is that it precedes, and thus predicts, what institutional money managers -- the elephants of financial markets -- will do with their cash. How? Because they have valuation models that tell them what they are willing to pay for a stock today based on its earnings tomorrow.
"
263,BKNG,"And what do they plug into their valuation models to give them that answer? Forward-looking earnings estimates that are produced by hundreds of quantitative minds in the investment community.
"
264,BKNG,"Why? Because professional stock investors -- portfolio managers for pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and insurance companies -- are forward-looking by nature. They don't care about the trailing P/E. They are focused on the forward P/E which only comes from analyst earnings estimates. 
"
265,BKNG,"And if estimates of futures earnings are rising in both agreement and magnitude among the analysts, then the fair value price that the valuation models of institutional investors spits out will be rising. In other words, higher estimates today equal higher stock prices tomorrow.
"
266,BKNG,"Are the analysts always right? Hardly, but in aggregate, the Zacks Rank stock rating system is able to crunch and quantify their inputs every night into a single very valuable and historically predictive number through a proprietary formula that sorts a universe of 4,400 stocks into five ratings.
"
267,BKNG,"The system alerts you immediately to earnings momentum and this gives you time to buy (or sell) a stock ahead of the elephants who usually take several weeks, and layers of committee approvals, to accumulate new positions.
"
268,BKNG,"Trading Rules that Earn Doubles, Triples, and Ten-Baggers
"
269,BKNG,"Let me give you a couple of the systems parameters and rules and then I will show you how it easily produced a 300%+ gain in Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), a 500%+ gain in Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report), a true ten-bagger in Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), 700% on your money on priceline.com (PCLN), and a double in Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report).
"
270,BKNG,"First, the Zacks Rank takes a universe of about 4,400 stocks and evaluates them based on the recent trends in analyst earnings estimate revisions. The stocks are weighted and then ranked on a relative basis, much like grading test scores on a curve, to produce 5 groups of stocks.
"
271,BKNG,"The top 5% of stocks earn the Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) for their superior earnings momentum. This means only about 220 names make this top tier list. These are the stocks most likely to outperform because of the price appreciation likely predicted by their strong forward earnings picture. 
"
272,BKNG,"The next 15% of stocks, 660 names, earn the Zacks #2 Rank (buy) because they still have still very attractive earnings momentum. This means that the Zacks Rank can have a buy rating on up to 880 stocks at once. Since none of us can or want to buy all those companies, it helps to focus primarily on #1 stocks, and those #2 stocks you are very interested in because of their stories or sectors. 
"
273,BKNG,"The middle 60% of stocks in this universe of 4,440 names are rated #3 Rank (hold) for their likelihood of being merely ""market performers."" This group will hold about 2,640 names. Finally, the bottom 20% of stocks are classified as #4 Rank (sell) and #5 Rank (strong sell), comprising approximately 880 names.
"
274,BKNG,"The 1, 2, 3 Step
"
275,BKNG,"What we have found is that very strong stocks tend to gravitate between Rank #1 and #2 for long periods over several months or quarters. Since the Zacks Rank focuses on analyst data only from the past 60 days, it highlights recent estimate revisions and is intended to alert you to near-term momentum.
"
276,BKNG,"But even a stock that tends to hang out in the #1 and #2 Ranks will sometimes slip down to a #3 hold simply because old data has dropped off, no new estimates have come in, and earnings appear to have flat lined. But this is really just a temporary lull, more so in analyst activity than in the companys real earnings power.
"
277,BKNG,"The five stocks I mentioned with triple digit returns in the past 2 years or so since the recession -- AAPL, CMG, NFLX, PCLN, and CAT -- all spent significant periods as #1 or #2 Rank stocks, often flipping back and forth as analysts moved estimates and other stocks competed for a spot on the top 220.
"
278,BKNG,"And in that 2 years or so, they all also dropped occasionally to a #3 Rank as there wasn't enough new analyst action to earn them a continuously unbroken streak among the top 880 names. But since they never dropped below a #3 Rank, investors who believed in these stocks for the slightly longer run than one or two quarters' earnings events could have easily hung on with a rule that asked ""Why sell a strong earnings machine if the story and trend seem bound to continue?"" After all, a body in motion...
"
279,BKNG,"Here are the numbers that speak of wealth building returns for stocks which maintained a Zacks #1 or #2 Rank consistently, and never slipped below a #3 Rank:
"
280,BKNG,"AAPL: Since December 2008, $100 to $375
"
281,BKNG,"CMG: Since December 2008, $60 to $325
"
282,BKNG,"NFLX: Since October 2008, $25 to $285
"
283,BKNG,"CAT: Since September 2009, $50 to $115
"
284,BKNG,"PCLN: Since November 2008, $70 to $430. Then after being a #4 Rank for a couple of weeks in January 2011, PCLN went back to the top ranks in February and surged on to $550.
"
285,BKNG,"Cause and Effect
"
286,BKNG,"When I first discovered the Zacks Rank stock rating system and become a fan of it this spring, I realized that the power of earnings estimate revisions (EER) was what I had been looking for all along for these three reasons:
"
287,BKNG,"1) Institutional investors valuation models use EER and individual investors can ""front-run"" these elephants
"
288,BKNG,"2) The EER approach simplifies and can precede all other fundamentals as a core approach to company and investment success
"
289,BKNG,"3) Momentum chart moves that initially show up as volume spikes and ""breakouts"" are usually preceded by upward EER

290,BKNG,"Apple Earnings Preview: Blowout Getting Priced-In
"
291,BKNG,"As I write this on Tuesday morning, Apple is due to report earnings after the close. Two things are telling you we may be expecting another blow-out quarter from the maker of all things magic.
"
292,BKNG,"First, the stock price has run up dramatically since late June from below $320 to new all-time highs above $375.
"
293,BKNG,"Second, analyst earnings estimate revisions of the past month and week have been exciting to watch. Of the 40-some covering the name, 20 analysts upped their numbers in the past 30 days and 10 did so in the past 7, taking the consensus estimate from $5.63 to $5.81 for the quarter just closed, and from $6.33 to $6.40 for the next. They also boosted estimates for next year.
"
294,BKNG,"It looks like the street is expecting a huge number from Jobs & Co because, as I should have mentioned earlier, analysts as a group tend to be conservative. The high estimate among the group is only $6.58, while ""whispers"" on the street are talking about a number above $7.00. This is how ""serial earnings surprisers"" like Apple keep killing it.
"
295,BKNG,"I think that kind of blowout EPS number takes AAPL over $400 in a heartbeat after the close. I'll give you one guess which factor drove the stock price to rally $60 in the past month, and it wasn't merely the ""technicals."" If the chart is a by-product, EER is the fuel. 
"
296,BKNG,"Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Analyst for Zacks.com
"
297,BKNG,"In the first quarter of 2010, I wrote an article for The Options News Network titled ""Apple: Why You Buy the Dips."" My argument was based on four strong forces:
"
298,BKNG,"1) Outstanding maker of must-have gadget magic and productivity tools that captivated consumers
"
299,BKNG,"2) Sales growth and earnings growth appeared unstoppable from innovative new products and new markets
"
300,BKNG,"3) Institutional sponsorship of AAPL stock also appeared unstoppable and made it in constant demand by fund managers who could not be left behind
"
301,BKNG,"4) Strong technical price action on chart since credit crisis lows, which is always indicative of institutional support
"
302,BKNG,"I was on to something with Apple. But maybe I was just lucky. On the currency trading desk where I worked for ten years, after someone had a good day we used to say ""Even a blind squirrel finds a nut... now and then.""
"
303,BKNG,"So I was always in search of a robust system for my stock-picking to reinforce my intuitive skills and protect me from my own random methods, and occasional blindness. Then in 2011, I discovered a system that used earnings estimate revisions to predict stock trends and momentum.
"
304,BKNG,"I didn't know it at first, but this was exactly what I was looking for because it simplified so many other fundamental metrics. And it actually preceded and predicted a lot of the technical work I was already a fan of. In essence, it created a solid foundation upon which to build all my other analysis.
"
305,BKNG,"Front-Running the Elephants
"
306,BKNG,"The primary achievement of this focus on earnings estimate revisions (EER) is that it precedes, and thus predicts, what institutional money managers -- the elephants of financial markets -- will do with their cash. How? Because they have valuation models that tell them what they are willing to pay for a stock today based on its earnings tomorrow.
"
307,BKNG,"And what do they plug into their valuation models to give them that answer? Forward-looking earnings estimates that are produced by hundreds of quantitative minds in the investment community.
"
308,BKNG,"Why? Because professional stock investors -- portfolio managers for pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and insurance companies -- are forward-looking by nature. They don't care about the trailing P/E. They are focused on the forward P/E which only comes from analyst earnings estimates. 
"
309,BKNG,"And if estimates of futures earnings are rising in both agreement and magnitude among the analysts, then the fair value price that the valuation models of institutional investors spits out will be rising. In other words, higher estimates today equal higher stock prices tomorrow.
"
310,BKNG,"Are the analysts always right? Hardly, but in aggregate, the Zacks Rank stock rating system is able to crunch and quantify their inputs every night into a single very valuable and historically predictive number through a proprietary formula that sorts a universe of 4,400 stocks into five ratings.
"
311,BKNG,"The system alerts you immediately to earnings momentum and this gives you time to buy (or sell) a stock ahead of the elephants who usually take several weeks, and layers of committee approvals, to accumulate new positions.
"
312,BKNG,"Trading Rules that Earn Doubles, Triples, and Ten-Baggers
"
313,BKNG,"Let me give you a couple of the systems parameters and rules and then I will show you how it easily produced a 300%+ gain in Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), a 500%+ gain in Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report), a true ten-bagger in Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), 700% on your money on priceline.com (PCLN), and a double in Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report).
"
314,BKNG,"First, the Zacks Rank takes a universe of about 4,400 stocks and evaluates them based on the recent trends in analyst earnings estimate revisions. The stocks are weighted and then ranked on a relative basis, much like grading test scores on a curve, to produce 5 groups of stocks.
"
315,BKNG,"The top 5% of stocks earn the Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) for their superior earnings momentum. This means only about 220 names make this top tier list. These are the stocks most likely to outperform because of the price appreciation likely predicted by their strong forward earnings picture. 
"
316,BKNG,"The next 15% of stocks, 660 names, earn the Zacks #2 Rank (buy) because they still have still very attractive earnings momentum. This means that the Zacks Rank can have a buy rating on up to 880 stocks at once. Since none of us can or want to buy all those companies, it helps to focus primarily on #1 stocks, and those #2 stocks you are very interested in because of their stories or sectors. 
"
317,BKNG,"The middle 60% of stocks in this universe of 4,440 names are rated #3 Rank (hold) for their likelihood of being merely ""market performers."" This group will hold about 2,640 names. Finally, the bottom 20% of stocks are classified as #4 Rank (sell) and #5 Rank (strong sell), comprising approximately 880 names.
"
318,BKNG,"The 1, 2, 3 Step
"
319,BKNG,"What we have found is that very strong stocks tend to gravitate between Rank #1 and #2 for long periods over several months or quarters. Since the Zacks Rank focuses on analyst data only from the past 60 days, it highlights recent estimate revisions and is intended to alert you to near-term momentum.
"
320,BKNG,"But even a stock that tends to hang out in the #1 and #2 Ranks will sometimes slip down to a #3 hold simply because old data has dropped off, no new estimates have come in, and earnings appear to have flat lined. But this is really just a temporary lull, more so in analyst activity than in the companys real earnings power.
"
321,BKNG,"The five stocks I mentioned with triple digit returns in the past 2 years or so since the recession -- AAPL, CMG, NFLX, PCLN, and CAT -- all spent significant periods as #1 or #2 Rank stocks, often flipping back and forth as analysts moved estimates and other stocks competed for a spot on the top 220.

"
341,BKNG,"For anyone that's ever been on the right side of a big winner, watching a river of gains flow into your account can be pretty exciting. But in order to score outsized returns, you have to be willing to take some risk. And in the stock market, that frequently comes in the form of momentum high flyers defying the rules of traditional investing.
"
342,BKNG,"Forget Valuation
"
343,BKNG,"One of the few things most of these high flyers have in common is a total disregard for traditional valuation parameters. That might seem to defy logic on the surface, but there is actually a very good reason for this phenomenon. Investors don't trade momentum stocks on current or even short-term revenue or earnings projections, they trade on long-term expectations for outsized growth that the market has yet to recognize and appreciate. So when you're looking at momentum stocks be sure to remember that current fundamentals may seem a bit detached from price action.
"
344,BKNG,"Buy the High
"
345,BKNG,"Speaking of price action, momentum stocks are also known for logging many new highs over a short or extended period of time. This in and of itself will keep many investors who prefer to buy dips on the sidelines. There is nothing wrong with either style, it's all about personal preference, but it's important to remember that when tracking a momentum stock, you will very rarely get a chance to buy on a reversal or dip.
"
346,BKNG,"Shares Can Always Go Higher
"
347,BKNG,"When I was working on the trading floor at the Chicago Board of Trade a few years ago, it wasn't uncommon to see big groups of traders rolling off the floor after a few early-morning rallies. These guys would assume that after two legs higher, whatever market they were trading was already gassed out. But that kind of sentiment, that a market is tapped out and can't go any higher is a bullish signal. Needless to say, those early gains were frequently followed by the biggest move of the day that came just as nobody was expecting it. The moral of the story is that prices can always go higher, even if they already seem quite high.
"
348,BKNG,"So on that note, let's shift gears and take a look at our top 4 momentum stocks that have been posting huge gains over the last few months.
"
349,BKNG,"Top 4 Momentum StocksCARBO Ceramics (CRR  -  Free Report) is a momentum high flyer of huge proportions, recently blasting into a new all-time high after reporting an impressive Q1 earnings surprise. Even though the valuation picture is running a bit hot, the company has four consecutive earnings surprises and a bullish growth projection, enough to keep the bulls charging higher. Take a look below.
"
350,BKNG,"Priceline, Inc. (PCLN) has been one of the hottest momentum stories of the last year, defying skeptics with a meteoric rise to an all-time high of $561. Ya, the forward P/E of 27X is a premium to the industry average, but with sharp earnings growth in hand, the momentum investors of the world expect more good things from this travel deals provider. To boot, the stochastic below the chart says shares are oversold, take a look below.
"
351,BKNG,"Green Mountain Coffee (GMCR) is a valuation felon, currently trading with a forward P/E of 52X, more than 3X the industry average. But so what, momentum investors could care less, and they have been getting paid handsomely to do so, with GMCR recently jumping into a new all-time high on another strong quarter. The valuation suggests a pending correction, but remember, the market can stay irrational longer than most people can stay solvent. Check out the three gaps higher below.
"
352,BKNG,"Brace for impact momentum traders, this next pick is hotter than Tiger Woods at a pancake house. ProShares Ultra Silver (AGQ  -  Free Report) is a double long silver ETF that tracks cash silver prices. With a 4-month range of $117 to $382, this is both an endorsement and cautionary tale of the kind of action you can find in a momentum high flyer. Take a look at the wild price action below.
"
353,BKNG,"Momentum Stocks-Proceed With Caution
"
354,BKNG,"So as you can see, there is plenty of spicy action in some of these momentum high flyers. Names like these don't necessarily represent your largest holdings, but having smaller allocations to higher-beta stocks gives you a chance of snagging a big winner.

"
356,BKNG,"Shares of Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) are trading at less than 1.5x book value despite the biggest earnings surprise in more than four quarters. The online travel company recently reported third-quarter profits of 36 cents per share, two cents above expectations, as European booking surged by 47%. EXPE is a Zacks #1 Rank stock.
"
357,BKNG,"Full Analysis
"
358,BKNG,"Expedia was created from the 2005 spin-off of IAC/InterActiveCorp's (IACI) travel businesses. EXPE operates multiple travel web sites including Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Hotwire.com and TripAdvisor.com. The company's brands also include Worldwide Travel Exchange and Interactive Affiliate Network.
"
359,BKNG,"EXPE's strategy is to target various niches of the travel market with a variety of brand-name and private-labeled web sites. For example, the company's namesake web site provides overall travel services (airline tickets, hotel reservations, cruises, destination packages, etc.). Expedia.com is operated with U.S., Australian and European versions. Hotwire.com focuses on discounted rates and offering travelers the chance to suggest a price they are willing to pay.
"
360,BKNG,"Rising global tourism and a strong European economy enabled EXPE to experience a good third quarter. Revenues rose 24% to $759.6 million, reflecting a 21% in gross bookings. European bookings surged by 47% (39% after currency adjustments). Hotel room nights stayed rose 16% and worldwide air revenue improved by 9% (15% more tickets were sold).
"
361,BKNG,"EXPE was able to convert the higher revenues into the higher profits thanks to 179-basis point improvement in gross margins. Cost-cutting measures and an increased mix of advertising and media revenue contributed to better profitability.
"
362,BKNG,"Per share profits totaled 36 cents for the third-quarter, two cents above expectations and nearly double earnings from a year prior. This was the second consecutive earnings surprise and the largest in more than four quarters.
"
363,BKNG,"Following the release of last week's report, three of the 11 covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts for both this year and next. The 2007 consensus earnings estimate now stands at $1.13, three cents above the average forecast of a week ago. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at $1.20 per share. The 2008 consensus earnings estimate is at $1.36 per share, five cents higher than a week ago. The most accurate estimate for 2008 is 11 cents higher at $1.47 per share.
"
364,BKNG,"The market turmoil of last week prevented the stock from reacting to this positive news. As a result, shares of EXPE now trade at less than 1.5x book value. This valuation represents a sharp discount to direct competitor Priceline.com (PCLN), whose shares trade at 9.7x book value.
"
365,BKNG,"EXPE is a Zacks #1 Rank stock. The impressive rating is assigned to EXPE because of the recent earnings surprise, the positive earnings estimate revisions for both 2007 and 2008 and most accurate estimates that are above the consensus earnings estimates. Since 1988, Zacks #1 Rank stocks have generated an annual average return of 32%.
"
366,BKNG,"Priceline.com (PCLN) continues to outperform and reach all-time highs.
"
367,BKNG,"PCLN is a travel service that offers leisure airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars,

"
370,BKNG,"The companys Name Your Own Price service (also called its
"
371,BKNG,"opaque business) offers customers a unique value proposition by allowing them to name their own price
"
372,BKNG,"for online products/services. In these transactions, Priceline.com determines the price it will accept and
"
373,BKNG,"has discretion in supplier selection. PCLNs value-add to suppliers is that Priceline.com provides a brand
"
374,BKNG,"preserving sales service that enables them to sell excess inventory without harming their existing retail
"
375,BKNG,"pricing structure. 
"
376,BKNG,"Priceline.com also has a more traditional travel sales model that allows customers to
"
377,BKNG,"choose specific suppliers and inventories. Under the retail model, Priceline.com acts as an agent for the
"
378,BKNG,"airline, hotel or rental car company and the supplier is the merchant of record. The company was
"
379,BKNG,"founded in 1997 and went public in March 1999.
"
380,BKNG,"Priceline.coms international growth and

"
383,BKNG,"The companys continued shift into retail airline tickets, non-air products (hotels,
"
384,BKNG,"rental cars, and travel packages), and into Europe should enable the company to produce solid long-term
"
385,BKNG,"earnings growth.
"
386,BKNG,"The company recently released results for the second quarter. In addition to earnings per share delivering strong outperformance on a year-over-year basis as well as in relation to the consensus estimates, Priceline.coms GAAP revenues of $355.9 million increased by 15.7% from the previous years second quarter. The company also noted that gross travel bookings, which refers to the total dollar value, inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers, rose 33% year-over-year to $1.2 billion.  
"
387,BKNG,"""Priceline.com's earnings performance in the second quarter exceeded our previous expectations for both the international and domestic businesses,"" said priceline.com President and Chief Executive Officer Jeffery H. Boyd. ""Internationally, Booking.com's results were driven by 93% growth in gross bookings, which continues to outperform market growth rates. Domestic gross bookings fell within the range of our guidance, but earnings growth exceeded our expectations due to strong organic growth in merchant hotel and rental cars and more efficient marketing.""
"
388,BKNG,"Analysts are optimistic about the companys future as evidenced by their earnings forecasts. Current third-quarter estimates of $1.22 per share increased from 99 cents over the past 60 trading days. Expectations for the full-year 2007 are currently pegged at $3.31 per share, up from the two months-ago level of $2.77.

"
390,BKNG,"The charts of many stocks have been affected by worries about the credit crunch, even those companies in stable financial condition and no exposure to junk debt or the housing market. Therefore, I will start this weeks discussion with a look at overall market conditions.
"
391,BKNG,"The major indexes are poised to post modest gains this week, rebounding from the lows established on Aug 23. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq broke back above their 200-day moving averages, while the Dow continued to stay above this long-term indicator. Allthree, however, remain below their 90-day moving averages and this trendline could prove to be a point of resistance.
"
392,BKNG,"Of greater concern, however, is the direction of the 200-day moving average. As the chart of the S&P 500 below shows, the long-term indicator is starting to flatten. Since one of the characteristics of a bull market is an upward trending 200-day moving average, this is an indicator to keep an eye on. 
"
393,BKNG,"Schering-Plough (SGP) provides a good example of how this market volatility is playing out on individual stocks. Although SGP is not an economically sensitive stock and is in good financial condition, it was nonetheless impacted by the recent market weakness. SGP is trading just below its 90-day moving average and is also approaching a previous area of support, so the stock may be at risk of encountering some resistance. A continued move to the upside, however, would be bullish.
"
394,BKNG,"There are some stocks, however, that are doing very well. One of them is Priceline.com (PCLN). PCLN set a new 52-week high following upward earnings estimate revisions by several analysts. Better yet, PCLN is not overbought at current levels  a very bullish sign.
"
395,BKNG,"Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) has performed remarkably well, despite the overall markets turmoil. The companys chart is consistent and uptrending, and its recent financial reports suggest more good times ahead.

"
398,BKNG,"On Apr 7, this Zacks #1 Rank stock reported second-quarter earnings of $1.00 per share, up from 55 cents per share in the year-ago period and 20 cents above expectations. Fueling the earnings growth, revenue rose to $355.9 million from $307.7 million in the year-ago period, just beating analyst forecasts of $354.3 million. According to the company, gross bookings rose by 33% to $1.2 billion.

"
400,BKNG,"Priceline.com also increased its full-year guidance forecast due to stronger-than-expected second-quarter results. The company now expects to earn between $3.50 and $3.65 per share, up from prior guidance of $2.90 to $3.10. Third-quarter earnings are expected to be between 90 cents and $1.00 per share
"
401,BKNG,"The latest 25% earnings surprise marked the fifth consecutive quarter Priceline.com has exceeded expectations. In fact, the company has missed estimates only one time in the last 14 quarters. Following the latest earnings release, full-year consensus estimates were increased by 37 cents to $3.30, the fourth upward revision in 90 days. Next years estimates have followed a similar trend and currently stand at $4.03, up from $3.12 three months ago. Furthermore, Zacks ranks the company a number one out of 21 companies in the Electronic Commerce category.  
"
402,BKNG,"Zacks last featured Priceline.com Inc. as a Momentum play on May 31, 2007 and has since returned over 19%. After posting a stellar return of 95.4% in 2006, PCLN has climbed over 68% year-to-date. While off the 52-week highs reached on Aug 8, the stock remains above the earnings induced upward price gap. In fact, the stock is currently trading in line with old resistance, which could become new support in the event of a rally. PCLNs consistent uptrend is obvious and the solid earnings momentum and increasing estimates foretell good times ahead. Look for PCLN to build on its outperformance and continue the upward trend. 
"
403,BKNG,"Priceline.com (PCLN) has been on a tear after reporting its second quarter. The share price shot up by approximately 22%, to a 52-week high, on the day after it reported and has been hovering around that level during the past few days.

407,BKNG,"The companys Name Your Own Price service (also called its
"
408,BKNG,"opaque business) offers customers a unique value proposition by allowing them to name their own price
"
409,BKNG,"for online products/services. In these transactions, Priceline.com determines the price it will accept and
"
410,BKNG,"has discretion in supplier selection. PCLNs value-add to suppliers is that Priceline.com provides a brand
"
411,BKNG,"preserving sales service that enables them to sell excess inventory without harming their existing retail
"
412,BKNG,"pricing structure. 
"
413,BKNG,"Priceline.com also has a more traditional travel sales model that allows customers to
"
414,BKNG,"choose specific suppliers and inventories. Under the retail model, Priceline.com acts as an agent for the
"
415,BKNG,"airline, hotel or rental car company and the supplier is the merchant of record. The company was

"
420,BKNG,"The company recently released results for the second quarter. In addition to earnings per share delivering strong outperformance on a year-over-year basis as well as in relation to the consensus estimates, Priceline.coms GAAP revenues of $355.9 million increased by 15.7% from the previous years second quarter. The company also noted that gross travel bookings, which refers to the total dollar value, inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by consumers, rose 33% year-over-year to $1.2 billion.  
"
421,BKNG,"""Priceline.com's earnings performance in the second quarter exceeded our previous expectations for both the international and domestic businesses,"" said priceline.com President and Chief Executive Officer Jeffery H. Boyd. ""Internationally, Booking.com's results were driven by 93% growth in gross bookings, which continues to outperform market growth rates. Domestic gross bookings fell within the range of our guidance, but earnings growth exceeded our expectations due to strong organic growth in merchant hotel and rental cars and more efficient marketing.""

423,BKNG,"A one-day Fed meeting will be held on Tuesday, Aug 7. The Federal Open Market Committee is not expected to change interest rates. It is unclear what, if anything, the Fed will change in its statement about housing or the economy. In its June statement, the Fed noted that the economy is expected to expand at a moderate pace and that there was an ongoing adjustment in the housing sector. Both of these observations continue to hold true, while the pace of inflation probably has not slowed enough to convince the Fed that rising prices are no longer a threat.
"
424,BKNG,"The Feds August meeting will be held during a week when the amount of economic data will be comparatively scarce and the pace of earnings news is slowing down. The first set of economic data will be published on Tuesday with preliminary second-quarter productivity data being released in the morning and June consumer credit being released in the afternoon. Wednesday features June wholesale trade numbers. July import price data will be released on Friday.
"
425,BKNG,"We have confirmed reports from 677 companies for the week of Aug 6-10. More importantly, the average size of the company reporting will be considerably smaller ($2.9 billion versus $6.1 billion for the week of Jul 30  Aug 3), meaning that the reports will have less of an impact on market direction. Dow component American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) will report on Wednesday, Aug 8, after the close of trading. 
"
426,BKNG,"The markets, unfortunately, have not reacted to what is a good second-quarter earnings season. The reason is concern about problems within the credit markets, fueled by the ongoing implosion in subprime and Alt-A mortgage loans. The return of volatility could create buying opportunities, particularly when one considers that the median company in the S&P 500 has reported 12.9% EPS growth and the median company within the S&P 600 (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600) has generated 9.4% growth. In addition, earnings estimates, on average, have been revised upwards. Profits for the S&P 500 are currently forecast to reach $94.06 this year, which is 1.1% better than what brokerage analysts were projecting a month ago.
"
427,BKNG,"From a trading standpoint, it is important to realize that August can be a volatile month. The number of earnings reports will decline throughout the month, many Americans will be out on summer vacations and hurricane season tends to start reaching its peak near the end of the month. Given the focus on the credit markets, it is likely that the equity markets will continue to experience choppy waters over the next several weeks.
"
428,BKNG,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Aug 6 - 10Foster Wheeler (FWLT) has topped expectations by an average margin of 45 cents per share over the past four quarters. During the past month, one of the five covering brokerage analysts raised his forecast for second-quarter earnings, pushing the consensus estimate up by three cents to $1.33 per share. Foster Wheeler is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Aug 8, before the start of trading.
"
429,BKNG,"JA Solar Holdings (JASO  -  Free Report) completed its IPO last February and then proceeded to top expectations for its first reported quarter as a publicly-traded company. Ahead of the Chinese solar cell manufacturers second-quarter report, brokerage analysts have been revising their projections upward. The consensus estimate calls for profits of 20 cents per share, two cents above the average projection of a month ago. JA Solar is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Aug 8, before the start of trading.
"
430,BKNG,"A strong summer season for the travel industry has led one brokerage analyst to raise his second-quarter forecast on Priceline.com (PCLN). The revision caused the consensus estimate to rise by two cents to 80 cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bullish at 90 cents per share. PCLN has topped expectations during each of the past four quarters by an average margin of 14 cents per share. Priceline.com is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Aug 7, after the close of trading.
"
431,BKNG,"A recent upward revision to TBS Internationals (TBSI) second-quarter consensus estimate suggests optimism about the shipping rates that the company was able to charge. During the past 30 days, one of the two covering brokerage analysts raised his forecast, sending the consensus estimate three cents higher to 55 cents per share. TBSI has topped expectations for three consecutive quarters by an average margin of 13.7 cents per share. TBS International is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Aug 8, before the start of trading.

432,BKNG,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Aug 6 -10
"
433,BKNG,"Last month, Spectrum Brands (SPC) reduced its full-year revenue forecast to about $2.634 billion from its previous forecast of $2.648 billion. The company cited the adverse impact of dry weather conditions on its home and garden business and weaker-than-expected sales of batteries. The majority of the covering brokerage analysts cut their forecasts in responses, sending the consensus estimate down to a fiscal third-quarter loss of 10 cents per share. SPC has missed expectations three times during the past four quarters. Spectrum Brands is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Aug 7, before the start of trading.

438,BKNG,"Shares of Priceline.com (PCLN) closed at a new six-year high yesterday as optimism about the companys prospects continues to brighten. Late last week, one of the covering brokerage analysts raised his forecasts both 2006 and 2007 earnings.

The new consensus estimates call for Priceline.com to earn $1.64 this year and $2.41 next year; these projections compare to the 30-day old forecasts of $1.55 and $2.36, respectively.
"
443,BKNG,"The net effect of the estimate revisions has been a higher price for PCLN. The stock closed yesterday at a new six-year high. Volume is suppressed by holiday trading, but MACD is moving upwards  a bullish sign.

530,BKNG,"The Electronic Commerce, or e-commerce industry, is one of the most dynamic sectors of the economy. The industry is still evolving, so data collection and evaluation are particularly difficult. Consequently, one has to rely largely on surveys by both government and private agencies.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the manufacturing sector is the largest contributor to e-commerce sales (35% of total shipments), followed by merchant wholesalers (21.2%). These two segments make up the business-to-business category.While retailers and service providers generated just 3.2% and 1.6% of their revenues online, these are the fastest growing segments. The Bureau categorizes these two segments as business-to-consumer. [2007 figures, as reported in May 2009.]Retail e-CommerceOver the five-quarter period ended September 2009, some retailers lost business to online rivals, while others continued to benefit from their online stores. Despite the recession, e-commerce sales outperformed the overall retail sector in each of the last five quarters. According to the Census Bureau, e-commerce accounted for 3.7% of overall retail sales in the third quarter of 2009, a sequential increase of 4.5% and a year-over-year increase of 1.8%. Overall retail sales, on the other hand, grew 1.7% sequentially but declined 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.Research organization Forrester Research believes that rapid growth in online retail sales in the U.S. will continue to come at the expense of brick-and-mortar outfits. Both Forrester Research and eMarketer publications indicate that this movement is increasingly attributable to the time savings and convenience of online transactions.Additionally, the advantages of comparison shopping and personal recommendations are adding a new wrinkle. Most of the large retailers offer great variety, as well as evaluations and activities of past users, which help customers make informed decisions. Although in the past the technology required for personalized recommendations was out of bounds for most small retailers, the success of these new features, as well as technology advancements, have made it a priority spend for all.eMarketer has also found that the most common criterion for a positive recommendation was price, followed by quality and then convenience. This, along with the easy availability of choices from competing online retail sites, could be the reasons for the intense price competition in the online retail market.According to data provided by ComScore, retail e-commerce (excluding travel) sales were up 6% in 2008. Retail e-commerce sales will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% from 2008 to 2013 (eMarketer). According to Forrester Research, around 7% of all retail sales were online in 2009.Free shipping has become an essential part of retail e-commerce, with 42% of online sales supported by free shipping in the third quarter of 2009, compared to 31% in the first quarter of 2008 (comScore).ServicesTwo of the most important categories within Services are travel and banking.Of these, perhaps the fastest growing is online travel. Travel represented 41% of total e-retail sales in 2008. [derived from comScore estimates]. It is true that 2009 was slower, as most online travel companies used a lot of promotional inventory. However, we expect growth to return in 2010, with both leisure and business seeing modest increases.International expansion is a common strategy for most of the top players, since a strong international business usually serves to balance out any weakness at home. However, occupancy tax matters remain a headwind for online travel companies in the near term.Banks are also awakening to the fact that people are now spending more time online. The results of a survey by the American Bankers Association (ABA) show that U.S. consumers are increasingly going online. Around 32% of consumers questioned felt that the Internet method of banking was their most-used, a significant increase from 2008, when 25% felt that the Internet was their most-used method. While telephone and email also showed slight increases, branches and ATMs showed significant declines. This clearly indicates that consumers are visiting branches less often.A report from the Aite Group, LLC shows that banks are responding to the change in customer priorities. The report is the result of interviews with online channel executives from 20 of the country’s 100 largest banks. Roughly 50% of the banks expect an increase of more than 15% in online channel budgets in 2010, another 35% expect an increase of 5-15%, while the remaining 15% expect no change.With online transactions expected to boom over the next few years, the top-most concern will be security. While banks will spend significantly on secure payment systems, hackers are expected to have a field day, largely targeting the flood of customers going online.Alternative payment systems are expected to become more important. While some of these payment systems, such as eBay’s (EBAY  -  Free Report) PayPal have been around for awhile, other systems, such as Google’s (GOOG) Checkout are picking up.Alternative payment systems never really gained momentum in the past because of the low volume of transactions. However, as online transactions continue to increase, many more such systems could suddenly become more available. For example, American Express (AXP) recently purchased Revolution Money for a significant amount of money. Other large banks could follow suit, purchasing alternative payment startups that would keep them in the race.M-CommerceM-commerce is a relatively new coinage, indicating the commercial transactions over the Internet currently being carried out by consumers through their mobile phones. Surveys by different private agencies suggest that consumers typically purchase pizza and other fast food, movie and other event tickets, hotel reservations and travelling tickets on their mobile phones, although some users have purchased more expensive items as well.However, m-commerce sales in North America are expected to gather momentum according to ABI Research. The research firm increased its m-commerce sales estimate for 2009 to $750 million (up from $544 million previously estimated) and currently expects sales to cross the $1 billion mark in 2010.The sales growth will come from increased user confidence and their adjustment to the new platform.Online AdvertisingWhile spending on online advertising has been impacted by the recession, it has not suffered as much as other media. Most research firms estimate mid-single-digit growth in 2009, helped by video and mobile advertising. While this may be considered good compared to the low-double-digit decline expected across other media -- newspapers, magazines, radio and TV -- it is the slowest growth rate in its relatively short history. Despite the weakness in the recent past, online advertising is expected to grow strongly into a $25-30 billion market by 2013.The main drivers of growth are currently expected to be an increase in the number of users, greater propensity of users to consume, a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the continued strength in search advertising.Search advertising is expected to remain the most popular, because results are measurable, and therefore more predictable than other media. This also makes the market more resilient in recessionary conditions, since advertisers are more confident about the results of their spending.OPPORTUNITIESThe online retail segment comprises a very large number of companies, although one can easily pick out the most important players. We are particularly positive about Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) because of its leading market position in online retail, strong financials and strength in international markets. The company’s e-book reader Kindle continues to do very well, and strength in this business should continue.Online travel companies, such as Expedia Inc (EXPE  -  Free Report) and Priceline.com (PCLN) are in a strong growth market. Consequently, they should continue to benefit from international expansion and customers moving online. While Orbitz Worldwide (OWW) is a much smaller player with more limited resources, it too should benefit from these trends. Although near-term results could suffer from the spillover effects of the recession as well as occupancy tax issues, we remain positive about their prospects over the next couple of years, at least.The search market is dominated by Google, Inc. (GOOG), which has seen phenomenal growth rates over the last five years. The company is a leading innovator, using its engineering talent to extend its position ion the computing platform to the mobile platform. The company has a huge cash balance that we were concerned was not being put to the best use. However, it is currently on an acquisition spree, which should further round out its product portfolio, build on current strengths and help expansion into new areas.A much smaller provider of Internet advertising solutions and online marketing services, ValueClick Inc. (VCLK) should also benefit from strength in the online advertising market, international expansion, restructuring actions and strong cash flows. However, as firms with larger advertising budgets increase spending on Internet advertising, many of the services performed by ValueClick could be done in-house. This is a risk of investing in the stock.WEAKNESSESWhile eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) is a leading retailer in its own right, the company has seen difficult times. Management is in the process of turning the company around by increasing focus on the fixed price model, but this could come at the cost of margins and alienation of a few sellers operating under the auction format. The company acquired some cash by selling off 70% of its share in Skype, and its current 30% stake should bring some returns.Meanwhile, competition continues to intensify for Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report), which provides distributed e-business infrastructure services and solutions. The low barriers to entry are also a concern, since this is a market adjacency that any large Internet or networking company, such as Google, Yahoo!, AT&T, Verizon, Cisco or Lucent could venture into.Falling bandwidth prices are a pressure on margins, while rising bandwidth costs are attracting new players. However, demand remains strong, with broadband penetration and momentum in online media and entertainment expected to continue in the foreseeable future.Yahoo, Inc. (YHOO) is second only to Google in the search market, although the company has been losing market share. New management is refocusing the company, selling off non-core assets and improving cash flows. The company has a leading position in email applications, and is building on this position through acquisitions and upgrades, which should ultimately help it turn around.

531,BKNG,"Stocks in the hotel industry are benefiting from growth in demand that supports increases in both occupancy and average daily rate (ADR). The momentum in the U.S. hotel industry continues in 2018 after moderate growth in 2017. In first-quarter 2018, the industry witnessed a better-than-expected rise in demand, with revenue per available room (RevPAR) increasing by 3.5%.Consequently, stocks in the Hotels and Motels Industry have put on an impressive show in the past year, handily outperforming the broader market, as a reflection of this positive backdrop. The Zacks Hotels and Motels Industry has rallied 20.2%, surpassing the S&P 500 index’s gain of 14.5%.The industry looks attractive, owing to rise in occupancy rate and gain in commercial transient demand. Further, we note that rising employment, higher real income and increased household net worth reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment. This has resulted in a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, which are likely to continue.The unemployment rate declined from 3.9% in April to 3.8% in May, the lowest in 18 years. The U6 unemployment rate, which includes people forced into part-time work and people sporadically looking for jobs, declined to 7.6%, the lowest level witnessed since May 2001.Going forward, consumer and business spending are expected to keep the mood upbeat, suggesting that the U.S. economy will remain on solid footing in 2018. In fact, the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model forecasts healthy 4.8% (annualized rate) GDP growth in second-quarter 2018.Numbers Look ImpressiveA recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) shows that new supply is likely to rise 2% in 2018, up from 1.8% in 2017. This is likely to result in 0.3% increase in occupancy rates in 2018 to 66.3%. Moreover, ADR and RevPAR are projected to climb 2.6% and 3%, respectively this year. In 2019, the industry is likely to register ADR and RevPAR growth of 2.8% each.Meanwhile, the Baird/STR Hotel Stock Index, which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U.S. exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks, rose 1.6% in April 2018. In fact, in a year, the index has gained 12.7%.Additionally, according to Smith Travel Research (STR), a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics, U.S. hotels continue to witness robust improvement across all metrics. However, the report revealed that occupancy rate will decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in 2019 due to rise in demand post hurricane in 2017. Despite this, the industry will continue to report record performance due to robust industry fundamental.Decline in International Travel a ConcernFall in international travel in the recent times has been a major concern for the U.S. lodging industry. Moreover, negative sentiment related to traveling to and from the United States, given Trump administration’s stringent policies on immigration and tourism visas,is detrimental to hotels. If the U.S. dollar gains strength, this may keep industry growth in check, given its impact on inbound international travel.Additionally, higher costs and increased supply along with pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown are likely to be headwinds.Meanwhile, hotel companies have been focusing on renovation, and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers. However, steep costs incurred by leading hotel companies to do so are taking a toll on profits. High labor costs will continue to be a major concern for hoteliers. In fact, online travel agents like Booking.com (BKNG  -  Free Report), Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) and TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) are also limiting the pricing power of these brands.Another major threat comes from home-sharing companies like Airbnb, Inc., which offer digital service, allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations. With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with, these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) and Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report). Both companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Catalysts Driving GrowthThe hotel industry is particularly vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of economic conditions. So the present solid economic fundamentals are likely to spur consumer spending in the remainder of 2018, raising optimism for hotel companies. Moreover, hotel companies will be able to counter any economic volatility better, if they keep moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services.Also, these companies must look for ways to sustain their growth as online private accommodation aggregators flood the marketplace with new inventory. In fact, Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. was viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home-sharing companies. Other hotel chains like Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corp. WYN are also investing in home-sharing start-ups to combat Airbnb.So far in 2018, the hotel industry has proved to be resilient amid marketplace shift. Going forward, the industry is likely to witness continued success.Thus, as hotel companies strive to enhance value and competitiveness, industry-best practices such as sustainability, brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking – especially among millennials – will remain priorities. Focused investment in infrastructure to attract business and leisure travelers will also hold the key to growth.Valuation PictureLooking at the industry’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization), the space’s valuation picture remains a bit stretched. The industry is currently trading at 16.81X trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA. Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 22.62X and as low as 10.8X, with a median of 13.95X. The S&P 500 Index is currently at 11.54X trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA, with the broader index’s five-year high, low and median at 12.67X, 7.49X, and 9.8 X, respectively.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, hotel companies are broadly grouped in the Consumer Discretionary sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).We rank 255 industries into 16 Zacks sectors based on earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our X industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).In fact, our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much. The Zacks Industry Rank for Hotels & Motels industry is currently #212 (Bottom 17%).The ranking is available on the Zacks Industry Rank page.Earnings TrendsThe Hotels & Motels industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.If we look at the overall results of the sector, per the latest report, earnings have grown 15.2% in the first quarter while total revenues are up 6%.Meanwhile, for the second quarter, revenues are expected to rise 6%, and earnings are projected to record a gain of 8.2%. For 2018, while revenues are expected to rise 5.8%, earnings are anticipated to increase 12%.For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trend report. ConclusionThe U.S. hotel industry has been benefiting from several factors like a strong economy, higher income, increased consumer confidence and a strong labor market. As people are steadfast on spending time with loved ones and keep looking for unique experiences at all price points, companies in the space believe that their diverse portfolio of offerings can continue to deliver on this growing demand.The U.S. economy expanded at a pace of 2.3% in the first quarter, above the consensus estimate. However, it represents a decline from 3% witnessed in the last three quarters of 2017. While declines were felt across all components, consumer spending declined significantly after strong gains in the fourth quarter of 2017.This may appear to be a concern at the first glance but first-quarter figures have been dismal in recent years due to statistical and weather-related issues. Other consumer-related indicators are on the rise, which means that consumer spending should pick up in the rest of the year. Investing in consumer discretionary stocks looks like a smart option at this point. Further, the U.S. economy is expected to expand at a 4% annualized rate in the second quarter, per the latest forecast by Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow.Thus, we see no reason why the industry should not continue to enjoy gains on both the top and bottom lines in the near-to-middle term, especially when the unemployment rate is at a 18-year low and wages are growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

532,BKNG,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 1.4% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is BKNG due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Booking Holdings (BKNG  -  Free Report) Beats on Q1 Earnings & RevenuesBooking Holdings reported better-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2018.Non-GAAP net earnings of $12 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $1.38. Earnings increased 22% year over year but decreased 29% sequentially.Revenues of $2.93 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.87 billion. Also, revenues were up 4.5% sequentially and 21% from the prior-year quarter.On a year-over-year basis, both the agency and merchant business showed strong momentum. Room nights, Rental cars and airline tickets, all performed impressively. On the call, management stated that the company will continue to focus on investments in people, systems and marketing with a long-term outlook.Overall, we remain positive about the secular growth trend in the online travel booking market, Booking Holdings’ strong position in the international markets, growth opportunities in the domestic market, good execution, prudent marketing strategy and strong financial position.However, weaker average daily rates for accommodations (ADR), macro headwinds, the increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax-related litigation remain overhangs.Let’s check out the numbers.Revenues in DetailsBooking Holdings generates bulk of its revenues from the international markets where the agency model is more popular. This is reflected in the merchant/agency split of revenues, which was 18/73% in the fourth quarter (previous quarter split was (19/74%).Merchant revenues were up 3.5% sequentially and19.1% year over year. Agency revenues increased 2% sequentially and 18.4% from the year-ago quarter.Advertising & Other revenues were up 30% sequentially and 50.2% from the last year. These are basically non inter-company revenues from Kayak and OpenTable.On a year-over-year basis, room nights volumes increased 13.2%. Also, rental car days increased 18.7% and airline tickets were up 1.9%.Booking Holdings’ room night growth is attributable to geographically diverse inventory and brand recognition that tend to balance out macro uncertainties related to any one market, as well as growing competition from the local and international players.BookingsBooking Holdings’ overall bookings were up 20.9% (12% in constant currency) from the year-ago quarter and above management’s guided range.Merchant bookings were up 74.1% from the prior-year quarter and agency bookings increased 13.4% from the year-ago levels.Margins and Net IncomeOwing to the nature of business and mix of agency versus merchant revenues, management usually uses gross profit dollars rather than margin to gauge performance during any quarter. Booking Holdings’ gross profit dollars were up 6% sequentially and 25.2% (18% in constant currency) from the last year.Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $798.2 million, up 25.7% from the year-ago quarter.Booking Holdings’ operating income was up 31.2% year over year. Operating margin of 24.9% was up 190 bps from the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetBooking Holdings ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $6.9 billion compared with $7.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. As of Mar 31, 2018, Booking Holdings generated $640.4 billion of cash from operations. It spent around $132 million on capex. Free cash flow in the quarter was $508.4 million.At quarter-end, Booking Holdings had $8 billion of long-term debt.GuidanceFor the second quarter of 2018, Booking Holdings expects room nights booked to grow 7-11% and total gross bookings to increase 10-14% year over year (5-9% on a constant currency basis).The company expects adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1,085-$1,125 million.Pro-forma EPS is expected to come in the range of $16.35-$17.00. GAAP EPS is expected within $15.50-$16.15.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

533,BKNG,"U.S. airlines are anticipating the best summer travel season ever in 2018, with 246 million passengers expected to take to the skies between June 1st and August 31st, beating the previous record of 237 million passengers set in 2017. A strong economy is fueling the boom as Americans can increasingly afford to travel afar on Summer vacations, although lower airfares and higher fuel costs will likely dampen the effects on net earnings for air carriers.Hotels, restaurants and car rentals would also logically enjoy the upswing, after all, after travelers arrive at their destinations, they have to get around, stay somewhere and eat, though labor and commodity costs threaten earnings in those sectors, too.What if there was a single investment that would benefit from the rise in bookings, but was not subject to the rising costs in the travel and entertainment industry? There is.Buy the MiddlemanTravel booking sites provide one-stop shopping for consumers by aggregating millions of price quotes and providing reservation and referral services, collecting a small percentage on each transaction. They benefit from the increase in activity, regardless of the earnings of their partners.But there are so many of these sites – as evidenced by the massive volume of television and online advertising we see every day – that it would be hard to pick the winners out of a huge crowd, right?Not really.Expedia, Hotels.com, HomeAway, Trivago, Orbitz, hotwire, CarRentals.com, TripAdvisor, VacationHomeRentals.com,  Booking.com, Priceline, Kayak, RentalCars.com and OpenTable are all divisions or subsidiaries of just three publicly traded companies. So are dozens of other lesser known sites operating in the U.S. and around the globe.Expedia Group Inc (EXPE  -  Free Report) has been growing its business through a network of majority owned subsidiaries including over a million bookable vacation listings and airline, car rental and cruise reservations.  Notable brands include Expedia, Orbitz, Hotels.com and Trivago.After a Q1 earnings beat, Expedia shares are up 20% from their February lows. The company trades at a 12 month forward P/E Ratio of 30X, which - while high for the market as a whole – is considerably lower than the Electronic Commerce Industry at 56.7X. Expedia’s Price to Sales Ratio is just 1.8X versus 7.2X for the industry.The Zacks Consensus estimate for earnings in Q3 and full year 2018 are now 30% and 22% higher than 2017 results. Expedia Group is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Spun off from Expedia in 2011, TripAdvisor Inc (TRIP  -  Free Report) operates the popular TripAdvisor site as well as 24 other brands all over the globe, including China.  Also performing strongly after unexpected strong Q1 earnings, TRIP shares are up 44% since the report on May 8th.Recent analyst upgrades have been a tailwind for the company which is now expected to earn $1.30/share in 2018, up from $1.15/share just 30 days ago and 30% higher than 2017. TripAdvisor is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Booking Holdings (BKNG  -  Free Report) - Formerly the Priceline Group (until a name change in February) - is comprised of Booking.com, Priceline.com, Kayak, RentalCars.com and the popular restaurant reservation service OpenTable.Since acquiring Booking.com in 2006, shares in the company have risen from the mid-$20s to a recent high of $22.28/share.  BKNG has the revenues and earnings to match the high price however, with expected sales in 2018 of $14.6B and earnings of $88.84/share. This values BKNG at an industry low forward P/E ratio of just 24.4X.  Booking Holdings is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In a recently hot market like travel reservations, it can pay to look past the obvious providers to the companies that provide services customers demand and get paid handsomely for it. These travel reservation sites all fit the bill.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

534,BKNG,"Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2018.Non-GAAP net earnings of $12 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $1.38. Earnings increased 22% year over year but declined 29% sequentially.Revenues of $2.93 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.87 billion. Also, revenues were up 4.5% sequentially and 21% from the prior-year quarter.On a year-over-year basis, both the agency and merchant business showed strong momentum. Room nights, Rental cars and airline tickets, all performed impressively. On the call, management stated that the company will continue to focus on investments in people, systems and marketing with a long-term outlook.Despite strong results, share price declined more than 7% in after-hours trading due to weaker-than-expected earnings guidance for the second quarter.Overall, we remain positive about the secular growth trend in the online travel booking market, Booking Holdings’ strong position in the international markets, growth opportunities in the domestic market, good execution, prudent marketing strategy and strong financial position.However, weaker average daily rates for accommodations (ADR), macro headwinds, the increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax-related litigation remain overhangs. In a year’s time, the stock has surged 19.7%, underperforming the industry’s gain of 49.2%. Let’s check out the numbers.Revenues in DetailsBooking Holdings generates bulk of its revenues from the international markets where the agency model is more popular. This is reflected in the merchant/agency split of revenues, which was 18/73% in the fourth quarter (previous quarter split was (19/74%).Merchant revenues were up 3.5% sequentially and19.1% year over year. Agency revenues increased 2% sequentially and 18.4% from the year-ago quarter.Advertising & Other revenues were up 30% sequentially and 50.2% from the last year. These are basically non inter-company revenues from Kayak and OpenTable.On a year-over-year basis, room nights volumes increased 13.2%. Also, rental car days increased 18.7% and airline tickets were up 1.9%.Booking Holdings’ room night growth is attributable to geographically diverse inventory and brand recognition that tend to balance out macro uncertainties related to any one market, as well as growing competition from the local and international players.Bookings Booking Holdings’ overall bookings were up 20.9% (12% in constant currency) from the year-ago quarter and above management’s guided range.Merchant bookings were up 74.1% from the prior-year quarter and agency bookings increased 13.4% from the year-ago levels.Margins and Net IncomeOwing to the nature of business and mix of agency versus merchant revenues, management usually uses gross profit dollars rather than margin to gauge performance during any quarter. Booking Holdings’ gross profit dollars were up 6% sequentially and 25.2% (18% in constant currency) from the last year.Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $798.2 million, up 25.7% from the year-ago quarter.Booking Holdings’ operating income was up 31.2% year over year. Operating margin of 24.9% was up 190 bps from the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetBooking Holdings ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $6.9 billion compared with $7.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.

Free cash flow in the quarter was $508.4 million.At quarter-end, Booking Holdings had $8 billion of long-term debt.GuidanceFor the second quarter of 2018, Booking Holdings expects room nights booked to grow 7-11% and total gross bookings to increase 10-14% year over year (5-9% on a constant currency basis).The company expects adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1,085-$1,125 million.Pro-forma EPS is expected to come in the range of $16.35-$17.00.

In the last reported quarter, the online travel company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 19.41%.The surprise history has been impressive in Booking Holdings’ case.

We expect agency revenues to increase in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by strength across all its platforms.Agoda and Rental Cars to Boost Merchant RevenuesIn the to-be-reported quarter, merchant revenues are also expected to grow, driven by strength across agoda.com and rentalcars.com. While agoda.com is likely to benefit from discounting in markets, rentalcars.com is expected to ride on continuous operational improvements.In the fourth quarter, merchant revenues were down 25.7% sequentially but up 15.6% year over year.Strong Room Night GrowthAlso, room night growth is expected to improve in the quarter to be reported, driven by diverse inventory and brand recognition that tend to balance out macro uncertainties related to any one market, as well as growing competition from local and international players.In the last reported quarter, room nights volume increased 16.8% on a year-over-year basis. Also, rental car days increased 5.4% and airline tickets were up 3.1% from the year-ago quarter.For the soon-to-be-reported quarter, Booking Holdings expects room nights booked to grow 8-12% and total gross bookings to increase 14.5-18.5% year over year (6-10% on a constant currency basis).

538,BKNG,"The Electronic Commerce, or e-commerce, industry is one of the most developing sectors of the economy. The industry is evolving very rapidly, so data collection and evaluation are particularly difficult. Consequently, one has to rely largely on surveys by both government and private agencies.
"
539,BKNG,"According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the manufacturing sector is the largest contributor to e-commerce sales (42% of their total shipments), followed by merchant wholesalers (23.4% of their total sales). These two segments make up the business-to-business category.
"
540,BKNG,"Retailers and service providers generated just 4.0% and 2.3%, respectively of their revenues online, a slightly higher percentage than they were in the prior year. The Bureau categorizes these two segments as business-to-consumer.
"
541,BKNG,"The business-to-business category makes up 91% of total e-commerce sales, with the balance coming from the business-to-consumer category. The fastest-growing segments were manufacturing and services. [All the above data from the U.S. Census Bureau relate to 2009, as published in May 2011.]Key Drivers
"
542,BKNG,"Since the industry is in evolution, the drivers are varying, or changing flavor. For instance, the initial push came from the time savings and convenience of online transactions. To this were added the benefits of comparison shopping and personal recommendations. As technology required for personalized recommendations developed, it became more available and its benefits more evident, most e-tailers started adding the feature until it is now considered a must-have.
"
543,BKNG,"Today, the biggest driver of growth in the industry is the adoption of smartphones, tablets and other mobile Internet devices (MIDs). According to comScore, 31% of U.S. mobile phone subscribers are already using smartphones to connect to the Internet. With just under a million of the devices selling every week, it is not surprising that people visiting an online store from their smartphone increased 90% from March 2010 to March 2011.
"
544,BKNG,"The advent of tablets brought another wave of change, as the larger screens offered better visibility of online stores and merchandise, thus facilitating purchases. The e-tailing group has reported that 68% of tablet owners surveyed made an online purchase, compared to 48% of smartphone users. Moreover, only 22% of tablet owners did not make a single purchase compared to 36% of smartphone users. The shopping experience on tablets appears to be more satisfactory than on smartphones.
"
545,BKNG,"Books and magazines, clothing and accessories, digital books and tickets are the hottest-selling items on MIDs.
"
546,BKNG,"Consumer electronic goods are leading the way in U.S. e-commerce sales, according to comScore, with around 50% of all computers and 30% of all consumer electronic goods being purchased online. This is in line with what one of the leading consumer electronics retailers Best Buy Co (BBY  -  Free Report) reported in the last quarter (1.8% decline in total revenue compared to an 11% increase in domestic online sales).Wal-Mart Stores (WMT  -  Free Report) also stated that its online business was growing strongly, with both traffic and order sizes picking up. It also stated that consumer electronics was an important category. Other packaged goods, such as soap and groceries grew 10% from 2009 to 2010, according to comScore.
"
547,BKNG,"Wal-Mart’s U.K. wing, ASDA, saw online grocery and general merchandise sales growing 20.8% in the last quarter over the prior year, while its online general merchandise business in Brazil grew 41.1%, indicating that the online opportunity in international markets is also significant.
"
548,BKNG,"Another area moving very rapidly to an online model is entertainment (in the form of books, music, video and games). Since reading books, listening to music, watching video and playing games can be done using the device connecting to the Internet, the barriers to direct consumption are rapidly evaporating. Therefore, previously unconnected electronic goods, such as TVs and game consoles are now being modified to enable connectivity.
"
549,BKNG,"On the other side of the fence, online versions of books, music, video and games that could be downloaded and consumed on a traditional computer or any other connected device are becoming available. Since the shift in consumption patterns is resulting in multi-functional electronic gadgets that are no longer optimized for a particular activity, there is a great drive to develop technologies that could improve the quality of each experience.e-Tail Strategies
"
550,BKNG,"The changing environment where consumers are increasingly connected have prompted retailers to develop new sales strategies. While many of the big traditional retailers and companies with well-known brands have opened their own online stores, others (including many smaller players) are increasingly tying up with websites like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report), Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN), Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report).
"
551,BKNG,"One of the most recent developments in the e-tailing sphere is the sale of discount coupons, where Groupon appears to be the forerunner. Groupon and its closest rival LivingSocial offer discount coupons with a very low shelf life from local players looking for sales. The company offers huge discounts to attract buyers and collects a percentage of the sales thus generated.
"
552,BKNG,"This kind of business is very competitive since it has very low barriers to entry. As a result, not just Amazon and Google, but also a host of other much smaller parties have started doing business in this format. Technology investments are also required in order to serve customer needs effectively. It is expected that Groupon’s recently-announced IPO would enable the company to invest in the business as necessary.
"
553,BKNG,"Another concept that has come up recently can best be termed social marketing. This is a concept being tried out by Facebook, one of the most popular social networking sites in the world. Forrester Research estimates that over 50% of the U.S. population has a Facebook account, and this is the potential that the platform will initially address.
"
554,BKNG,"SocialStore, as it is called, uses MarketLive's Intelligent Commerce Platform that enables marketers to display product information, promotions/discounts, shopping carts and check-out options. Both comparative shopping and comparative pricing are possible. The basic advantages of the system that are currently being touted are that it allows easy brand building, creates meaningful commercial relationships and makes use of account-holders’ social connections to attract new buyers.Retail e-Commerce
"
555,BKNG,"ComScore has provided first quarter retail ecommerce sales numbers. The firm estimates that sales increased 12% from the first quarter of 2010, representing the second straight quarter of double-digit growth and the sixth straight quarter of positive growth.
"
556,BKNG,"Moreover, the unadjusted figures from the U.S. Commerce Department puts total retail sales in the first quarter of this year 1.2% higher than during the first quarter of 2008 (pre-recession), compared to e-retail sales growth of 26.3% during the same time period.
"
557,BKNG,"ComScore also stated that the number of buyers increased 7%, the transactions per buyer increased 9% and the value per transaction declined 4%. The data validates our theory that there were a larger number of mobile transactions for lower-value items.
"
558,BKNG,"Forrester Research believes that rapid growth in online retail sales in the U.S. will continue to come at the expense of brick-and-mortar outfits. ComScore adds that this increase is mainly on account of the lower prices and convenience of online transactions.
"
559,BKNG,"It also stated that high gas prices and a persistently high level of unemployment were driving consumers to increase their online purchases. It is therefore expected that online sales would suffer only slightly even if prices were to go up further.
"
560,BKNG,"Free shipping remains a major lure, with ComScore estimating that 61% of customers were somewhat likely to cancel their purchases in its absence. Overall, 47% of purchases in the last quarter included free shipping, compared to 49% in the previous quarter (which was also the holiday season).
"
561,BKNG,"Total retail e-commerce is currently 8.6% of total retail sales, according to ComScore. Forrester Research estimates that this share will go up to 11% by 2015. 2011 is expected to see a 12% growth in the U.S. and a 13% growth in Europe.Travel
"
562,BKNG,"The U.S. Commerce Department expects the overall travel market to grow at an average rate of 6-8% from 2010 to 2016, with China, South Korea, Brazil, Russia and India, in that order, expected to be the largest contributors. All of these countries, with the exception of India, are expected to grow at triple-digit rates, while India is expected to grow at just under a triple-digit rate. Travel and tourism is one of the country’s strongest industries, contributing a trade surplus in each of the last 20 years.
"
563,BKNG,"According to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the improving economy will result in a 3.2% increase in demand for hotel reservations, which along with a 0.6% increase in hotel supply will lead to higher occupancy rates (59% expected in 2011 compared to 57.6% in 2010). This will also raise hotel rates by 5.1%.
"
564,BKNG,"According to eMarketer estimates, US online sales of leisure and unmanaged business travel will increase 8.5% this year. eMarketer believes that the increase in spending is mainly on account of higher airfares, hotel rates and ancillary fees, which increase the aggregate dollar amount of online bookings. Booking through mobile devices is expected to grow significantly, with 11.8 million new users.
"
565,BKNG,"However, another report by PhocusWright mentioned that when online penetration of the travel market reached 35% in any country, growth rates were likely to slow down to single-digits. The research firm mentioned that only the U.S., U.K. and Scandinavia had reached this level of penetration and most other markets across Europe, Asia and Latin America would continue to show good growth rates.Payment Systems
"
566,BKNG,"The most recent development in payment systems is Google Inc’s (GOOG) digital wallet, which allows a customer to make a payment by waving his mobile phone over a POS terminal. While the near-field communication (NFC) technology used in the system is already in use in some parts of Europe, the concept is relatively new to the U.S. Other than convenience, the main attraction being highlighted is the security of the payment channel, since neither the customer nor the retailer would be recording the personal information related to the customer.
"
567,BKNG,"Adoption of the device, although it is a ways off, will have a remarkable effect on the volume and value of mobile transactions, since it should increase the percentage of higher-value sales through the mobile platform.
"
568,BKNG,"The digital wallet is a great improvement over eBay’s (EBAY  -  Free Report) existing payment system, Paypal, which takes away a significant percentage of earnings from the retailer or person providing the service. Moreover, although the system is itself secure, there is always a security risk for a buyer not used to dealing with Paypal, since it requires that you provide personal information.
"
569,BKNG,"Traditional payment systems (from banks) also realize that people are now spending more time online and have therefore stepped up their investments in related IT. The results of a survey by the American Bankers Association (ABA) show that U.S. consumers are increasingly going online.
"
570,BKNG,"More than 35% of consumers questioned in the middle of 2010 felt that the Internet method of banking was their most preferred, a significant increase from 2009, when 25% felt that the Internet was their most-used method. Moreover, Internet banking is the most preferred for age groups below 55 and the second-most preferred for age groups above that. Preference for ATMs continues to decline.
"
571,BKNG,"eMarketer reported that a Novantas study showed a similar shift in customer preferences. According to that study, the percentage of customers transferring funds online went from 34% in 2005 to 67% in 2010, product research through the Internet went from 46% to 77%, while balance checking went from 44% to 76%. However, according to an Emphatica study, mobile banking has not picked up sufficiently in either the U.S. or Canada, due to security-related concerns.Security
"
572,BKNG,"With online transactions expected to boom over the next few years, the top-most concern remains security. While banks will spend significantly on secure payment systems, hackers are expected to have a field day, largely targeting the flood of customers going online. The recent data breach at Citibank, a part of Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), is testimony of this fact.
"
573,BKNG,"Alternative payment systems will continue to gain popularity. While some of these payment systems, such as eBay’s PayPal have been around for awhile, other systems such as Google’s digital wallet are still in the making. Alternative payment systems never really gained momentum in the past because of the low volume of transactions. However, as online transactions continue to increase, many more such systems could suddenly become more available.
"
574,BKNG,"We expect mobile security to become a major focus area for technology companies, since this is the stumbling block to payments through the mobile platform (currently just 2% of U.S. online spending). Additionally, hackers continue to multiply and data breaching has become commonplace.Online Advertising
"
575,BKNG,"The U.S. online advertising market has seen some very strong growth in the past few years, despite the recession that impacted the entire economy. eMarketer estimates that the market will grow 20.2% in 2011 to $31.3 billion, compared to the 14.9% growth witnessed in 2010.
"
576,BKNG,"However, growth rates are expected to drop over the next few years: 17.6% in 2012, 12.0% in 2013, 10.4% in 2014 and 8.8% in 2015. Falling growth rates notwithstanding, the share of online ad spending in total ad spending is expected to increase from 20% this year to 28% in 2015. By contrast, TV ad spending is expected to remain steady at around 38% throughout.
"
577,BKNG,"The current strength in online advertising is coming primarily from the growing popularity of the display format. Of all the forms of online advertising, display (including video, banner ads, rich media and sponsorships) is expected to see the strongest growth over the next few years, overtaking search by 2015. It is already pretty close on the heels of search ($9.91 billion in 2010 compared to $12.0 billion for search).
"
578,BKNG,"The lower pricing of video and banner ads has made them popular with brand advertisers, so ad inventories are solid. eMarketer expects that 39.4% of ad budgets will be devoted to branding in 2011, fueling growth in display ads. Facebook is also expected to have a significant impact.
"
579,BKNG,"The underlying drivers of growth are the continued increase in the number of users, greater propensity of users to consume online, a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the push into display advertising.
"
580,BKNG,"Search advertising is expected to remain popular, however, because results are measurable, and therefore, more predictable than other media. This also makes the market more resilient in recessionary conditions, since advertisers are more confident about the results of their spending.OPPORTUNITIES
"
581,BKNG,"We can strongly recommend very few stocks in the sector right at this point. However, slightly longer-term opportunities abound, as have been outlined below.
"
582,BKNG,"Online travel companies, such as Expedia Inc (EXPE  -  Free Report) and Priceline.com (PCLN) are in a strong growth market. Consequently, they should continue to benefit from international expansion and customers moving online.
"
583,BKNG,"Domestic growth will likely be slower and mainly driven by the continued improvement in the economy. While Orbitz Worldwide (OWW) is a much smaller player with more limited resources, it too should benefit from these trends.
"
584,BKNG,"However, China will be disappointing, as local players and the government continue to make operations difficult for U.S. players. Occupancy tax issues are likely to remain a point of contention and online travel agents appear to be fighting a losing battle.
"
585,BKNG,"As far as e-tailers go, the foremost remain Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report). Amazon’s opex has been on the rise and likely to remain high through the year, as the company invests to take growth to the next level.
"
586,BKNG,"Although estimates have been going down and earnings growth is likely to be limited in 2011, we believe the company remains one of the most attractive long-term investments, with a solid growth strategy and good prospects both nationally and internationally.
"
587,BKNG,"The search market is dominated by Google Inc (GOOG), which has seen phenomenal growth rates over the last five years. The company is a leading innovator, using its engineering talent to extend its position in the computing platform to the mobile platform. The company has a huge cash balance that we were concerned was not being put to the best use.
"
588,BKNG,"However, it remains acquisitive, which should further round out its product portfolio, build on current strengths and help expansion into new areas. Google’s main challenge is the increasing competition from not just archrival Yahoo Inc (YHOO), but also challenger Microsoft Corp (MSFT), who’s Bing search engine continues to gain ground in the U.S.
"
589,BKNG,"A much smaller provider of Internet advertising solutions and online marketing services, ValueClick Inc. (VCLK) should also benefit from the strength in the online advertising market (particularly display), international expansion, restructuring actions and strong cash flows. However, as firms with larger advertising budgets increase spending on Internet advertising, many of the services performed by ValueClick could be done in-house. This is a risk of investing in the stock.WEAKNESSES
"
590,BKNG,"E-tailer eBay continues to play catch-up with Amazon. The company is undergoing a metamorphosis, with a new image, new strategies and technology investments. We expect eBay’s results to improve going forward, driven by its Paypal payment platform. However, Amazon remains the better play, in our opinion.
"
591,BKNG,"Meanwhile, competition continues to intensify for Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report), which provides distributed e-business infrastructure services and solutions. The low barriers to entry are also a concern, since this is a market adjacency that any large Internet or networking company could venture into. Falling bandwidth prices are a pressure on margins, while rising bandwidth costs are attracting new players. However, broadband penetration and momentum in online media and entertainment remain tailwinds.Yahoo! (YHOO) is second only to Google in the search market, although the company has not seen much gain in market share. Management remains focused on the display segment, which should pay dividends if projections for that market hold good. 
"
592,BKNG,"Yahoo has a leading position in email applications and is building on this position through acquisitions and upgrades, which should ultimately help it turn around. However, monetization of the search alliance with Microsoft remains behind schedule and there is some controversy related to its Asian assets, which are the main attraction in the shares.
"
593,BKNG,"Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) recently reported third quarter results that beat big for the fourth consecutive quarter. Analysts expect earnings growth of 35.34% in 2009.
"
594,BKNG,"Priceline.com provides online travel services in 78 countries in 29 different languages. The company owns several web sites including booking.com, which offers over 73,000 participating hotels to customers worldwide, priceline.com and Agoda.com, which handles the Asian online hotel reservation business.Gross Travel Bookings Jump 32.8% in the Third Quarter 
"
595,BKNG,"On Nov 9, Priceline.com reported its third quarter results and easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 30.19%. Earnings per share were $3.45 compared to the Zacks Consensus of $2.65. The company reported $1.74 in the year ago period.
"
596,BKNG,"Gross travel bookings rose 32.8% to $2.7 billion compared to the year ago period.  Revenues also climbed by 30.1% to $730.7 million. The international segment continued to see growth, contributing $316.9 million to the quarter, a 41.7% increase over a year ago.
"
597,BKNG,"The company saw a strong summer travel season and growth rates picked up quarter over quarter in both the international and domestic segments. The overall online travel industry also saw improvement year-over-year as there were fee reductions and supplier discounting in the industry.Fourth Quarter Outlook
"
598,BKNG,"The company is projecting revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 24% to 28% which isn't surprising given the downturn in travel in the fourth quarter of 2008. Total gross travel bookings are expected to jump 30% to 40%.
"
599,BKNG,"Analysts are moving to revise their estimates. The fourth quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate is up 12 cents to $1.33 in the past week with 4 out of 9 analysts revising in that time.
"
600,BKNG,"For 2009, estimates are up 30 cents to $6.89 with only 2 analysts raising in the last 7 days. Analysts are also bullish on 2010, as the Zacks Consensus has jumped almost 8% in the last week to $8.47 from $7.86. That is year over year earnings growth of 22.97%.The 5-Year Chart
"
601,BKNG,"Priceline.com, a Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stock, has been on fire in recent months and is now trading at a multi-year high last seen during the end of the dot-com boom. You can see the 5-year chart below.

"
711,BKNG,"Today I want to talk about moving averages.  
"
712,BKNG,"I wrote about this earlier in the year, but thought a quick review would be in order since so many people are talking about the 200-day moving average on TV and in the newspapers, and whether the stock market can get thru it or not.  
"
713,BKNG,"First off, moving averages would fall under the heading of 'technical analysis'. But you don't have to be a technician to use them. They're pretty plain and simple and very straight forward.  
"
714,BKNG,"Even though the market is making a nice comeback, it has been in a brutal downtrend over the last year and a half.  
"
715,BKNG,"But we're at an inflection point where the market seems to be getting ready to breakout even higher - or hit a wall and turn around.  
"
716,BKNG,"And that's where all of this 200-day moving average talk comes into play. Long-Term and Short-Term Moving Averages
"
717,BKNG,"Short-term moving averages help gauge the short term direction of the market while longer-term moving averages take a bigger picture view.  
"
718,BKNG,"The 200-day moving average would be a longer-term moving average.  
"
719,BKNG,"In general, if a stock breaks the 200-day moving average on its way down, that's generally thought to be bearish, and the longer-term trend could be turning lower.  
"
720,BKNG,"Tons of stocks did this in 2008.   
"
721,BKNG,"The 200-day moving average can also act as support. If a stock comes down, but stops at the major moving average and then starts moving higher from there, it can act as a firm underpinning of support for the stock. Kind of like a moving trendline.  
"
722,BKNG,"And just like breaking the 200-day moving average on the way down can often times signal a downtrend, an upside breakout thru the 200-day moving average can often times signal the beginning of a new uptrend for a stock.  
"
723,BKNG,"The 50-day moving average can be quite useful as well. It's more of an intermediate snapshot of the price trend and is more sensitive than the longer-term 200 day.  
"
724,BKNG,"A rising moving average with the price trading above it is bullish while a descending moving average with the price trading below it is bearish.  
"
725,BKNG,"And even shorter term signals can be seen with the 10- and 20-day moving averages.  
"
726,BKNG,"Moving average crossovers can also be valuable. When the quicker moving average (10-day for example) is above the slower moving average (20-day), this is thought to be bullish. Likewise, when the shorter-term is trading below the longer-term moving average, this is thought to be bearish.  
"
727,BKNG,"Currently, the Nasdaq is trading above the 200-day moving average, the S&P 500 just poked thru there the other day and the Dow Jones just touched the underside of it on Monday. (See below.) 
"
728,BKNG,"What does this mean?  
"
729,BKNG,"It means that the market will be looking at the indexes very closely to see if the 200-day moving average acts as resistance or support.  
"
730,BKNG,"If the markets can stay above the 200-day; chartists, technicians, skeptics and the like will look at this as the confirmation they need to believe the market is shedding its long-term downtrend and potentially beginning a new leg up.  
"
731,BKNG,"But whether the market breaks thru the 200-day moving average or not, there are plenty of stocks already trading above it and many more breaking thru (up or down) every day.  
"
732,BKNG,"And finding these kinds of stocks is easy to do with a stock screener.  
"
733,BKNG,"Of course, moving averages alone don't tell the whole story. But a company with solid fundamentals, while also trading above these momentum indicators, can help you find stocks in confirmed uptrends.

"
765,BKNG,"From November 20, 2008 to January 6, 2009, the S&P Retail Index [RLX] rose 41%. Not a bad move for a group of stocks that had one of the worst holiday shopping seasons in recent memory. It appears that investors became more bullish on retailers because of seemingly cheap valuations, anticipated benefits from a federal government stimulus package, and a better economy in the second half of 2009.
"
766,BKNG,"In our view, the 50-day upward move in retail stocks was a bear-market rally. Investors should begin to lighten up on exposure to retail stocks. We expect the group to give back those gains as it becomes apparent that many retail stocks are not cheap, that the stimulus will provide at best a short-term boost, and the economy will not turn until 2010.
"
767,BKNG,"Our negative view of the group is based on the awful 2008 holiday season, a reduction of leverage in the financial system and, most importantly, consumer attitudes shifting away from borrowing to make discretionary purchases. These factors all point to continued pressure on consumer spending.
"
768,BKNG,"As a result, we believe that consumer and retailer trends that began in 2008 will continue throughout 2009. Consumers will focus their spending on necessary items such as food, clothing, and staples. Discretionary purchases will be made when items are significantly marked down. In turn, retailers will focus on reducing square footage, reducing leverage and reducing inventory. This will lead to further negative earnings estimate revisions for retailers for the next few quarters.   
"
769,BKNG,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
770,BKNG,"We see few opportunities in the near term. That said, investors looking for exposure should focus on retailers with stable revenue and earnings. These include defensive plays including discounters, retailers with debt-free balance sheets, and supermarkets.
"
771,BKNG,"Two stocks we like in this environment are Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report).
"
772,BKNG,"Krogers sales should remain relatively intact. Consumers will still need to shop for groceries even with in a weak economic environment. Kroger is doing a good job of gaining market share by competing on price and selection.
"
773,BKNG,"PetMed Express operates the nationwide pet pharmacy 1800PetMeds.com. The company markets its health products for dogs, cats and horses. PETS revenue is holding up well in this challenging retail environment. The company continues to manage its operating costs, which has enabled the company to produce strong earnings growth.
"
774,BKNG,"Another long-time favorite of ours is GameStop (GME  -  Free Report), which reported blow-out numbers for the holiday season with same-store sales up 10%. The company also increased its EPS guidance for the fourth quarter.
"
775,BKNG,"WEAKNESSES
"
776,BKNG,"We would avoid most names in retail. The stocks that are least attractive in this environment are those companies with levered balance sheets, marginal businesses, or those retailers that rely on the credit markets to buy inventory or sell its merchandise. We have Sell ratings on department stores including JC Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), specialty retailers Cost Plus (CPWM) and Tractor Supply (TSCO  -  Free Report), and e-commerce firms Overstock.com (OSTK  -  Free Report) and Priceline.com (PCLN).
"
777,BKNG,"In last week's edition of Trading Tools, priceline.com (PCLN) was examined, as it appeared on the Zacks Unusually High Option Volume filter. Utilizing the same screener again this week, I stumbled across medical technology mogul Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report). Before we begin, let's explain the contrarian stance that makes Schaeffer's so unique. When searching for a bullish pick, we like to see heavy skepticism toward an outperforming stock, as this leaves ample room for upgrades or other positive catalysts to fuel the stock higher. When searching for a bearish pick, on the other hand, contrarians are looking for significant bullish sentiment toward an underperforming stock, as we believe an excess of optimism is a sign that everyone has already bought into the stock and sideline money is virtually tapped out. 
"
778,BKNG,"However, keep in mind that some optimism and pessimism is genuinely warranted and isn't always a contrarian indicator  like an outperforming stock with many ""buy"" ratings or an underperforming stock with a plethora of ""sell"" ratings. The Unusually High Option Volume Screener
"
779,BKNG,"The filter is somewhat self-explanatory. It looks for stocks with single-day option volume in excess of their average volume over the last month. Why is this important? Simply put, this filter allows us to gauge how options traders feel about a certain stock, and sometimes unusually heavy option activity can be the sign of an event (like earnings or merger-and-acquisition news, for instance) or, occasionally, a reversal of sentiment in the options pits. A Rare Day in the Bears' Lair
"
780,BKNG,"According to the Zacks filter, SYK saw put volume of more than 800 contracts cross the tape during last Wednesday's holiday-shortened session. That's more than twice its average daily volume of fewer than 350 contracts. 
"
781,BKNG,"However, despite Wednesday's bias for bearish bets, it seems options players have been flocking to the bullpen at full speed lately. During the past 10 days on the International Securities Exchange (ISE), SYK has seen almost 17 times as many calls than puts bought to open  an annual optimistic peak for options traders on the ISE.  
"
782,BKNG,"Further underscoring the high hopes among the options crowd is SYK's descending Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR), which measures sentiment among near-term options speculators. After inching lower recently, the stock's SOIR now rests at 0.63, indicating that calls outnumber their put rivals among options slated to expire in less than 3 months. 
"
783,BKNG,"So, with most options players on the bullish bandwagon, why the recent preference for puts? Fundamentally Flat-lining?
"
784,BKNG,"The recent surge in put volume could be as a result of Stryker's recall-related news, which hit the Street early last Wednesday. More specifically, the company recalled 322 ""custom cranial implant kits"" used to correct facial trauma or defects, after the manufacturer determined that it couldn't ensure product sterility.  
"
785,BKNG,"Stryker had launched a voluntary recall of the products a couple of months ago, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) just recently determined the potential for infection a ""class 1"" event (the most serious type of recall, according to the FDA), issuing public notice. 
"
786,BKNG,"The news comes on the heels of other fundamental woes  primarily the company's latest adjustment to its 2008 sales and earnings forecast. On Dec. 19, Stryker slashed its predictions amid ""significant and rapid contraction"" in hospital capital budgets, which wounds the firm's product demand. The medical device maker now expects 2008 revenue growth of 9% to 10%, compared to previous guidance of 11% to 12%. It also predicts fourth-quarter earnings (excluding items) of $2.82 to $2.84 per share, down from $2.88 per share it projected in October. Checking Out the Charts
"
787,BKNG,"Technically speaking, since breaching long-term resistance in the 60-to-62 region in October, the shares of SYK have tumbled roughly 33%. In fact, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 Index (SPX) by more than 15% during the past 40 trading sessions, and is poised to close 2008 on a year-to-date loss of 46%. 
"
788,BKNG,"The equity is now attempting to find a key foothold in the 38-to-40 neighborhood, which played the part of support through 2004  2006. A monthly close beneath this area would place the shares in territory not explored since September 2003. 
"
789,BKNG,"Regardless of the stock's recent fall from grace on the charts, an ample amount of optimism continues to surround SYK. The underperformer still harbors an impressive 10 ""strong buys"" and 1 ""buy"" rating, according to Zacks, compared to an equal number of ""holds"" and no ""sell"" ratings.  The Bottom Line
"
790,BKNG,"Overall, traders will want to keep an eye on the 40 neighborhood; once a form of long-term support, the equity is now attempting to find a familiar foothold here. A monthly close beneath this region could signal additional technical weakness for the shares. 
"
791,BKNG,"Should the stock resume its quest for new lows, the bulls could abandon ship. An unwinding of optimism  whether in the options arena, or via downgrades and/or price-target cuts  could spark a fresh wave of selling pressure on the struggling security. 
"
792,BKNG,"In last week's edition of Trading Tools, financial firm U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) was examined after it made an appearance on the Zacks Unusually High Option Volume filter. Utilizing the same screener again this week, I stumbled across online travel firm priceline.com (PCLN). Before we begin, let's explain the contrarian stance that makes Schaeffer's so unique. When searching for a bullish pick, we like to see heavy skepticism toward an outperforming stock, as this leaves ample room for upgrades or other positive catalysts to fuel the stock higher. When searching for a bearish pick, on the other hand, contrarians are looking for significant bullish sentiment toward an underperforming stock, as we believe an excess of optimism is a sign that everyone has already bought into the stock and sideline money is virtually tapped out.
"
793,BKNG,"However, keep in mind that some optimism and pessimism is genuinely warranted and isn't always a contrarian indicator  like an outperforming stock with many ""buy"" ratings or an underperforming stock with a plethora of ""sell"" ratings.The Unusually High Option Volume Screener
"
794,BKNG,"The filter is somewhat self-explanatory. It looks for stocks with single-day option volume in excess of their average volume over the last month. Why is this important? Simply put, this filter allows us to gauge how options traders feel about a certain stock, and sometimes unusually heavy option activity can be the sign of an event (like earnings or merger-and-acquisition news, for instance) or, occasionally, a reversal of sentiment in the options pits. Swelling Call Volume
"
795,BKNG,"The Zacks filter indicates that PCLN saw call volume of 17,802 contracts cross the tape on Thursday, outpacing its average daily call volume of 2,457 by more than 7 times. 
"
796,BKNG,"Specifically, a trio of options in the January 2009 series attracted the bulk of Thursday's call activity. The 60 call saw volume of 5,030 contracts cross the tape, while another 7,883 contracts changed hands on the 70 strike. The 75 call was also popular, with total volume of 2,718 contracts on Thursday. 
"
797,BKNG,"However, a quick glimpse at these options indicates that the bulk of Thursday's call volume on PCLN consisted of closeouts, rather than the addition of new positions. Open interest on the January 60 strike fell by 2,785 contracts, while 4,242 positions were liquidated at the 70 strike. Only the 75 call saw open interest grow, with 358 new positions in open interest Friday. 
"
798,BKNG,"PCLN closed Thursday at $70.10 after hitting an intraday high of $72.16, so it seems likely that all of the liquidated 60 calls, and many of the 70 calls, could have been closed out for a gain. The elimination of this near-term call open interest could account for a recent uptick in the security's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR); until recently, this indicator was trending lower. What Are Investors Buying to Open?
"
799,BKNG,"While the surge in call volume on Thursday doesn't exactly point to increasing optimism, recent data from the International Securities Exchange (ISE) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) does. During the past 10 days, PCLN has racked up a call/put ratio of 1.46 on the ISE, which ranks higher than 90% of other such readings in the past year.  
"
800,BKNG,"Looking back even further, the equity has garnered a 20-day call/put ratio of 2.95 on the ISE and the CBOE. This combined ratio reveals that traders have purchased nearly 3 times more calls than puts on PCLN during the past 20 trading days. Since this data is based only on buy-to-open transactions, it affords a clear view of option traders' upbeat sentiment. Checking Out the Charts
"
801,BKNG,"So, is PCLN deserving of investors' bullish bets? On the charts, the equity is currently facing a critical technical challenge. The shares have pulled back from their May peak near 145, but recently found a floor at the 45 level. The equity is rebounding from this support, but is now trading just below resistance from its 20-week moving average. 
"
802,BKNG,"If PCLN can find enough buying pressure to muscle atop this trendline, its short-term path higher could be clear. A continued capitulation by short sellers might aid in this effort; short interest fell by 5.9% during the most recent reporting period, as the bears were no doubt spooked by the security's rebound from support. 
"
803,BKNG,"Currently, 19.3% of PCLN's float remains dedicated to short interest. At the stock's average daily volume, it would take more than a week's worth of trading days for all these bearish bets to be repurchased. This configuration indicates that the shares have ample fuel to support a continued rally. The Bottom Line
"
804,BKNG,"Overall, traders will want to keep an eye on priceline.com's 20-week moving average. While the stock appears to be trending higher, this trendline has so far provided a ceiling to the equity's progress last week. Within the next several sessions, it should become clear whether PCLN has the technical muscle to top this resistance, or whether it will shrink away from this hurdle. 
"
805,BKNG,"If the equity clambers atop this moving average, it should encourage short sellers and option players to continue their migration to the stock's bullish bandwagon. This steady influx of buying pressure could lend to additional gains. However, a rejection here could put PCLN's uptrend on hold for the short term. 
"
806,BKNG,"Stocks extended yesterdays trend of closing higher as thin trading continued during the week that is leading up to a holiday weekend. Share prices spiked on a better-than-anticipated gross domestic product (GDP) reading and a dip in jobless claims.
"
807,BKNG,"The Dow advanced by 212.67 points, or 1.85%, on Thursday, closing at 11,715.18. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 19.02 points, or 1.48%, to 1,300.68. The tech-dominated Nasdaq moved up 29.18 points, or 1.22%, to 2,411.64.
"
808,BKNG,"After two difficult quarters, the Commerce Department reported GDP growing at a 3.3% annual rate for the second quarter, the fastest pace in almost a year. The result, which topped analysts expectations of 2.7% and the governments forecasts of 1.9%, was encouraging but is being taken with a grain of salt as most economists believe that the growth will slow down for the rest of the year. Robust exports (due to a weaker dollar) that were primarily responsible for the improved GDP number could tapper off as the global economy slows.          
"
809,BKNG,"The Labor Department announced that the number of individuals seeking unemployment benefits decreased for the third consecutive week to a seasonally adjusted 425,000. The result came in 10,000 below last weeks total and a little lower than analyst expectations of 427,000.  
"
810,BKNG,"Also helping stocks gain ground today was oils decline as the International Energy Agency announced that it would access strategic stockpiles should Tropical Storm Gustav adversely impact energy production in the Gulf of Mexico. 
"
811,BKNG,"Light, sweet crude lost $2.56, settling at $115.59 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
"
812,BKNG,"Natural gas for October delivery slipped as well, by 55.8 cents to settle at $8.05 per million British thermal units in New York. 
"
813,BKNG,"The Focus List
"
814,BKNG,"Our Focus List holdings combined to deliver a gain of 1.36% for the day.
"
815,BKNG,"Thursdays biggest portfolio winner was Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp. (WAB  -  Free Report), which was up 4% on no news. Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) came in second with a 3.56% gain, also on no major developments.
"
816,BKNG,"It is also worth noting that the recently beleaguered Central European Distribution Corp. (CEDC) staged a reversal today, ascending by 2.15%. We have been puzzled by the companys recent declines especially since the conflict between Russia and Georgia has quieted down, and it was nice to see a recovery in this fundamentally strong holding.  
"
817,BKNG,"Only three Focus List stocks turned in losses today, the biggest of which was just half a percent.  
"
818,BKNG,"Portfolio Additions and Deletions
"
819,BKNG,"While not reflected in the above performance figure for Thursday, there were a few additions and one deletion executed in the Focus List.
"
820,BKNG,"We added Edison International (EIX  -  Free Report), which is an electric utility operating in California. We believe the conservative nature of this stock (beta of 0.74 and dividend of about 2.5%) helps to offset some of the economic risk presented by the other recent additions. 
"
821,BKNG,"Flour Corp. (FLR  -  Free Report) was another Focus List addition. The company provides engineering and construction services. We believe this company is a conservative play on the energy sector with a heavy reliance on downstream (e.g. refining) projects. FLR also generates a sizeable amount of revenues from power generation and industrial customers, providing a level of diversification to its customer base.  
"
822,BKNG,"Also added was Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report). We picked up this one to provide exposure to the railroads, an industry that has been gaining market share and successfully exhibiting pricing power. Brokerage analysts have raised both their 2008 and 2009 profit forecasts on KSU within the past 30 days.
"
823,BKNG,"Metalico (MEA) was added as well. The company recycles metal. Though commodity prices have fallen, brokerage analysts remain bullish on MEA's prospects, having raised forecasts for this year and next. We believe the current price factors in the prevailing economic environment and provides an attractive buying opportunity.
"
824,BKNG,"On the deletions side, we removed Priceline.com (PCLN) to lock in nearly a 300% profit. Though we have held this stock since Nov 3, 2005, we are concerned that the current global economic environment has created a situation where the downside risk outweighs potential future rewards.
"
825,BKNG,"Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN), one of the largest on-line travel companies, provides travel services in 21 languages in over 60 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
"
826,BKNG,"The company operates three websites, including Booking.com, an international online hotel reservation service, Priceline.com, a U.S. online travel service which provides travel bargains, and Agoda.com, an Asian hotel reservation service.Priceline.com Beats Wall Street Estimates by 21.57%
"
827,BKNG,"On May 8, Priceline.com reported first-quarter earnings and surprised on estimates by 21.57%, or 11 cents. Earnings per share were 62 cents compared with analysts' estimates of 51 cents.
"
828,BKNG,"While the company saw strong growth in both the U.S. domestic and international markets, with gross travel bookings rising 76% year-over-year to $1.76 billion, it was the international division which set the pace for the quarter. 
"
829,BKNG,"The international business, which comprises Booking.com and Agoda.com, had $1 billion in gross travel bookings, an increase of 100% over the prior year. Even factoring in foreign currency exchange rates, the increase would still have been 75% over 2007. Much of that gain was from Booking.com, which now has 45,000 worldwide hotel partners.
"
830,BKNG,"The quarter wasn't too shabby for the domestic division either, as the company saw gross travel bookings growth of 51%, its highest growth in a single quarter in over three years.Outlook for the Second Quarter and 2008
"
831,BKNG,"The company provided guidance for the second quarter of net income between $1.25 and $1.40 per share. Priceline.com forecasts a 65% to 75% year-over-year increase in gross travel bookings and a year-over-year increase of 80% to 90% in international gross travel bookings.
"
832,BKNG,"For full-year 2008, PCLN said that it expects to generate approximately $7.5 billion to $7.9 billion in gross travel bookings. The company also expects to earn in the range of $5.25 to $5.65 earnings per share.
"
833,BKNG,"Priceline.com, a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy), has beaten estimates four quarters in a row on average of 16.89%. The company has an outstanding five year average return on equity (ROE) of 20.91%. 
"
834,BKNG,"Last week, I expressed optimism about the economy and the equity markets. I also said, however, that we were not yet out of the woods.
"
835,BKNG,"The news over the past few days reinforced my view about being cautiously optimistic.
"
836,BKNG,"There continues to be good earnings from companies with exposure to economic fluctuations, such as Walt Disney (DIS) and Focus List member Priceline.com (PCLN). Productivity was better than expected in the first-quarter. Many retailers reported growth in April sales. More Americans received their stimulus checks. Finally, the aggregate trend in estimate revisions continues to suggest a declining level of pessimism on the part of brokerage analysts.
"
837,BKNG,"On the other hand, oil continued to hit new highs. American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) reminded investors that the credit crunch is hurting earnings. Eduardo Castro-Wright, who oversees Wal-Mart's (WMT  -  Free Report) U.S. stores, observed that ""the 'paycheck cycle' is more pronounced for customers than in past months.""
"
838,BKNG,"Wal-Mart's conference call on Tuesday could be interesting from a standpoint of how stimulus checks are being spent. Although it is still early, WMT could provide insight as to whether consumers are using the money to buy necessities (food, medicine, etc.), if choosing to splurge on discretionary items like flat panel televisions or saving it/paying down debt.
"
839,BKNG,"Keep in mind that revolving consumer debt rose at a 7.9% annual rate in March, according to the Federal Reserve. Soaring gasoline prices and rising food prices are squeezing many consumers. Falling home prices make it harder to depend on home equity lines. For some people, the rebate checks will provide a much needed infusion of cash. But, even among those who need the cash, there is no guarantee that they will make the most fiscally responsible decision on what to do with the stimulus.
"
840,BKNG,"From an economic standpoint, we want the rebate checks to be spent. More money tossed into the economy should help to accelerate growth. Saving the cash or using it to pay down debt would be the smarter move for many people, however. Predicting what consumers will actually do is very difficult, especially given that previous surveys have given conflicting forecasts.
"
841,BKNG,"Going back to the bigger picture, outside of the financial, homebuilding and retail sector, most corporations are continuing to realize growth. The economy did expand in the first-quarter and we expect the pace of growth to accelerate. It may not be the perfect environment, but there are signs that we should begin to see a gradual recovery.
"
842,BKNG,"The major indexes tested their 200-day moving averages, but pulled back. Blame Texas Tea for the failure to move higher.
"
843,BKNG,"I would caution against reading too much into the action of the past few days. Earnings season is coming to an end and the Fed is on hold, which means fewer catalysts over the short-term. I think a lot people are waiting to see if the recovery does kick in.
"
844,BKNG,"Plus, there the risk remains that the recent upward move was nothing more than a bear trap. I think it was signaled the start of a recovery, but in order to be pragmatic, I need to acknowledge both the good and the bad.
"
845,BKNG,"Focus List Updates
"
846,BKNG,"We added four stocks to the portfolio, the most within the span of seven days in quite some time. First-quarter earnings resulted in some new stocks showing up on our screens.
"
847,BKNG,"Central European Distributors (CEDC) is a Polish company that produces vodka. The company gives us exposure to Eastern Europe. We also liked its valuation and the fact that it raised guidance.
"

870,BKNG,"Priceline.com (PCLN) is a travel service that offers leisure airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars, vacation packages, and cruises. The company operates as Priceline.com, rentalcars.com, breezenet.com, and lowestfares.com. The company's Name Your Own Price service (also called its opaque business) offers customers a unique value proposition by allowing them to name their own price for online products/services. In these transactions, Priceline.com determines the price it will accept and has discretion in supplier selection. PCLN's value-add to suppliers is that Priceline.com provides a brand preserving sales service that enables them to sell excess inventory without harming their existing retail pricing structure. Priceline.com also has a more traditional travel sales model that allows customers to choose specific suppliers and inventories. The company was founded in 1997 and went public in March 1999. 
"
871,BKNG,"While Priceline.com may have started as the name your own price service, the company continues to shift its business model away from its original opaque business model to become a more diversified online travel company. Priceline.com's continued shift into retail airline tickets, non-air products (hotels, rental cars, and travel packages), and into Europe should enable the company to produce solid long-term earnings growth. Priceline.com's shift into the retail air ticket sales exposes the company to a much larger market than its opaque business.

885,BKNG,"The bulk of the Q2 earnings season is now behind us, with results from only about 16% of the S&P 500 members still awaited. The Retail sector is the only one at this stage that has a sizable number of reports still to come, with a number of traditional retailers on deck to report results. With another 35 index members reporting results this week, the Q2 earnings season will have come to an end for 91% of S&P 500 members by the end of the week.As we have been saying all along since the start of this reporting cycle, the Q2 earnings season has turned out to be very good. The key positives include broad-based growth reaching double-digit level for the second quarter in a row, record earnings tally, an abundance of positive surprises and favorable trends on the revisions front.We will discuss Q2 results in greater detail below, but let’s focus on what’s coming out this week.Key Earnings Reports for the Week of August 7th   This week brings in results from more than 700 companies, including 35 from the S&P 500 index. There is no shortage of big-name operators coming out with results this week, but we are featuring just a few hereNVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) shares have literally been on fire since the last earnings report on May 9th. The stock was down -3.5% on the year through May 9th, but has been an outstanding performer since that day. Year to date, the stock is now up +57.3%, handily outperforming the Zacks Semiconductor industry’s +17% gain and the broader Zacks Tech sector’s +17.2% gain. The stock has long history of making big moves on earnings releases, though the reaction following the May 9th report was in a league of its own. Estimates for the June quarter initially went up, but have been otherwise stable for the last two months, with the company expected to earn 69 cents on +1.96 billion in revenues, up 56% and +37.1% from the year-earlier period, respectively. NVIDIA is scheduled to report Q2 results after the market’s close on August 10th.Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) shares led the S&P 500 index through April 27th this year, but have been steady underperformers since then. The stock is currently up +3.3% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the +10.5% gain for the S&P 500 index and the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s +14.5% gain. The never ending worry about Disney remains the fate of its ESPN franchise in the current cord-cutting media environment. Disney reports Q2 results after the market’s close on August 8th, with the company expected to come out with $1.53 per share in earnings (down -5.4% from the year-earlier period) on $14.4 billion in revenues (up +1.2%). Estimates have been steadily coming down since the start of the period, with the current $1.53 per share estimate down from $1.69 per share on July 1st.Priceline (PCLN) has been a standout performer this year, with the stock up +38.5% in the year-to-date period vs. +33.7% for Expedia and +47.4% gain for the Zacks e-commerce industry. The stock always responds strongly to the earnings report; it was down big following the last earnings release on May 9th.  The company is scheduled to report Q2 results after the market’s close on August 8th. The online travel leader is expected to report $14.27 in EPS on $3 billion in revenues, which represents year-over-year changes of +10.7% and +17.2%, respectively. Trends in estimate revisions have mostly been negative. TripAdvisor (TRIP) will also report after the market’s close on August 8th.Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and the broader department store space appear to be in an existential struggle. The stock is down -34.7% in the year-to-date period vs. -24.2% decline for the Zacks department store industry. This compares to +10.6% gain for the S&P 500 index and +31.4% gain for Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Driving this underperformance is the industry’s competitive landscape characterized by the secular shift of sales to the online medium that is showing up in falling traffic and same-store sales. The company has been trying to bring down its store count and we will likely hear more on that front as it reports Q2 results before the market’s open on Thursday August 10th. The company is expected to report $0.44 per share in earnings on $5.49 billion in revenues, down -18.3% and -6.4% from the year-earlier period, respectively. Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) and Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) report on August 10th as well.Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard (as of Friday, August 4, 2017) We now have Q2 results from 420 S&P 500 members that combined account for 86.7% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies are up +11.6% from the same period last year on +5.6% higher revenues, with 74.3% beating EPS estimates and 68.3% beating revenue estimates.The table below shows the current Q2 ScorecardThe charts below compare the Q2 results thus far from the 420 index members with what we had seen from the same group of companies in other recent periods.As pointed out earlier, the proportion of companies beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking above historical periods (right-hand chart). The earnings and revenue growth pace for these 420 companies is below what we had seen from the same sample of companies in Q1, but an improvement over other recent periods.4 Takeaways from the Q2 Earnings SeasonHere are the four takeaways from the results that have come out already.First, the earnings and revenue growth pace is steadily going up relative to pre-season expectations. Total Q2 earnings for the index are currently expected to be up +10% from the same period last year on +5.1% higher revenues.Please note that the +10% growth rate is the blended growth rate; it combines the actual growth for the 420 S&P 500 members that have reported with estimates for the still-to-come 80 index members. At the start of the quarter, the expectation was for earnings growth of +7.9%, which came down as the quarter unfolded, reaching as low as +5.6% just ahead of the start of the reporting season.The deceleration in Q2 earnings growth notwithstanding, the quarter’s earnings tally is on track to reach a new all-time quarterly record, surpassing the 2016 Q4 level, as you can see in the chart below. The chart below contrasts the estimated 2017 Q2 total of $293.6 billion with the actual earnings for the preceding four quarters and estimates for the following four periods.This record isn’t expected to last very long, with each of the coming quarters expected to bring in ever bigger earnings tallies.Second, an above-average proportion of companies are beating EPS and revenue estimates. We typically don’t give this factor a lot of weight in evaluating or assessing an earnings season since we all know that management teams are experts in managing expectations. Even then, the trend emerging in the Q2 earnings season is noteworthy for two reasons. First, estimates for the quarter had not fallen by as much as had historically been the case. Second, the proportion of positive revenue surprises, a much harder variable to manipulate relative to earnings, is really off the chart.The chart below shows the proportion of 420 S&P 500 members that have beaten both EPS and revenue estimates and how that compares to historical periodsThird, Q2 growth is broad-based and not dependent on one or two sectors. There is strong growth contribution from the Finance, Technology and Energy sectors in Q2, but we have 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors on track to produce more earnings than the year-earlier period.Fourth, estimates for the September quarter have started coming down, but the pace and magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other comparable periods. Total Q3 earnings are currently expected to be up +4.3% from the same period last year, down from +6.3% at the start of July. The chart below shows the evolution of Q3 growth expectations since the start of the period.This is a reassuring start on the revisions front, but we will have to see if this trend will remain in place through the rest of this earnings season.The chart below shoes Q2 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters. As you can see in the chart below, this growth pace is expected to continue through the rest of the year.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

886,BKNG,"It is reasonable to take a favorable view of the lodging industry’s supply-demand fundamentals given the improving U.S. and global economic outlook. Then again, the so-called “Trump Slump” in travel -- the anticipated decline in foreign travelers to the U.S. due to Trump administration’s policies -- does not bode well for the U.S. economy or the hotel industry.Additionally, increased supply coupled with macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies   could keep hoteliers’ growth under check. This makes it important to take a closer look at some of the dampeners before investing in the hotel industry.Below we discuss some of the headwinds that hotel stocks may face in the near and the long term:Trump’s Policies Hover Over Hoteliers: President Donald Trump’s efforts to impose a travel ban barring inbound travelers from some predominantly Muslim countries along with the recent ban on a broad range of electronic devices in the cabins of U.S.-bound aircraft from certain countries and talks of expanding the same have cast a pall on future travel demand to and from the U.S. The President has also talked about building a wall along the U.S. southern border to curb Mexican immigrants entering the country illegally.Trump’s travel ban orders have been stymied by federal judges. However, his stringent policies on immigration and tourist visas to deter foreigners from the U.S. appear to have made international visitors rethink their vacation in the U.S.Notably, since Trump took office, there have been clear signs and data suggesting that the number of people willing to travel to the U.S. has already reduced dramatically, thanks to his plans. In fact, there’s been a continued slow-down in U.S.-bound air travel bookings ever since. Also, online searches by prospective travelers to the U.S. have also been witnessing a sharp decline.In fact, as per Tourism Economics, the drop-off in tourism is anticipated to result in 4.3 million lesser visitors this year. This adds up to a staggering loss of $7.4 billion in revenues for the U.S. Meanwhile, another 6.3 million visitors and $10.8 billion that they would have spent is estimated to be lost in 2018, due to Trump rhetoric and policies.Thus, as tourists plan to steer clear of Donald Trump’s America, the U.S. travel industry is bearing the brunt of his unpopular policies. As the U.S. has become by some degree, a less desirable place to visit, causing billions in lost revenue,it is sure to be detrimental to hoteliers’ businesses and the overall industry.Lingering Uncertainty in Certain International Markets: Despite immense growth potential, hoteliers are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues like the social/political impact of ‘’Brexit’’ and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia. Though Trump’s stringent policies might make travelers opt for Europe and Asia, instead of the U.S., various concerns in these regions raise eyebrows.Notably, a sluggish economy and oversupply in Brazil are weighing on demand in the Latin American region and has checked overall sales. In fact, a weak Latin American economy, aggravated by political turmoil led to softer tourism numbers in 2015 and 2016. This is likely to continue in 2017. Continued uncertainty in Africa and macroeconomic factors in Venezuela are likely to restrict hoteliers’ revenues.Meanwhile, hoteliers like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) expect pandemic virus like Zika to continue tempering growth in the Caribbean region.In Europe, economic/political conditions are expected to be challenging after U.K.’s exit from the 28-member economic bloc. Business in Europe is as it is clouded by economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone.Recent terror assaults in key European cities like London, Paris, Zurich and Brussels have also affected tourism. Challenging market dynamics in France is a potent headwind. Additionally, concerns of further terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting trade in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria.If these aren’t enough, the slowing down of the Chinese economy — which might continue to hurt discretionary spending and travel — and concerns over Japan owing to a weaker yen and tax increases are adding to hoteliers’ woes.Meanwhile, in the Middle East, political unrest, lower government spending, new hotel supply and a tough oil market continue to hurt tourism and RevPAR trends. Any respite from these ills in the region is not expected in the near-term.Most of the leading hoteliers’ have considerable presence in the above-mentioned markets and are thus vulnerable to the economic conditions in these regions as it might limit their business growth.Slowing RevPar Trends: Most of the hoteliers in the U.S. have been witnessing slowing revenue per available room (RevPAR) trends of late because of continued muted international visitation. Moreover, continued increase in supply of hotels in the domestic market is limiting room rents, thereby hurting RevPAR.Moreover, the majority of leading hoteliers expect soft demand in the oil producing regions – mainly parts of Texas, Houston, Louisiana, Houston, Oklahoma City and West Virginia – to continue taking a toll on RevPAR.Fluctuation in Exchange Rates: Most of the major hoteliers like Marriott, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation WYN generate a substantial portion of their revenues from customers outside the U.S. and are therefore highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. Thus, continued volatility in exchange rates would continue to hurt their results as it has been doing so over the past few quarters.Meanwhile, as the U.S. dollar continues to show strength against various other currencies, negative currency translation is a major concern for these companies. Also, a strong dollar means that travel to the U.S. is becoming more expensive for visitors from other countries and they might look for alternative destinations. This is likely to thwart travel demand and length of stays.Both these factors may possibly be detrimental to the hotel industry. In fact, Marriott and Hyatt has been witnessing fewer international guests at its U.S. hotels, given a stronger dollar. Meanwhile, Marriott and Wyndham are also bearing the brunt of the Venezuelan currency devaluation.Operating Margins Under Pressure: Operating margins for hoteliers are yet to reach the industry peak of 2007 in the U.S. given the spike in costs. Hoteliers are looking to differentiate themselves and keep pace with changing consumer tastes through investments in technology, quick customer service and real-time marketing. These are denting margins even further. Additionally, most hoteliers plan to gain competitive advantage and differentiate their brands through renovation. This will however come at the cost of near-term margins.Meanwhile, as the economy improves and unemployment levels drop, hotel managers are expected to continue struggling to control their largest operating expense – labor costs. Rising salaries, wages and benefits, as well as increased staffing levels have been adding to hoteliers’ labor costs.Moreover, hoteliers are unable to match the rising cost of operations with the increase in room rates. This is lowering their ability to achieve levels of profit growth observed in the last four to five years.Additionally, online booking sites like Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) and The Priceline Group’s PCLN Booking.com are limiting the pricing power of these hotels, which are contracting their margins. Higher commission rates charged on hotels are also hurting margins. Meanwhile, with lower overhead costs and less strict regulations than hotel companies, home sharing companies like Airbnb, Inc. are competing head-to-head with traditional players in certain segments of the market and even seizing share from them.Stocks to AvoidA couple of players in the space that induce our cautious-to-bearish outlook are Marriott and Peak Resorts, Inc. (SKIS  -  Free Report). Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.To ConcludeNegative sentiments related to traveling to and from the U.S. thanks to Trump along with decline in international inbound travel given a strengthening U.S. dollar are acting as the major spoilers for the U.S. hotel industry.Additionally, various geopolitical and economic woes, oversupply, and higher costs are wreaking havoc on the hotel industry. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether improving economic indicators and initiatives undertaken by hoteliers can offset these negatives.Let us see how these companies fare, brave the challenges and register profits in the coming days. In “2017 Set to Bring Modest Growth for US Hotel Industry” we focused on the conditions that are expected to drive the industry forward.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

887,BKNG,"The U.S. hotel industry started 2017 on a strong note with solid demand supporting modest growth in both occupancy and average daily rate (ADR) in first-quarter 2017. Revenue per available room (RevPAR) also increased 3.4%.This is reflected in the industry’s stock-price performance. Over the past six months, the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry has fared better than the broader S&P 500 index. While the industry has gained 12.5%, the broader index has added only 6.9%.Despite moderate first-quarter GDP growth of 1.2%, low oil prices, rising employment, higher real income, and increased household net worth reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment. This has resulted in a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, which is likely to continue.Positive economic outlook (GDP projected to rise 2.2% in 2017) is also expected to keep the mood upbeat, supporting continued albeit decelerating growth for the U.S. hotel industry for the rest of the year. Even then, peaking supply growth is expected to put pressure on pricing power, thereby tempering the performance somewhat.What Do Numbers Say?Statistics underscore the expectation of moderating but positive performance by the hotel industry. A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) shows that new supply is likely to rise 2% in 2017, slightly below the anticipated demand growth of 2.1%. This is likely to result in a 0.1% rise in occupancy rates in 2017 to 65.5%.Though both ADR and RevPAR are projected to climb 2.3% in 2017, the rate of increase will likely be less than the average growth recorded in the past few years.Additionally, as per CBRE Hotels' Americas Research, ADR and RevPAR are expected to rise 2.9% year over year in 2017, while occupancy is projected to inch up 0.1%.Meanwhile, the Baird/STR Hotel Stock Index, which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U.S. exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks, fell 2.4% in Jun 2017. However, in the first six months of the year, the index rose 25.4%, much higher than its 19.6% rise in the same period last year.Thus, while overall demand in the U.S. is likely to remain strong, driven in part by firming group travel, increasing supply growth is anticipated to lead to stabilizing occupancy levels. ADR and RevPAR are expected to continue to increase, but at a slower pace than earlier expected, impacted in part by comparatively lower growth in the overall economy.What’s Hurting the Hoteliers?Uncertainty, both international and domestic, continues to weigh on the performance of the U.S. lodging industry.On the one hand, the strengthening U.S. dollar and its impact on inbound, international travel is expected to keep the industry’s growth at check.On the other hand, negative sentiment related to traveling to and from the U.S. given the Trump administration’s stringent policies on immigration and tourism visasis bad for hotels.Additionally, higher costs, increased supply along with pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown are likely to continue to pose headwinds.Though prospects of lower taxes, reduced regulations and updated trade policies proposed by the Trump administration should contribute to economic improvement, capital market surge and rising business and consumer confidence, the majority of these changes are unlikely to take effect until at least 2018.Meanwhile, hoteliers have been focusing on renovation and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers. However, to do so, steep costs incurred by leading hoteliers are taking a toll on profits. Moreover, high labor costs will continue to be a major concern for hoteliers, and as they won’t be able to boost ADRs as much as they would like, their profits may be dented further. In fact, online travel agents like Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report), TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) and The Priceline Group Inc. PCLN are also limiting the pricing power of these brands.Another major threat comes from home sharing companies, like Airbnb, Inc., which offer digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations. With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with, these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report).What Can Drive Growth?The hotel industry is particularly vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of economic conditions. So the present solid economic fundamentals that should spur consumer spending in 2017 raises optimism for hoteliers.Moreover, hoteliers will be able to counter any economic volatility better, if they keep moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services.Particularly, hoteliers must look for ways to sustain their growth as online private accommodation aggregators flood the marketplace with new inventory. In fact, Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. is being viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and homesharing companies. Other hoteliers like Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corp. WYN are also investing in home sharing start-ups to combat Airbnb. Notably, both Hyatt and Wyndham carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So far, the hotel industry has proved to be resilient during this marketplace shift. In 2017, too, the industry is estimated to witness continued success.Thus, as hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness, industry-best practices such as sustainability, brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking – especially among millennials – will remain the priorities. Acute, focused investment in infrastructure to attract more business and leisure travelers will also hold the key to growth.Why Hotel Stocks Still Have Some Upside LeftWhile the industry has outperformed the broader market over the last five years, it seems there is still a value-oriented path ahead. Looking at the industry’s EV/EBITDA ratio (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization), which is the best multiple for valuing hotels as they are highly capital intensive, investors might still want to pay more.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 10.51, which compares favorably with what it saw in the last five years. The ratio is lower than the average of 12.72 and the high of 17.45 over the last five years.Moreover, it compares somewhat favorably with the market at large, as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is 10.83.Overall, the valuation of the industry from an EV/EBITDA perspective looks attractive when compared with its own range in the same time period. Moreover, its somewhat lower-than-market positioning calls for some more upside in the quarters ahead.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, hotel companies are broadly grouped in the Consumer Discretionary sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).We rank 265 industries into 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our X industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).In fact, ourback-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much. The Zacks Industry Rank for Hotels & Motels industryis currently at #94 (Top 35%).The ranking is available on the Zacks Industry Rank page.Earnings TrendsThe Hotels & Motels industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.If we look at the overall results of the sector, earnings grew 14.2% in the March quarter while total revenues rose 11.9%.Meanwhile, for the June quarter, though revenues are expected to rise 7.7%, earnings are projected to record a decline of 1.7%. Meanwhile, for 2017 too, while revenues are expected to rise 6.3%, earnings are anticipated to decrease 4.3%.For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our ‘Earnings Trends’ report.How Will the Players Fare This Earnings Season?A look at the table below shows that four of these five largest hoteliers carry a favorable Zacks Rank – which speaks well for the hotel industry at the moment.A look at the Earnings ESP shows that three of the five hoteliers are likely to beat expectations when they report quarterly results in July/August.ConclusionLooking at the recent economic indicators and the industry’s cheap valuation, growth prospects of the U.S. hotel industry appear bright.Though industry-wide headwinds continue to weigh on investor sentiment, hotel companies have good reasons to remain optimistic. Particularly, those willing to venture out of their comfort zones and be responsive to changing consumer expectations to provide a more holistic offering, are sure to emerge winners.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

888,BKNG,"The bulk of the Q1 earnings season is now behind us, with results from only about 18% of the S&P 500 members still awaited. The Retail sector is the only one at this stage that has a sizable number of reports still to come, with a number of traditional retailers Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) on deck to report results this week. With another 43 index members reporting results this week, the Q1 earnings season will have come to an end for 91% of S&P 500 members by the end of the week.As we have been saying all along since the start of this reporting cycle, the Q1 earnings season has turned out to be very good. Not only is growth very strong and the highest in many years, but a bigger proportion of companies have come out with positive surprises, particularly on the revenues front. Importantly, while estimates for the current period (2017 Q2) have come down, they aren’t falling by as much as has been the case in the comparable periods in other recent quarters.All in all, the picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season has been positive and reassuring.Key Earnings Reports for the Week of May 8th  This week brings in results from more than 700 companies, including 43 from the S&P 500 index. There is no shortage of big-name operators coming out with results this week, but we are featuring just a few hereNVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) shares have been laggards this year, down -2.7% in the year-to-date period vs. +4.1% gain for the Zacks Semiconductor industry and +12.6% gain for the Zacks Technology industry. The stock had literally been a tear prior to this year and that lead still shows up in its one-year performance of +194% gain (vs. +25.9% for the Tech sector and +45.2% for the industry). Quarterly earnings reports have historically been key catalysts for this maker of high-end graphics processor, with the Q1 earnings report after the market’s close on Tuesday May 9th expected to be no different. The company is expected to report $0.66 per share on $1.91 billion, up +69.5% and +46.4% from the year-earlier period, respectively. Given the stock’s recent underperformance and the modestly negative trend on the revisions front, expectations may be low enough for this earnings report to push the stock higher.Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) shares have broadly tracked the S&P 500 index this year (up +6.7% in the year-to-date period vs. +7% gain for the index) after lagging the index all of last year on persistent worries about the fate of its ESPN franchise in the current cord-cutting media environment. Over the past one year, the stock is up +5.4% while the S&P 500 index has gained +16.1%. Disney reports Q1 results after the market’s close on Tuesday May 9th, with the company expected to come out with $1.45 per share in earnings on $13.5 billion in revenues, up +6.5% and +3.9%, respectively. Results will likely be quite strong on the back of continued momentum in the studio business and likely positive traffic at the recently opened Shanghai Disneyland, but focus will remain on the ESPN franchise. The estimates trend has been modestly positive, with current Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for the quarter modestly going up over the past month.Priceline (PCLN) has been a standout performer this year, with the stock up +30.6% in the year-to-date period vs. +24.2% for Expedia and +29.5% gain for the Zacks e-commerce industry. The stock was up big following the last quarterly release (February 27th) when it handily beat estimates and guided higher and market participants will be looking for  repeat performance when it reports Q1 results after the market’s close on Tuesday May 9th. The online travel leader is expected to report $8.80 in EPS on $2.43 billion in revenues, which represents year-over-year changes of -6% and +13.3%, respectively. Trends in estimate revisions has mostly been positive, though read-throughs from last week’s mixed Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) earnings report is modestly on the negative side. TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) will also report after the market’s close on Tuesday.Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) shares have done modestly better than the department store space this year, but the stock as well as the group as a whole are some of the weakest in the entire market. The stock is down -18.3% in the year-to-date period (down -22.3% over the past year) vs. -21.3% decline for the Zacks department store industry (down -20.3% over the past year). This compares to +7% gain for the S&P 500 index this year and +16.1% over the past year. Driving this underperformance is the industry’s competitive landscape characterized by the secular shift of sales to the online medium that is showing up in falling traffic and same-store sales. The company has been trying to bring down its store count and we will likely hear more on that front as it reports Q1 results before the market’s open on Thursday May 11th. The company is expected to report $0.35 per share in earnings on $5.47 billion in revenues, down -11.9% and -5.2% from the year-earlier period, respectively. Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) will also report Thursday morning while Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) will report after the market’s close.Q1 Earnings ScorecardAs of Friday, May 5th, we have Q1 results from 412 S&P 500 members that combined account for 85.7% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies are up +14.2% from the same period last year on +7.3% higher revenues, with 73.3% beating EPS estimates and 67.7% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 52.9%.The table provides the current earnings season scorecard, as of May 5th, 2017.Comparing Q1 ResultsThe chart below provide a comparison of the growth performance thus far with what we have seen from this same group of 412 S&P 500 members in other recent periods.As you can see, the Q1 growth pace is notably tracking above what we had seen from the same group of 412 index members in other recent periods. Importantly, the growth performance is broad-based and not narrowly concentrated. We got the leadership from the Finance space earlier in the reporting cycle, but the baton has since shifted to Tech and host of other areas, including Industrials, Basic Materials, and Energy.Positive Revenue SurprisesThe chart below compares the proportion of positive EPS and revenue surprises in Q1 thus far with what we had seen from the same group of 412 index members in other recent periods.The proportion of Q1 companies beating EPS estimates is tracking above historical periods, with positive revenue surprises particularly coming out ahead of what we are used to seeing in the recent past. You can see the same in the chart below that compares the proportion of Q1 companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates with other recent periods.Technology Sector ScorecardFor the Technology sector, we have Q1 results from 44 of the sector’s 62 operators in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these 44 Tech sector companies (accounting for 85.9% of the sector’s total market cap in the index) are up +16.5% from the same period last year on +6.4% higher revenues, with 77.3% beating EPS estimates and 79.5% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below show how the sector’s Q1 results thus far compare with what we have been seeing from the same group of Tech companies in other recent periods.As you can see, the sector’s growth performance is notably tracking above other recent periods, though the proportion of positive surprises is about in-line with recent history.Expectations for Q1 As a Whole Looking at Q1 as whole, combining the actual results from the 412 S&P 500 members that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come 88 index members, total earnings are expected to be up +12.7% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues. This would follow +7.4% earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on +4.7%.The table below shows the summary picture for Q1, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q4.Please note that the Q1 earnings season follows the strong showing on the earnings front in the preceding reporting cycle. Not only did 2016 Q4 growth reach the highest in two years, but total earnings for the quarter also reached a new quarterly record. The strong Q4 performance came after the first positive earnings growth in 2016 Q3, having declined in each of the preceding 5 quarters. The strong Q1 showing represents a notable acceleration in the growth momentum.The chart below shows the Q1 earnings growth contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters. As you can see in the chart below, this growth pace is expected to continue through the rest of the year.Please note that the earnings backdrop has not changed in any meaningful way since the November elections, notwithstanding the market’s strong gains since then.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

889,BKNG,"Granted, sales have been pretty solid in the U.S. and emerging markets have great growth prospects. Still, it would be prudent to take a closer look at some of the dampeners before investing in the hotel industry. Particularly, macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies and high costs could keep hoteliers’ growth in check.Below we discuss some of the headwinds that hotel stocks may face in the near as well as the long term:Demand-Supply Gap Unfavorable: The recovery in the broader economy is a boon for the hotel industry as it has perked up leisure and business travel demand. Meanwhile, the supply-demand environment in the U.S. has been favorable since 2010 with growth in demand outpacing supply growth. However, of late, the gap between demand growth and supply growth has considerably narrowed.In fact, considering the long pipeline of hotels, PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) expects the sector’s supply growth of 1.9% in 2017, thereby outpacing demand growth of 1.6%. This is expected to lead to the first occupancy decline for the U.S. lodging industry since 2009. PwC has also predicted for a positive but slow growth in average daily rate (ADR) and revenue per available room (RevPAR) in the year.Trump’s Travel Ban Hovers Over Hoteliers: The administration’s travel restrictions through executive action are adding to an overall air of uncertainty, on the margin, about travel into the country. The President has also talked about building a wall along the U.S. southern border to curb Mexican immigrants entering the country illegally.All these have cast a pall over future travel demand to and from the U.S. The perception of the U.S. becoming a less desirable place to visit in the eyes of the global traveler is a net negative for the industry as a whole.Lingering Uncertainty in Certain International Markets: Despite immense growth potential, hoteliers are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues in international markets, like the social/political impact of ‘’Brexit’’ and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia.Moreover, a sluggish economy in Brazil is weighing on demand in the Latin American region and has checked overall sales. In fact, Brazil, Argentina and Ecuador witnessed a decline in hotel occupancy in 2016. The weak Latin American economy, aggravated by political turmoil thus led to softer tourism numbers in 2015 and 2016 which is likely to continue in 2017.Meanwhile, hoteliers like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) expect pandemic virus like Zika to continue to temper growth in the Caribbean region.In Europe, economic/political conditions are expected to be challenging after U.K.’s exit from the 28-member economic bloc. Business in Europe is as it is clouded by economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone.Terror attacks on key European cities like London, Paris and Brussels in recent years have also affected tourism. The attacks in Brussels last year dealt a severe blow to Europe’s tourism industry, just as it was going into the peak season with hopes of a turnaround from the canceled bookings that followed the Paris attacks in 2015. Additionally, concerns of further terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting trade in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria.If this wasn’t enough, the slowing down of the Chinese economy and concerns over Japan, owing to a weaker yen and tax increases, are adding to hoteliers’ woes. Notably, China’s economic growth rate moderated in recent times with its 2015 GDP growth touching a 25-year low. The slowdown in the Chinese economy is thus hurting discretionary spending and, in turn, travel.Meanwhile, the Middle East and Africa has seen a decline in international arrivals due to a drop in oil prices with increase in security concerns, political unrest and rising supply, adding to the woes of hoteliers.Slowing RevPar Trends: Most of the hoteliers in the U.S. have been witnessing slowing revenue per available room (RevPAR) trends of late, because of continued muted international visitation along with new supply impact.Moreover, the majority of leading hoteliers expect soft demand in the oil producing regions – mainly parts of Texas, Houston, Louisiana, Houston, Oklahoma City and West Virginia – to continue hurting RevPAR.Fluctuation in Exchange Rates: Most of the major hoteliers like Marriott, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation WYN generate a substantial portion of their revenues from customers outside the U.S.As the U.S. dollar continues to show strength against various other currencies, negative currency translation is a major concern for these companies. In fact, Marriott has been witnessing fewer international guests at its U.S. hotels, given the stronger dollar. Meanwhile, Marriott and Wyndham are also bearing the brunt of Venezuelan currency devaluation.Thus, such volatility in exchange rates would continue to hurt the results of hoteliers as it has been doing so over the past few quarters.Operating Margins Under Pressure: Operating margins for the hoteliers are yet to reach the industry peak of 2007 in the U.S. due to a spike in costs. Hoteliers are looking to differentiate themselves and keep up with changing consumer tastes through investments in technology, quick customer service and real-time marketing. These are denting margins even further. Additionally, most hoteliers plan to gain a competitive advantage and differentiate their brands through renovation. This comes at the cost of near-term margins.Meanwhile, as the economy improves and unemployment levels drop, hotel managers are expected to continue struggling to control their largest operating expense – labor costs. Rising salaries, wages and benefits, as well as increased staffing levels has been adding to the hoteliers’ labor costs.Moreover, hoteliers are unable to match the rising cost of operations with increases in room rates. This is lowering their ability to achieve the levels of profit growth observed the past four to five years.Additionally, online booking sites like Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) and The Priceline Group’s PCLN Booking.com are limiting the pricing power of these hotels, which are contracting their margins. The higher commission rates charged on hotels are also hurting margins. Meanwhile, with lower overhead costs and less stricter regulations than hotel companies, home sharing companies like Airbnb, Inc. are also seizing share from traditional players.Stocks to AvoidSome of the players in the space that induce our cautious-to-bearish outlook include Belmond Ltd. (BEL  -  Free Report), La Quinta Holdings Inc. LQ and Hyatt. While Belmond and La Quinta has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), Hyatt carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.To ConcludeAlthough various geopolitical and economic woes along with higher costs are threatening growth in the hotel industry, it remains to be seen whether an improving economy and initiatives undertaken by hoteliers can offset these negatives.Let us see how these companies fare, brave the challenges and register profits in the coming days. In “Will 2017 Bring Growth for the US Hotel Industry?” we focused on the conditions which are expected to drive the industry forward.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

890,BKNG,"The U.S. hotel industry cycle appears to be moderating to historical norms, coming off years of accelerated growth that started in 2010 following the Great Recession. This moderating trend is expected to continue this year as well, with many industry players projected to experience muted growth.Solid lodging fundamentals, a steady rise in business and leisure travel on the back of an improving economy and positive employment numbers are favorable developments for the industry. Strong investor appetite thanks to higher transaction volumes should also help.Prospects of lower taxes, reduced regulations and updated trade policies should contribute to improving economic conditions, surging capital markets and rising business and consumer confidence. This is likely to support growth in corporate transient demand, which was bumpy all through 2016.On the flip side, geopolitical uncertainties are expected to continue weighing on the performance of the U.S. lodging industry. Also, rising costs, the strengthening U.S. dollar and its impact on inbound, international travel along withpockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown,are all expected to keep the industry’s growth in check.We thus expect the lodging cycle to more or less align with the broader business cycle, going forward. This is reflected in the group’s recent stock price performance as well, which has been roughly in-line with the S&P 500 index over the past year.What Do the Numbers Say?Statistics underscore the expectation of a more or less flat performance by the hotel industry. A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) shows that new supply is likely to rise 1.9% in 2017, outpacing demand growth of 1.6%. This is likely to affect occupancy rates, which are expected to fall marginally by 0.3% in 2017.Meanwhile, though average daily rate’s (ADR) projected rise of 2.6% in 2017 will be lower than 2016’s rise, it will still be impressive. As a result, revenue per available room (RevPAR) is expected to increase 2.3%. This will be however lower than the average RevPAR growth recorded in the past few years.Moreover, the Baird/STR Hotel Stock Index, which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U.S. exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks, rose 0.7% in Feb 2017.Additionally, according to Smith Travel Research (STR), a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics,overall occupancy at U.S. hotels was up 1.9% year over year for the week ended Mar 4, 2017. ADR rose 1.6% year over year and RevPAR grew 3.6% in the same timeframe.ConcernsHoteliers have been focusing on renovation and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers. However, to do so, the steep costs incurred by leading hoteliers are taking a toll on profits. Moreover, high labor costs will continue to be a major concern for hoteliers, and as they won’t be able to boost ADRs as much as they would like, it is likely to further dent their profits. In fact, online travel agents like Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report), TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) and The Priceline Group Inc. PCLN are also limiting the pricing power of these brands.Moreover, negative sentiment related to travelling to and from the U.S. following President Donald Trump’s recent travel ban brings bad news for hotels that play a crucial role in the travel supply chain.Meanwhile, the slowdown in China, lingering uncertainty in various international markets, and increased supply are likely to continue to pose headwinds. Particularly, in Europe, economic/political conditions are expected to be challenging post-Brexit.Another major threat comes from home sharing companies, like Airbnb, Inc., which offer a digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations. With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with, these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report). Notably, both Marriott and Wyndham carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.What Can Drive Growth?The hotel industry is particularly vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of economic conditions. So the present solid economic fundamentals that should spur consumer spending in 2017 raises optimism for hoteliers.Moreover, hoteliers will be able to counter any economic volatility better, if they keep moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services.Particularly, hoteliers must look for ways to sustain their growth as online private accommodation aggregators flood the marketplace with new inventory. In fact, Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. is being viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home sharing companies. Other hoteliers like Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation WYN are also investing in home sharing start-ups to combat Airbnb.Thus, as hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness, industry-best practices such as sustainability, brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking – especially among the millennials – will remain the priorities.Why Hotel Stocks Still Have Some Upside LeftWhile the industry outperformed the broader market over the last five years, it seems there is still a value-oriented path ahead. Looking at the industry’s EV/EBITDA ratio (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization), which is the best multiple for valuing hotels as they are highly capital intensive, investors might still want to own these stocks.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 11.4X, which compares favorably with what it saw in the last five years. The ratio is lower than the average level of 12.7X and its high of 17.4X over this period.Moreover, it compares somewhat favorably with the market at large, as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 13.7X and the median level is 11.4X.Overall, the valuation of the industry from an EV/EBITDA perspective looks attractive when compared with its own range in the same time period. Moreover, its lower-than-market positioning calls for some more upside in the quarters ahead.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, hotel companies are broadly grouped in the Consumer Discretionary sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).We rank 265 industries into 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our X industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much. The Zacks Industry Rank for Hotels & Motels industryis currently at #92 (Top 35%).The ranking is available on the Zacks Industry Rank page.Earnings TrendsThe Hotels & Motels industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.If we look at the overall results of the sector, earnings grew 10% in the December quarter while total revenues rose 11.3% in the quarter.Meanwhile, for the March quarter, though revenues are expected to rise 11.5%, earnings are projected to record a gain of mere 1.2%. However, for 2017, both earnings and revenues are expected to rise roughly 7.3% and 4.1%, respectively.For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our ‘Earnings Preview’ report.ConclusionLooking at the recent economic indicators and the industry’s cheap valuation, the growth prospects of the industry appear bright. With their focus on innovation, hoteliers could turn some of the challenges into opportunities in 2017.We note that lodging is a cyclical business. Although flat performance seems dispiriting, the compelling fundamentals supporting continued growth in travel will avert an outright fall from the present peak levels.Thus, though industry-wide headwinds continue to weigh on sentiment, hoteliers are cautiously optimistic moving ahead in 2017.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

891,BKNG,"Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) has been a solid travel stock to own this month, up over 8.5% through March 15. Shares are finally getting close to their pre-election highs near $133.EXPE was even a Bull of the Day in early January because the outlook according to earnings estimate revisions was bright and sunny.But the trend for EPS estimates in the past few weeks has taken a spring-break turn south that now puts Expedia in the cellar of the Zacks Rank. And this is not simply because of the Q4 adjusted earnings miss of 12% in early February.While year-over-year revenue comparisons were strong, sequential revenues for the holiday quarter were down 18.9% as gross bookings decreased 13.4% sequentially.The company has been making a large number of acquisitions and integration of these companies into its core platforms appears to be complete. Management noted that ""room nights"" improved throughout the quarter and are expected to remain healthy in the first quarter.Yet analysts have been furiously taking down their profit projections for the current quarter and the entire year. In the past 90 days, estimates for the March quarter have reversed from a profit of 16-cents to a loss of 27-cents.The June quarter has dropped from EPS of $1 to 62-cents and these changes take the full year down from $5.21 to $4.24 in the past 90 days.The Trivago TriangleBesides the typical competition, consolidation, and general disruption in online travel -- thanks to Airbnb -- there is a trio of other problems nagging Expedia.First, Expedia expects revenue and profitability to be negatively impacted by the shift of Easter into the second quarter this year. And management sees pressure on margins early this year due to investments in selling & marketing ahead of the travel season.Second, Expedia is a majority shareholder in Trivago (TRVG  -  Free Report) and that German-based travel portal has had its booking problems lately. In Q4, revenues decreased 33.7% sequentially.Third, for the month of March, TRVG shares have been struggling to stay above their December IPO debut of $11.85 after the hotel search provider disclosed a self-identified weakness in its financial reporting. My colleague Ryan McQueeney explained the situation on March 9...The revelation came within the company’s 20-F annual report, which was posted on the SEC’s website earlier today. In the filing, Trivago said that it identified an issue in its financial reporting practices that may cause even more issues in the future.“We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements of our financial statements,” the company said.The company cited its IPO and the inexperience of its employees in dealing with U.S. general accounting practices as the primary reason for the weakness.Don't Trip on ThisTravel holds plenty of opportunities, even though the industry is ranked in the bottom third of all industries that Zacks tracks. And EXPE probably has a bright future with 15% projected top line growth this year and 22.6% projected EPS growth.But right now, the analysts are in ""big revision mode"" about that growth story. So the chances of EXPE breaking through $133 to new highs are not as good as a trip back down to support near $120 and lower.Unless of course the company pulls of a coup and buys TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) before Priceline PCLN does.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

892,BKNG,"TripAdvisor, Inc. (TRIP  -  Free Report) has been investing in its future but that means revenues, and earnings growth, are taking a hit. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) had its 2017 estimates cut in the last month.TripAdvisor is the largest travel site in the world, providing 465 million reviews on hotels, restaurants, tours, attractions, and even the weather.Its branded websites reach 390 million average unique monthly visitors in 49 markets worldwide.It also operates 23 other travel media brands including airfarewatchdog.com, citymaps.com, cruisecritic.com, flipkey.com, jetsetter.com, oyster.com, viator.com, thefork.com, and others.Fourth Miss in the Row in the Fourth QuarterOn Feb 15, TripAdvisor reported its fourth quarter results and missed for the fourth time in a row. Earnings were just $0.05 compared to the Zacks Consensus of $0.18.Revenue rose 2% to $316 million from $309 million.Expenses increased as it instituted its hotel instant booking and strengthened its reach in Attractions, Restaurants and Vacation Rentals.The key for the company is raising awareness among consumers that TripAdvisor is more than just a review site. You can now book there as well.2016 Always Meant to be a Transition YearInvestors were disappointed in TripAdvisor again this quarter, but 2016 was never meant to be anything more than a transition year as it rolled out the new, expensive initiatives.It believes it has turned the corner in the fourth quarter and that 2017 will be stronger.The analysts believe that as well.Although they have cut 2017 estimates to $1.06 from $1.09 a share in the last 60 days, which is still earnings growth of 8%, they expect a bigger rebound in 2018.2018 earnings are forecast to rise 22% to $1.30.Shares Near 2-Week LowInvestors didn't like the quarter and punished the shares, which have sunk over the last 2 years.Is this a buying opportunity?Shares aren't cheap. They trade with a forward P/E of 44.A lot is still riding on the new booking feature on the site, which hasn't been in place long enough to yield results.If you're interested in the online travel area, you might want to consider online travel giant Priceline PCLN right now instead. It's expected to grow earnings by 15% next year.

893,BKNG,"Granted, sales have been pretty solid in the U.S. and emerging markets have great growth prospects. Still, it would be prudent to take a closer look at some of the dampeners before investing in the hotel industry. Particularly, macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies could spoil the party for hoteliers.Below, we discuss some of the headwinds that hotel stocks may face in the near as well as the long term.Lingering Uncertainty in Certain International Markets: Despite immense growth potential, hoteliers are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues in international markets, like the social/political impact of the unexpected ‘’Brexit’’ vote and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia.Moreover, a sluggish economy in Brazil is weighing on demand in the Latin American region and has checked overall sales. In fact, Brazil, Argentina and Ecuador have witnessed a decline in hotel occupancy so far in 2016. The weak Latin American economy, aggravated by political turmoil thus led to softer tourism numbers in 2015, which continues in 2016.Meanwhile, hoteliers like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) expect pandemic virus like Zika to continue to temper growth in the Caribbean region.In Europe, economic/political conditions are expected to be challenging after U.K.’s exit from the 28-member economic bloc. Business in Europe is as it is clouded by economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone.Recent terror assaults on key European cities like London, Paris and Brussels have also affected tourism numbers. The attacks in Brussels dealt a severe blow to Europe’s tourism industry, just as it was going into the peak season with hopes of a turnaround from the canceled bookings that followed the Paris attacks last year. Further, concerns of further terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting trade in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria.If this wasn’t enough, the slowing down of the Chinese economy and concerns over Japan, owing to a weaker yen and tax increases, are adding to hoteliers’ woes. Notably, China’s economic growth rate moderated in recent times with its 2015 GDP growth touching a 25-year low. The slowdown in the Chinese economy is thus hurting discretionary spending and, in turn, travel.Meanwhile, the Middle East and Africa has seen a decline in international arrivals due to a drop in oil prices and increase in security concerns, political unrest and rising supply, adding to the woes of hoteliers.Slowing RevPar Trends: Most of the hoteliers in the U.S. have been witnessing slowing revenue per available room (RevPAR) trends of late, because of continued muted international visitation along with new supply impact.In fact, taking into account the impact of a weaker global macro outlook, Marriott lowered its comparable system-wide RevPAR expectations on a constant dollar basis to growth of 3% in North America, outside North America and worldwide for full-year 2016. Notably, the company had earlier guided for RevPAR growth of 3% to 5%.Moreover, the majority of leading hoteliers expect soft demand in the oil producing regions, which mainly include parts of Texas, Houston, Louisiana, Houston, Oklahoma City and West Virginia to continue hurting RevPAR.Fluctuation in Exchange Rates: Most of the major hoteliers like Marriott, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation WYN generate a substantial portion of their revenues from customers outside the U.S. Notably, all these companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Hence, any unfavorable change in currency may hurt their financials to a great extent. Though the dollar weakened slightly in 2016 compared to the previous year, the negative currency impact is still significant. Meanwhile, Marriott and Wyndham are bearing the brunt of Venezuelan currency devaluation as well.Thus, such volatility in exchange rates would continue to hurt the results of hoteliers as it has been doing so over the past few quarters.Operating Margins Under Pressure: Operating margins for the hoteliers are yet to reach the industry peak of 2007 in the U.S. due to a spike in costs. Hoteliers are looking to differentiate themselves and keep up with changing consumer tastes through investments in technology, quick customer service and real-time marketing. These are denting margins even further. Additionally, most hoteliers plan to gain a competitive advantage and differentiate their brands through renovation. This comes at the cost of near-term margins.Additionally, online booking sites like Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) and The Priceline Group’s PCLN Booking.com are limiting the pricing power of these hotels, which are contracting their margins. The higher commission rates charged on hotels are also hurting margins. Meanwhile, with lower overhead costs and less stricter regulations than hotel companies, home sharing companies like Airbnb, Inc. are also seizing share away from traditional players.Healthcare Reforms to Hurt Profitability: The Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, is expected to have an adverse impact on hoteliers’ margins. The law entails hotels with 100 or more full-time equivalent employees to offer healthcare coverage to nearly all full-time employees and their dependents beginning this year. Also, from 2016, employers with 50 to 99 full-time-equivalent employees have also been included under Obamacare. Employers will be suffering penalties for any non-compliance. This would continue to raise costs for hoteliers in the near term.To ConcludeAlthough various geopolitical & economic woes are threatening RevPar growth in the hotel industry, it remains to be seen whether improving economy and efforts undertaken by hoteliers to increase occupancy can offset these negatives.Let us see how these companies fare and register profits in the coming days.

894,BKNG,"Macroeconomic concerns in several economies could spell trouble for the hotel industry. While sales have been pretty solid in the U.S., the outlook for emerging markets doesn’t appear that inspiring.
"
895,BKNG,"Despite strength in the domestic market, there are plenty of near-term factors that investors should take into account. Below, we discuss some of the headwinds that the hotel stocks may face in the near as well as the long term:Operating Margins Under Pressure: Though revenue per available room (RevPAR) has fairly picked up since the industry started recovering in 2009, operating margins are yet to reach the industry peak of 2007 in the U.S. due to a spike in costs. Hoteliers are looking to differentiate themselves and keep up with the changing consumer tastes through investments in technology, quick customer service and real-time marketing. These would dent margins even further. Additionally, most hoteliers plan to gain a competitive advantage and differentiate their brands through renovation, though at the cost of near-term margins.
"
896,BKNG,"Additionally, online booking sites like Expedia and The Priceline Group’s (PCLN) Booking.com are limiting the pricing power of these brands, which are contracting margins. Further, the higher commission rates charged for the hotels are hurting margins. Airbnb, Inc. – which connects tourists with homeowners through a digital platform – is also hurting revenues for hotels, especially in the urban markets. With lower overhead costs and less stricter regulations than hotel companies, these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing shares away from traditional players.Lingering Uncertainty in Certain International Markets: Despite immense growth potential, hoteliers are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues in the international markets, like the sluggishly recovering European economy and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia.
"
897,BKNG,"Moreover, high inflation rates, worsening employment scenario and currency devaluation in Latin America, especially Brazil and Argentina, have arrested overall sales. Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Ecuador witnessed decline in hotel occupancy in 2015. The weak Latin American economy, along with political turmoil, led to softer tourism numbers in 2015 which continued in the beginning of 2016. In addition to this, supply outpaced demand in the region, according to a Skift report, which hurt the situation further.
"
898,BKNG,"Uncertainty over the new government’s policy in China is another concern. The new Chinese leadership has asked government officials to curtail extravagance. Tighter government expenditure is expected to hurt food and beverage businesses of hoteliers, particularly in the northern and western parts where government is a major customer. Further, the economic growth rate of the country moderated in the recent times with its 2015 GDP growth touching a 25-year low. The slowdown in the Chinese economy would hurt discretionary spending, and in turn, travel.
"
899,BKNG,"In Europe, Turkey’s unstable geopolitical environment lowered tourism numbers, which affected occupancy in the beginning of 2016. Recent safety concerns across the continent due to terrorist attacks and threats, also affected tourism numbers across key cities like Paris and London at the end of 2015.
"
900,BKNG,"Further, the recent terrorist attacks in Brussels dealt an additional blow to Europe’s tourism industry, just as it was going into the peak season with hopes of a turnaround from the canceled bookings that followed the attacks in Paris last year.
"
901,BKNG,"Further, concerns of more terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting tourism in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria. In the Middle East and Africa, a decline in international arrivals due to drop in oil prices and increase in security concerns, political unrest and rising supply added to the woes.Healthcare Reforms to Hurt Profitability: The Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, is expected to have an adverse impact on hoteliers. The law entails hotels with 100 or more full-time equivalent employees to offer healthcare coverage to nearly all full-time employees and their dependents beginning this year. Meanwhile, from 2016, employers with 50 to 99 full-time-equivalent employees will also be included under this Act. Employers will suffer penalties for any non-compliance.

"
906,BKNG,"The U.S. hotel industry has been strong so far in 2016, driven by the rise in business and leisure travel in the wake of an improving economy and increasingly positive employment numbers. Favorable supply and demand balances, strong investor appetite, thanks to higher transaction volumes, and solid lodging fundamentals spread cheer across the industry.
"
907,BKNG,"Moreover, hoteliers moved from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services to counter economic volatility better. Further, the rapid adoption of technology in the last few years has improved operating efficiencies and enhanced guest services.
"
908,BKNG,"Does this mean that all’s well for the hotel industry? Not really.What Are the Concerns?
"
909,BKNG,"Hoteliers are capitalizing on growing tourism numbers, but higher costs for renovation as well as digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic are taking a toll on profits. Further, online travel agents like Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) and The Priceline Group Inc. (PCLN) are limiting the pricing power of these brands.
"
910,BKNG,"Another major threat is posed by home-sharing operators like Airbnb, Inc., which offer a digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations. With lower overhead costs and less strict regulations than hotel companies, these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing shares from giants like Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT), Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report).What’s Being Done?
"
911,BKNG,"Marriott’s recent deal to acquire Starwood Hotels is being viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home sharing companies. Other hoteliers like Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (WYN) are also investing in home sharing start-ups, to combat the Airbnb threat.
"
912,BKNG,"Statistics underscore the intense competition in the hotel industry. A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) shows that the lodging sector did not witness significant average daily rate (ADR) growth in the past few months, despite the increase in occupancy.
"
913,BKNG,"As a result of persistent pricing challenges, PwC slightly lowered the 2016 outlook for hotels to 5.5% for revenue per available room (RevPAR) growth. The RevPAR growth in 2015 was 6.3%.The slowdown in China, stronger-than-expected U.S. dollar, increasing political conflict in the Middle East, and a lull in the pace of recovery in the U.S. housing market are expected to pose headwinds.
"
914,BKNG,"Notwithstanding common macroeconomic hurdles, the lodging sector is expected to grow in 2016, thanks to the improving U.S. business and solid international travel and tourism volumes.
"
915,BKNG,"In the beginning of 2016, both transient and group demand exhibited solid momentum, with the year-over-year pace of recovery in group demand outpacing that of the transient segment. While this momentum in group demand is expected to continue, mega sporting events like the Olympics in South America should boost tourism this year.
"
916,BKNG,"The lodging performance indicators also showed year-over-year improvement. According to Smith Travel Research (STR), the leading information and data provider for the lodging industry, the ADR at U.S. hotels was up 4.2% year over year for the week ended Mar 19, 2016. Overall occupancy went up 1.9% year over year and RevPAR grew 6.2% for the same time frame.
"
917,BKNG,"As hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness, industry-best practices such as sustainability, brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking – especially among the millennial – will remain the priorities.Zacks Industry Rank
"
918,BKNG,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, we rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank. https://www.zacks.com/zrank/about-zacks-industry-rank.php
"
919,BKNG,"As a guideline, the outlook for industries in the top 1/3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' the middle 1/3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and the bottom 1/3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of #177 and higher is 'Negative.'
"
920,BKNG,"The Zacks Industry Rank for the hotels/motels industry is currently stands at #164 among the other industries ranked, indicating the group’s near-term neutral outlook.
"
921,BKNG,"The group’s neutral Zacks Rank placement is essentially a function of improved top line, partly offset by declining occupancy numbers in many markets, primarily due to economic and political challenges.Earnings Trends
"
922,BKNG,"The fourth-quarter 2015 earnings season has shown a mixed trend in the hotel and motel industry.
"
923,BKNG,"While Starwood Hotels surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues, Marriott beat the consensus mark for earnings but lagged the revenue estimates. Similar to Marriott, Wyndham Worldwide outperformed estimates for earnings but lagged revenues.
"
924,BKNG,"The hotel industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.
"
925,BKNG,"Total earnings for this sector increased 2.2% in the fourth quarter, compared with 2.6% in the third quarter. Total revenue grew 1.0% as against 0.4% increase in the previous quarter.
"
926,BKNG,"First-quarter 2016 earnings are expected to decline 0.4% year over year, whereas revenues are expected to decline 2.4% in the first quarter of 2016.

"
929,BKNG,"Ecommerce discussions often exclude online travel because this segment is relatively more mature, with a lot of the growth coming from international expansion and continued shift from offline to online channels. Moreover, the market is highly fragmented with just a few big players in a position to make a difference.
"
930,BKNG,"But the many small players mean that there is stiff competition and rapid innovation that also drives up their costs. This in turn makes it difficult for them to operate, increasingly driving them toward acquisitions in order to take their technology and expertise to scale.
"
931,BKNG,"The main drivers of the market are increased digitization, mobile adoption and international expansion. The stronger economy, benign oil prices and higher spending levels provide the perfect backdrop for growth, but currency will remain a headwind this year.Travel
"
932,BKNG,"The U.S. Commerce Department estimates international travel to the U.S. to grow at a CAGR of 3.1% from 2015 to 2020. Visitor volume is expected to grow from 0.4% in 2015 to 2.6% this year. Inbound travel volumes from Mexico, China, Canada and the UK will be the highest during this period while China, India, Taiwan, South Korea and Australia will see the highest growth rates.
"
933,BKNG,"The Travel and Tourism industry remains one of the country’s strongest. According to the BEA, industry spending grew 4.4% in 2015, an improvement over 3.1% growth in 2014. The fourth quarter wasn’t the high point, however, growing just 1.7% (down from 4.5% growth in the previous quarter) although it compared favorably with the real GDP decline of 1.0%.
"
934,BKNG,"Transportation (up 1.0%) and traveler accommodations (down 4.2%) were the weakest points in the quarter. Food services & drinking places and recreation, entertainment & shopping grew nicely. Overall pricing weakened 1.5% compared to a 0.2% decline in the third quarter.  
"
935,BKNG,"According to the TravelClick North American Hospitality Review (NAHR), stronger average daily rates (ADRs) in both leisure and business segments will drive first-quarter and full-year 2016 revenues in North America. Based on bookings and commitments up to the report date (Mar 4), the research firm sees a 2.9% increase in ADRs in the first quarter, supporting a 0.4% increase in occupancy. ADRs for the second quarter are expected to increase 2.7% with a stronger occupancy commitment of 4.0%.
"
936,BKNG,"For the 12-month period from Feb 2016 to Jan 2017, the research firm sees ADR growth of 2.8% and occupancy growth of 2.7% in the transient leisure business. The business side is expected to be weaker, with ADR growth of 3.4% being somewhat offset by an expected occupancy decline of 0.9%.
"
937,BKNG,"According to the TravelClick North American Distribution Review for the first quarter, digital channels comprising OTAs, hotel websites and GDS continue to gain in popularity. By quarter-end, the OTA channel is expected to grow 14.9% from a year ago, hotel websites 34.7% and GDS 15.8%. Direct-to-hotel and CRO are expected to increase 22.1% and 12.4%, respectively.
"
938,BKNG,"Based on current booking trends, overall ADRs are expected to increase 3.6%, with the direct-to-hotel channel growing 5.6%. ADRs for CRO are expected to be up 4.0%, OTA 3.3%, GDS 3.0% and hotel websites 2.3%.
"
939,BKNG,"But with rapid technology-driven international expansion, collaborations and acquisitions/consolidations, global travel trends have become an important consideration for domestic operators. As a result, the rising middle class, increased digital sophistication and Internet connectivity in emerging high-growth markets are now important drivers.
"
940,BKNG,"STR Global data for Jan 2016 shows that while occupancy varies across regions, price increases are broad-based.
"
941,BKNG,"eMarketer says that global digital travel sales will continue to grow through 2019 although the rate of growth will moderate. By geography, North America will remain the largest segment, although being more mature, it will see its growth rate coming down over the period to end at 28.9% of global digital travel sales.
"
942,BKNG,"Western Europe, another mature market, will follow along the same path to end 2019 at 24.3%. Asia/Pac will see double-digit growth in each year to end at 31.8%. Latin America will grow strong double digits off a low base to end at 7.2%. Ditto for MEA, which will end at 5.9%. Cantral and Eastern Europe will comprise less than 2% in 2019.
"
943,BKNG,"Mobile travel sales are expected to maintain share of total mcommerce sales this year at about 31.0%, increasing to 46.0% by 2019. Overall, desktop travel sales will see continued declines over the forecast period with mobile travel sales decelerating but continuing to grow at double-digit rates.Vacation Rental
"
944,BKNG,"Another area that has gained prominence in recent years is vacation rental. Airbnb pioneered the concept and took a lot of initial share, but others like Priceline’s (PCLN) Villas.com and Expedia’s (EXPE  -  Free Report) HomeAway are also doing quite well. This is an emerging segment because it targets younger and thriftier travelers that might also be given to last-minute buying habits.
"
945,BKNG,"Airbnb mainly focuses on unmanaged properties where the owner might lend out a room or apartment, while HomeAway focuses on unshared accommodation that may be more expensive. While the market is still pretty nascent so research is limited, these companies have both spread across 190 countries and have multi-billion dollar valuations.
"
946,BKNG,"The top travel booking sites are Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com, Travelocity.com, Orbitz.com and Hotwire.com. Since Booking.com and Kayak are part of Priceline and the others part of Expedia, this narrows down the top companies in the segment to Priceline and Expedia. However, there are several others worth considering that include Ctrip International (CTRP  -  Free Report), Travelport (TVPT  -  Free Report) MakeMyTrip (MMYT  -  Free Report) and Qunar (QNAR), which floated its IPO last year.
"
947,BKNG,"TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) is also leveraging its strength in referrals to enter the crowded travel booking space through its Instant Booking initiative.Digital Advertising
"
948,BKNG,"eMarketer says that Display advertising will surpass Search advertising for the first time to account for 47.9% of total digital advertising spending in 2016. Search will account for 43.6%. New innovative ad formats like native and banner ads are expected to be the most popular with advertisers this year. Mobile will account for 62.6% o spending.
"
949,BKNG,"Total growth rates are expected to continue decelerating: 15.4% in 2016, 12.5% in 2017, 11.9% in 2018 and 11.0% in 2019. The mobile platform will remain particularly strong, growing 38.0% in 2016, 21.0% in 2017, 14.0% in 2018 and 13.0% in 2019.
"
950,BKNG,"Hotels may be expected to notably increase digital advertising spending this year. According to a TravelClick survey, 57.3% of hoteliers said they are increasing their marketing budgets for 2016, with an increased spend on search engine marketing (23.2%), website update/redesign (20.7%), online advertising (12.2%) and mobile (17.1%).
"
951,BKNG,"The underlying drivers of growth are the continued increase in the number of netizens, greater propensity of users to consume online, a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the need to create brand awareness online.
"
952,BKNG,"But the market is getting increasingly competitive and pushing players to investment and innovation. The increasing propensity to use programmatic buying techniques (automating the inventory buying process) hurts pricing at market leader Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and rivals Yahoo (YHOO) and Microsoft. Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) large and growing user base and trove of personal data is driving prices on the platform. A lot of other networking companies, such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Pintertest are also growing in the digital advertising space.
"
953,BKNG,"International expansion (where rates are lower) and transition to mobile (where conversion tends to be lower) result in margin pressure for these players.
"
954,BKNG,"Digital advertising spend continues to move beyond search to social networks and content sites like Facebook, Netflix and Pandora, so the analytics side has been racing to catch up. Most of these players are acquiring or developing their own analytics capabilities, but content providers still have a preference for third-party solutions from companies like Nielsen (NLSN), comScore and WPP.
"
955,BKNG,"Earnings season is almost behinds us, with over 84% of S&P 500 companies having reported already. Many notable companies have been missing estimates and lowering guidance, which has caused damage to their respective stocks. However, there have been a handful of winners lately whose stocks have jumped violently on positive reports. These stocks were sold down so much in anticipation of a bad report, that the positive surprise was met with aggressive buying.
"
956,BKNG,"The market typically knows something you don’t. When indices are under severe selling pressure and a stock doesn’t go down, that stock is showing its hand.  Relative strength in market weakness will give clues to which stocks will win over the long run.
"
957,BKNG,"Over the last couple week’s I’ve noticed four stocks that have reacted strongly to earnings. These stocks showed strength leading up into earnings and jumped big after their reports.Priceline (PCLN) is a Zacks Rank #2(Buy) that is a popular online travel agency (OTA) and reservation service. The company operates multiple reservation sites such as Booking.com, Agoda.com, OpenTable and others. Priceline competes with other OTA’s within the internet commerce sector, an industry that’s ranked 157 out of 265 (bottom 41%) in the Zacks Industry Rank.
"
958,BKNG,"Priceline has a market cap of $61.5 Billion with a Forward PE of 19. The stock sports Zacks Style Scores of “B” in Growth, expecting EPS growth of 18%.
"
959,BKNG,"The company reported earnings on February 17th with the Q4 bottom line coming in at $12.63 versus the $11.83 expected and revenues at $2.00 Billion versus $1.98 Billion expected. Guidance for Q1 came in at $9.00-9.60 versus the $9.83 expected and revenues are seen up 9-16% year over year.
"
960,BKNG,"Priceline’s report beat the expected bottom line number as it typically does. However, revenues were only a slight beat and Q1 guidance was below the expected number. The price action showed that investors didn’t care too much about later, as the stock shot up over 10% on the news.
"
961,BKNG,"Looking at the chart below we see Priceline is an extremely volatile stock. Recent market pressure and fears about the Zika virus pushed this stock under the $1000 mark in early February. However, two prior earnings reports from Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) and Trip Advisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) gave the stock a bid as the market was still drifting down. This gave investors a clue into where Priceline earnings and stock might be going.
"
962,BKNG,"The plan here shouldn’t be to chase the stock higher after a 10% move higher. Patience is key and should be utilized by waiting for a market pullback and a pullback in the stock. While that $1000 price might be unrealistic, the $1100 pre-earnings level should be a good entry to shoot for.Edwards Lifesciences (EW  -  Free Report) is a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) that provides products and technologies to treat late-stage cardiovascular disease. The California Company's products include tissue replacement heart valves, heart valve repair products, hemodynamic monitoring devices, angioscopy equipment, oxygenators, and pharmaceuticals. They are in an industry that’s ranked 62 out of 265 (Top 23%) in the Zacks Industry Rank.
"
963,BKNG,"Edwards has a market cap of $19 Billion and a Forward PE of 33.
"
964,BKNG,"The company reported earnings on February 2nd with Q4 coming in at $0.63 versus $0.59 expected and revenues at $671 Million versus the $643 Million expected. They also guided higher with Q1 seen at $0.64-0.70 versus $0.56 expected, as well as raised fiscal year 2016 to $2.57-2.67 versus the $2.39 expected.
"
965,BKNG,"The initial reaction to earnings was positive and the stock is now over 10% from its pre-earnings price. Looking at the estimate revisions in the chart below, we see momentum behind these revisions. Any pull back will be an opportunity for a long-term entry.Hawaiian Holdings (HA  -  Free Report) is a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) that is an airline based out of Hawaiian and engages primarily in the scheduled transportation of passengers, cargo and mail. They are in an industry that’s ranked 611out of 265 (Top 4%) in the Zacks Industry Rank.
"
966,BKNG,"Hawaiian has a market cap of $2 Billion with a Forward PE of 8. The stock sports Zacks Style Scores of “B” in Momentum and “A” in Value and Growth.
"
967,BKNG,"The company had earnings on January 26th and the initial reaction was positive. After a pullback to the pre-earnings price the stock went on a 25% run up to $39.50 a share.
"
968,BKNG,"CEO Mark Dunkerley went into detail on the conference call: “The low cost of fuel, robust demand in all of our major geographies, manageable industry capacity growth between the US mainland and Hawaii in the second half of the year, and the wonderful customer service delivered by my colleagues on the ground and in the air have combined for a record setting 2015. The strong financial results validate the decision we made to grow rapidly in the last five years. The cash flow we generated in 2015 was used to pay down a portion of the debt we took on to finance our growth and for the further strengthening of our balance sheet. Looking forward, our outlook is for these positive trends to continue and the headwind of a strong US dollar in our international markets to decelerate, giving us a measure of confidence that 2016 will be an even better year for our business.”
"
969,BKNG,"The positive momentum should be considered on any market pullback and be taken as an opportunity to get in the stock.Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) is a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) that is the world's largest fully-integrated producer, processor and marketer of chicken and poultry-based food products They are in an industry that’s ranked 4 out of 265 (Top 2%) in the Zacks Industry Rank.
"
970,BKNG,"Tyson has a market cap of $22 Billion and a Forward PE of 16. The stock sports Zacks Style Scores of “B” in Value and “A” in Momentum and Growth.
"
971,BKNG,"The company reported earnings on February 5th with Q4 coming in at $1.15 versus $0.87 expected. They also guided higher with fiscal year 2016 seen at $3.85 versus the $3.64 expected. They also announced a $50 Million buyback, 13% of the market cap at the time.
"
972,BKNG,"The reaction was very positive as the stock has ripped over 20% since. Any significant pull back should be viewed as an opportunity to join the momentum.In Summary
"
973,BKNG,"All these companies reviewed have showed strength in a time when the market has been weak.  While companies reporting weak earnings have been punished, these stocks have been rewarded after showing strength in fundamentals.  Any market pullback should be view as an opportunity to enter the stocks for a long-term investment.  Note: Want more articles from this author?

974,BKNG,"Macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies could spell trouble for the hotel industry. However, sales have been pretty solid in the U.S. and emerging markets still have great growth prospects.
"
975,BKNG,"Despite strength in the domestic market, there are plenty of near-term factors to take note of before investing in these stocks. Below, we discuss some of the headwinds that the hotel stocks may face in the near as well as the long term:Operating Margins Under Pressure: Though revenue per available room (RevPAR) has picked up since the industry started recovering in 2009, operating margins have yet to reach the industry peak of 2007 in the U.S. due to a spike in costs. Hoteliers are looking to stand out and keep up with the changing consumer tastes through investments in technology, quick customer service and real-time marketing. These would dent margins even further. Additionally, most hoteliers plan to renovate properties to gain a competitive advantage and differentiate their brands. This would further hurt margins in the near term.
"
976,BKNG,"Additionally, online booking sites like Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) and The Priceline Group’s (PCLN) Booking.com are limiting the pricing power of these brands, which are contracting margins. Further, the higher commission rates charged for the hotels are also hurting margins.Lingering Uncertainty in Certain Regions: Despite immense growth potential, hoteliers are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues in the international markets, like the sluggishly recovering economy in Europe and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia.
"
977,BKNG,"Moreover, high inflation rates, a worsening employment scenario and currency devaluation have arrested overall Latin American sales. Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela witnessed declines in hotel occupancy in 2015. The weak Latin American economy, along with political turmoil, translated into softer tourism numbers in 2015. Additions to supply outpaced demand in the region, according to a report from Skift, worsening the situation further.
"
978,BKNG,"Uncertainty over the new government’s policy in China is another issue. The new Chinese leadership has asked government officials to curtail extravagance. Tighter government expenditures are expected to hurt food and beverage businesses of hoteliers, particularly in the northern and western parts where government is a major customer. Further, the slowdown in the Chinese economy would hurt discretionary spending, and in turn, travel. Although tourism in India has recovered post-elections, the controversial anti-government protests in Thailand as well as political unrest in Hong Kong significantly hurt business.
"
979,BKNG,"Further, concerns about terrorist attacks and violence against foreigners are increasingly hurting tourism in many African countries such as Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. Economic headwinds and political unrest have hampered growth in other parts of the continent as well. In the Middle East, Saudi visa restrictions remain a headwind.Health Care Reforms to Hurt Profitability: The Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, is expected to have an adverse impact on hoteliers. The law entails hotels with 100 or more full-time equivalent employees to offer health care coverage to substantially all full-time employees and their dependents beginning this year. Meanwhile, it will be applicable for employers with 50 to 99 full-time-equivalent employees in 2016. Employers have to suffer penalties if they do not follow these rules. This will raise costs for hoteliers in the near term.
"
980,BKNG,"Some of the players in the space induce our cautious-to-bearish outlook. Currently, Sands China Ltd.  has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), while Red Lion Hotels Corporation (RLH  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Bottom Line
"
981,BKNG,"As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be pessimistic about the hotel industry. But what about investing in the space right now? Are there opportunities for short-term investors?

984,BKNG,"U.S. Hotel Industry Recovers in Tune with Economic Growth
"
985,BKNG,"The U.S. hotel industry’s strength has remained intact so far in 2015, reflecting a steady rise in business and leisure travel on the back of an improving economy. Favorable supply and demand balances, strong investor appetite thanks to higher transaction volumes and solid lodging fundamentals spread cheer across the industry. Moreover, hoteliers have moved from owning real estate to franchising their brand and services to better counter economic volatility.
"
986,BKNG,"Despite pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown, this optimism should remain in place for the rest of this year and continue into 2016.
"
987,BKNG,"Does this mean that the hotel industry is lying on a bed of roses? Well, not really.
"
988,BKNG,"Hoteliers are scrambling for profits while trying to capitalize on growing tourism numbers. Higher costs and expenses incurred by leading hoteliers for renovation as well as digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic are denting profits. Further, online travel agents like Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) and The Priceline Group Inc. (PCLN) are limiting the pricing power of these brands.
"
989,BKNG,"Another major threat is home-sharing companies like Airbnb, Inc. which offers a digital service allowing tourists to book homes at holiday destinations. With low overhead costs and light regulations compared with hotel companies, these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing market share away from giants like Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT), Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report).
"
990,BKNG,"In fact, Marriott’s recent deal to acquire Starwood Hotels for $12.2 billion is being viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home-sharing companies. Other hoteliers like Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corp. (WYN) are also investing in home sharing start-ups.
"
991,BKNG,"Statistics underscore the intense competition in the hotel industry. A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) shows that the lodging sector did not witness significant average daily rate (ADR) growth in the past few months.
"
992,BKNG,"As a result of persistent pricing challenges, PwC slightly lowered the 2015 outlook for hotels to 6.5% revenue per available room (RevPAR) growth, due to lower-than-expected increase in ADR. However, overall the demand conditions in the U.S. remained strong, contributing to the increasing occupancy levels this year.
"
993,BKNG,"Notwithstanding the common macroeconomic hurdles, the lodging sector is expected to deliver growth in 2016, thanks to the improving U.S. business and solid international travel and tourism volumes.
"
994,BKNG,"In 2015, both transient and group demand exhibited solid momentum, with the year-over-year pace of recovery in group demand outpacing that of the transient segment. While this momentum in group demand is expected to continue, mega sporting events like the Olympics in South America should boost tourism in 2016.
"
995,BKNG,"The lodging performance indicators also showed year-over-year improvement. According to Smith Travel Research (STR), the leading information and data provider for the lodging industry, the ADR at U.S. hotels was up 3.7% year over year for the week ended Nov 14, 2015. Overall occupancy went up 2.4% year over year and RevPAR grew 6.2% for the same time frame.
"
996,BKNG,"As hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness, industry-best practices such as sustainability, brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking, especially among the millennial, will remain the priorities.Zacks Industry Rank - Positive

1001,BKNG,"The third-quarter earnings season has shown a mixed trend in the hotel and motel industry.
"
1002,BKNG,"While Starwood Hotels surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, it missed the same for revenues marginally. Similarly, Marriott beat the consensus mark for earnings but lagged the revenue estimates. Wyndham Worldwide, on the other hand, outperformed our estimates for both earnings and revenues.
"
1003,BKNG,"The hotel industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.
"
1004,BKNG,"The earnings ""beat ratio"" for the Consumer Discretionary sector is 74.4%, while the revenue ""beat ratio"" is 41% in the third quarter. Total earnings for this sector increased 2.8% in the reported quarter, compared with 2.2% in the second quarter. Total revenue grew 1.8% as against 1.4% increase in the previous quarter.
"
1005,BKNG,"Fourth-quarter 2015 earnings are expected to decline 3.9%, whereas revenues are expected to decline 10.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015, pegging the full-year 2015 growth outlook at 5.3%. For 2016, the sector’s revenues are poised to expand around 15.8%.

"
1008,BKNG,"Although retail ecommerce is the segment that most of us are interested in, it is in fact just a part of the overall ecommerce market. Retailers and service providers generate just 5.2% and 3.1%, respectively of their revenues online, a slightly higher percentage than they did in the prior year. The U.S. Census Bureau categorizes these two segments as business-to-consumer.
"
1009,BKNG,"According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the manufacturing sector is the most reliant on e-commerce sales (51.9% of their total shipments), followed by merchant wholesalers (26.4% of their total sales). These two segments make up the business-to-business category.
"
1010,BKNG,"The latest numbers from the Bureau suggest that growth rates across all segments were similar with services being just a bit slower. [All the above data from the U.S. Census Bureau relate to 2012, as published in May 2014.]
"
1011,BKNG,"The industry is evolving very rapidly, so data collection and evaluation are particularly difficult. Consequently, one has to rely largely on surveys by both government and private agencies.
"
1012,BKNG,"In this section, we will discuss segments of the ecommerce market than do not relate directly to the retail of goods, and focus instead on travel, payments, security and advertising.Travel
"
1013,BKNG,"The U.S. Commerce Department expects international travel to the U.S. to continue increasing over the next few years. Visitor volume is currently expected to increase 3.7-4.2% a year from 2013 to 2017 leading to a 26% increase in the number of users by 2018. Visitors from the Caribbean are expected to be the slowest-growing (1%). The Middle East, Asia and South America are expected to grow 67%, 60% and 52%, respectively.
"
1014,BKNG,"The fastest growth is expected to come from China (229%), Saudi Arabia (191%), Russian Federation (79%), Brazil (66%), Argentina (65%) and Columbia (54%).
"
1015,BKNG,"The Travel and Tourism industry remains one of the country’s strongest industries, although the first quarter of 2014 did not go that well. According to the BEA, the industry declined 1.0% in the quarter, better than the real GDP decline of 2.9% (in the fourth quarter of 2013 it grew 4.5% compared to GDP growth of 2.6%). The recreation and entertainment segment was the main driver of weakness, declining 11.2% in the quarter (compared to a 0.9% increase in the previous quarter).
"
1016,BKNG,"Food services and drinking places also contributed with a 3.5% decline (compared to a 7.4% increase in the previous quarter). Accommodation prices went up 13.2% while passenger air transportation prices dropped 5.5%. They were down 8.0% and 7.0%, respectively in the previous quarter.
"
1017,BKNG,"The top travel booking sites are Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com (acquired by Priceline), Travelocity.com, Orbitz.com and Hotwire.com. Since Booking.com and Kayak are part of Priceline (PCLN) and both Hotels.com and Hotwire.com part of Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), this narrows down the top companies in the segment to Priceline, Expedia, Orbitz Worldwide (OWW) and Travelocity. However, there are several others worth considering that include Ctrip International (CTRP), MakeMyTrip (MMYT  -  Free Report), TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report), which was spun off from Expedia, and Qunar (QUNR), which recently had its IPO.
"
1018,BKNG,"The top site for travel content is TripAdvisor, visited by 60% of Americans when choosing a hotel. Google’s (GOOGL) YouTube is now growing in popularity and is the second in line, according to the MMGY Global's 2013 Portrait of American Travelers study.
"
1019,BKNG,"Global outbound trips grew 4% in the first eight months of 2013 and are expected to grow 4-5% this year. The Asia/Pacific region is expected to see the strongest growth (up 9%), with China alone growing 18%. South America will follow with 6% growth followed by Europe at 3-4% and North America thereafter at 3% [World Travel Monitor 2013].
"
1020,BKNG,"According to the TravelClick North American Hospitality Review (NAHR), both occupancy and average daily rates (ADRs) in North America have been growing steadily through the end of 2013 and into 2014. The occupancy rate for 2013 was flattish in the Group segment and up across most categories within the Transient segment, with the only weakness attributable to government spending. The ADR increased across all categories and was helped by much stronger leisure spending. The trends going into 2014 were positive for both occupancy and ADR.
"
1021,BKNG,"Online travel agents (OTAs) continue to grow the fastest: up 15.2% in 2013, according to TravelClick. The hotels’ own websites were up 7.6%, with direct walk-ins and calls to the hotel down 0.4% and 4.3%, respectively. The global distribution system used by travel agents was up 3.5%.
"
1022,BKNG,"Share of room nights based on actual reservations in 2013:
"
1023,BKNG,"According to STR Global, occupancy rates, ADRs and RevPAR saw positive growth across the world in May 2014:
"
1024,BKNG,"A recent PhoCusWright report mentions the top seven technology trends for the travel market. Accordingly, it appears that video is essential to draw customers and content marketing, guides, travel information and ROI tracking can all benefit from it. Trend two was with respect to search engines.
"
1025,BKNG,"The report says that Google’s algorithms are now favoring site design rather than keywords, making SEO somewhat redundant. So site design and navigability are becoming essential to capture search traffic. Social media has increased the availability of reviews, so companies are increasing focus on the overall travel experience.
"
1026,BKNG,"Trend four is increasing mobile usage, which the report says will account for 27% of online travel revenue by 2015.  The fourth trend is in wearables, with Virgin Mobile and a tourism board in Florida already using Google Glass effectively for customer interaction and advertising, respectively. Using big data analytics and social media marketing are the sixth and seventh major trends, respectively.  
"
1027,BKNG,"eMarketer is less optimistic about global digital travel sales growth. According to the research firm, this is a more mature segment, so growth rates are decelerating compared to retail ecommerce where they are growing faster. As a result, it expects travel’s 34.1% share of U.S. ecommerce sales in 2013 to drop to 26.2% by 2018.
"
1028,BKNG,"However, mobile travel sales are expected to increase share on total mcommerce sales from 31.1% in 2014 to 32.8% in 2018. Overall, desktop travel sales will see continued declines over the forecast period with mobile travel sales decelerating but continuing to grow at double-digit rates.
"
1029,BKNG,"Further, Mexico, India, Spain, Italy and Norway are expected to have the highest shares of digital travel sales in the next five years, with Brazil, China, India, Mexico and Italy being the fastest growers.Payment Systems
"
1030,BKNG,"Trends show that younger people, many of whom have been using the Internet from a very early age are likely to spend more online. For example, consumers aged 25-33 (Gen Y) spent an average $563 million online compared to consumers aged 34-47 (Gen X), who spent $535 on average. [Forrester report May 2014]
"
1031,BKNG,"Considering this trend, online players are vying with each other to come out with convenient and secure payment solutions. There are a host of payment systems in the market, but the greatest progress has been made on near field communication (NFC), quick response (QR) code, Soundwave and Bluetooth low energy (BLE).
"
1032,BKNG,"The latest to enter the fray is Amazon (AMZN) with its ""Amazon Payments"" system. Recognizing the most-used mobile and computing platforms, the system works on any desktop or tablets/smartphones running Android or iOS operating systems. Amazon’s payment system is likely to be popular with retailers given its huge customer base. For Amazon, it will also facilitate further data collection and position it strongly versus eBay’s (EBAY) Paypal and Google’s Digital Wallet.
"
1033,BKNG,"By far the most successful mobile payment system is Paypal, which has come a long way from a mere online payment service. Last year, the company inked a deal with Discover Network (DFS), the fourth largest credit card company, bringing its seven million plus retailers onto the Paypal network. Paypal has also signed up a large number of traditional retailers such as The Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Office Depot (ODP  -  Free Report). The company is now selling its marketing services as a bundled solution to retailers and the success of this strategy is evident in Paypal’s growth numbers.
"
1034,BKNG,"The digital wallet from Google enables in-app purchase and mobile payments in addition to PoS purchases and money transfer. Other than the credit and debit card information, users can now store loyalty cards, discount coupons and offers that they can apply during purchase. More importantly, Google has found a way to reduce its dependence on NFC technology. A non-NFC-enabled phone can now use the Wallet to transfer funds from any of the accounts saved in it.
"
1035,BKNG,"Google now requires app developers for the Android platform to compulsorily use its payment service instead of a competing service from eBay or others. Despite the strong growth in Android devices, Google Play (its app store) has not done that well, partly because of the many steps to conversion that turns customers away. But the company is now beginning to see nice growth rates.Apple (AAPL) has removed NFC compatibility from its devices and also introduced iBeacon, which is a BLE technology. The technology tracks the approximate location of a person, the time spent at different stores and even the location within the store. It has the potential to push highly relevant offers and promos at opportune moments.
"
1036,BKNG,"Apple has accumulated a large number of patents for payment processing and it’s very likely that that iBeacon will be rolled into its very own iWallet. Payments on its platform are currently handled by its Passbook system. Apple is one of the largest online retailers although it also sells through traditional retail outlets, so a payment platform from Apple may be expected to catch on very fast.
"
1037,BKNG,"The FIS Mobile Wallet from Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) is basically a bar code reader that feeds information related to the purchase into the user’s smartphone and uses it as a medium to transfer the information to the cloud. Online purchase of merchandise is also possible. The solution provides good security, since the transaction is carried out entirely in the cloud through the retailer’s and banker’s applications and personal information is not shared at the time of purchase.Visa (V  -  Free Report) has also jumped on the bandwagon, claiming that its V.me is a digital wallet with a difference. Not only can it be used to make mobile contactless payments (bar code, QR code or NFC), but it can also be used for online checkout (it remembers card details from several providers).
"
1038,BKNG,"Mobile banking is set to grow very strongly over the next few years, according to Juniper Research. The research firm estimates that a billion mobile devices (or 15% of the installed base) will be used for banking transactions by 2017, up from an expected 590 million in 2013. Most banks already have at least one mobile banking offering, with some larger banks offering more than one option. Messaging remains most popular across the world, but apps are likely to remain the preferred channel in most developed markets.
"
1039,BKNG,"Mobile banking has not picked up sufficiently in either the U.S. or Canada, due to security-related concerns. However, an analysis by Deloitte shows that it could become the most-preferred banking method by 2020. The study estimates that 20-25 million Generation-Y consumers will become new banking customers by 2015.
"
1040,BKNG,"It is believed that high smartphone penetration, higher income and greater digital sophistication will drive increased demand for mobile banking services. Since mobile banking is expected to be the most cost efficient for banks, investment in technology to improve and expand mobile banking services is likely to increase.Security
"
1041,BKNG,"With online transactions expected to boom over the next few years, the topmost concern remains security. While banks will spend significantly on secure payment systems, hackers are expected to have a field day, largely targeting the flood of customers going online. Last year saw a huge increase in security breaches, something that may be expected to continue.
"
1042,BKNG,"McAfee’s threat report for the fourth quarter of 2013 added 2.4 million new mobile malware samples. This is up 197% year over year. Moreover, new suspect URLs grew 40% in 2013 with new ransomware doubling from the fourth quarter of 2012. The report shows a growing tendency of malware producers to send handset information related to customer behavior and location details.
"
1043,BKNG,"What is even more alarming is that even “secure” payment platforms like digital wallets using NFC technology can now be infected by worms within close range of devices (“bump and infect”). An infected device can give out personal information during the payment process that can be used to steal from the wallet.
"
1044,BKNG,"Mobile security offerings currently come from AirWatch, Apple, Avast, Check Point, Cisco (CSCO), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Juniper (JNPR  -  Free Report), Kaspersky, McAfee, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), MobileIron, BlackBerry (BBRY), Symantec (SYMC  -  Free Report) and Trend Micro, among others.
"
1045,BKNG,"Alternative payment systems never really gained momentum in the past because of the low volume of transactions. However, as online transactions continue to increase, many more such systems could suddenly become available.
"
1046,BKNG,"We expect mobile security to become a major focus area for technology companies, since this is the stumbling block to payments through the mobile platform.Digital Advertising
"
1047,BKNG,"The U.S. digital advertising market has seen some very strong growth in the past few years, such that the discussion has shifted to its most effective channel, which is mobile. eMarketer estimates that while the total digital ad market will grow 47.6% from 2013 to 2017, mobile will grow 271.0%, with desktop declining 17.5%.
"
1048,BKNG,"Total growth rates are expected to continue declining: 12.6% in 2014, 10.3% in 2015, 9.2% in 2016 and 7.1% in 2017. Retail, financial services, consumer packaged goods (CPG) and travel in that order, are expected to drive this growth. The mobile platform will remain particularly strong, growing 56.0% in 2014, 41.8% in 2015, 33.1% in 2016 and 26.0% in 2017. Spending on mobile ads is expected to increase as a percentage of total spending on digital as well as total media ads in each of the years.
"
1049,BKNG,"The current strength in online advertising is coming primarily from the growing popularity of the display format. Of all the forms of online advertising, display (including video, banner ads, rich media and sponsorships) is expected to see the strongest growth over the next few years. The underlying drivers of growth of the display format are the continued increase in the number of users, greater propensity of users to consume online, a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the need to create brand awareness online.
"
1050,BKNG,"Google’s YouTube leads in the video segment. The increasing propensity to use programmatic buying techniques (automating the inventory buying process) is hurting both Google’s and Yahoo’s (YHOO) premium placements. Yahoo is currently focusing on the content side of things in order to boost ad revenue.Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) on the other hand has more relevant personal data, which advertisers like. It is also very strong on the mobile platform, which has been driving its results in recent times.
"
1051,BKNG,"While digital advertising spend has been moving to non-search portals, such as Facebook, search is likely to remain relevant and important. Google is the leader here and is using its other technologies (maps, voice, devices) to make its services more invaluable to users. It is also making a splash in the Internet of Things, with wearables, auto, TV and home automation products. If Android becomes ubiquitous, the opportunity to serve ads will be that much greater.
"
1052,BKNG,"Search advertising results are measurable, and therefore more predictable, than other media. This also makes the market more resilient in recessionary conditions, since advertisers are more confident about the results of their spending.
"
1053,BKNG,"Since ecommerce entails the buying and selling of goods or services over electronic systems, it includes companies that are totally dependent on these sales, those that are gradually moving to it, as well as those that want to use it partially. Therefore, the biggest sellers or the ones growing the strongest are not necessarily those that are solely dependent on the Internet. The following diagrams seek to explain the position of companies primarily dependent on the Internet for the distribution of their goods and services in the context of the Zacks Industry Rank.
"
1054,BKNG,"Two (Retail/Wholesale and Computer & Technology) of the 16 broad Zacks sectors are related to the ecommerce industry as depicted below.
"
1055,BKNG,"We rank the 264 industries across the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.
"
1056,BKNG,"The outlook for industries positioned at #88 or lower is 'Positive,' between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and #177 and higher is 'Negative.'
"
1057,BKNG,"Therefore, Internet Services – Delivery and Internet Commerce being in the 176th and 218th positions, respectively are in negative territory, with Internet Services (168th position) being neutral.
"
1058,BKNG,"So it is not surprising that the average rank of stocks in the Internet Services – Delivery industry is 3.12, for Internet Commerce, it is 3.29, while for Internet Services it is 3.09. [Note: Zacks Rank #1 denotes Strong Buy, #2 is Buy, #3 means Hold, #4 Sell and #5 Strong Sell].Earnings Trends
"
1059,BKNG,"The broader Retail/Wholesale sector, of which Internet Commerce is a part, should see improving growth rates.
"
1060,BKNG,"Total earnings for the sector are expected to increase 3.9% in the second quarter on revenue growth of 7.6%. This contrasts with an earnings growth of 0.4% based on revenue growth of 3.8% in the preceding quarter.
"
1061,BKNG,"The other companies we are discussing in the e-commerce outlook (Part 2) fall under the broader Technology sector. Here we see a decline in earnings and slight improvement in revenue.
"
1062,BKNG,"Specifically, earnings growth is expected to drop to 2.3% (from 4.4% in the previous quarter), while revenue growth is expected to be 3.7% (up from 2.7% in the previous quarter).OPPORTUNITIES
"
1063,BKNG,"The sector is under pressure right now, so we see very few opportunities. Most of the companies are dealing with significant investments or other growth-related issues, so it is hard get enthusiastic.
"
1064,BKNG,"In this environment, we continue to like Facebook because of its growing share of digital ad revenue and swelling user base. A recent report from Forrester indicates that Facebook remains extremely popular with teens, particularly the age group of 12-17, allaying fears that teens were abandoning the platform. Importantly, the company continues to innovate, frequently enhancing and/or making relevant changes to its platform and introducing new products for advertisers.
"
1065,BKNG,"The other company we are positive about is Priceline. The company has a strong international presence and is currently attempting to take share in the domestic market.
"
1066,BKNG,"Priceline is attacking on all fronts: it has increased offline advertising without cutting back on online advertising, and is offering discounts and building inventory. It also picked up restaurant reservations company OpenTable to get into that vertical, while using the closer customer interaction to pull customers onto its platform. Higher costs will impact near-term earnings, but the company is likely to see market share gains, which will be positive for longer-term growth.WEAKNESSES
"
1067,BKNG,"Yahoo is one of the few companies with significant growth issues. The company is tied up in a search agreement with Microsoft that is essentially transferring its search market share. With volumes looking unexciting and pricing under pressure from programmatic buying, the core business is under some pressure. Additionally, there is some uncertainty about the amount its Alibaba holdings will yield, which is keeping the shares range bound. CEO Mayer’s initiatives are not contributing materially to results just yet.
"
1068,BKNG,"Expedia doesn’t have the growth issues that Yahoo does, but the company is seeing growing competition from Priceline in North America, a region it has always dominated. Priceline has taken a very aggressive approach to build market share here and this is forcing Expedia to step up marketing costs.
"
1069,BKNG,"Chinese travel company Ctrip is seeing tremendous growth fueled by a growing middle class and increased consumerism in China, the shift from traditional to online media for booking travel and increased mobile usage. However, we are unable to recommend the shares because it is currently in investment mode to build position in the super-competitive Chinese market and has also bought ToursForFun a U.S. OTA to tap growth in the region.
"
1070,BKNG,"Similar is the case with Baidu (BIDU), the dominant search engine company of China. Baidu is the Google of China with tremendous opportunities. The company has been investing in the business to build a position in the mobile and video segments and the company is already seeing growing monetization on mobile. While integration of recent acquisitions and investment considerations could be a slight headwind in the next few quarters, the company is clearly moving in the right direction.
"
1071,BKNG,"Increased digitization, mobile adoption, international expansion and better analytics are key drivers.
"
1072,BKNG,"Ecommerce discussions often exclude online travel because this segment is relatively more mature with a lot of the growth coming from international expansion and continued to shift from offline to online channels. Moreover, the market is highly fragmented with just a few big players in a position to make a difference.
"
1073,BKNG,"But the many small players mean that there is stiff competition and rapid innovation that also drives up their costs. This in turn makes it difficult for them to operate, increasingly driving them toward acquisitions in order to take their technology and expertise to scale.
"
1074,BKNG,"The main drivers of the market are increased digitization, mobile adoption and international expansion. The stronger economy and higher spending levels provide the perfect backdrop for growth, but currency will remain a headwind this year.Travel
"
1075,BKNG,"The U.S. Commerce Department expects international travel to the U.S. to continue increasing over the next few years. In 2014, visitor volume increased 7%, well over the expected range of 3.7-4.2% a year from 2013 to 2017. Visits from 16 of the top 20 countries grew, of which 8 grew double-digits.
"
1076,BKNG,"The Travel and Tourism industry remains one of the country’s strongest. According to the BEA, the industry spending grew 2.0% in the first quarter of 2015, a deceleration from 4.9% growth in the previous quarter although it compared favorably with the real GDP decline of 0.7%.
"
1077,BKNG,"Transportation-related commodities and food services & drinking places were the points of weakness, growing just 1.9% and 2%, respectively in the last quarter. Spending on passenger air transportation improved to 3.9%. Traveler accommodation also grew. Overall pricing weakened sequentially. 
"
1078,BKNG,"According to the TravelClick North American Hospitality Review (NAHR), stronger average daily rates (ADRs) will drive first-quarter and full-year 2015 revenues in North America. Based on bookings and commitments up to the report date (Jan 28), the research firm sees a 4.5% increase in ADRs offsetting a 0.2% decline in occupancy. ADRs for the full year are expected to increase 4.5% with occupancy increasing 2.8%.
"
1079,BKNG,"According to the TravelClick North American Distribution Review for the first quarter, digital channels comprising OTAs, hotel websites and GDS continued to gain in popularity. The OTA channel grew 15.1% from a year ago, hotel websites grew 7.1% and GDS 1.1%. Direct-to-hotel and CRO declined 8.4% and 6.1%, respectively.
"
1080,BKNG,"Based on current booking trends, growth projections for the seasonally strong second and third quarters are a respective 4.3% and 5.9%.
"
1081,BKNG,"But with rapid technology-driven international expansion, collaborations and acquisitions/consolidations, global travel trends have become an important consideration for domestic operators. As a result, the rising middle class, increased digital sophistication and Internet connectivity in emerging high-growth markets are now important drivers.
"
1082,BKNG,"STR Global data for May 2015 shows that while occupancy is increasing across regions, this is coming at the cost of prices in emerging regions. Europe on the other hand is seeing currency headwinds while in the Americas the increased demand is being absorbed in higher prices.
"
1083,BKNG,"eMarketer is not very optimistic about global digital travel sales growth. According to the research firm, this is a more mature segment, so growth rates are decelerating compared to retail ecommerce where they are growing faster. As a result, it expects travel’s 34.1% share of U.S. ecommerce sales in 2013 to drop to 26.2% by 2018.
"
1084,BKNG,"However, mobile travel sales are expected to increase share of total mcommerce sales from 31.1% in 2014 to 32.8% in 2018. Overall, desktop travel sales will see continued declines over the forecast period with mobile travel sales decelerating but continuing to grow at double-digit rates.
"
1085,BKNG,"Further, Mexico, India, Spain, Italy and Norway are expected to have the highest shares of digital travel sales in the next five years, with Brazil, China, India, Mexico and Italy being the fastest growers.
"
1086,BKNG,"A recent PhoCusWright report mentions the top seven technology trends influencing the travel market. Accordingly, it appears that video is essential to draw customers and content marketing, guides, travel information and ROI tracking can all benefit from it.

"
1088,BKNG,"Trend three is increasing mobile usage, which the report says will account for 27% of online travel revenue by 2015.
"
1089,BKNG,"The fourth trend is in wearables, with Virgin Mobile and a tourism board in Florida already using Google Glass effectively for customer interaction and advertising, respectively. Using big data analytics and social media marketing are the sixth and seventh major trends, respectively.  
"
1090,BKNG,"The top travel booking sites are Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com (acquired by Priceline), Travelocity.com, Orbitz.com and Hotwire.com. Since Booking.com and Kayak are part of Priceline (PCLN) and the others a part of Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), this narrows down the top companies in the segment to Priceline and Expedia. However, there are several others worth considering that include Ctrip International, MakeMyTrip and Qunar, which floated its IPO this year.
"
1091,BKNG,"TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) is also leveraging its strength in referrals to enter the crowded travel booking space.Digital Advertising
"
1092,BKNG,"The U.S. digital advertising market has seen some very strong growth in the past few years, such that the discussion has shifted to its most effective channel, which is mobile. eMarketer estimates that while the total digital ad market will grow 47.6% from 2013 to 2017, mobile will grow 271.0%, with desktop declining 17.5%.

"
1094,BKNG,"The underlying drivers of growth are the continued increase in the number of netizens, greater propensity of users to consume online, a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the need to create brand awareness online.
"
1095,BKNG,"But the market is getting increasingly competitive and pushing players to investment and innovation. The increasing propensity to use programmatic buying techniques (automating the inventory buying process) hurts pricing at market leader Google and rivals Yahoo (YHOO) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report).
"
1096,BKNG,"Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) large and growing user base and trove of personal data is driving prices on the platform. A lot of other networking companies, such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Pintertest are also entering the digital advertising space.
"
1097,BKNG,"International expansion (where rates are lower) and transition to mobile (where conversion tends to be lower) are near-term negatives for these players.
"
1098,BKNG,"Digital advertising spend continues to move beyond search to social networks and content sites like Facebook, Netflix and Pandora, so the analytics side has been racing to catch up. Most of these players are acquiring or developing their own analytics capabilities, but content providers still have a preference for third-party solutions from companies like Nielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report), comScore and WPP.
"
1099,BKNG,"Ecommerce discussions often exclude online travel because this segment is relatively more mature, with a lot of the growth coming from international expansion. Moreover, the market is highly fragmented with just a few big players in a position to make a difference.
"
1100,BKNG,"But the many small players mean that there is stiff competition and rapid innovation that also drives up costs and shrinks margins. This in turn makes it difficult for smaller operators, who can’t compete on the cost side and increasingly look to be acquired in order to take their technology and expertise to scale.
"
1101,BKNG,"The main drivers of the market are increased digitization, mobile adoption and international expansion. The stronger economy and higher spending levels provide the perfect backdrop for growth, but currency will remain a headwind this year.Travel
"
1102,BKNG,"The U.S. Commerce Department expects international travel to the U.S. to continue increasing over the next few years. Visitor volume is currently expected to increase 3.7-4.2% a year from 2013 to 2017 leading to a 26% increase in the number of visitors by 2018.
"
1103,BKNG,"The Travel and Tourism industry remains one of the country’s strongest. According to the BEA, the industry grew 1.3% in the third quarter of 2014, which decelerated from 3.3% in the previous quarter and was much lower than the real GDP growth of 3.9%. Spending on passenger air transportation and recreation and entertainment were the weak points, declining 7.2% and 5.5%, respectively. Traveler accommodation spending grew 8.3%.  
"
1104,BKNG,"According to the TravelClick North American Hospitality Review (NAHR), stronger average daily rates (ADRs) will drive first-quarter and full-year 2015 revenues in North America. Based on bookings and commitments up to the report date (Jan 28), the research firm sees a 4.5% increase in ADRs offsetting a 0.2% decline in occupancy. ADRs for the full year are expected to increase 4.5%, with occupancy increasing 2.8%.
"
1105,BKNG,"A Feb 2015 report for fourth-quarter room night bookings indicates a customer preference shift in favor of OTAs, which grew 12.7%. While hotel websites and GDS also grew (6.8% and 4.6%, respectively), there was notable weakness in direct-to-property and CRO, which declined 5.2% and 5.3%, respectively.
"
1106,BKNG,"Share of room nights based on actual reservations in the first quarter of 2015 show that online channels (OTA, hotel websites) constitute the largest share of travel bookings (47%).
"
1107,BKNG,"But with rapid technology-driven international expansion, collaborations and acquisitions/consolidations, global travel trends have become an important consideration for domestic operators. As a result, the rising middle class, increased digital sophistication and Internet connectivity in emerging high-growth markets are now important drivers.
"
1108,BKNG,"STR Global data shows that performance across geographies was mixed in Jan 2015-
"
1109,BKNG,"eMarketer is not very optimistic about global digital travel sales growth. According to the research firm, this is a more mature segment, so growth rates are decelerating compared to retail ecommerce, where they are growing faster. As a result, it expects travel’s 34.1% share of U.S. ecommerce sales in 2013 to drop to 26.2% by 2018.
"
1110,BKNG,"However, mobile travel sales are expected to increase share of total mcommerce (mobile commerce) sales from 31.1% in 2014 to 32.8% in 2018. Overall, desktop travel sales will see continued declines over the forecast period with mobile travel sales decelerating but continuing to grow at double-digit rates.
"
1111,BKNG,"Further, Mexico, India, Spain, Italy and Norway are expected to have the highest shares of digital travel sales in the next five years, with Brazil, China, India, Mexico and Italy being the fastest growers.
"
1112,BKNG,"A recent PhoCusWright report mentions the top seven technology trends influencing the travel market. Accordingly, it appears that video is essential to draw customers and content marketing, guides, travel information and ROI tracking can all benefit from it. Trend two was with respect to search engines.
"
1113,BKNG,"The report says that Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) algorithms are now favoring site design rather than keywords, making SEO somewhat redundant. So site design and navigability are becoming essential to capture search traffic. Social media has increased the availability of reviews, so companies are increasing focus on the overall travel experience.
"
1114,BKNG,"Trend three is increasing mobile usage, which the report says will account for 27% of online travel revenue by 2015. The fourth trend is in wearables, with Virgin Mobile and a tourism board in Florida already using Google Glass effectively for customer interaction and advertising, respectively. Using big data analytics and social media marketing are the sixth and seventh major trends, respectively.  
"
1115,BKNG,"The top travel booking sites are Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com (acquired by Priceline), Travelocity.com, Orbitz.com and Hotwire.com. Since Booking.com and Kayak are part of Priceline (PCLN) and the others a part of Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), this narrows down the top companies in the segment to Priceline and Expedia. However, there are several others worth considering that include Ctrip International (CTRP  -  Free Report), MakeMyTrip (MMYT  -  Free Report) and Qunar (QUNR), which floated its IPO this year.
"
1116,BKNG,"The top site for travel content is TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report), visited by 60% of Americans when choosing a hotel. Google’s YouTube is growing in popularity and is the second in line, according to the MMGY Global's 2013 Portrait of American Travelers study.Digital Advertising
"
1117,BKNG,"The U.S. digital advertising market has seen some very strong growth in the past few years, such that the discussion has shifted to its most effective channel, which is mobile. eMarketer estimates that while the total digital ad market will grow 47.6% from 2013 to 2017, mobile will grow 271.0%, with desktop declining 17.5%.
"
1118,BKNG,"Total growth rates are expected to continue declining: 10.3% in 2015, 9.2% in 2016 and 7.1% in 2017. Retail, financial services, consumer packaged goods (CPG) and travel in that order, are expected to drive this growth. The mobile platform will remain particularly strong, growing 41.8% in 2015, 33.1% in 2016 and 26.0% in 2017. Spending on mobile ads is expected to increase as a percentage of total spending on digital as well as total media ads in each of the years.
"
1119,BKNG,"The underlying drivers of growth are the continued increase in the number of ""netizens,"" greater propensity of users to consume online, a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the need to create brand awareness online.
"
1120,BKNG,"But the market is getting increasingly competitive and pushing players to investment and innovation. The increasing propensity to use programmatic buying techniques (automating the inventory buying process) hurts pricing at market leader Google and rivals Yahoo (YHOO) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report). Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) large and growing user base and trove of personal data is driving prices on the platform. A lot of other networking companies, such as LinkedIn (LNKD), Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and Pintertest are also entering the digital advertising space.
"
1121,BKNG,"International expansion (where rates are lower) and transition to mobile (where conversion tends to be lower) are near-term negatives for these players.
"
1122,BKNG,"While digital advertising spend has been moving to non-search portals, such as Facebook, search is likely to remain relevant and important. Google is the leader here and is using its other technologies (YouTube, maps, voice, devices) to increase the value of its services. It is also making a splash in the Internet of Things, with wearables, auto, TV and home automation products. The popularity of Android will increase its opportunity to serve ads.
"
1123,BKNG,"The Q4 earnings season has effectively come to an end for most of the major sectors, with the Retail sector as the only one that has a significant number of reports still awaited. It has been a lackluster reporting season thus far, with a disconcerting mix of Energy sector weakness, dollar strength and global growth challenges not only weighing on Q4 results but also causing estimates for the current and following quarters to fall at a pace that we haven’t seen in recent periods.
"
1124,BKNG,"We will discuss what’s happening to current (and following) quarter estimates a little later, but let’s focus on the Retail sector for now which has a number of leaders like Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Priceline (PCLN), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and others on the docket this week. In total, we will get Q4 earnings reports from almost 400 companies this week, including 49 S&P 500 members. By the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from 440 S&P 500 members or 88% of the index’s total membership.
"
1125,BKNG,"Retail sector stocks have been strong performers lately, with sector stocks in the S&P 500 handily outperforming the broader index in both the year-to-date and trailing 52-weeks as well as in response to the results that have come out already.
"
1126,BKNG,"The retail sector results thus far don’t show any meaningful improvement over what we have been seeing from the sector in other recent periods. But investors seem to be holding out hope that the sector will be a key beneficiary of what is happening to oil prices. We haven’t really seen much evidence of that happening as yet, but this week’s commentary from Wal-Mart will give us some pointers how reasonable these hopes are.Retail Sector Scorecard
"
1127,BKNG,"As of Friday February 13th, we have seen Q4 results from 20 retailers in the S&P 500 index (out of the 42 total) that combined account for almost half of the sector’s total market cap in the index. Total earnings for these 20 retails are up +1.9% from the period last year, on +9.1% higher revenues, with 70% beating EPS estimates and 55% coming ahead of top-line expectations.
"
1128,BKNG,"The charts below compare the sector’s results thus far with what these same 20 retailers reported over the past year. As you can see, the earnings growth rate (+1.9%) is better than what we saw from the same group of companies in Q3, but is below the 4-qurater average, though the revenue growth rate is better. With respect to beats, more retailers are beating EPS estimates relative to Q3 as well as the 4-quarter average, while the revenue beat ratio is below Q3’s but better than the 4-qurater average.
"
1129,BKNG,"Combining the Retail sector earnings for the 20 companies that have come out with the 22 still to come, the sector’s total earnings in Q4 are expected to be up +2.7% on 5.3% higher revenues, with margins losing ground. This compares to earnings growth rates of +2.7% on +5.8% revenue gains in Q3. Margins have been an issue for the sector for quite some time, with management teams blaming the ‘overly promotional environment’ for the trend. As we have been flagging in this space repeatedly, the sector doesn’t have much of a revenue problem – they are bringing in the revenue dollars, they are unable to capture more of these revenue dollars as earnings.The Q4 Scorecard (as of 2/13/2015)
"
1130,BKNG,"We have seen Q4 results from 391 S&P 500 members that combined account for 85.0% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies are up +6.3% from the same period last year, with 69.9% beating EPS estimates. Total revenues are up +1.4% from the same period last year and 56.1% of them are coming ahead with top-line estimates.
"
1131,BKNG,"The table below shows the current scorecard for the S&P 500 indexNote: While we are quite further along in the reporting cycle for the S&P 500 index, we still have some ways to go for the small-cap indexes. At the end of the write-up, we share the Q4 Scorecard for the Russell 2000 index, where only 42.7% of the companies have reported results already.
"
1132,BKNG,"The reference to the favorable stock price response of Retail sector companies to the results thus far is evident from the ‘Earnings Impact’ column in the scorecard table (second last column). As you can see, the average stock price gain for the Retail sector stocks at +4.36% is the highest of all the sectors.
"
1133,BKNG,"There aren’t that many surprises with respect to earnings and revenue ‘surprises’, with beat ratios broadly tracking in-line with other recent periods even though revenue beat ratios are a tad on the low side. But the growth rates, particularly on the revenue side, are decidedly on the weak side relative to other recent periods.
"
1134,BKNG,"The charts below compare the results thus far with what we have seen from the same group of companies in 2014 Q3 and the average for the preceding four quarters.The ‘Apple Effect’
"
1135,BKNG,"The growth issues facing the large-cap companies seem to be non-existent for the largest of them all – Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report). As discussed in this space before, Apple’s top and bottom-line growth rates would be the envy of any company, let alone an operator this big. Apple’s revenue and earnings numbers are so big that they have a material bearing on the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index as well. You have to isolate the ‘Apple Effect’ to get a true sense of the Q4 growth pace at this stage in reporting cycle for the index as well as the Tech sector.  
"
1136,BKNG,"The charts below show a side-by-side comparison of how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates look with and without the iPhone maker’s contribution. Please note that the left side chart shows the growth rates for the 391 S&P 500 companies that have reported results already while the right side shows the growth rates for those companies without Apple.
"
1137,BKNG,"As you can see in the chart above, the aggregate Q4 growth rate drops from +6.3% earnings growth on +1.4% higher revenues with Apple to +4.6% earnings growth on 0.7% higher revenues without Apple. The iPhone maker is no doubt very big, but its contribution to overall earnings is even greater than its size. The company currently accounts for 19.4% of the total market capitalization of the entire Technology sector in the S&P 500 index, but it alone accounts for 29.6% of the sector’s total earnings in 2014 Q4. For the S&P 500 index as a whole, it accounts for 3.6% of the total market cap and 6.3% of total Q4 earnings.The Finance Drag
"
1138,BKNG,"In fairness to the aggregate growth picture, Apple isn’t the only outsized influence in the results – there is plenty more on the negative side that is dragging the growth rate down. Finance was an early drag, with tough comparisons at Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) restricting the sector’s earnings growth to a decline of -3.3% on +0.6% higher revenues. Excluding the drag from the Finance sector, total earnings for the remaining S&P 500 companies would be up +8.8% on +1.5% higher revenues. The +8.8% ex-Finance earnings growth rate is actually better than what we have been seeing from these companies in other recent quarters, though the revenue growth rate is still on the low side.
"
1139,BKNG,"The chart below compares the earnings and revenue growth rates thus far on an ex-Finance basis.Oil – The Biggest Drag
"
1140,BKNG,"The Energy sector’s travails are well known by now, a function of the extraordinarily sharp drop in oil prices in recent months. With results from 84.6% of the Energy sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 already, the sector’s earnings are down -17.3% on -15.9% lower revenues. In terms of positive surprises, this is actually better performance from this group of Energy sector companies than has been the case in other recent quarters, but the growth rates are extremely low.
"
1141,BKNG,"The chart below compares the Energy sector’s earnings and revenue growth rates thus far with what we have seen from the same group of Energy companies in other recent quarters.
"
1142,BKNG,"Had it not been for this oil-centric drag, the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 would be looking a lot better, as the side-by-side growth comparison chart below shows. Please note that the chart on the left side includes the Energy sector while the one of the right side is without the Energy sector.
"
1143,BKNG,"Perhaps the true growth picture is the one that excludes the effects of both oil and Apple. The chart below does exactly that – it excludes Apple and the Energy sector from the results thus far.
"
1144,BKNG,"Any way you look at it, the revenue growth rate is weak relative to what we have seen comparable periods in the recent past.  The Composite Q4 Picture
"
1145,BKNG,"Combining the actual results for the 391 S&P 500 companies that have reported with the 109 still-to-come reports, total Q4 earnings are expected to be up +6.4% on 1.5% higher revenues.
"
1146,BKNG,"Eight sectors – Transportation, Business Services, Medical, Utilities, Construction, Technology, Autos, and Aerospace –are expected to have double-digit earnings growth in Q4, while two sectors are expected to have lower total earnings this quarter relative to the year-earlier period. The Energy sector has the weakest growth profile for understandable reasons, with total earnings for the sector expected to be down -16.8% on -14.9% lower revenues.
"
1147,BKNG,"The table below presents the summary picture for Q4 contrasted with what companies actually reported in the Q3 earnings season.Falling Estimates
"
1148,BKNG,"Estimates for the current period (2015 Q1) have come down sharply, with total earnings for the quarter now expected to be down -3.3% from the same period last year, down from the +10.8% growth rate expected in early October. As was the case in Q4, Energy is the biggest driver of this negative revisions trend, but the picture isn’t that inspiring beyond the Energy sector either. While total Q1 earnings for the Energy sector were expected to be down (only) -35.6% in mid-December, they are now expected to be down -61.8% year over year.
"
1149,BKNG,"The chart below plots the evolution of current and following quarter estimates over the last 3-plus months. As you can see, the first half 2015 growth rate has effectively fallen victim to developments in the oil patch.
"
1150,BKNG,"The chart above is spotlighting the revisions trend for the first two quarters of the 2015, though the expected growth picture for the second half of the year has taken a big beating in recent days as well. In fact, the double-digit earnings growth expectation for 2015 has already evaporated and been pushed forward into 2016 now.  
"
1151,BKNG,"The chart below focuses solely on evolution of 2015 Q1 estimates and presents the evolving picture with and without the Energy sector. As you can see, the Energy sector is undoubtedly the biggest driver, but estimates have been coming down fairly sharply outside of the Energy sector as well.
"
1152,BKNG,"The green columns represent the aggregate growth expectation for the S&P 500 as a whole over different time periods since early October 2014; the grey column shows the same data on an ex-Energy basis.Russell 2000 Scorecard (as of Friday, February 13)
"
1153,BKNG,"We have seen Q4 results from 852 Russell 2000 members or 42.7% of the index’s total members. Total earnings for these 852 companies are up +21.8% from the same period last year on +10.6% higher revenues, with 48.8% beating EPS estimates and 36.6% coming ahead of top-line expectations.  
"
1154,BKNG,"The table below presents the Russell 2000 Scorecard
"
1155,BKNG,"This is actually better growth (both revenues as well earnings) that we have seen from this same group of Russell 2000 members in other recent periods, though the beat ratios don’t offer a clear definitive comparison. The chart below shows how the results thus far compare to other recent period.  
"
1156,BKNG,"The better growth rates reflect the largely domestic orientation of these companies relative to their large-cap peers and the smaller weight of the Energy sector in the index.  The Bottom Line
"
1157,BKNG,"As we have stated in this space before, the Q4 earnings season has essentially been a story of three inter-related factors – oil, the U.S. dollar and global economic growth. Oil aside, the other two factors have been at play in other recent quarters as well. But all three came together into their own this earnings season. We saw that play out in actual Q4 results and how estimates for the current and coming periods have unfolded. With no respite on any of those fronts, estimates likely have more to go before stabilizing.Note: Want more articles from this author?

1159,BKNG,"Although retail ecommerce is the segment that most of us are interested in, it is in fact just a part of the overall ecommerce market. Retailers and service providers generate just 5.2% and 3.1%, respectively of their revenues online, a slightly higher percentage than they did in the prior year. The U.S. Census Bureau categorizes these two segments as business-to-consumer (B2C).
"
1160,BKNG,"The industry is evolving very rapidly, so data collection and evaluation are particularly difficult. Consequently, one has to rely largely on surveys by both government and private agencies.
"
1161,BKNG,"In this section, we will discuss segments of the ecommerce market that do not relate directly to the retail of goods, or the technology used to pay for them and focus instead on travel and advertising.
"
1162,BKNG,"These markets are evolving rapidly with increased digitization, mobile adoption, industry consolidation and international expansion being the biggest drivers. The stronger economy and higher spending levels provide the perfect backdrop.Travel
"
1163,BKNG,"The U.S. Commerce Department expects international travel to the U.S. to continue increasing over the next few years. Visitor volume is currently expected to increase 3.7-4.2% a year from 2013 to 2017, leading to a 26% increase in the number of visitors by 2018.
"
1164,BKNG,"The Travel and Tourism industry remains one of the country’s strongest. According to the BEA, the industry grew 2.1% in the second quarter of 2014, which wasn’t, however, as strong as the real GDP growth of 4.2%. Spending on “food services and drinking places;” and recreation, entertainment and shopping grew 6.5 and 4.5%, respectively. Transportation also strengthened, driven by increased passenger air travel as offset by declines in other transportation categories.
"
1165,BKNG,"According to the TravelClick North American Hospitality Review (NAHR), third-quarter 2014 occupancy and average daily rates (ADRs) in North America grew 4.3% and 5.3%, respectively.
"
1166,BKNG,"Share of room nights based on actual reservations in the first quarter of 2014 show that online channels (OTA, hotel websites) already constitute the largest share of travel bookings (43%).
"
1167,BKNG,"But with rapid technology-driven international expansion, collaborations and acquisitions/consolidations, global travel trends have become an important consideration for domestic operators. As a result, the rising middle class, increased digital sophistication and Internet connectivity in emerging high-growth markets are now important drivers.
"
1168,BKNG,"STR Global data shows that performance across geographies was mixed in Sept. 2014:     
"
1169,BKNG,"Overall, global outbound trips grew 5% in 2013 with overnight accommodations increasing 4% and international travel spending increasing 6%. The Asia/Pacific region is expected to see the strongest growth this year (up 8%). South America will follow with 4%, Europe with 4% and North America thereafter with 3% [World Travel Monitor].
"
1170,BKNG,"eMarketer is less optimistic about global digital travel sales growth. According to the research firm, this is a more mature segment, so growth rates are decelerating compared to retail ecommerce where they are growing faster. As a result, it expects travel’s 34.1% share of U.S. ecommerce sales in 2013 to drop to 26.2% by 2018. However, mobile travel sales are expected to increase share of total mcommerce sales from 31.1% in 2014 to 32.8% in 2018. Overall, desktop travel sales will see continued declines over the forecast period with mobile travel sales decelerating but continuing to grow at double-digit rates.
"
1171,BKNG,"Further, Mexico, India, Spain, Italy and Norway are expected to have the highest shares of digital travel sales in the next five years, with Brazil, China, India, Mexico and Italy being the fastest growers.
"
1172,BKNG,"A recent PhoCusWright report mentions the top seven technology trends influencing the travel market. Accordingly, it appears that video is essential to draw customers and content marketing, guides, travel information and ROI tracking can all benefit from it. Trend two was with respect to search engines. The report says that Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) algorithms are now favoring site design rather than keywords, making SEO somewhat redundant. So site design and navigability are becoming essential to capture search traffic.
"
1173,BKNG,"Social media has increased the availability of reviews, so companies are increasing focus on the overall travel experience. Also trending is increasing mobile usage, which the report says will account for 27% of online travel revenue by 2015. The fourth trend is in wearables, with Virgin Mobile and a tourism board in Florida already using Google Glass effectively for customer interaction and advertising, respectively. Using big data analytics and social media marketing are the sixth and seventh major trends, respectively.  
"
1174,BKNG,"The top travel booking sites are Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com (acquired by Priceline), Travelocity.com, Orbitz.com and Hotwire.com. Since Booking.com and Kayak are part of Priceline (PCLN) and both Hotels.com and Hotwire.com part of Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), this narrows down the top companies in the segment to Priceline, Expedia, Orbitz Worldwide (OWW) and Travelocity. However, there are several others worth considering that include Ctrip International (CTRP  -  Free Report), MakeMyTrip (MMYT  -  Free Report) and Qunar (QUNR), which floated its IPO this year.
"
1175,BKNG,"The top site for travel content is TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report), visited by 60% of Americans when choosing a hotel. Google’s YouTube is growing in popularity and is the second in line, according to the MMGY Global's 2013 Portrait of American Travelers study.Digital Advertising
"
1176,BKNG,"The U.S. digital advertising market has seen some very strong growth in the past few years, such that the discussion has shifted to its most effective channel, which is mobile. eMarketer estimates that while the total digital ad market will grow 47.6% from 2013 to 2017, mobile will grow 271.0%, with desktop declining 17.5%.
"
1177,BKNG,"Total growth rates are expected to continue declining: 12.6% in 2014, 10.3% in 2015, 9.2% in 2016 and 7.1% in 2017. Retail, financial services, consumer packaged goods (CPG) and travel, in that order, are expected to drive this growth. The mobile platform will remain particularly strong, growing 56.0% in 2014, 41.8% in 2015, 33.1% in 2016 and 26.0% in 2017. Spending on mobile ads is expected to increase as a percentage of total spending on digital as well as total media ads in each of the years.
"
1178,BKNG,"The underlying drivers of growth are the continued increase in the number of ""netizens,"" greater propensity of users to consume online, a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the need to create brand awareness online.
"
1179,BKNG,"But the market is getting increasingly competitive and pushing players to investment and innovation. The increasing propensity to use programmatic buying techniques (automating the inventory buying process) hurts pricing at market leader Google and rivals Yahoo (YHOO) and Microsoft (MSFT). Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) large and growing user base and trove of personal data is driving prices on the platform. A lot of other networking companies, such as LinkedIn (LNKD), Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and Pintertest are also entering the digital advertising space.
"
1180,BKNG,"International expansion (where rates are lower) and transition to mobile (where conversion tends to be lower) are near-term negatives for these players.
"
1181,BKNG,"While digital advertising spend has been moving to non-search portals, such as Facebook, search is likely to remain relevant and important. Google is the leader here and is using its other technologies (YouTube, maps, voice, devices) to increase the value of its services. It is also making a splash in the Internet of Things, with wearables, auto, TV and home automation products. The popularity of Android will increase its opportunity to serve ads.

1182,BKNG,"The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends report.  To access the full article, please click here. Q4 Earnings Estimates Are Coming Down
"
1183,BKNG,"With more than 80% of Q3 results already on the books, the picture emerging from this reporting cycle is decent enough; it’s not great, but it’s not bad either.
"
1184,BKNG,"In terms of growth rates, beat ratios and guidance, it’s a mixed bag when Q3 results are viewed in the context of other recent periods. Some metrics are showing an improvement, such as a modestly bigger ratio of companies is beating earnings estimates and the revenue growth rate appears to have picked up. But other metrics are showing weakness, such as the relatively lower earnings growth rate and the fewer positive revenue surprises.
"
1185,BKNG,"The guidance picture is no different from what we have been seeing in recent quarters, with a majority of the companies providing guidance guiding lower, with Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report), Priceline (PCLN) and Este Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) as the latest in a long line of leading operators providing weak outlook.
"
1186,BKNG,"As a result, estimates for the current quarter (2014 Q4) are following the all-too-familiar pattern of sliding down, as the chart below clearly shows.
"
1187,BKNG,"In some aspects, the negative revisions trend for the current quarter is somewhat more pronounced than what we had seen at a comparable stage in the preceding reporting cycle. (More on that on page 10)Q3 Earnings Scorecard (as of November 5th, 2014)
"
1188,BKNG,"Including this morning’s earnings announcements, we now have Q3 results from 414 S&P 500 members that combined account for 86.7% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these 414 companies are up +7.4% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues, with 72.9% beating EPS estimates and 56.3% coming out with positive revenue surprises.
"
1189,BKNG,"The two charts below compare the Q3 growth rates and beat ratios for these 414 companies with what these same companies reported in 2014 Q2 and the 4-quarter average (through Q2).
"
1190,BKNG,"As you can see, the earnings and revenue growth performance for these 414 companies (+7.4% for earnings and +3.9% for revenues) are below what we got from these same companies in Q2, but compare favorably to the respective 4-quarter averages. With respect to surprises, the earnings and revenue beat ratios are following divergent paths, with earnings surprises notably more widespread while revenue surprises a little hard to come by.
"
1191,BKNG,"Looking at Q3 expectations as a whole, combining the actual results from the 414 S&P 500 members that have reported with estimates for the remaining 86, total earnings are expected to be up +6.3% on +3.7% higher revenues. The composite growth has started going up as more companies report and beat estimates. The overall level of total earnings in Q3 are on track to be the second highest ever, second only to the record level of the preceding quarter – 2014 Q2.Note: Want more articles from this author?

1193,BKNG,"Although retail ecommerce is the segment that most of us are interested in, it is in fact just a part of the overall ecommerce market. Retailers and service providers generate just 4.7% and 3.0%, respectively of their revenues online, a slightly higher percentage than they did in the prior year. The U.S. Census Bureau categorizes these two segments as business-to-consumer.
"
1194,BKNG,"According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the manufacturing sector is the largest contributor to e-commerce sales (49.3% of their total shipments), followed by merchant wholesalers (24.3% of their total sales). These two segments make up the business-to-business category.
"
1195,BKNG,"This places the business-to-business category at 90% of total ecommerce sales, with the balance coming from the business-to-consumer category. The latest numbers from the Bureau suggest that the fastest-growing segments were retail and wholesale. [All the above data from the U.S. Census Bureau relate to 2011, as published in May 2013.]
"
1196,BKNG,"The industry is evolving very rapidly, so data collection and evaluation are particularly difficult. Consequently, one has to rely largely on surveys by both government and private agencies.
"
1197,BKNG,"In this section, we will discuss segments of the ecommerce market than do not relate directly to the retail of goods, and focus instead on travel, payments, security and advertising.Travel
"
1198,BKNG,"The U.S. Commerce Department expects international travel to the U.S. to continue increasing over the next few years. Visitor volume is currently expected to increase 3.7-4.2% a year from 2013 to 2017 leading to a 26% increase in the number of users by 2018. Visitors from the Caribbean are expected to be the slowest-growing (1%). The Middle East, Asia and South America are expected to grow 67%, 60% and 52%, respectively.
"
1199,BKNG,"The fastest growth is expected to come from China (229%), Saudi Arabia (191%), Russian Federation (79%), Brazil (66%), Argentina (65%) and Columbia (54%).
"
1200,BKNG,"The Travel and Tourism industry remains one of the country’s strongest industries, although the third quarter of 2013 (latest available data) saw a deceleration in its growth rate. According to the BEA, lower air passenger travel as well as all other transportation-related commodities affected the industry during the quarter. As a result, the industry grew 2.5% in the quarter, below the real GDP growth of 3.6% (in the second quarter it grew 3.5% compared to GDP growth of 2.5%).
"
1201,BKNG,"The top travel booking sites are Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com (acquired by Priceline), Travelocity.com, Orbitz.com and Hotwire.com. Since Booking.com and Kayak are part of Priceline (PCLN) and both Hotels.com and Hotwire.com part of Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), this narrows down the top companies in the segment to Priceline, Expedia, Orbitz Worldwide (OWW) and Travelocity. However, there are several others worth considering that include Ctrip International (CTRP), MakeMyTrip (MMYT  -  Free Report), TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report), which was spun off from Expedia, and Qunar (QUNR), which recently had its IPO.
"
1202,BKNG,"Global outbound trips grew 4% in the first eight months of 2013 and are expected to grow 4-5% this year. The Asia/Pacific region is expected to see the strongest growth (up 9%), with China alone growing 18%. South America will follow with 6% growth followed by Europe at 3-4% and North America thereafter at 3% [World Travel Monitor 2013].
"
1203,BKNG,"According to the TravelClick North American Hospitality Review (NAHR), both occupancy and average daily rates (ADRs) in North America have been growing steadily through the end of 2013 and into 2014. The occupancy rate for 2013 was flattish in the Group segment and up across most categories within the Transient segment, with the only weakness attributable to government spending. The ADR increased across all categories and was helped by much stronger leisure spending. The trends going into 2014 were positive for both occupancy and ADR.
"
1204,BKNG,"Online travel agents (OTAs) continue to grow the fastest: up 15.2% in 2013, according to TravelClick. The hotels’ own websites were up 7.6%, with direct walk-ins and calls to the hotel down 0.4% and 4.3%, respectively. The global distribution system used by travel agents was up 3.5%.
"
1205,BKNG,"Share of room nights based on actual reservations in 2013:
"
1206,BKNG,"Smartphones are playing a key role in travel purchases, especially for last minute purchases. eMarketer estimates for smartphone travel researchers in the U.S. show the segment touching 50 million or 40% of all digital travel researchers in 2013, with total U.S. mobile travel sales touching $13.6 billion. Overall growth in digital travel sales is expected to moderate this year, with non-travel sales escalating. Mexico, India, Spain, Italy and Norway are expected to have the highest shares of digital travel sales in the next five years, with Brazil, China, India, Mexico and Italy being the fastest growers.
"
1207,BKNG,"The top site for travel content is TripAdvisor, visited by 60% of Americans when choosing a hotel. Google’s (GOOG) YouTube is now growing in popularity and is the second in line, according to MMGY Global's 2013 Portrait of American Travelers study.
"
1208,BKNG,"Another report by PhocusWright mentioned that when online penetration of the travel market reached 35% in any country, growth rates were likely to slow down to single-digits. The research firm mentioned that only the U.S., U.K. and Scandinavia had reached this level of penetration and most other markets across Europe, Asia and Latin America would continue to show good growth rates.Payment Systems
"
1209,BKNG,"With practically all market research indicating solid growth in ecommerce sales over the next few years, online players are vying with each other to come out with convenient and secure payment solutions. There are a host of payment systems in the market, but the greatest progress has been made on near field communication (NFC), quick response (QR) code, Soundwave and Bluetooth low energy (BLE).
"
1210,BKNG,"The latest to enter the fray is Amazon (AMZN) with its ""Login and Pay with Amazon"" system. Recognizing the most-used mobile and computing platforms, the system works on any desktop or tablets/smartphones running Android or iOS operating systems. Amazon’s payment system is likely to be popular with retailers given its huge customer base. For Amazon, it will also facilitate further data collection and position it strongly versus eBay’s (EBAY) Paypal and Google’s Digital Wallet.
"
1211,BKNG,"By far the most successful mobile payment system is Paypal, which has come a long way from a mere online payment service. Last year, the company inked a deal with Discover Network (DFS), the fourth largest credit card company, bringing its seven million plus retailers onto the Paypal network. Paypal has also signed up a large number of traditional retailers such as The Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Office Depot (OD). The company is now selling its marketing services as a bundled solution to retailers and the success of this strategy is evident in Paypal’s growth numbers.
"
1212,BKNG,"The new digital wallet from Google enables in-app purchase and mobile payments in addition to PoS purchases and money transfer. Other than the credit and debit card information, users can now store loyalty cards, discount coupons and offers that they can apply during purchase. More importantly, Google has found a way to reduce its dependence on NFC technology. A non-NFC-enabled phone can now use the Wallet to transfer funds from any of the accounts saved in it.
"
1213,BKNG,"Google now requires app developers for the Android platform to compulsorily use its payment service instead of a competing service from eBay or others. Despite the strong growth in Android devices, Google Play (its app store) has not done that well, partly because of the many steps to conversion that turns customers away. The simplification of the checkout process should help sales on Google Play.Apple (AAPL) has removed NFC compatibility from its devices and also introduced iBeacon, which is a BLE technology. The technology tracks the approximate location of a person, the time spent at different stores and even the location within the store. It has the potential to push highly relevant offers and promos at opportune moments.
"
1214,BKNG,"Apple has accumulated a large number of patents for payment processing and it’s very likely that that iBeacon will be rolled into its very own iWallet. Payments on its platform are currently handled by its Passbook system. Apple is one of the largest online retailers although it also sells through traditional retail outlets, so a payment platform from Apple may be expected to catch on very fast.
"
1215,BKNG,"The FIS Mobile Wallet from Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) is basically a bar code reader that feeds information related to the purchase into the user’s smartphone and uses it as a medium to transfer the information to the cloud. Online purchase of merchandise is also possible. The solution provides good security, since the transaction is carried out entirely in the cloud through the retailer’s and banker’s applications and personal information is not shared at the time of purchase.Visa (V  -  Free Report) has also jumped on the bandwagon, claiming that its V.me is a digital wallet with a difference. Not only can it be used to make mobile contactless payments (bar code, QR code or NFC), but it can also be used for online checkout (it remembers card details from several providers).
"
1216,BKNG,"Mobile banking is set to grow very strongly over the next few years, according to Juniper Research. The research firm estimates that a billion mobile devices (or 15% of the installed base) will be used for banking transactions by 2017, up from an expected 590 million in 2013.
"
1217,BKNG,"Most banks already have at least one mobile banking offering, with some larger banks offering more than one option. Messaging remains most popular across the world, but apps are likely to remain the preferred channel in most developed markets.
"
1218,BKNG,"Mobile banking has not picked up sufficiently in either the U.S. or Canada, due to security-related concerns. However, an analysis by Deloitte shows that mobile banking could become the most-preferred banking method by 2020. The study estimates that 20-25 million Generation-Y consumers will become new banking customers by 2015.
"
1219,BKNG,"It is believed that high smartphone penetration, higher income and greater digital sophistication will drive increased demand for mobile banking services. Since mobile banking is expected to be the most cost efficient for banks, investment in technology to improve and expand mobile banking services is likely to increase.Security
"
1220,BKNG,"With online transactions expected to boom over the next few years, the topmost concern remains security. While banks will spend significantly on secure payment systems, hackers are expected to have a field day, largely targeting the flood of customers going online. Last year saw a huge increase in security breaches, something that may be expected to continue.
"
1221,BKNG,"Recent research from McAfee revealed certain important facts: first, that mobile malware was primarily spreading through apps; second, 75% of infected apps came from Google Play; third, the chances of downloading malware or suspicious URLs was 1 in 6; fourth, 40% of malware families disrupt the system in more than one way, which is an indication of the increasing sophistication of hackers; and fifth, 23% of mobile spyware can result in data loss.
"
1222,BKNG,"What is even more alarming is that even “secure” payment platforms like digital wallets using NFC technology can now be infected by worms within close range of devices (“bump and infect”). An infected device can give out personal information during the payment process that can be used to steal from the wallet.
"
1223,BKNG,"Mobile security offerings currently come from AirWatch, Apple, Avast, Check Point, Cisco (CSCO), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Juniper (JNPR  -  Free Report), Kaspersky, McAfee, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), MobileIron, BlackBerry (BBRY), Symantec (SYMC  -  Free Report) and Trend Micro, among others.
"
1224,BKNG,"Alternative payment systems will continue to gain popularity. While some of these payment systems, such as PayPal, have been around for a while, other systems, such as Google’s digital wallet, V.me and the FIS Mobile Wallet are still in the making. Alternative payment systems never really gained momentum in the past because of the low volume of transactions. However, as online transactions continue to increase, many more such systems could suddenly become available.
"
1225,BKNG,"We expect mobile security to become a major focus area for technology companies, since this is the stumbling block to payments through the mobile platform (currently just 2% of U.S. online spending).Digital Advertising
"
1226,BKNG,"The U.S. digital advertising market has seen some very strong growth in the past few years, such that the discussion has shifted to its most effective channel, which is mobile. eMarketer estimates that while the total digital ad market will grow 47.6% from 2013 to 2017, mobile will grow 271.0%, with desktop declining 17.5%.
"
1227,BKNG,"Total growth rates are expected to continue declining: 12.6% in 2014, 10.3% in 2015, 9.2% in 2016 and 7.1% in 2017. Retail, financial services, consumer packaged goods (CPG) and travel in that order, are expected to drive this growth. The mobile platform will remain particularly strong, growing 56.0% in 2014, 41.8% in 2015, 33.1% in 2016 and 26.0% in 2017. Spending on mobile ads is expected to increase as a percentage of total spending on digital as well as total media ads in each of the years.
"
1228,BKNG,"The current strength in online advertising is coming primarily from the growing popularity of the display format. Of all the forms of online advertising, display (including video, banner ads, rich media and sponsorships) is expected to see the strongest growth over the next few years. The underlying drivers of growth of the display format are the continued increase in the number of users, greater propensity of users to consume online, a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the need to create brand awareness online.
"
1229,BKNG,"Google’s YouTube leads in the video segment. The increasing propensity to use programmatic buying techniques (automating the inventory buying process) is hurting both Google’s and Yahoo’s (YHOO) premium placements. Yahoo is currently focusing on the content side of things in order to boost ad revenue. Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) on the other hand has more relevant personal data, which advertisers like. It is also very strong on the mobile platform, which has been driving its results in recent times.
"
1230,BKNG,"While digital advertising spend has been moving to non-search portals, such as Facebook, search is likely to remain relevant and important. Google is the leader here and is using its other technologies (maps, voice, devices) to make its services more invaluable to users. Its Enhanced Campaigns strategy that seeks to integrate ad campaigns across platforms is also bearing fruit, as it is proving more profitable for advertisers.
"
1231,BKNG,"Search advertising results are measurable, and therefore more predictable, than other media. This also makes the market more resilient in recessionary conditions, since advertisers are more confident about the results of their spending.
"
1232,BKNG,"Since ecommerce entails the buying and selling of goods or services over electronic systems, it includes companies that are totally dependent on these sales, those that are gradually moving to it, as well as those that want to use it partially. Therefore, the biggest sellers or the ones growing the strongest are not necessarily those that are solely dependent on the Internet.
"
1233,BKNG,"The following diagrams seek to explain the position of companies primarily dependent on the Internet for the distribution of their goods and services in the context of the Zacks Industry Rank. Two (Retail/Wholesale and Computer & Technology) of the 16 broad Zacks sectors are related to the ecommerce industry as depicted below.
"
1234,BKNG,"We rank the 264 industries across the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.
"
1235,BKNG,"The outlook for industries positioned at #88 or lower is 'Positive,' between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and #177 and higher is 'Negative.'
"
1236,BKNG,"Therefore, Internet Services – Delivery and Internet Commerce being in the 212th and 233rd positions, respectively are in negative territory, with Internet Services (102nd position) being neutral.
"
1237,BKNG,"So it is not surprising that the average rank of stocks in the Internet Services – Delivery industry is 3.29, for Internet Commerce, it is 3.37, while for Internet Services it is 3.00. [Note: Zacks Rank #1 denotes Strong Buy, #2 is Buy, #3 means Hold, #4 Sell and #5 Strong Sell].Earnings Trends
"
1238,BKNG,"The broader Retail/Wholesale sector, of which Internet Commerce is a part, should have a moderate quarter. With roughly half the companies having reported thus far, the earnings beat ratio is 56.5% although the revenue beat ratio is much lower at 30.1%.
"
1239,BKNG,"Total earnings for the sector have increased 0.3% in the fourth quarter on revenue growth of 3.9%. This contrasts with an earnings growth of 10.3% based on revenue growth of 3.8% in the preceding quarter. This seems to indicate heavy discounts typical of the holiday season.
"
1240,BKNG,"The other companies we are discussing in the e-commerce outlook (Part 2) fall under the broader Technology sector. Here we see a fairly strong earnings beat ratio of 86.7%, supported by a revenue beat ratio of 73.3%.
"
1241,BKNG,"Total earnings in the sector were up 5.3% year over year similar to the 5.6% increase in the third quarter. Total revenues increased 5.2% from last year, up from 3.2% in the third quarter. The trend appears positive.
"
1242,BKNG,"Earnings estimates for 2013 and 2014 indicate better growth prospects in both years for Retail/Wholesale and Technology.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1243,BKNG,"The sector is under pressure right now, so we see very few opportunities. Most of the companies are dealing with significant investments or other growth-related issues, so it is hard get enthusiastic.
"
1244,BKNG,"The only stock that is worth recommending in this environment is Facebook. The company has seen its ad revenues swell, despite fears of reducing teen engagement and poorer-than-expected conversion for advertisers. Importantly, the company continues to innovate, frequently enhancing and/or making relevant changes to its platform. Therefore, one can’t ignore the strong growth numbers and resultant surge in estimates.WEAKNESSES
"
1245,BKNG,"On the other hand, we don’t see many significant weaknesses either.
"
1246,BKNG,"For instance, Chinese travel company Ctrip (CTRP) is seeing tremendous growth fueled by a growing middle class and increased consumerism in China, the shift from traditional to online media for booking travel and increased mobile usage. The company also reported solid results and provided strong revenue guidance. However, we are unable to recommend the shares because it is currently in investment mode to build position in the super-competitive Chinese market and has also bought ToursForFun a U.S. OTA to tap growth in the region.
"
1247,BKNG,"Similar is the case with Baidu (BIDU), the dominant search engine company of China. Baidu is the Google of China with tremendous opportunities. The company has been investing in the business to build a position in the mobile and video segments and the company is already seeing growing monetization on mobile. While integration of recent acquisitions and investment considerations could be a slight headwind in the next few quarters, the company is clearly moving in the right direction.
"
1248,BKNG,"The Electronic Commerce, or e-commerce industry is one of the most progressive sectors of the economy. The industry is evolving very rapidly, so data collection and evaluation are particularly difficult. Consequently, one has to rely largely on surveys by both government and private agencies.
"
1249,BKNG,"According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the manufacturing sector is the largest contributor to e-commerce sales (49.3% of their total shipments), followed by merchant wholesalers (24.3% of their total sales). These two segments make up the business-to-business category.
"
1250,BKNG,"Retailers and service providers generated just 4.7% and 3.0%, respectively of their revenues online, a slightly higher percentage than they were in the prior year. The Bureau categorizes these two segments as business-to-consumer.
"
1251,BKNG,"This places the business-to-business category at 89% of total ecommerce sales, with the balance coming from the business-to-consumer category. The latest numbers from the Bureau suggest that the fastest-growing segments were retail and wholesale. [All the above data from the U.S. Census Bureau relate to 2011, as published in May 2013].
"
1252,BKNG,"The U.S. Commerce Department estimates that ecommerce sales in the country grew 16.9% in 2013 to reach $263.3 billion.Retail
"
1253,BKNG,"Total retail e-commerce grew 3.4% sequentially and 16.0% year over year to 6% of total retail sales in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to the quarterly retail trade survey by the Census Bureau. Forrester Research estimates that this share will go up to 10% by 2017.
"
1254,BKNG,"comScore data (as compiled in the table below) indicates that this segment recovered very quickly from the economic downturn and continued to grow at an accelerated rate over the last few years.Key Drivers
"
1255,BKNG,"Since the industry is in evolution, the drivers are changing. For instance, the initial push came from the time savings and convenience of online transactions. To this were added the benefits of comparison shopping and personal recommendations. As technology required for personalized recommendations developed, became more available and its benefits more evident, most e-tailers started adding the feature until it is now considered a must-have.
"
1256,BKNG,"Today, the biggest driver of growth in the industry is the adoption of smartphones, tablets and other mobile Internet devices. In fact, trends indicate that consumers prefer mobile browsers when shopping, searching and entertaining themselves, while preferring apps for navigation and acquiring information.
"
1257,BKNG,"comScore sees global mobile Internet users increasing very rapidly, with mobile as a percentage of total ecommerce sales (excluding travel) going from 11% in 2012 to 15% by the end of 2013. This share is expected to go up to 26% in 2017.
"
1258,BKNG,"Smartphones and tablets accounted for 6.0% and 3.5% of total ecommerce sales in the first half of the year, according to comScore, with event tickets and apparel and accessories being the most popular items on mobile devices. eMarketer estimates that tablets generated 65% of m-commerce sales in 2013, with smartphones accounting for the rest.
"
1259,BKNG,"While both tablets and smartphones are extremely convenient when on the move, tablets have several additional advantages. In fact they are a boon to the ecommerce industry, since the larger screens offer better visibility of online stores and merchandise, thus facilitating purchases.
"
1260,BKNG,"Average spending per user on tablets is therefore 20% higher than on smartphones but since more people have smartphones, their overall share of ecommerce spending is lower. Given the unique advantages of smartphones and tablets, it appears that they are working in conjunction to boost total online retail sales. Additionally, the inherent cost savings and convenience of “showrooming” ensures that the trend will continue.  
"
1261,BKNG,"Continued advancements in technology are improving navigation and customer experience on ecommerce sites, which is improving reviews and thus drawing more traffic to the sites.
"
1262,BKNG,"The digital consumption of books, music, video and games all over the world is extending the reach of these goods and thereby boosting sales. Therefore, previously unconnected electronic goods, such as TVs and game consoles are now being modified to enable connectivity. On the other side of the fence, online versions of books, music, video and games that can be downloaded and consumed on a traditional computer or any other connected device are becoming available.
"
1263,BKNG,"Since the shift in consumption patterns is resulting in multi-functional electronic gadgets that are no longer optimized for a particular activity, there is a great drive to develop technologies that could improve the quality of each experience.Free shipping remains a major lure.Top-Selling Items
"
1264,BKNG,"The 10 hottest individual product categories are women’s apparel, books, computer hardware, computer software, apparel, toys/video games, video DVDs, health and beauty, consumer electronics and music.Apparel is a huge market and although online sales are currently under 10% of total apparel sales, the category already generates the most dollars. Selling tools, such as zoom, color swatching and configurators are helping the process. Even primarily brick-and-mortar outfits like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) sees that consumers purchasing through multiple channels (online and offline stores) tend to spend more.
"
1265,BKNG,"This is encouraging traditional retailers to offer an online store to supplement their physical stores. Online sales also show better conversions since searches usually draw consumers with a prior intention to purchase. eMarketer estimates that apparel will be the fastest-growing category over the next few years, making up around 20% of total retail ecommerce sales by 2016.
"
1266,BKNG,"The increase in technology purchases over the Internet is driven by not only individual consumers, but also companies and governments. The efficient and timely processing of orders, choice of payment options, subscription-selling and sales under the SaaS model are all facilitators. eMarketer estimates that online sales of consumer electronics goods will nearly double over the next four years to touch $80.2 billion by 2016.
"
1267,BKNG,"The Association of American Publishers says that ebook sales in the U.S. grew 34% in 2012, following triple-digit growth in the four preceding years. Growth trends in 2013 according to last-available reports indicate tough comps for the children’s category that are offsetting increases in adult and religious categories. With a penetration rate in the mid-teens percentage range, scope for market expansion is present.
"
1268,BKNG,"However, the shift in preference from e-readers to tablets that offer other forms of entertainment, such as movies, games, songs and so on, is a deterrent (a Bowker Market Research survey and wsj.com). U.S. players continue to see strength in international markets. Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) are the primary channels facilitating international expansion, although other smaller players and local companies in international markets are also playing a part.
"
1269,BKNG,"Nearly 87% of the Internet-using audience in the U.S. watched videos in December. Google (GOOG) sites remained the forerunner facilitating online video consumption, with significantly higher unique viewers (UVs) than any of the others. Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), which has moved up the ranks pretty fast (helped by 6-second Vine videos and auto-load videos), maintained the second position. AOL Media Network, Yahoo sites, NDN sites and Amazon sites took the next few positions, with VEVO (in which Google’s YouTube recently acquired a stake) coming in at number seven. AOL topped the list as far as ads viewed were concerned (helped by the Adap.tv acquisition) with Liverail and Google coming in second and third. [comScore estimates, Jan 2014]
"
1270,BKNG,"The Cisco VNI initiative has forecast global consumer Internet video traffic to increase from 57% of total consumer Internet traffic in 2012 to 69% in 2017, with Internet TV increasing 5X by then and VoD tripling. This represents tremendous opportunity in terms of video content sales and ad revenues.
"
1271,BKNG,"The digital consumption of music has seen huge growth since Apple announced its first iPod. Amazon and others are also seeing their business grow. In 2013 however, digital track sales declined around 6% while digital album sales stayed flat (Nielsen). The decline is attributable to streaming services, such as YouTube and Spotify, which saw volumes increase 32%. A recent IFPI report shows that digital music could finally bring a turnaround in the music business, which has been in the doldrums for many years. While piracy remains a major concern, licensed and ad supported music services are growing in popularity.  
"
1272,BKNG,"The gaming segment has suffered over the last few quarters, impacted by the economic slowdown that affected consumer spending. However, while this affected total gaming spend, it did not affect the online segment, which gained from the increasing digitization of games, the desire to play across multiple platforms and the availability of free-to-play games to draw customers.
"
1273,BKNG,"As a result, sales through online channels continue to grow at the expense of traditional retail. The release of the new Play Station 4 from Sony and Xbox One from Microsoft are also helping sales right now.
"
1274,BKNG,"Since video, games and music are often social activities, they are increasingly being marketed on social platforms such as Facebook and Pinterest.
"
1275,BKNG,"Facebook’s SocialStore, as it is called uses MarketLive's Intelligent Commerce Platform that enables marketers to display product information, promotions/discounts, shopping carts and check-out options. Both comparative shopping and comparative pricing are possible. The basic advantages of the system that are currently being touted are that it allows easy brand building, creates meaningful commercial relationships and makes use of account-holders’ social connections to attract new buyers.
"
1276,BKNG,"An E-tailing Group study reveals that of 100 U.S. consumer product merchants with e-commerce websites surveyed, 98 had a Facebook account. Around 90% of these redirected the user to the merchant’s own page, 96% had loaded brand-building videos, 56% had product-oriented videos, 44% had store locators and 38% had promotions.
"
1277,BKNG,"Facebook remains the leader by far in the social networking space, with monthly average users that are significantly higher than other networks such as Tumblr, Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn and Others. Its recent acquisition of WhatsApp ensures that user growth will remain very strong, despite the strength at peers. Engagement on Facebook also compares favorably with its peers.
"
1278,BKNG,"Selling discount coupons is also helping retail. Groupon (GRPN) is the leader here, which along with its closest rival LivingSocial offer discount coupons with a very low shelf life from local players looking for sales. The company offers huge discounts to attract buyers and collects a percentage of the sales thus generated. This kind of business is very competitive, since it has very low barriers to entry.
"
1279,BKNG,"As a result, not just Amazon and Google, but also a host of other much smaller parties have started doing some business in this format. Technology investments are also required in order to serve customer needs effectively. Considering the prospects, we don’t see the platform as a major contributor to e-commerce sales in the near term.Forecast for 2013
"
1280,BKNG,"A recent report from Forrester indicates that online spending (excluding travel) will increase at a 10% CAGR to reach $370 billion by 2017. Western Europe is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11% to 2017. The Asia/Pacific region will emerge as the largest ecommerce market this year, pushing ahead of North America for the first time.
"
1281,BKNG,"Since ecommerce entails the buying and selling of goods or services over electronic systems, it includes companies that are totally dependent on these sales, those that are gradually moving to it, as well as those that want to use it partially. Therefore, the biggest sellers or the ones growing the strongest are not necessarily those that are solely dependent on the Internet.

"
1291,BKNG,"Earnings estimates for 2013 and 2014 indicate better growth prospects in both years for Retail/Wholesale and Technology.Market Position
"
1292,BKNG,"comScore estimates that Amazon remains the leading Internet retailer based on unique visitors (UVs) in Dec 2013, followed by eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT  -  Free Report), Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report), Apple and Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), in that order. The top 3 have a much higher penetration on both Android and iOS platforms.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1293,BKNG,"Opportunities are hard to come by considering the way the sector is doing now. There are huge growth prospects, so companies are mostly in the investment mode. Naturally, at this stage there are execution risks, or at least some uncertainty regarding the time by which investments will bear fruit.
"
1294,BKNG,"In this environment, Priceline.com (PCLN) is one of the few stocks with some momentum. The company reported solid results and looks set to ride the growth wave.
"
1295,BKNG,"We also see estimates for Autobytel (ABTL) going up, attributable to a refocusing of its business and a demonstrated ability to deliver a solid lead generation business. The company has not done too well in the last few years due to its dependence on macro factors particularly with respect to the automotive industry. It also needed to trim its operating structure. With this out of the way, Autobytel should be able to generate steadier returns.WEAKNESSES
"
1296,BKNG,"Nearly all the Internet retailers have issues at present. That’s because Internet retailing requires proper fulfillment and a solid technology platform to be successful and both these factors become difficult as the companies grow.
"
1297,BKNG,"Moreover, the pursuit of growth in international markets is an absolute necessity, because stealing business from traditional retailers can only take them so far. Besides, traditional retailers have become wiser and many have developed their own e-tailing platform.
"
1298,BKNG,"Generally, estimates have been coming down for a large number of companies, mostly because of execution uncertainties related to their investments. Some of these that we would like to caution against include Amazon.com, eBay, Blue Nile (NILE) and Autobytel.
"
1299,BKNG,"The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends report.  To access the full article, please click here. Q4 Earnings Estimates Are Coming Down
"
1300,BKNG,"With more than 80% of Q3 results already on the books, the picture emerging from this reporting cycle is decent enough; it’s not great, but it’s not bad either.
"
1301,BKNG,"In terms of growth rates, beat ratios and guidance, it’s a mixed bag when Q3 results are viewed in the context of other recent periods. Some metrics are showing an improvement, such as a modestly bigger ratio of companies is beating earnings estimates and the revenue growth rate appears to have picked up. But other metrics are showing weakness, such as the relatively lower earnings growth rate and the fewer positive revenue surprises.
"
1302,BKNG,"The guidance picture is no different from what we have been seeing in recent quarters, with a majority of the companies providing guidance guiding lower, with Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report), Priceline (PCLN) and Este Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) as the latest in a long line of leading operators providing weak outlook.
"
1303,BKNG,"As a result, estimates for the current quarter (2014 Q4) are following the all-too-familiar pattern of sliding down, as the chart below clearly shows.
"
1304,BKNG,"In some aspects, the negative revisions trend for the current quarter is somewhat more pronounced than what we had seen at a comparable stage in the preceding reporting cycle. (More on that on page 10)Q3 Earnings Scorecard (as of November 5th, 2014)
"
1305,BKNG,"Including this morning’s earnings announcements, we now have Q3 results from 414 S&P 500 members that combined account for 86.7% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these 414 companies are up +7.4% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues, with 72.9% beating EPS estimates and 56.3% coming out with positive revenue surprises.
"
1306,BKNG,"The two charts below compare the Q3 growth rates and beat ratios for these 414 companies with what these same companies reported in 2014 Q2 and the 4-quarter average (through Q2).
"
1307,BKNG,"As you can see, the earnings and revenue growth performance for these 414 companies (+7.4% for earnings and +3.9% for revenues) are below what we got from these same companies in Q2, but compare favorably to the respective 4-quarter averages. With respect to surprises, the earnings and revenue beat ratios are following divergent paths, with earnings surprises notably more widespread while revenue surprises a little hard to come by.
"
1308,BKNG,"Looking at Q3 expectations as a whole, combining the actual results from the 414 S&P 500 members that have reported with estimates for the remaining 86, total earnings are expected to be up +6.3% on +3.7% higher revenues. The composite growth has started going up as more companies report and beat estimates. The overall level of total earnings in Q3 are on track to be the second highest ever, second only to the record level of the preceding quarter – 2014 Q2.Note: Want more articles from this author?

1310,BKNG,"Average Grade for Q3 Earnings Season
"
1311,BKNG,"We still have plenty of Q3 earnings reports to come, but the bulk of the earnings season is now behind us, with results from 363 S&P 500 companies already out as of Friday, October 31st. The Retail sector is the only one where more than half of the sector’s companies have yet to report Q3 results. For the remaining sectors, the reporting season has ended for 2 – Autos and Aerospace – whole 4 other sectors have Q3 results for 90% or more of their total market caps.   
"
1312,BKNG,"More than a 1000 companies will be reporting results this week, including 87 S&P 500 members. By the end of this week, we will have Q3 earnings reports from 450 S&P 500 companies, with the Retail sector as the only one that will have any sizable number of reports still awaited at that stage.
"
1313,BKNG,"We grade this earnings season as about ‘average’ – it isn’t good, but it isn’t bad either. To explain our ‘average’ grade, we share two types of charts below that will show how the results thus far compare with the past and what’s happening to estimates for the current period (2014 Q4).
"
1314,BKNG,"The two side-by-side charts below compare the results thus far what we had seen from the same group of S&P 500 members in Q2 and other preceding quarters (the 4-Quarter Average is the four quarters through 2014 Q2). The left hand side chart shows the growth rate for earnings (orange) and revenues (green) and the right side chart shows the beat ratios. The data in these charts is for the 363 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q3 as of Friday, October 31st.
"
1315,BKNG,"As you can see, it’s hard to make one all-encompassing narrative for the reporting cycle, other than to say that it’s not materially different from what we have been seeing from these companies in other recent quarters, particularly on the growth front. Beat ratios appear to be diverging from the norm a bit – with the Q3 earnings beat ratios modestly tracking above recent levels while revenue beat rates are on the weak side.
"
1316,BKNG,"One could argue that this isn’t bad performance and we are being harsh in giving this reporting cycle an ‘average’ grade. That’s a fair comment, but our grade also reflects how the results thus far, particularly management guidance, are impacting estimates for the current period (2014 Q4).
"
1317,BKNG,"The chart below shows what’s happening to Q4 estimates as companies have been releasing Q3 results. As you can see, estimates are moving down
"
1318,BKNG,"This negative revisions trend isn’t new either – we have been seeing this quarter after quarter for more than two years now. In some respects, the pace and magnitude of negative revisions at this stage is exceeding what we had been seeing at comparable stages in the last few quarters.The Q3 Scorecard (as of October 31st)
"
1319,BKNG,"We have seen Q3 results from 363 S&P 500 members that combined account for 79.2% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies are up +7.2% from the same period last year, with 72.5% of the companies beating earnings estimates. Total revenues are up +3.9% and 52.1% have come ahead of top-line estimates.
"
1320,BKNG,"The chart below shows the current Q3 earnings Scorecard
"
1321,BKNG,"As you can see, the earnings growth rate for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors is in double digits, with Basic Materials (up +22.9%), Utilities (+14.9%), and Medical (+14.2%) having the strongest growth rates. The Materials strength is a reflection of increased demand for this economically sensitive sector in these troubled times, but relatively easier comparisons for the Chemicals (the largest industry in the sector) and Steel industries.  
"
1322,BKNG,"The chart below shows the industry level scorecard for the Basic Materials sector
"
1323,BKNG,"On the flip side, we have just a couple of negative signs on the growth front, with Autos down -21.6% and Retail down -1.3%. We know that the automakers were struggling with product recalls and the Retail sector still has plenty of reports to come. The hope is that the falling gasoline prices will help the sector this holiday season, though recent commentary from Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) doesn’t bear that out.Mixed Tech Results
"
1324,BKNG,"The Tech sector where we have seen results from 81.4% of the sector’s market cap has been a relative laggard. Total earnings for the 44 Tech sector companies (out of 65 in the S&P 500 index) are up +6.0% on +9.1% higher revenues, with 72.7% beating EPS estimates and 61.4% coming ahead of top-line estimates. The beat ratios for the sector were tracking below historical levels earlier in the reporting cycle, but are now tracking above recent historical levels on the earnings front and a bit below on the revenue side.
"
1325,BKNG,"As the chart below shows, the earnings growth rate is notably weaker than what we have seen from the cohort of 44 companies in other recent quarters, though the revenue growth rate is better.  The Composite Picture
"
1326,BKNG,"The table below shows a composite (or blended) summary picture of Q3 that combines actual results from the 363 S&P 500 members that have reported with estimates for the remaining 137 index members. As you can see, total earnings are expected to be up +5.9% from the same period last year on +3.2% higher revenues and modest margin gains. The expected growth rate for Q3 has been steadily improving in recent days as companies report results and beat estimates.
"
1327,BKNG,"Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached an all-time quarterly record in 2014 Q2 and current estimates for Q3 put the quarterly total as the second highest ever. But given the historical trend of roughly two-thirds of the companies beating earnings estimates, the final Q3 tally will likely be right in the preceding quarter’s record vicinity. The chart below shows that current consensus estimates reflect record tallies in the following quarters.  
"
1328,BKNG,"As mentioned earlier, estimates have been coming down lately and the revisions trend will likely accelerate as more consumer centric companies report in the coming days.Note: Want more articles from this author?

1340,BKNG,"Average Grade for Q3 Earnings Season
"
1341,BKNG,"We still have plenty of Q3 earnings reports to come, but the bulk of the earnings season is now behind us, with results from 363 S&P 500 companies already out as of Friday, October 31st. The Retail sector is the only one where more than half of the sector’s companies have yet to report Q3 results. For the remaining sectors, the reporting season has ended for 2 – Autos and Aerospace – whole 4 other sectors have Q3 results for 90% or more of their total market caps.   
"
1342,BKNG,"More than a 1000 companies will be reporting results this week, including 87 S&P 500 members. By the end of this week, we will have Q3 earnings reports from 450 S&P 500 companies, with the Retail sector as the only one that will have any sizable number of reports still awaited at that stage.
"
1343,BKNG,"We grade this earnings season as about ‘average’ – it isn’t good, but it isn’t bad either. To explain our ‘average’ grade, we share two types of charts below that will show how the results thus far compare with the past and what’s happening to estimates for the current period (2014 Q4).
"
1344,BKNG,"The two side-by-side charts below compare the results thus far what we had seen from the same group of S&P 500 members in Q2 and other preceding quarters (the 4-Quarter Average is the four quarters through 2014 Q2). The left hand side chart shows the growth rate for earnings (orange) and revenues (green) and the right side chart shows the beat ratios. The data in these charts is for the 363 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q3 as of Friday, October 31st.
"
1345,BKNG,"As you can see, it’s hard to make one all-encompassing narrative for the reporting cycle, other than to say that it’s not materially different from what we have been seeing from these companies in other recent quarters, particularly on the growth front. Beat ratios appear to be diverging from the norm a bit – with the Q3 earnings beat ratios modestly tracking above recent levels while revenue beat rates are on the weak side.
"
1346,BKNG,"One could argue that this isn’t bad performance and we are being harsh in giving this reporting cycle an ‘average’ grade. That’s a fair comment, but our grade also reflects how the results thus far, particularly management guidance, are impacting estimates for the current period (2014 Q4).
"
1347,BKNG,"The chart below shows what’s happening to Q4 estimates as companies have been releasing Q3 results. As you can see, estimates are moving down
"
1348,BKNG,"This negative revisions trend isn’t new either – we have been seeing this quarter after quarter for more than two years now. In some respects, the pace and magnitude of negative revisions at this stage is exceeding what we had been seeing at comparable stages in the last few quarters.The Q3 Scorecard (as of October 31st)
"
1349,BKNG,"We have seen Q3 results from 363 S&P 500 members that combined account for 79.2% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies are up +7.2% from the same period last year, with 72.5% of the companies beating earnings estimates. Total revenues are up +3.9% and 52.1% have come ahead of top-line estimates.
"
1350,BKNG,"The chart below shows the current Q3 earnings Scorecard
"
1351,BKNG,"As you can see, the earnings growth rate for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors is in double digits, with Basic Materials (up +22.9%), Utilities (+14.9%), and Medical (+14.2%) having the strongest growth rates. The Materials strength is a reflection of increased demand for this economically sensitive sector in these troubled times, but relatively easier comparisons for the Chemicals (the largest industry in the sector) and Steel industries.  
"
1352,BKNG,"The chart below shows the industry level scorecard for the Basic Materials sector
"
1353,BKNG,"On the flip side, we have just a couple of negative signs on the growth front, with Autos down -21.6% and Retail down -1.3%. We know that the automakers were struggling with product recalls and the Retail sector still has plenty of reports to come. The hope is that the falling gasoline prices will help the sector this holiday season, though recent commentary from Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) doesn’t bear that out.Mixed Tech Results
"
1354,BKNG,"The Tech sector where we have seen results from 81.4% of the sector’s market cap has been a relative laggard. Total earnings for the 44 Tech sector companies (out of 65 in the S&P 500 index) are up +6.0% on +9.1% higher revenues, with 72.7% beating EPS estimates and 61.4% coming ahead of top-line estimates. The beat ratios for the sector were tracking below historical levels earlier in the reporting cycle, but are now tracking above recent historical levels on the earnings front and a bit below on the revenue side.
"
1355,BKNG,"As the chart below shows, the earnings growth rate is notably weaker than what we have seen from the cohort of 44 companies in other recent quarters, though the revenue growth rate is better.The Composite Picture
"
1356,BKNG,"The table below shows a composite (or blended) summary picture of Q3 that combines actual results from the 363 S&P 500 members that have reported with estimates for the remaining 137 index members. As you can see, total earnings are expected to be up +5.9% from the same period last year on +3.2% higher revenues and modest margin gains. The expected growth rate for Q3 has been steadily improving in recent days as companies report results and beat estimates.
"
1357,BKNG,"Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached an all-time quarterly record in 2014 Q2 and current estimates for Q3 put the quarterly total as the second highest ever. But given the historical trend of roughly two-thirds of the companies beating earnings estimates, the final Q3 tally will likely be right in the preceding quarter’s record vicinity. The chart below shows that current consensus estimates reflect record tallies in the following quarters.  
"
1358,BKNG,"As mentioned earlier, estimates have been coming down lately and the revisions trend will likely accelerate as more consumer centric companies report in the coming days.Note: Want more articles from this author?

"
1360,BKNG,"On a busy earnings day, we will have AIG (AIG  -  Free Report), Herbalife (HLF  -  Free Report) and Sprint (S  -  Free Report) report results after the close.
"
1361,BKNG,"Earnings ESP or Expected Surprise Prediction, our proprietary leading indicator of positive earnings surprises, is showing AIG beating EPS estimates.
"
1362,BKNG,"Our research shows that companies with positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank of 1, 2 or 3 are highly likely to beat earnings estimates. AIG has Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and ESP of +0.9%.

1372,BKNG,"Overall, we will be getting results from 376 companies this week, including 16 S&P 500 members. By the end of this week, we will have seen Q2 results from almost 94% of the S&P 500 members (469 in total). This week’s reports are heavily weighted toward the Retail sector, with major operators in the space like Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), and others coming out with Q2 results. Notable reports from other sectors include Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report).
"
1373,BKNG,"It has been a tough reporting cycle for the Retail sector, with most of the companies coming short of earnings estimates. Total earnings for 21 Retail sector companies in the S&P 500 that have already reported Q2 results are up +4.8% on +8.7% higher revenues, with only 33.3% beating earnings estimates and a respectable 57.1% coming ahead of top-line expectations.
"
1374,BKNG,"The 33.3% earnings beat ratio for the sector is the weakest in the S&P 500 index, matching the sector’s under-performance in the preceding quarter. But while Q1 was written off due to weather related issues, there is no handy excuse to fall back upon this time around. If anything, the performance thus far spotlights the extremely promotional retail environment that has been with us for quite some time and the impact that is having on the sector’s margins. Retailers don’t have so much of revenue problem – revenues are good enough. They have a margin problem, with the super competitive retail environment eating into their margins.    The Q2 Scorecard (as of Friday morning, August 8th)
"
1375,BKNG,"Total earnings for the 453 S&P 500 members that have reported already are up +8.7% from the same period last year, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 65.8% and a median surprise of +2.6%. Total revenues are up +4.6%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 61.4% and a median surprise of 0.8%.
"
1376,BKNG,"The table below shows the summary scorecard
"
1377,BKNG,"Any way you look at it, the 2014 Q2 earnings season has been very positive - the growth rates are better, more companies are coming ahead of estimates, and there is even some modest improvement on the guidance front. Guidance still remains weak, with most companies guiding lower. But the proportion of companies guiding lower is smaller than what we have been seeing in recent quarters. And even those that don’t offer guidance have been qualitatively talking up their business outlook.
"
1378,BKNG,"The charts below compare the results thus far from these 453 companies with what we saw from the same group of companies in other recent quarters.The earnings & revenue growth rates compared The beat ratios compared 
"
1379,BKNG,"The revenue growth rates and beat ratios are notably better relative to what we have become used to seeing in recent quarters.Small-caps Update – S&P 600 Q2 Scorecard
"
1380,BKNG,"Stock prices of small-cap stocks have been underwater this year, with the S&P 600 down -4.2% vs. a gain of +3.9% for the S&P 500 in the year-to-date period. This underwhelming stock price performance is getting confirmed by the group’s mixed results thus far in the Q2 reporting cycle.
"
1381,BKNG,"As of Friday, August 8, we have seen Q2 results from 520 S&P 600 members or 86.7% of the index’s total members. Total earnings for these 520 companies are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +8.3% higher revenues, with 49.2% beating EPS estimates and 37.7% coming ahead of top-line expectations.  
"
1382,BKNG,"In terms of comparison to other recent quarters, the earnings growth is better than what we have seen from the same group of 520 small-cap companies in 2014 Q1 as well as the average growth rate of the last four quarters. The earnings beat ratio is in-line with what the same group has performed over that same period. The top-line performance presents a mixed picture, with the growth rate modestly better while the beat ratios tracking lower.
"
1383,BKNG,"A word about the beat ratios for the small-cap stocks may be in order. While roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500 companies beat EPS estimates on average, the ratio is a lot lower for the small-cap index, with about 50% of the S&P 600 companies beating earnings estimates.
"
1384,BKNG,"Here is the updated Q2 scorecard for the S&P 600 index   The Composite Q2 Picture for the S&P 500
"
1385,BKNG,"The composite (or blended) growth picture for Q2, combining the actual results for the 453 S&P 500 companies that have reported with estimates for the 47 still-to-come reports, shows total earnings increasing by +8.0% on +4.3% higher revenues and modestly higher net margins. This would follow earnings growth of +1.3% in Q1 on +2.8% higher revenues. The Q2 earnings growth rate has been steadily going up, as more companies report and beat estimates.
"
1386,BKNG,"The table below compares what is expected for Q2 with what was actually achieved in Q1.
"
1387,BKNG," Record S&P 500 Earnings in Q2
"
1388,BKNG,"Total earnings in Q2 are on track to reach a new all-time quarterly record, surpassing the last record set in 2013 Q4. The chart below shows these quarterly earnings totals, with estimates for the coming quarters all in the record territory.
"
1389,BKNG," The Sustainability Question
"
1390,BKNG,"As discussed in this report, the earnings results thus far represent a notable improvement over what we have become accustomed to seeing in recent quarters. But is it a one-off bounce from the low levels in Q1 or the start of something sustainable and enduring?
"
1391,BKNG,"The ongoing revisions trend in estimates for the current period appears to be indicating that this favorable trend can be sustained. We will see how the revisions trend unfolds through the remainder of this reporting cycle, but estimates for 2014 Q3 have held up very well thus far – better than what we have seen over comparable periods in other recent quarters.

1403,BKNG,"A big miss on the Zacks Consensus Estimate in Q1 has analysts scrambling to cut 2013 estimates on Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report). Growth is now expected to decline on this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) by 8.4% in 2013.
"
1404,BKNG,"Expedia is a well known online travel company that operates several travel sites in the United States and globally including Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Hotwire.com and, in China, eLong. 
"
1405,BKNG,"Expedia is the majority holder in eLong which is a bright spot in the business. It saw 71% year over year growth in room nights in China in the first quarter.Big Miss Spooks Investors
"
1406,BKNG,"On Apr 25, Expedia reported first quarter results and despite growing revenue 24% year over year due to strong growth in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific, it wasn't quite as good as the analysts had been hoping for.
"
1407,BKNG,"It reported a loss of 24 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus by 35 cents, or 318%. It was the first earnings miss in 5 quarters.
"
1408,BKNG,"Investors showed no mercy as they sold off the shares.
"
1409,BKNG,"7 estimates were revised lower for 2013 in the last 60 days. The full year Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen to $2.58 from $3.03 just 2 months ago.
"
1410,BKNG,"The result is that Expedia has fallen to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
"
1411,BKNG,"Despite the earnings miss, the analysts still like the online travel space. But investors might want to consider Priceline (PCLN), a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), until the dust settles on Expedia.Want More of Our Best Recommendations?

1413,BKNG,"Q1 Earnings Picture Becoming Clear
"
1414,BKNG,"We still have plenty of Q1 earnings reports to come, but the bulk of the earnings season is now behind us. The Retail sector is the only one where more than half of the sector’s total market capitalization has yet to report Q1 results. For the remaining sectors, the reporting season has ended for 3 – Autos, Aerospace, and Business Services and 4 other sectors have Q1 results for 90% or more of the sector’s total market cap.   
"
1415,BKNG,"This week is the last major reporting week of the Q1 earnings season, with results from more than 950 companies coming out, including 77 S&P 500 members. This includes industry leaders like Disney (DIS), New Corp (NWSA  -  Free Report), Priceline (PCLN), Whole Foods (WFM) and many others. By the end of this week, we will have Q1 earnings reports from 451 S&P 500 companies. The Retail sector will be the only group by the end of the week that will still have a material number of Q1 results still awaited (retailers typically have non-calendar fiscal period endings).
"
1416,BKNG,"The broad trends about the Q1 earnings are fairly well established by now and the coming reports are unlikely to change them in any material way. These trends pertain to anemic growth, fewer top-line surprises and continued negative guidance that is prompting estimates for the current period to come down. The fact is that none of these trends are new or unique to the Q1 earnings season, as they have been in place for the most part for more than a year.Scorecard for 2014 Q1 (as of Friday, May 2nd)
"
1417,BKNG,"Total earnings for the 374 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up 1.4% from the same period last year, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 68.0% and a median surprise of +3.9%. Total revenues are up +2.2%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 44.1% and the median company beating top-line expectations by 0.1%.
"
1418,BKNG,"The table below shows the current scorecard for all 16 Zacks sectors. As you can see, the 374 S&P 500 members that have already reported Q1 results account for 80.0% of the index’s total market capitalization.
"
1419,BKNG,"The chart below shows how the earnings and revenue growth rates for Q1 thus far compare to what these same companies reported in 2013 Q4 and the 4-quarter average. 
"
1420,BKNG,"The Q1 earnings growth picture is no doubt weak. We should keep two things in mind while evaluating this growth picture. Firstly, it’s not news to the market, as expectations had fallen sharply ahead of the start of the reporting season. As such, as shocking as the above picture seems to be, nobody is exactly shocked at seeing them (the flat-lined GDP reading for the quarter was actually more shocking). Secondly, the growth picture actually isn’t as bad as the above picture is making it out to be once the drag from the Finance sector (which itself is a function of weak results at Bank of America) is excluded from the aggregate results.
"
1421,BKNG,"The comparison chart below of ex-Finance results clearly shows this.
"
1422,BKNG," This chart of ex-Finance growth is showing that the earnings and revenue growth rates at this stage in Q1 are roughly comparable to historical averages. Nothing exciting about that finding, but it is actually an improvement over what was expected just a couple of weeks back.
"
1423,BKNG,"The chart below shows how the beat ratios thus far compare with the preceding and last few quarters.
"
1424,BKNG,"As you can see, the earnings beat ratios are right around historical levels, though the revenue beat ratios are clearly on the weak side.
"
1425,BKNG,"Looking at the composite Q1 picture, meaning combining the actual results from the 374 companies that have reported with estimates for the 126 still-to-come reports, total earnings are expected to be up 0.4% on +1.9% higher revenues. The table below presents the (composite) summary picture for Q1, showing the year-over-year change in total earnings, revenues and margins for all 16 Zacks sectors. 
"
1426,BKNG,"As we are seeing in the Q1 results already, the low expectations are making it easy for companies to come out ahead of them. Roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500 members beat earnings expectations every quarter any way and we are right around that level in Q1 as well. So, more results along those lines would be nothing new and wouldn’t tell us much about the health of corporate earnings.
"
1427,BKNG,"What we haven’t seen for a while is positive guidance and favorable comments from management teams about business outlook. And Q1 is largely along those same lines, causing estimates for the current period to come down. With retailers a bigger part of the reporting docket in the coming days, the negative revisions will most likely only accelerate in the reminder of this reporting season.
"
1428,BKNG,"The downtrend in Q2 estimates is consistent with the trend that has been in place for almost two years now. Stocks made impressive gains over the last two years even though estimates were coming down during that time period, with the Fed QE keeping alive hopes of an eventual growth recovery. It will be interesting to see if investors will respond any differently to the coming period of negative revisions.

1444,BKNG,"Q4 Earnings Season Winding Down
"
1445,BKNG,"The Q4 earnings season isn’t over yet, with almost 400 companies releasing results this week, including 41 S&P 500 members. But the bulk of the reporting season is now behind us, giving us a good enough sense of how good, or otherwise this reporting season has been.  
"
1446,BKNG,"We are sticking with our overall take that the Q4 earnings season has been good enough; it has certainly been no worse than other recent quarters. In fact, this earnings season is better than recent quarters in terms of earnings growth and positive surprises, both EPS and revenue surprises. Where it’s no different from other recent quarters is in terms of lackluster top-line growth and continued negative guidance.
"
1447,BKNG,"In other words, we didn’t see any improvement on the guidance front, which has been weak for more than a year now. And this is prompting estimates for the current quarter to come down, as the chart below shows.
"
1448,BKNG,"With companies in the retail sector starting to report fourth quarter results in greater numbers this week and beyond, we will likely see even more negative guidance. They don’t even need to try very hard to explain their dire straits – they can safely blame everything on the weather. Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) which reports on Thursday had already pre-announced its Q4 problems, but we will likely see a lot more negative guidance from other retailers in the coming days. Total earnings for the sector are expected to be down -4.6% in Q4, which is a material downgrade from the +1.1% growth expected at the start of the reporting season.Q4 Earnings Scorecard (as of Friday, 2/14/2014)
"
1449,BKNG,"Total earnings for the 401 S&P 500 members that have reported already, combined accounting for 86.2% of the index’s total market capitalization,  are up +11.1% from the same period last year, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 68.6% and a median surprise of +2.4%. Total revenues are barely in the positive column, up only +0.8%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 61.1% and a median surprise of +0.8%.
"
1450,BKNG,"More companies have beat earnings and revenue expectations than has been the case in recent quarters, as the chart below shows. Perhaps expectations had fallen a bit low ahead of the Q4 reporting season. 
"
1451,BKNG,"The earnings growth rate for these 401 companies is better than what we saw from this same group of companies in Q3 and the 4-quarer average. A big contributor to the strong Q4 earnings growth is easy comparisons for three companies – Bank of America (BAC), Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), and Travelers (TRV  -  Free Report). Exclude these three companies and total earnings growth for the S&P 500 companies that have reported drops to +6.9% from the ‘headline’ +11.1%, which is about where growth has been in recent quarters.
"
1452,BKNG,"The revenue growth rate is notably weak, but that’s primarily because of the Finance and Energy sectors. Prudential Financial (PRU  -  Free Report) had an unusually large top-line gain in the year-earlier quarter and is a big reason for the Finance sector’s -8.9% drop in reported revenues. Excluding these two sectors, total revenue growth for the S&P 500 improves to +4.2%, which compares to +4% gain for the same group of companies in Q3 and the 4-quarter average of +2.5%. What this means is that top-line growth is weak, but it’s not as weak as the ‘headline’ +0.8% gain would make you believe.  The Composite Growth Picture

1453,BKNG,"The ‘composite’ picture for Q4, where we combine results from the 401 companies that have reported already with the 99 still to come, is for growth rate of +9.2%. This will be the highest quarterly growth pace of 2013, with easy comparisons playing a non-trivial role in propping up the growth pace. The +9.2% growth rate compares to +5.0% in Q3 and +4% in Q2.
"
1454,BKNG,"Finance remains a big growth driver in Q4 – total earnings growth for the S&P 500 in Q4 drop to +6.1% once the sector is excluded. Energy continues to be a drag on aggregate growth, with total earnings for the sector expected to be down -10.3% in Q4 after declining -8.4% in Q3. Excluding the Energy sector, total Q4 earnings for the S&P 500 would be up +12.1% vs. +6.9% in Q3.  
"
1455,BKNG,"Technology earnings are expected be up +4.5% after the +5.6% gain in Q3. While Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB) did extremely well, the sector overall has had a good earnings season as well. With Q4 results from 93.7% of the sector’s total market capitalization already out, total earnings for the sector are up +5.6% on +5.2% higher revenues. These growth rates aren’t materially different from what we saw from this same group of companies in Q3, but the beat ratios are notably better, indicating that expectations may have fallen a bit too low in the run up to the start of the reporting season.
"
1456,BKNG,"Of the Tech sector companies that have reported already (57 out of 65 Tech sector companies in the S&P 500 accounting for 93.7% of the sector’s total market cap have reported results), 86.0% have beat earnings expectations, up from Q3’s 70.2% earnings beat ratio and the 4-quarter average of 75.4%. Positive revenue surprises have been materially widespread relative to recent quarters as well, with Q4 revenue beat ratio currently tracking 75.4% vs. 61.4% in Q3 and the 4-quarter average of 57.0%.  
"
1457,BKNG,"Lack of corporate capital spending has been an issue for the sector for some time and the consensus view is that we will see a turnaround on that front later this year. We haven’t heard anything yet that will add to our confidence in that expectation. But this optimistic view is a big contributor to the expected upturn in the Tech sector’s growth estimate later this year. Total earnings for the sector are expected to be up +10.2% this year and +11.0% in 2015, pronounced acceleration from the flat reading in 2013.
"
1458,BKNG,"For a more detailed look at the Q4 earnings season, please check our weekly Earnings Trends report.Guidance Still on the Weak Side
"
1459,BKNG,"For obvious reasons, the market’s focus has been on management guidance. Companies typically provide guidance only for the following quarter, but they do tend to discuss their outlook for the coming year on the Q4 earnings calls.
"
1460,BKNG,"What we saw on the guidance front didn’t show any improvement from what we have been seeing for quite some time - companies are still guiding lower. The ongoing emerging market turmoil is only adding to this lack of visibility. We have seen this start to show up in negative estimate revisions for Q1 and beyond, as earlier referred to. But estimates will likely have to come down more if current trends persist.  Monday-2/17

1470,BKNG,"This is the second part of the eCommerce Stock Update. You can read Part One by clicking here. 
"
1471,BKNG,"Although retail ecommerce is the segment that most of us are interested in, it is in fact just a part of the overall ecommerce market. Retailers and service providers generate just 4.7% and 3.0%, respectively of their revenues online, a slightly higher percentage than they did in the prior year. The U.S. Census Bureau categorizes these two segments as business-to-consumer.
"
1472,BKNG,"According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the manufacturing sector is the largest contributor to e-commerce sales (49.3% of their total shipments), followed by merchant wholesalers (24.3% of their total sales). These two segments make up the business-to-business category.
"
1473,BKNG,"This places the business-to-business category at 90% of total ecommerce sales, with the balance coming from the business-to-consumer category. The latest numbers from the Bureau suggest that the fastest-growing segments were retail and wholesale. [All the above data from the U.S. Census Bureau relate to 2011, as published in May 2013.]
"
1474,BKNG,"The industry is evolving very rapidly, so data collection and evaluation are particularly difficult. Consequently, one has to rely largely on surveys by both government and private agencies.
"
1475,BKNG,"In this section, we will discuss segments of the ecommerce market than do not relate directly to the retail of goods, and discuss instead travel, payments, security and advertising.Travel
"
1476,BKNG,"The U.S. Commerce Department expects international travel to the U.S. to continue increasing over the next few years. Visitor volume is currently expected to increase 3.7-4.2% a year from 2013 to 2017 leading to a 26% increase in the number of users by 2018. Visitors from the Caribbean are expected to be the slowest-growing (1%). The Middle East, Asia and South America are expected to grow 67%, 60% and 52%, respectively.
"
1477,BKNG,"The fastest growth is expected to come from China (229%), Saudi Arabia (191%), Russian Federation (79%), Brazil (66%), Argentina (65%) and Columbia (54%).
"
1478,BKNG,"The Travel and Tourism industry remains one of the country’s strongest industries, although the second quarter (latest available data) saw a deceleration in its growth rate. According to the BEA, lower air passenger travel as well as reduced automotive rental and leasing affected the industry during the quarter. As a result, the industry grew 2.5% in the quarter, same as the real GDP growth of 2.5% (in the first quarter it grew 7.3% compared to GDP growth of 1.1%).
"
1479,BKNG,"The top travel booking sites are Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com (acquired by Priceline), Travelocity.com, Orbitz.com and Hotwire.com. Since Booking.com and Kayak are part of Priceline (PCLN) and both Hotels.com and Hotwire.com part of Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), this narrows down the top companies in the segment to Priceline, Expedia, Orbitz Worldwide (OWW) and Travelocity. However, there are several others worth considering that include Ctrip International (CTRP), MakeMyTrip (MMYT  -  Free Report), TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report), which was spun off from Expedia, and Qunar (QUNR), which recently had its IPO.
"
1480,BKNG,"The global travel market grew 4% in 2012 and is expected to grow another 2-3% this year. The Asia/Pacific region is expected to see the strongest growth (up 6%), followed by Europe and South America (mainly Brazil) at 2% each. North America (mainly U.S. is expected to be flat this year [World Travel Monitor 2012].
"
1481,BKNG,"According to the June 2013 TravelClick North American Hospitality Review (NAHR), both occupancy and average daily rates (ADRs) in North America are seeing steady growth this year. Occupancy rates grew much more than ADRs most categories, indicating that demand is coming at the cost of prices. Individual occupancy was higher than group occupancy with individual leisure occupancy being stronger than business occupancy. In the second quarter of 2013, total travel occupancy grew 5.3% from last year with ADR growth at 3.5%.
"
1482,BKNG,"Group travel is expected to be flattish in the September quarter, although individual travel (both in terms of occupancy and ADRs) is expected to accelerate.
"
1483,BKNG,"Online travel agents (OTAs) are growing the fastest this year: up 11.7% in the second quarter, according to the TravelClick North American Distribution Review (NADR). The hotels’ own websites were up 8.1%, with direct walk-ins and calls to the hotel growing 4.4%. The global distribution system, used by travel agents and CRS (calls to a hotel's toll-free number) were also up 5.7% and 3.7%, respectively, reversing a negative trend.
"
1484,BKNG,"Share of room nights based on actual reservations-
"
1485,BKNG,"Smartphones are playing a key role in travel purchases, especially for last minute purchases. eMarketer expects smartphone travel researchers in the U.S. to grow to 50 million or 40% of all digital travel researchers this year, with total U.S. mobile travel sales touching $13.6 billion.
"
1486,BKNG,"The top site for travel content is TripAdvisor, visited by 60% of Americans when choosing a hotel. Google’s (GOOG) YouTube is now growing in popularity and is the second in line, according to MMGY Global's 2013 Portrait of American Travelers study.
"
1487,BKNG,"Another report by PhocusWright mentioned that when online penetration of the travel market reached 35% in any country, growth rates were likely to slow down to single-digits. The research firm mentioned that only the U.S., U.K. and Scandinavia had reached this level of penetration and most other markets across Europe, Asia and Latin America would continue to show good growth rates.Payment Systems
"
1488,BKNG,"With practically all market research indicating solid growth in ecommerce sales over the next few years, online players are vying with each other to come out with convenient and secure payment solutions. There are a host of payment systems in the market, but the greatest progress has been made on near field communication (NFC), quick response (QR) code, Soundwave and Bluetooth low energy (BLE).
"
1489,BKNG,"The latest to enter the fray is Amazon (AMZN) with its ""Login and Pay with Amazon"" system. Recognizing the most-used mobile and computing platforms, the system works on any desktop or tablets/smartphones running Android or iOS operating systems. Amazon’s payment system is likely to be popular with retailers given its huge customer base. For Amazon, it will also facilitate further data collection and position it strongly versus eBay’s (EBAY) Paypal and Google’s Digital Wallet.
"
1490,BKNG,"By far the most successful mobile payment system is Paypal, which has come a long way from a mere online payment service. Last year, the company inked a deal with Discover Network (DFS), the fourth largest credit card company, bringing its seven million plus retailers onto the Paypal network. Paypal has also signed up a large number of traditional retailers such as The Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Office Depot (OD). The company is now selling its marketing services as a bundled solution to retailers and the success of this strategy is evident in Paypal’s growth numbers.
"
1491,BKNG,"The new digital wallet from Google enables in-app purchase and mobile payments in addition to PoS purchases and money transfer. Other than the credit and debit card information, users can now store loyalty cards, discount coupons and offers that they can apply during purchase. More importantly, Google has found a way to reduce its dependence on NFC technology. A non-NFC-enabled phone can now use the Wallet to transfer funds from any of the accounts saved in it.
"
1492,BKNG,"Google now requires app developers for the Android platform to compulsorily use its payment service instead of a competing service from eBay or others. Despite the strong growth in Android devices, Google Play (its app store) has not done that well, partly because of the many steps to conversion that turns customers away. The simplification of the checkout process should help sales on Google Play.Apple (AAPL) has removed NFC compatibility from its devices and also introduced iBeacon, which is a BLE technology. The technology tracks the approximate location of a person, the time spent at different stores and even the location within the store. It has the potential to push highly relevant offers and promos at opportune moments.
"
1493,BKNG,"Apple has accumulated a large number of patents for payment processing and it’s very likely that that iBeacon will be rolled into its very own iWallet. Payments on its platform are currently handled by its Passbook system. Apple is one of the largest online retailers although it also sells through traditional retail outlets, so a payment platform from Apple may be expected to catch on very fast.
"
1494,BKNG,"The FIS Mobile Wallet from Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) is basically a bar code reader that feeds information related to the purchase into the user’s smartphone and uses it as a medium to transfer the information to the cloud. Online purchase of merchandise is also possible. The solution provides good security, since the transaction is carried out entirely in the cloud through the retailer’s and banker’s applications and personal information is not shared at the time of purchase.Visa (V  -  Free Report) has also jumped on the bandwagon, claiming that its V.me is a digital wallet with a difference. Not only can it be used to make mobile contactless payments (bar code, QR code or NFC), but it can also be used for online checkout (it remembers card details from several providers).
"
1495,BKNG,"Mobile banking is set to grow very strongly over the next few years, according to Juniper Research. The research firm estimates that a billion mobile devices (or 15% of the installed base) will be used for banking transactions by 2017, up from an expected 590 million at the end of this year. Most banks already offer at least one mobile banking offering, with some larger banks offering more than one option. Messaging remains most popular across the world, but apps are likely to remain the preferred channel in most developed markets.
"
1496,BKNG,"Mobile banking has not picked up sufficiently in either the U.S. or Canada, due to security-related concerns. However, an analysis by Deloitte shows that mobile banking could become the most-preferred banking method by 2020. The study estimates that 20-25 million Generation-Y consumers will become new banking customers by 2015.
"
1497,BKNG,"A banking.com study shows that 48% of ""Generation Y"" (gen Y) consumers are already using online banking services. Moreover, their preference for online banking is so high that around 30% said they would consider switching financial institutions if they did not provide the service. Both online and mobile banking by gen Y consumers largely consists of checking account balances and transferring funds, although they also like to pay bills on the platform.
"
1498,BKNG,"It is believed that high smartphone penetration, higher income within this group and greater digital sophistication will drive increased demand for mobile banking services. Since mobile banking is expected to be the most cost efficient for banks, investment in technology to improve and expand mobile banking services is likely to increase.Security
"
1499,BKNG,"With online transactions expected to boom over the next few years, the topmost concern remains security. While banks will spend significantly on secure payment systems, hackers are expected to have a field day, largely targeting the flood of customers going online. Last year saw a huge increase in security breaches, something that may be expected to continue.
"
1500,BKNG,"Recent research from McAfee revealed certain important facts: first, that mobile malware was primarily spreading through apps; second, 75% of infected apps came from Google Play; third, the chances of downloading malware or suspicious URLs was 1 in 6; fourth, 40% of malware families disrupt the system in more than one way, which is an indication of the increasing sophistication of hackers; and fifth, 23% of mobile spyware can result in data loss.
"
1501,BKNG,"What is even more alarming is that even “secure” payment platforms like digital wallets using NFC technology can now be infected by worms within close range of devices (“bump and infect”). An infected device can give out personal information during the payment process that can be used to steal from the wallet.
"
1502,BKNG,"Mobile security offerings currently come from AirWatch, Apple, Avast, Check Point, Cisco (CSCO), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Juniper (JNPR  -  Free Report), Kaspersky, McAfee, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), MobileIron, Blackberry (BBRY), Symantec (SYMC  -  Free Report) and Trend Micro, among others.
"
1503,BKNG,"Alternative payment systems will continue to gain popularity. While some of these payment systems, such as PayPal, have been around for a while, other systems, such as Google’s digital wallet, V.me and the FIS Mobile Wallet are still in the making. Alternative payment systems never really gained momentum in the past because of the low volume of transactions. However, as online transactions continue to increase, many more such systems could suddenly become more available.
"
1504,BKNG,"We expect mobile security to become a major focus area for technology companies, since this is the stumbling block to payments through the mobile platform (currently just 2% of U.S. online spending).Digital Advertising
"
1505,BKNG,"The U.S. digital advertising market has seen some very strong growth in the past few years, despite the recession that impacted the entire economy. eMarketer estimates that the market will grow 14.9% in 2013, compared to the 15.0% growth in 2012.
"
1506,BKNG,"Growth rates are expected to continue declining: 12.6% in 2014, 10.3% in 2015, 9.2% in 2016 and 7.1% in 2017. Retail, financial services, consumer packaged goods (CPG) and travel in that order, are expected to drive this growth. The slight upward revision is attributed to previous estimates is driven by strength on the mobile platform, which will grow 95.0% in 2013, 53.8% in 2014, 41.8% in 2015, 33.1% in 2016 and 26.0% in 2017. Spending on mobile ads is expected to increase as a percentage of total spending on digital as well as total media ads in each of the years.
"
1507,BKNG,"The current strength in online advertising is coming primarily from the growing popularity of the display format. Of all the forms of online advertising, display (including video, banner ads, rich media and sponsorships) is expected to see the strongest growth over the next few years. The underlying drivers of growth of the display format are the continued increase in the number of users, greater propensity of users to consume online, a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the need to create brand awareness online.
"
1508,BKNG,"Google’s YouTube leads in the video segment. The increasing propensity to use programmatic buying techniques (automating the inventory buying process) is hurting Yahoo’s (YHOO) premium placements. Yahoo is currently focusing on the content side of things in order to boost ad revenue. Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) on the other hand has more relevant personal data, which advertisers like. Facebook’s main problem is the decline in teen usage and low conversion for advertisers.
"
1509,BKNG,"While digital advertising spend has been moving to non-search portals, such as Facebook, search is likely to remain relevant and important. Google is the leader here and is using its other technologies (maps, voice, devices) to make its services more invaluable to users. Its Enhanced Campaigns strategy that seeks to integrate ad campaigns across platforms is also bearing fruit, as it is proving more profitable for advertisers.
"
1510,BKNG,"Search advertising results are measurable, and therefore more predictable, than other media. This also makes the market more resilient in recessionary conditions, since advertisers are more confident about the results of their spending.
"
1511,BKNG,"Since ecommerce entails the buying and selling of goods or services over electronic systems, it includes companies that are totally dependent on these sales, those that are gradually moving to it, as well as those that want to use it partially. Therefore, the biggest sellers or the ones growing the strongest are not necessarily those that are solely dependent on the Internet. The following diagrams seek to explain the position of companies primarily dependent on the Internet for the distribution of their goods and services in the context of the Zacks Industry Rank.
"
1512,BKNG,"Two (Retail/Wholesale and Computer & Technology) of the 16 broad Zacks sectors are related to the ecommerce industry as depicted below.
"
1513,BKNG,"We rank the 264 industries across the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.
"
1514,BKNG,"The outlook for industries positioned at #88 or lower is 'Positive,' between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and #177 and higher is 'Negative.'
"
1515,BKNG,"Therefore, Internet Commerce and Internet Services – Delivery being in the 32nd and 95th positions, respectively are in positive territory, with Internet Services (166th position) being neutral.
"
1516,BKNG,"So it is not surprising that the average rank of stocks in the Internet Commerce industry is 2.65, for Internet Services – Delivery, it is 2.94, while for Internet Services it is 3.06. [Note: Zacks Rank #1 denotes Strong Buy, #2 is Buy, #3 means Hold, #4 Sell and #5 Strong Sell].Earnings Trends
"
1517,BKNG,"The broader Retail/Wholesale sector, of which Internet Commerce is a part, is not expected to do too well in the third quarter, considering the fact that both the estimated revenue and earnings beat ratios are 38.9%. The calculated earnings beat ratio based on companies that have reported thus far is just slightly higher at 40.9%.
"
1518,BKNG,"Total earnings for the sector are estimated to increase 4.9% in the third quarter on revenue growth of 3.8%, indicating escalating costs and sluggish growth. This contrasts with an earnings growth of 9.3% on a revenue base of 6.9% in the preceding quarter.
"
1519,BKNG,"The other companies we are discussing in the e-commerce outlook (part 2) fall under the broader Technology sector. Here we estimate a fairly strong earnings beat ratio of 71.2%, partially supported by a revenue beat ratio of 57.7%. While the estimated revenue beat ratio is consistent with the 57.7% in the previous quarter, the estimated earnings beat ratio is lower than the 75.0% calculated for the second quarter. The earnings beat ratio of companies that have reported thus far is 76.5%, better than the estimated numbers.
"
1520,BKNG,"Total earnings in the sector were up 4.0% year over year compared to a 9.6% decline in the second quarter. Total revenues did slightly better, increasing 2.4% from last year, up from 0.6% in the second quarter.
"
1521,BKNG,"Earnings estimates for 2013 and 2014 indicate better growth prospects in both years for Retail/Wholesale. Technology is expected to be even stronger.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1522,BKNG,"While many of the companies discussed are expected to do well this year, there are a few stand-out opportunities.
"
1523,BKNG,"The first is the emerging Chinese travel company Ctrip (CTRP), which is seeing tremendous growth fueled by a growing middle class and increased consumerism in China, the shift from traditional to online media for booking travel and increased mobile usage. These trends are spurring strong growth, which has resulted in rising estimates.
"
1524,BKNG,"The second is Baidu (BIDU), the dominant search engine company of China. Baidu is the Google of China with tremendous opportunities. The company has been investing in the business to build a position in the mobile and video segments and the company is already seeing growing monetization on mobile. While integration of recent acquisitions and investment considerations could be a slight headwind in the next few quarters, the company is clearly moving in the right direction.
"
1525,BKNG,"Facebook is another opportunity worth looking into. The company has seen its ad revenues swell, despite fears of reducing teen engagement and poorer-than-expected conversion for advertisers. Importantly, the company continues to innovate, frequently enhancing and/or making relevant changes to its platform. Therefore, one cant ignore the strong growth numbers and resultant surge in estimates.WEAKNESSES
"
1526,BKNG,"We do not see a lot of weakness, although many of the companies may not be great opportunities either.
"
1527,BKNG,"Revenue growth prospects for online travel companies Priceline, Expedia and Orbitz Worldwide are good. International expansion is a key factor driving growth for these companies and collaborative agreements with local players will be the key. Lower-value inventories in international markets are on the rise, so margins could be impacted.This is the second part of the eCommerce Stock Update. You can read Part One by clicking here. 
"
1528,BKNG,"Q4 Earnings Estimates Are Coming Down
"
1529,BKNG,"The bulk of the Q3 earnings season is now behind us, with results from 367 S&P 500 members, or 73.4% of the index’s total membership, already known. We have a busy reporting docket this week as well, the last busy week of the Q3 earnings season, with more than 635 companies releasing results, including 72 S&P 500 members. This week’s reporting line-up has heavy representation from the oil & gas and utility industries, though a number of major media companies like CBS Corp (CBS) and Disney (DIS) are also reporting results.
"
1530,BKNG,"Our overall verdict on the Q3 earnings season is favorable, particularly relative to the last few quarters. That actual results have been better relative to lowered pre-season expectations is no surprise given management team’s impressive track record in under-promising and over-delivering. There is still not much growth and most companies are still guiding lower, prompting estimates for Q4 to come down. But whatever little growth we have in Q3 thus far is better than we have seen in recent quarters. And for those keeping records, the Q3 earnings season appears on track a new quarterly record for total earnings, surpassing the level achieved in Q2.Q3 Earnings Scorecard (as of Friday, 11/1/2013)
"
1531,BKNG,"Total earnings for the 367 S&P 500 companies that have reported results are up +4.3% with 67% beating earnings expectations, while total revenues for these companies are up +2.8% and 52.6% are beating top-line expectations. The table below shows the current earnings scorecard.
"
1532,BKNG,"This is better performance than what this same group of 367 companies reported in Q2, and the 4-quarter average. As you can see in the chart below, the earnings and revenue growth rates for these companies is a notable improvement on what we saw from this same group of companies in Q2 and the 4-quarter average.
"
1533,BKNG,"Unlike recent quarters, The Finance sector isn’t driving growth in Q3. Total earnings growth outside of Finance of +2.8% compares to earnings decline of -4.3% in Q2 and the average -1.5% decline in the preceding four quarters. Improved growth at the Technology, Basic Materials, and Transportation sectors accounts for the positive ex-Finance variance in Q3 relative to the recent past.
"
1534,BKNG,"Total earnings for the 81.4% of the Technology sector’s market capitalization, that have reported results already, are up +5.1% from the same period last year, which compares to earnings declines of -11.6% in Q2 and the 4-quarter average of -3.4%.
"
1535,BKNG,"At the medium industry level (or M level), we have 7 industries in the Technology sector, of which only Telecom Services hasn’t reported any results as of yet. The growth picture has improved for each of the other six industries, with the improvement particularly notable for the Software & Services and Semiconductor industries. These two industries combined, account for 41% of the sector’s total earnings.
"
1536,BKNG,"Strong earnings growth at Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) accounts for the positive growth profile of the Software & Services industry and account for a big part of the Tech sector’s positive growth picture. Excluding both these companies form the Tech sector’s tally, the sector’s Q3 total earnings growth drops from +5.1% to +1.6%.   
"
1537,BKNG,"Total earnings for the Computer & Office Equipment industry, the biggest industry in the sector accounting for almost 44% of the sector’s total earnings, are down -4.3% from the same period last year, primarily driven by tough comparisons for Apple (AAPL). But this still better performance than what the industry was able to achieve in recent quarters. Apple’s negative year-over-year comparison has been a big drag on the sector’s growth picture. Excluding Apple, total earnings for the Tech sector would be up +9.6% (up +5.1% including the company).
"
1538,BKNG,"Total earnings for the Basic Materials sector are up +10.2% on +2% higher revenues. The improvement in the sector’s growth numbers is primarily a function of easy comparisons, particularly in the sector’s dominant chemicals industry (69% of total sector earnings come from the Chemicals & Fertilizer industry). The Chemicals industry earnings are up +11.3% at this stage, largely due to easy comparisons at Dow Chemicals (DOW). Dow missed and guided lower, but its Q3 total earnings were up year over year.The Composite Growth Picture
"
1539,BKNG,"Total earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole, combining the results from the 367 that have reported with estimates for the remaining for the 133, is for growth of +4% on +2.5% higher revenues. This compares to +3.4% earnings growth in Q2 on flat revenues.
"
1540,BKNG,"Only five of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have double-digit earnings growth in Q3 – Finance (+10.7%), Construction (+30.7%), Transportation (+13.5%), Autos (+32.1%) and Aerospace (+13.1%). Excluding Finance, total earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to be up +2.5% on +3.1% higher revenues, which is up from a decline of -2.3% in total earnings on +1.1% higher revenues in Q2.
"
1541,BKNG,"Given the trend we have seen thus far, actual earnings growth in Q3, when all reports are in, will most likely be better than what saw in the first two quarters of the year – likely in the +4.5% to +5% range. As modest as this growth rate is, it will still be the best quarterly earnings growth rate of 2013 thus far.  Q4 Estimates Coming Down
"
1542,BKNG,"Estimates for Q4 have started coming down, though they still have plenty of room to go before reaching ‘reasonable’ levels. The chart below shows consensus earnings growth rates for the next two quarters, the composite estimate for Q3 and the actual growth rates for the first two quarters of the year.
"
1543,BKNG,"The chart below shows the evolution of Q4 growth rate over the last few weeks.
"
1544,BKNG,"Part of the strong Q4 growth is a function of easier comparisons, as 2012 Q4 represents the lowest quarterly earnings total for the S&P 500 in the last six quarters, with the comps particularly easy for the Finance sector. But it’s not all due to easy comparisons, as the expected earnings totals for Q4 represent a new all-time quarterly record.
"
1545,BKNG,"Total earnings for the S&P 500 are on track to reach a new all-time record at $260.2 billion in Q3, surpassing the preceding quarter’s $258.5 billion record. But they are expected to reach a new record of $265.8 billion in 2013 Q4 and an even higher level in the first quarter of 2014.
"
1546,BKNG,"Investors seem to be fine with the current record level of earnings as providing enough justification for the stock market’s all-time record level. We will have wait to see if this justification would work once the Fed starts getting out of the QE, which some suspect could happen as early as this December. But irrespective of when the Fed starts tapering, the stock market needs stronger earnings growth in the coming quarters than we have seen in the recent past to maintain its recent momentum.

1560,BKNG,"This is part two of our e-Commerce Industry Outlook. Click here to read part one.
"
1561,BKNG,"Although retail e-Commerce is the segment that most of us are interested in, it is in fact just a part of the overall e-Commerce market. In fact, retailers and service providers generate just 4.7% and 3.0%, respectively of their revenues online, a slightly higher percentage than they did in the prior year. The U.S. Census Bureau categorizes these two segments as business-to-consumer.
"
1562,BKNG,"According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the manufacturing sector is the largest contributor to e-commerce sales (49.3% of their total shipments), followed by merchant wholesalers (24.3% of their total sales). These two segments make up the business-to-business category.
"
1563,BKNG,"This places the business-to-business category at 90% of total e-Commerce sales, with the balance coming from the business-to-consumer category. The latest numbers from the Bureau suggest that the fastest-growing segments were retail and wholesale. [All the above data from the U.S. Census Bureau relate to 2011, as published in May 2013]
"
1564,BKNG,"The industry is evolving very rapidly, so data collection and evaluation are particularly difficult. Consequently, one has to rely largely on surveys by both government and private agencies.
"
1565,BKNG,"In this section, we will discuss segments of the e-Commerce market than do not relate directly to the retail of goods, and discuss instead travel, payments, security and advertising.Travel
"
1566,BKNG,"The U.S. Commerce Department expects international travel to the U.S. to continue increasing over the next few years. Visitor volume is currently expected to increase 6-8% a year from 2012 to 2016 leading to a 49% increase in the number of users during the period.
"
1567,BKNG,"Visitors from the Middle East are expected to be the slowest-growing (29%). South America, Asia and Oceania growth rates are expected to be comparable at 83%, 82% and 82%, respectively.
"
1568,BKNG,"The fastest growth is expected to come from China (232%), South Korea (200%), Brazil (150%), Russian Federation (139%) and India (94%). Travel and tourism is one of the country’s strongest industries, contributing a trade surplus in each of the last 20 years.
"
1569,BKNG,"The top travel booking sites are Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com (acquired by Priceline), Travelocity.com, Orbitz.com and Hotwire.com. Since Booking.com and Kayak are part of Priceline (PCLN) and both Hotels.com and Hotwire.com part of Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), this narrows down the top companies in the segment to Priceline, Expedia, Orbitz Worldwide (OWW) and Travelocity. However, there are several others worth considering that include Ctrip International (CTRP  -  Free Report), MakeMyTrip (MMYT) and TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report), which was spun off from Expedia.
"
1570,BKNG,"The global travel market grew 4% in 2012 and is expected to grow another 2-3% this year. The Asia/Pacific region is expected to see the strongest growth (up 6%), followed by Europe and South America (mainly Brazil) at 2% each. North America (mainly U.S.) is expected to be flat this year. [World Travel Monitor 2012]
"
1571,BKNG,"According to the April 2013 TravelClick North American Hospitality Review (NAHR), both occupancy and average daily rates (ADRs) in North America are seeing steady growth this year, with individual bookings (both leisure and business) doing better than group bookings. In the second quarter of 2013, total travel occupancy growth was 3.6% from last year with ADR growth even better at 3.8%.
"
1572,BKNG,"Online travel agents (OTAs) are growing the fastest this year – up 13.7% in the first quarter, according to the TravelClick North American Distribution Review (NADR). The hotels’ own websites were up 5.0%, with direct walk-ins and calls to the hotel growing 3.7%. The areas of weakness were the global distribution system used by travel agents and CRS (calls to a hotel's toll-free number).
"
1573,BKNG,"Share of individual bookings-
"
1574,BKNG,"Global corporate travel bookings were up 8.8% in April, according to Pegasus Solutions, which is the single largest processor of electronic hotel transactions. This is the highest volume growth through GDSs since August 2011.
"
1575,BKNG,"Smartphones are playing a key role in travel purchases, especially for last minute purchases. eMarketer expects smartphone travel researchers in the U.S. to grow to 50 million or 40% of all digital travel researchers this year, with total U.S. mobile travel sales touching $13.6 billion.
"
1576,BKNG,"The top site for travel content is TripAdvisor, visited by 60% of Americans when choosing a hotel. Google’s (GOOG) YouTube is now growing in popularity and is the second in line, according to MMGY Global's 2013 Portrait of American Travelers study.
"
1577,BKNG,"Another report by PhocusWright mentioned that when online penetration of the travel market reached 35% in any country, growth rates were likely to slow down to single-digits. The research firm mentioned that only the U.S., U.K. and Scandinavia had reached this level of penetration and most other markets across Europe, Asia and Latin America would continue to show good growth rates.Payment Systems
"
1578,BKNG,"With practically all market research indicating solid growth in e-Commerce sales over the next few years, online players are vying with each other to come out with convenient and secure payment solutions.
"
1579,BKNG,"The FIS Mobile Wallet from Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (FIS) is basically a bar code reader that feeds information related to the purchase into the user’s smartphone and uses it as a medium to transfer the information to the cloud. Online purchase of merchandise is also possible. The solution provides good security, since the transaction is carried out entirely in the cloud through the retailer’s and banker’s applications and personal information is not shared at the time of purchase.
"
1580,BKNG,"QR code payments have already been made by most smartphone users in the U.S. and the technology is moving mainstream. However, the safety of the system comes at a price, which is the time it takes to complete a transaction. This is the reason that Google is still hanging on to its digital wallet.
"
1581,BKNG,"Google’s digital wallet allows a customer to make a payment by waving his mobile phone over a POS terminal. Other than the convenience of the whole thing, the main attraction being highlighted is the security of the payment channel, since neither the customer nor the retailer would be recording the personal information related to the customer. Adoption of the device, although it is some way off, will have a remarkable effect on the volume and value of mobile transactions, since it should increase the percentage of higher-value sales.
"
1582,BKNG,"However, the cost of POS terminals is a downside to the system that could easily turn away retail partners. This is an evolving area and much could change over the next few years.Visa (V  -  Free Report) has also jumped on the bandwagon, claiming that its V.me is a digital wallet with a difference. Not only can it be used to make mobile contactless payments (bar code, QR code or NFC), but it can also be used for online checkout (it remembers card details from several providers).
"
1583,BKNG,"The greatest success however is currently being enjoyed by eBay’s Paypal, which has seen success at a large number of traditional retailers such as The Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Office Depot (OD). One drawback that remains is that although the system is itself secure, there is always a security risk for a buyer not used to dealing with Paypal, since it requires personal information.
"
1584,BKNG,"Mobile banking is set to grow very strongly over the next few years, according to Juniper Research. The research firm estimates that a billion mobile devices (or 15% of the installed base) will be used for banking transactions by 2017, up from an expected 590 million at the end of this year. Most banks already offer at least one mobile banking offering, with some larger banks offering more than one option. Messaging remains the most popular across the world, but apps are likely to remain the preferred channel in most developed markets.
"
1585,BKNG,"Mobile banking has not picked up sufficiently in either the U.S. or Canada, due to security-related concerns. However, an analysis by Deloitte shows that mobile banking could become the most-preferred banking method by 2020. The study estimates that 20-25 million ""Generation Y"" (Gen Y) consumers will become new banking customers by 2015.
"
1586,BKNG,"A banking.com study shows that 48% of Gen Y consumers are already using online banking services. Moreover, their preference for online banking is so high that around 30% said they would consider switching financial institutions if they did not provide the service. Both online and mobile banking by Gen Y largely consists of checking account balances and transferring funds, although they also like to pay bills on the platform.
"
1587,BKNG,"It is believed that high smartphone penetration, higher income within this group and greater digital sophistication will drive increased demand for mobile banking services. Since mobile banking is expected to be the most cost efficient for banks, investment in technology to improve and expand mobile banking services is likely to increase.Security
"
1588,BKNG,"With online transactions expected to boom over the next few years, the topmost concern remains security. While banks will spend significantly on secure payment systems, hackers are expected to have a field day, largely targeting the flood of customers going online. Last year saw a huge increase in security breaches, something that may be expected to continue.
"
1589,BKNG,"Recent research from McAfee revealed certain important facts: first, that mobile malware was primarily spreading through apps; second, 75% of infected apps came from Google Play; third, the chances of downloading malware or suspicious URLs was 1 in 6; fourth, 40% of malware families disrupt the system in more than one way, which is an indication of the increasing sophistication of hackers; and fifth, 23% of mobile spyware can result in data loss.
"
1590,BKNG,"Even more alarming is that even “secure” payment platforms like digital wallets using NFC technology can now be infected by worms within close range of devices (“bump and infect”). An infected device can give out personal information during the payment process that can be used to steal from the wallet.
"
1591,BKNG,"Mobile security offerings currently come from AirWatch, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Avast, Check Point, Cisco (CSCO), IBM (IBM), Juniper (JNPR), Kaspersky, McAfee, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), MobileIron, RIM (Blackberry) (BBRY), Symantec (SYMC) and Trend Micro, among others.
"
1592,BKNG,"Alternative payment systems will continue to gain popularity. While some of these payment systems, such as eBay’s (EBAY) PayPal have been around for a while, other systems, such as Google’s digital wallet, V.me and the FIS Mobile Wallet are still in the making. Alternative payment systems never really gained momentum in the past because of the low volume of transactions. However, as online transactions continue to increase, many more such systems could suddenly become more available.
"
1593,BKNG,"We expect mobile security to become a major focus area for technology companies, since this is the stumbling block to payments through the mobile platform (currently just 2% of U.S. online spending).Digital Advertising
"
1594,BKNG,"The U.S. digital advertising market has seen some very strong growth in the past few years, despite the recession that impacted the entire economy. eMarketer estimates that the market will grow 14.0% in 2013, compared to the 15.0% growth in 2012.
"
1595,BKNG,"Growth rates are expected to continue declining: 12.4% in 2014, 10.2% in 2015, 9.0% in 2016 and 6.9% in 2017. Retail, financial services, consumer packaged goods (CPG) and travel in that order, are expected to drive this growth.
"
1596,BKNG,"The current strength in online advertising is coming primarily from the growing popularity of the display format. Of all the forms of online advertising, display (including video, banner ads, rich media and sponsorships) is expected to see the strongest growth over the next few years. Also, of all the forms of display advertising, video and banner ads are expected to grow the strongest from 2011 to 2016.
"
1597,BKNG,"Search will remain supreme until 2016, gradually giving way to video and banner ads, both of which will grow rapidly. The lower pricing of video and banner ads has made them popular with brand advertisers, so ad inventories are solid. Another factor favoring display ads is the proliferation of smartphones, where the smaller screens make display ads more effective than text ads.
"
1598,BKNG,"The underlying drivers of growth of the display format are the continued increase in the number of users, greater propensity of users to consume online, a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the need to create brand awareness online.
"
1599,BKNG,"Search advertising is expected to remain popular, because results are measurable, and therefore, more predictable than other media. This also makes the market more resilient in recessionary conditions, since advertisers are more confident about the results of their spending.
"
1600,BKNG,"Since ecommerce entails the buying and selling of goods or services over electronic systems, it includes companies that are totally dependent on these sales, those that are gradually moving to it, as well as those that want to use it partially. Therefore, the biggest sellers or the ones growing the strongest are not necessarily those that are solely dependent on the Internet. The following diagrams seek to explain the position of companies primarily dependent on the Internet for the distribution of their goods and services in the context of the Zacks Industry Rank.
"
1601,BKNG,"Two (Retail/Wholesale and Computer & Technology) of the 16 broad Zacks sectors are related to the ecommerce industry as depicted below.
"
1602,BKNG,"We rank the 264 industries across the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.
"
1603,BKNG,"The outlook for industries positioned at #88 or lower is 'Positive,' between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and #177 and higher is 'Negative.'
"
1604,BKNG,"Therefore, Internet Commerce being in the 114th position is in Neutral territory, with Internet Services (185th position) being negative and Internet Services – Delivery (58th position) being positive.
"
1605,BKNG,"So it is not surprising that the average rank of stocks in the Internet Commerce industry is 3.00, for Internet Services it is 3.15, while for Internet Services – Delivery, it is 2.76. [Note: Zacks Rank #1 denotes Strong Buy, #2 is Buy, #3 means Hold, #4 Sell and #5 Strong Sell].Earnings Trends
"
1606,BKNG,"The broader Retail/Wholesale sector, of which Internet Commerce is a part, appears to be turning the corner. While the revenue beat ratio is on the low side (34.1%), the earnings beat ratio is pretty robust at 61.4%.
"
1607,BKNG,"Total earnings for the sector were up 5.7%, but not nearly as good as the 7.4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2012. Total revenues were up 1.5% from last year compared to a 4.9% increase in the fourth quarter.
"
1608,BKNG,"The other companies we are discussing in the e-Commerce outlook (Part 2) fall under the broader Technology sector. Here too, we see a fairly strong earnings beat ratio of 63.1%, partially supported by a revenue beat ratio of 45.6%.
"
1609,BKNG,"However, total earnings in the sector were down 4.4% compared to a 1.7% increase in the fourth quarter. Total revenues did slightly better, increasing 2.9% from last year, down from 5.3% in the fourth quarter.
"
1610,BKNG,"Initial earnings estimates for 2013 and 2014 indicate double-digit growth in both years for Retail/Wholesale. Technology on the other hand is expected to be flat this year and up double-digits in the next.
"
1611,BKNG,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
1612,BKNG,"While many of the companies discussed are expected to do well this year, there are a few stand-out opportunities.
"
1613,BKNG,"TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) is doing extremely well right now and the company’s decision to invest in offline advertising (TV) makes sense. Traffic continues to surge, as the company continues to add content, both in the U.S. and important international markets.
"
1614,BKNG,"Another good investment is Yahoo (YHOO), which is altering course under the leadership of Marissa Meyer. The company has been acquiring aggressively to position itself in the mobile segment and last reports indicated growing engagement.
"
1615,BKNG,"Facebook (FB) is another opportunity worth looking into. The company is cozying up with Samsung, which has taken the mobile market by storm. It is also getting more innovative by the day, which is the only way to success here.WEAKNESSES
"
1616,BKNG,"We do not see a lot of weakness, although many of the companies may not be great opportunities either.
"
1617,BKNG,"Revenue growth prospects for online travel companies Priceline, Expedia and Orbitz Worldwide are good. International expansion is a key factor driving growth for these companies and collaborative agreements with local players will be the key. Lower-value inventories in international markets are on the rise, so margins could be impacted.
"
1618,BKNG,"(Note: This is Part 2 of the eCommerce Industry Stock Outlook. Read Part 1 here.)
"
1619,BKNG,"Although retail e-commerce is the segment that most of us are interested in, it is in fact just a small part of the overall ecommerce market. In fact, retailers and service providers generate just 4.4% and 2.3%, respectively of their revenues online, a slightly higher percentage than they were in the prior year. The U.S. Census Bureau categorizes these two segments as business-to-consumer.
"
1620,BKNG,"According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the manufacturing sector is the largest contributor to e-commerce sales (46.4% of their total shipments), followed by merchant wholesalers (24.6% of their total sales). These two segments make up the business-to-business category.
"
1621,BKNG,"This places the business-to-business category at 90% of total e-commerce sales, with the balance coming from the business-to-consumer category. The latest numbers from the Bureau suggest that the fastest-growing segments were manufacturing and retail. [All the above data from the U.S. Census Bureau relate to 2010, as published in May 2012]
"
1622,BKNG,"The industry is evolving very rapidly, so data collection and evaluation are particularly difficult. Consequently, one has to rely largely on surveys by both government and private agencies.
"
1623,BKNG,"In this section, we will discuss other segments of the e-commerce market, including travel, payments, security and advertising.Travel
"
1624,BKNG,"The U.S. Commerce Department expects international travel to the U.S. to continue increasing over the next few years. Visitor volume is currently expected to increase 6-8% a year from 2012 to 2016 leading to a 49% increase in the number of users during the period. Visitors from the Middle East are expected to be the slowest-growing (29%). South America, Asia and Oceania growth rates are expected to be comparable at 83%, 82% and 82%, respectively.
"
1625,BKNG,"The fastest growth is expected to come from China (232%), South Korea (200%), Brazil (150%), Russian Federation (139%) and India (94%). Travel and tourism is one of the country’s strongest industries, contributing a trade surplus in each of the last 20 years.
"
1626,BKNG,"According to research from eTrack, eMarketer and Alexa.com compiled in September 2012, Internet-based travel booking revenue has grown 73% over the last five years, with 57% of all travel reservations being made online. The bookings and revenue generated by source and category (latest estimates) are represented in the following graphs.
"
1627,BKNG,"The top travel booking sites are Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com (recently acquired by Priceline), Travelocity.com, Orbitz.com and Hotwire.com. Since Booking.com and Kayak are part of Priceline (PCLN) and both Hotels.com and Hotwire.com part of Expedia (EXPE), this narrows down the top companies in the segment to Priceline, Expedia, Orbitz Worldwide (OWW) and Travelocity. However, there are several others worth considering, such as TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report), which was spun off from Expedia.
"
1628,BKNG,"According to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the improving economy will result in a 1.8% increase in demand for U.S. hotel reservations this year, which along with a 0.8% increase in hotel supply will lead to higher occupancy rates (62.0%). As a result, RevPAR will be up 5.9%.
"
1629,BKNG,"However, most players have extensive operations in Europe and a growing presence in Asia, which means that they will be affected by growth rates in these regions as well. PricewaterhouseCoopers expects RevPAR growth to slow down in Europe, although some cities will see growth while others (most notably London and Madrid) will see declines.
"
1630,BKNG,"The global travel market grew 4% in 2012 and is expected to grow another 2-3% this year. The Asia/Pacific region is expected to see the strongest growth (up 6%), followed by Europe and South America (mainly Brazil) at 2% each. North America (mainly U.S. is expected to be flat this year [World Travel Monitor 2012].
"
1631,BKNG,"Smartphones are playing a key role in travel purchases, especially for last minute purchases. eMarketer expects smartphone travel researchers to grow from 23.7% of total online travel researchers in 2011 to 53.9% in 2016. Similarly, smartphone travel purchasers are expected to grow from 12.6% in 2011 to 32.5% in 2016.
"
1632,BKNG,"Another report by PhocusWright mentioned that when online penetration of the travel market reached 35% in any country, growth rates were likely to slow down to single-digits. The research firm mentioned that only the U.S., U.K. and Scandinavia had reached this level of penetration and most other markets across Europe, Asia and Latin America would continue to show good growth rates.Payment Systems
"
1633,BKNG,"With practically all market research indicating solid growth in ecommerce sales over the next few years, online players are vying with each other to come out with convenient and secure payment solutions.

Online purchase of merchandise is also possible. The solution provides maximum security, since the transaction is carried out entirely in the cloud through the retailer’s and banker’s applications and personal information is not shared at the time of purchase.
"
1635,BKNG,"While QR code payments (as the technology is called) have already been made by half the smartphone users in the U.S. (report compiled by eMarketer), the usage was mainly out of curiosity. It appears that the safety of the system comes at a price, which is the time it takes to complete a transaction. This is the reason that Google is still betting on its digital wallet.
"
1636,BKNG,"Google’s digital wallet allows a customer to make a payment by waving his mobile phone over a POS terminal. Other than the convenience of the whole thing, the main attraction being highlighted is the security of the payment channel, since neither the customer nor the retailer would be recording the personal information related to the customer. Adoption of the device, although it is some way off, will have a remarkable effect on the volume and value of mobile transactions, since it should increase the percentage of higher-value sales.
"
1637,BKNG,"However, the cost of POS terminals is a downside to the system that could easily turn away retail partners. This is an evolving area and much could change over the next few years.Visa (V) has also jumped on the bandwagon, claiming that its V.me is a digital wallet with a difference. Not only can it be used to make mobile contactless payments (bar code, QR code or NFC), but it can also be used for online checkout (it remembers card details from several providers).
"
1638,BKNG,"The greatest success however is currently being enjoyed by eBay’s Paypal, which has seen some success at traditional retailers such as The Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Office Depot (ODP  -  Free Report). One drawback that remains is that although the system is itself secure, there is always a security risk for a buyer not used to dealing with Paypal, since it requires personal information.
"
1639,BKNG,"Mobile banking is set to grow very strongly over the next few years, according to Juniper Research.

"
1649,BKNG,"The U.S. digital advertising market has seen some very strong growth in the past few years, despite the recession that impacted the entire economy. eMarketer estimates that the market will grow 16.6% in 2012 to $37.3 billion, compared to the 21.7% growth in 2011 (latest available data).
"
1650,BKNG,"However, growth rates are expected to drop over the next few years: 13.9% in 2013, 12.4% in 2014, 8.7% in 2015 and 6.4% in 2015. Falling growth rates notwithstanding, the share of digital ad spending in total ad spending is expected to increase from 20% in 2011 to 29% in 2016. By contrast, TV ad spending is expected to drop slightly from around 38% of total ad spending in 2011 to less than 37% in 2016. Print is expected to decline even more significantly from 22.6% in 2011 to 16.4% in 2016.
"
1651,BKNG,"The current strength in online advertising is coming primarily from the growing popularity of the display format. Of all the forms of online advertising, display (including video, banner ads, rich media and sponsorships) is expected to see the strongest growth over the next few years. Also, of all the forms of display advertising, video and banner ads are expected to grow the strongest from 2011 to 2016.

"
1653,BKNG,"Google will remain the most significant player in digital advertising throughout the forecast period, growing its share from 40% in 2011 to 44% in 2014. Yahoo, Microsoft, Facebook (FB) and AOL will account for 7%, 7%, 7% and 2% share, respectively by 2014.
"
1654,BKNG,"The underlying drivers of growth of the display format are the continued increase in the number of users, greater propensity of users to consume online, a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the need to create brand awareness online.
"
1655,BKNG,"Search advertising is expected to remain popular, because results are measurable, and therefore, more predictable than other media. This also makes the market more resilient in recessionary conditions, since advertisers are more confident about the results of their spending.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1656,BKNG,"As evident from the above table, the top picks in the sector are online travel booking companies Priceline, Expedia and Orbitz Worldwide. International expansion is a key factor driving growth for these companies and collaborative agreements with local players are helping. The ADR is something to watch here, as lower-value inventories are on the rise.
"
1657,BKNG,"We are also cautiously optimistic about Google despite its recent history of misses, given the company’s market position, business stability, expected growth rates, strategic execution and positive estimate revision trend. The current uncertainty is related to the recently-acquired hardware business, which is impacting its margins. But this is just a small part of the overall business and we remain confident about management execution and planning that have been commendable in the past.
"
1658,BKNG,"While Facebook offers much higher growth, you also have to pay a higher multiple for it. This doesn’t make a lot of sense.WEAKNESSES
"
1659,BKNG,"TripAdvisor is doing extremely well right now and the company’s decision to invest in offline advertising (TV) makes sense. However, estimates have fallen as a result, pulling down the Zacks Rank. Given the increased expenditure, growth will moderate in the next few quarters. However, the stock remains a good pick for long-term investors.
"
1660,BKNG,"A weaker looking Durable Goods reading this morning and another day of Bernanke testimony provide the backdrop for today’s trading session. Italy related concerns will also be at play, partly offset by positive earnings reports from Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) this morning and Priceline.com (PCLN) after the close on Tuesday.
"
1661,BKNG,"Weakness in this morning’s Durable Goods orders for January came in weaker than expected, but the ‘headline’ softness was primarily in the transportation sector. After all, Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) took only two aircraft orders in January after orders for more than 180 planes the month before. But ‘core’ capital good goods orders officially known as nondefense capital goods orders excluding aircraft came in surprisingly very strong.
"
1662,BKNG,"The ‘core’ serves as a proxy for private sector capital expenditures in the economy and is typically weaker in the first month of the quarter. The inherent volatility of the Durable Goods report limits its utility on a month-to-month basis, but the ‘core’ strength is nevertheless positive and likely indicative of improvement in business confidence in January following the Fiscal Cliff headwind in at year’s end.
"
1663,BKNG,"We also have another day of testimony from the Fed Chief today, but the market likely got enough reassurance from his Tuesday comments. The bottom line on the Fed front is that there is no imminent change in the central bank’s bond purchase program, which has served as a key driver of the market’s recent momentum. Bernanke was categorical in claiming that they are well aware of the program’s costs and benefits and that it made sense for the Fed to continue with the open-ended QE program at this end. He cautiously cited improvement in the underlying economy, but also pointed towards policy risks, particularly from the budget sequester.
"
1664,BKNG,"Barring a material improvement in the labor market, meaning monthly job gains in excess of 200K for at least 3 months, I don’t expect any changes to the Fed’s current monetary policy stance, particularly given the strong likelihood of fiscal austerity getting underway as a result of the sequester.RELATED ARTICLESIs the Correction Over, or Just Getting Started?Market Eyes a Slew of News This Week (VIDEO)3 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks

1668,BKNG,"Tui Travel, which sells all-inclusive tour packages, recently told Sky News that its sales for the summer were up 4% over 2012 while bookings in the month of January jumped 2%. 
"
1669,BKNG,"The UK saw a 9% increase in summer bookings despite negative GDP growth last quarter. The Nordic countries also had strong bookings, rising 10%. Germany and France, however, saw demand fall. The company, which is publicly traded in London, guided to the high end of its previous full year 2013 guidance range.How Should Investors Play The Travel Boom?
"
1670,BKNG,"There are a bunch of directions investors could go when looking for travel plays. The most obvious is the hotel and resort companies. The airlines and cruise ships are another. 
"
1671,BKNG,"But what about the companies that consumers go to to plan their trips? The Internet has revolutionized travel. Twenty years ago, to plan a trip, you'd have to go to a travel agent with your ideas of your trip and the best you could do was to pick up some brochures. 
"
1672,BKNG,"Now, travelers have the world at their fingertips on the Internet but that has caused its own problems as there is so much information, who has time to sort through it all?
"
1673,BKNG,"Companies that present the easiest way to search through information are moving to the forefront of the travel industry. Traveling has gone social in a big way. Travelers want to make connections with other travelers and they want deals. Companies that give travelers these two basic things will thrive.
"
1674,BKNG,"And while you may think that some of these companies have been around a number of years so that there isn't much growth, they are still finding it in the emerging market countries where the middle class is expanding. A growing middle class means more discretionary spending money which should translate into more travel.4 Companies Cashing In On The Dream Trip1. TripAdvisor 2. Travelzoo 3. Expedia 4. Priceline.com TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report)
"
1675,BKNG,"TripAdvisor is the largest online travel research company in the world. Who doesn't go on it and dream of that dream vacation every once in awhile- especially in the midst of winter's cold and snow?
"
1676,BKNG,"It offers reviews of hotels, restaurants and attractions around the world. It operates tripadvisor sites in 30 countries as well as China, which operates under the brand daodao.com. In 2012, TripAdvisor was averaging about 60 million unique monthly visitors.
"
1677,BKNG,"In the third quarter of 2012, TripAdvisor made 79% of its revenue from click-based advertising, 11% from display-based advertising and 10% from subscription.
"
1678,BKNG,"The company was spun off from Expedia in 2011 and shares have had a rocky ride during that however they recently hit a new all-time high.
"
1679,BKNG,"For a company trading with a forward P/E of 28, expected earnings growth isn't that great for 2012. But earnings are supposed to ramp up in 2013.
"
1680,BKNG,"2012 expected earnings growth of 5%
"
1681,BKNG,"2013 expected earnings growth of 20.3%

1683,BKNG,"Travelzoo is a particular favorite of travel fans dreaming of that ""too good to pass up"" dream trip. Every Wednesday, it blasts out the Travelzoo Top 20 deals to its 26 million subscribers in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. 
"
1684,BKNG,"Travelzoo has had 1.5 million downloads of its smart phone app. It isn't restricted solely to travel as it also publishes deals on restaurants and entertainment.
"
1685,BKNG,"On Jan 24, Travelzoo reported its fourth quarter results and it beat the Zacks Consensus by 9%. Revenue rose 5% to $37 million. Travelzoo is the smallest of these four stock picks with a market cap of only $329 million.
"
1686,BKNG,"The stock soared in 2011 to $100 a share before crashing back to earth. It has traded in a narrow range since.

1689,BKNG,"Travelzoo is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report)
"
1690,BKNG,"Expedia is one of the world's largest online travel agents with its Expedia.com brand available in 30 countries. It also operates hotels.com, hotwire.com, Venere and eLong, China's second largest online travel agency.
"
1691,BKNG,"On Feb 5, the company reported its fourth quarter results and it beat the Zacks Consensus by 2 cents. Revenue rose 24% while gross bookings jumped 19%. Its biggest growth region was Asia-Pacific. International bookings were up 32% in the quarter.

"
1697,BKNG,"Priceline.com is one of the world's largest online travel agents. It operates a bunch of travel sites including Priceline.com, booking.com, agoda.com and rentalcars.com. Most are familiar with Priceline's ""name your price"" promotion with William Shatner.
"
1698,BKNG,"But booking.com has been its key to growth over the last several years. Booking.com is the largest hotel booking site in the world. Headquartered in Europe, and concentrating on the European market, booking.com wasn't launched in the United States until 2008.

1699,BKNG,"The company isn't afraid of acquiring companies to extend its growth. In November 2012, Priceline.com announced it was acquiring airline fare site Kayak for $1.8 billion. It's expected to close in the first quarter of 2013.

"
1705,BKNG,"The Electronic Commerce, or e-Commerce, industry is one of the most dynamic sectors of the economy. The industry is evolving very rapidly, so data collection and evaluation are particularly difficult. Consequently, one has to rely largely on surveys by both government and private agencies.
"
1706,BKNG,"According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the manufacturing sector is the largest contributor to e-Commerce sales (46.4% of their total shipments), followed by merchant wholesalers (24.6% of their total sales). These two segments make up the business-to-business category.
"
1707,BKNG,"Retailers and service providers generated just 4.4% and 2.3%, respectively, of their revenues online, a slightly higher percentage than they were in the prior year. The Bureau categorizes these two segments as business-to-consumer.
"
1708,BKNG,"The business-to-business category makes up 90% of total e-Commerce sales, with the balance coming from the business-to-consumer category. The fastest-growing segments were manufacturing and retail. [All the above data from the U.S. Census Bureau relate to 2010, as published in May 2012.]Key Drivers
"
1709,BKNG,"Since the industry is in evolution, the drivers are varying, or changing flavor. For instance, the initial push came from the time savings and convenience of online transactions. To this were added the benefits of comparison shopping and personal recommendations. As technology required for personalized recommendations developed, became more available and its benefits more evident, most e-tailers started adding the feature. It is now considered a must-have.
"
1710,BKNG,"Today, the biggest driver of growth in the industry is the adoption of smartphones, tablets and other mobile Internet devices. Smartphones continue to lead the way all over the world, although tablets are growing very fast, followed by other devices. Moreover, trends indicate that consumers prefer mobile browsers when shopping, searching and entertaining themselves, while preferring apps for navigation and acquiring information.
"
1711,BKNG,"comScore sees global mobile Internet users increasing very rapidly and surpassing desktop Internet users by 2014. U.S. smartphone users were up 47% from March 2011 to March 2012 and multi-device ownership (of smartphones, tablets and so forth) was up 308% during the same time period. Other countries with significant Internet traffic through non-computing devices include Singapore, the U.K., Japan, Australia, Canada, Spain, India, France and Brazil. Therefore, this estimate looks reasonable.
"
1712,BKNG,"Recent market research indicates that price comparisons, product reviews and product availability are checked online through mobile phones roughly a third of the time. Around 20% of consumers even check prices at rival websites while in a store, and a third of these shoppers are diverted.
"
1713,BKNG,"While smartphones are extremely convenient when on the move, tablets have several advantages of their own. In fact, they are a boon to the e-Commerce industry, since the larger screens offer better visibility of online stores and merchandise, thus facilitating purchases. This is the reason that although 79% of smartphones and tablets were used for shopping-related activities in the first quarter, 42% of tablet users actually purchased something using their devices versus just 29% for smartphones (Nielsen).
"
1714,BKNG,"However, smartphones were the preferred device for store location, coupon redemption and such other “ön-the-go” activities. Given the unique advantages of smartphones and tablets, it appears that they are working in conjunction to boost total online retail sales.
"
1715,BKNG,"The Android OS currently leads the U.S. mobile segment, according to comScore, with a 51% market share. The iOS is second with around 26%, followed by BlackBerry with around 12%. Going by new purchase trends in the first quarter (Android 58%, Apple 26% and Blackberry 10%), it looks like iOS will hold its own position (or grow slightly) in a growing market, with Windows also growing slightly and Android gaining hugely at the expense of Blackberry and smaller players.
"
1716,BKNG,"Another area moving very rapidly to an online model is entertainment (in the form of books, music, videos and games). Since reading books, listening to music, watching videos and playing games can be done using any device connecting to the Internet, the barriers to direct consumption are rapidly evaporating. Therefore, previously unconnected electronic goods, such as TVs and game consoles, are now being modified to enable connectivity.
"
1717,BKNG,"On the other side of the fence, online versions of books, music, videos and games that can be downloaded and consumed on a traditional computer or any other connected device are becoming available. Since the shift in consumption patterns is resulting in multi-functional electronic gadgets that are no longer optimized for a particular activity, there is a great drive to develop technologies that could improve the quality of each experience.E-tail Strategies
"
1718,BKNG,"The changing environment, where consumers are increasingly connected, have prompted retailers to develop new sales strategies. While many of the big traditional retailers and companies with well-known brands, such as Levis, have opened their own online stores, others (including many smaller players) are increasingly tying up with websites like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report), Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) and Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report).
"
1719,BKNG,"Amazon has for some time depended on the Kindle platform to boost book sales. But considering the growing competition from tablets, particularly Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPad, the company decided to broaden the scope of the device. Therefore, the Kindle Fire was built to help not only book sales, but also sales of all kinds of other digital content, including songs and movies.
"
1720,BKNG,"It is hard to tell exactly how this market will shape up given the recent launch of Google’s (GOOG) Nexus 7 and Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Surface. We are inclined to think that all these players will continue focusing on what they do best, so we do not see Amazon in any danger right now.
"
1721,BKNG,"Another recent development includes the sale of discount coupons, where Groupon (GRPN  -  Free Report) appears to be the forerunner. Groupon and its closest rival LivingSocial offer discount coupons with a very low shelf life from local players looking for sales. The company offers huge discounts to attract buyers and collects a percentage of the sales thus generated.
"
1722,BKNG,"This kind of business is very competitive, since it has very low barriers to entry. As a result, not just Amazon and Google, but also a host of other much smaller parties have started doing business in this format. Technology investments are also required in order to serve customer needs effectively. Considering the prospects, we don’t see the platform as a major contributor to e-Commerce sales in the near term.
"
1723,BKNG,"Another concept that has come up recently can best be termed social marketing. This is a concept popularized by Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), the most popular social networking site in the world. Currently, around half of the U.S. population has a Facebook account, and this is the potential that the platform will initially address.
"
1724,BKNG,"Facebook’s SocialStore, as it is called, uses MarketLive's Intelligent Commerce Platform that enables marketers to display product information, promotions/discounts, shopping carts and check-out options. Both comparative shopping and comparative pricing are possible. The basic advantages of the system that are currently being touted are that it allows easy brand building, creates meaningful commercial relationships and makes use of account-holders’ social connections to attract new buyers.
"
1725,BKNG,"A recent study by the E-tailing Group reveals that of 100 U.S. consumer product merchants with e-Commerce websites surveyed, 98 had a Facebook account. Around 90% of these redirected the user to the merchant’s own page, 96% had loaded brand-building videos, 56% had product-oriented videos, 44% had store locators and 38% had promotions.
"
1726,BKNG,"Another social networking site that has seen phenomenal growth since its launch in 2009 is Pinterest. According to comScore, Pinterest is currently the third largest social networking site in the U.S. (behind Facebook and Twitter), having attracted 10 million monthly unique visitors by February 2012. Forbes says the monthly unique visitors touched 20 million this month (from 1 million a year ago). While the company has yet to get into the advertising business, its users are already making money and engagement compares favorably with Facebook.Retail e-Commerce
"
1727,BKNG,"ComScore has provided first quarter 2012 retail ecommerce sales numbers. The firm estimates that sales increased 17% from the first quarter of 2011, representing the sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Moreover, it estimates that total retail sales are up 10% from the first quarter of 2008 (pre-recession), compared to a 42% increase in e-Commerce sales.
"
1728,BKNG,"The rapid growth in online retail sales in the U.S. will continue to come at the expense of brick-and-mortar outfits. ComScore adds that this increase is mainly on account of the lower prices and convenience of online transactions. There is also another emerging trend called “showrooming,” where consumers look at products in brick and mortar outlets and then complete the purchase online.
"
1729,BKNG,"Free shipping remains a major lure, with an e-tailing group survey showing that 73% of customers wanted unconditional free shipping, with 42% agreeing that free shipping would be welcome when they reached a certain spending level. Overall, 52% of purchases in the last quarter included free shipping, compared to 49% in the year-ago quarter.
"
1730,BKNG,"Total retail e-Commerce is currently 4.9% of total retail sales in the first quarter, according to the quarterly retail trade survey by the U.S. Census Bureau. Forrester Research estimates that this share will go up to 11% by 2015.
"
1731,BKNG,"Amazon remains the leader by far based on average monthly unique visitors (UVs). The e-Commerce giant, leveraging on its Prime and Kindle platforms, saw a 29% increase in UVs according to comScore. Although Apple remains a distant second, its UVs were up 25%, followed by Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), which saw UVs up 18% and Netflix (NFLX), which saw UVs up 9%.Travel
"
1732,BKNG,"The U.S. Commerce Department expects international travel to the U.S. to continue over the next few years. Visitor volume is currently expected to increase 6-8% a year from 2012 to 2016 leading to a 49% increase in the number of users during the period.
"
1733,BKNG,"Visitors from the Middle East are expected to be the slowest-growing (29%). South America, Asia and Oceania growth rates are expected to be comparable at 83%, 82% and 82%, respectively. The fastest growth is expected to come from China (232%), South Korea (200%), Brazil (150%), Russian Federation (139%) and India (94%). Travel and tourism is one of the country’s strongest industries, contributing a trade surplus in each of the last 20 years.
"
1734,BKNG,"According to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the improving economy will result in a 1.8% increase in demand for hotel reservations this year, which along with a 0.5% increase in hotel supply will lead to higher occupancy rates (60.9% expected in 2012 compared to 60.1% in 2011). This will also raise hotel rates by 5.1%.
"
1735,BKNG,"eMarketer estimates that online sales of leisure and unmanaged business travel in the U.S. increased 8.5% in 2011. eMarketer believes that the increase in spending was mainly on account of higher airfares, hotel rates and ancillary fees, which increase the aggregate dollar amount of online bookings. Booking through mobile devices is expected to grow significantly, with 11.8 million new users.
"
1736,BKNG,"However, another report by PhocusWright mentioned that when online penetration of the travel market reached 35% in any country, growth rates were likely to slow down to single-digits. The research firm mentioned that only the U.S., U.K. and Scandinavia had reached this level of penetration and most other markets across Europe, Asia and Latin America would continue to show good growth rates.Payment Systems
"
1737,BKNG,"With practically all market research indicating solid growth in e-Commerce sales over the next few years, online players are vying with each other to come out with convenient and secure payment solutions. The FIS Mobile Wallet from Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) is basically a bar code reader that feeds information related to the purchase into the user’s smartphone and uses it as a medium to transfer the information to the cloud. Online purchase of merchandise is also possible.
"
1738,BKNG,"The solution provides maximum security, since the transaction is carried out entirely in the cloud through the retailer’s and banker’s applications and personal information is not shared at the time of purchase. While QR code payments (as the technology is called) have already been made by half the smartphone users in the U.S. (report compiled by eMarketer), the usage was mainly out of curiosity. It appears that the safety of the system comes at a price, which is the time it takes to complete a transaction. This is the reason that Google is still betting on its digital wallet.
"
1739,BKNG,"Google digital wallet allows a customer to make a payment by waving his mobile phone over a POS terminal. While the near field communication (NFC) technology used in the system is already in use in some parts of Europe, the concept is relatively new to the U.S. Other than convenience, the main attraction being highlighted is the security of the payment channel, since neither the customer nor the retailer would be recording the personal information related to the customer.
"
1740,BKNG,"Adoption of the device, although it is some ways off, will have a remarkable effect on the volume and value of mobile transactions, since it should increase the percentage of higher-value sales through the mobile platform. However, the cost of POS terminals is a downside to the system that could easily turn away retail partners. But this is an evolving area, and much could change over the next few years.
"
1741,BKNG,"The digital wallet was a great improvement over eBay’s existing payment system, Paypal, which takes away a significant percentage of earnings from the retailer or person providing the service. Moreover, although the system is itself secure, there is always a security risk for a buyer not used to dealing with Paypal, since it requires that you provide personal information.
"
1742,BKNG,"According to an Emphatica study, mobile banking has not picked up sufficiently in either the U.S. or Canada, due to security-related concerns. However, an analysis by Deloitte shows that mobile banking could become the most-preferred banking method by 2020. The study estimates that 20-25 million ""Generation Y"" (Gen Y) consumers will become new banking customers by 2015.
"
1743,BKNG,"A study on banking.com shows that 48% of Gen Y consumers are already using online banking services. Moreover, their preference for online banking is so high that around 30% said they would consider switching financial institutions if they did not provide the service. Both online and mobile banking by Gen Y largely consists of checking account balances and transferring funds, although they also like to pay bills on the platform.
"
1744,BKNG,"It is believed that high smartphone penetration, higher income within this group and greater digital sophistication will drive increased demand for mobile banking services. Since mobile banking is expected to be the most cost efficient for banks, investment in technology to improve and expand mobile banking services is likely to increase.Security
"
1745,BKNG,"With online transactions expected to boom over the next few years, the topmost concern remains security. While banks will spend significantly on secure payment systems, hackers are expected to have a field day, largely targeting the flood of customers going online. Last year saw a huge increase in security breaches, something that may be expected to continue.
"
1746,BKNG,"Alternative payment systems will continue to gain popularity. While some of these payment systems, such as eBay’s PayPal have been around for a while, other systems, such as Google’s digital wallet and the FIS Mobile Wallet are still in the making. Alternative payment systems never really gained momentum in the past because of the low volume of transactions. However, as online transactions continue to increase, many more such systems could suddenly become more available.
"
1747,BKNG,"We expect mobile security to become a major focus area for technology companies, since this is the stumbling block to payments through the mobile platform (currently just 2% of U.S. online spending). Additionally, hackers continue to multiply and data breaching has become commonplace.Online Advertising
"
1748,BKNG,"The U.S. online advertising market has seen some very strong growth in the past few years, despite the recession that impacted the entire economy. This year, the market will benefit from the U.S. General Election and the Summer Olympics. eMarketer estimates that the market will grow 23.3% in 2012 to $33.8 billion, compared to the 23.0% growth in 2011. However, growth rates are expected to drop over the next few years: 17.7% in 2013, 13.5% in 2014, 8.9% in 2015 and 7.8% in 2015.
"
1749,BKNG,"Falling growth rates notwithstanding, the share of online ad spending in total ad spending is expected to increase from 20% in 2011 to 31% in 2016. By contrast, TV ad spending is expected to drop slightly from around 38% of total ad spending in 2011 to less than 37% in 2016. Print is expected to decline even more significantly, from 22.6% in 2011 to 16.4% in 2016.
"
1750,BKNG,"The current strength in online advertising is coming primarily from the growing popularity of the display format. Of all the forms of online advertising, display (including video, banner ads, rich media and sponsorships) is expected to see the strongest growth over the next few years. Also, of all the forms of display advertising, video and banner ads are expected to grow the strongest from 2011 to 2016.
"
1751,BKNG,"Contrary to previous expectations, it now appears that search will remain supreme throughout, although its share will give way slightly to video ad spending, which will nearly double. The lower pricing of video and banner ads has made them popular with brand advertisers, so ad inventories are solid. Another factor favoring display ads is the proliferation of smartphones, where the smaller screens make display ads more effective than text ads.
"
1752,BKNG,"Facebook, which recently had its IPO, is the largest player in the display ad segment with a 14% share in 2011. Google is close on its heels with 13.8%. eMarketer estimates that Facebook and Google will remain neck-to-neck this year, with Google pulling ahead in 2013 and widening the gap in 2014. Yahoo, which was in third position with 10.8% share in 2011, is expected to see a steady decline in sales and market position. Microsoft and AOL, while growing revenues are expected to maintain market share.
"
1753,BKNG,"The underlying drivers of growth of the display format are the continued increase in the number of users, greater propensity of users to consume online, a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the push into display advertising.
"
1754,BKNG,"Search advertising is expected to remain popular, because results are measurable, and therefore, more predictable than other media. This also makes the market more resilient in recessionary conditions, since advertisers are more confident about the results of their spending.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1755,BKNG,"We can strongly recommend very few stocks in the sector at this point. However, longer-term opportunities abound, as have been outlined below.
"
1756,BKNG,"Online travel company Priceline (PCLN) is in a strong growth market. Consequently, it should continue to benefit from international expansion and customers moving online. Domestic growth will likely be slower and mainly driven by the continued improvement in the economy. While Orbitz Worldwide (OWW) is a much smaller player with more limited resources, it too should benefit from these trends.
"
1757,BKNG,"However, expansion in China will be disappointing, as local players and the government continue to make operation difficult for U.S. players. Occupancy tax issues are likely to remain a point of contention and online travel agents have recently scored a few wins.
"
1758,BKNG,"The search market is dominated by Google Inc. (GOOG), which has seen phenomenal growth rates over the last five years. The company is a leading innovator, using its engineering talent to extend its position in the computing platform to the mobile platform.
"
1759,BKNG,"The company has a huge cash balance that we were concerned was not being put to the best use. However, Google remains acquisitive, which should further round out its product portfolio, build on current strengths and help expansion into new areas. Google’s main challenge is the increasing competition from not just archrival Yahoo, but also challenger Microsoft Corp, whose Bing search engine continues to gain ground.
"
1760,BKNG,"A much smaller provider of Internet advertising solutions and online marketing services, ValueClick Inc. (VCLK) should also benefit from the strength in the online advertising market (particularly display), the recently acquired Dotomi, international expansion, restructuring actions and strong cash flows. However, as firms with larger advertising budgets increase spending on Internet advertising, many of the services performed by ValueClick could be done in-house. This is a risk of investing in the stock.WEAKNESSES
"
1761,BKNG,"As far as e-tailers go, the foremost remain Amazon.com and eBay. Amazon’s opex has been on the rise and is likely to remain high through the year, as the company invests to take growth to the next level. Although we expect the strong revenue growth to continue, the continued addition to its operating leverage will keep earnings depressed for some time.
"
1762,BKNG,"As international sales gain momentum and the shift from offline to online purchasing continue, margins should respond and trickle down to the bottom line.  However, we don’t see this happening in the next 6 months (which is our long-term investment horizon).
"
1763,BKNG,"E-tailer eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) continues to play catch-up with Amazon. The company is undergoing a metamorphosis, with a new image, new strategies and technology investments. We expect eBay’s results to improve going forward, driven by its Paypal payment platform. However, Amazon remains the better play, in our opinion.
"
1764,BKNG,"Online travel company Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) is not likely to do as well as Priceline, as the company will feel the impact of the TripAdvisor spinoff. Moreover, it has exposure to the air ticket segment, where competition is on the rise and airline policies are raising ticket prices. The resultant  decline in air ticket sales is negatively impacting its results.
"
1765,BKNG,"Meanwhile, competition continues to intensify for Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM), which provides distributed e-business infrastructure services and solutions. The low barriers to entry are also a concern, since this is a market adjacency that any large Internet or networking company, such as Google, Yahoo!, AT&T, Verizon, Cisco or Lucent could venture into.
"
1766,BKNG,"Falling bandwidth prices are pressuring margins, while rising bandwidth costs are attracting new players. However, broadband penetration and momentum in online media and entertainment remain tailwinds.Yahoo (YHOO) is second only to Google in the search market, although the company has not seen much gain in market share. Management remains focused on the display segment, which should pay dividends if projections for that market hold good.
"
1767,BKNG,"Yahoo has a leading position in email applications and is building on this position through acquisitions and upgrades, which should ultimately help it turn around. However, monetization of the search alliance with Microsoft remains behind schedule, and there is some controversy related to its Asian assets, which are the main attraction in the shares.
"
1768,BKNG,"The Electronic Commerce, or e-commerce, industry is one of the most progressive sectors of the economy. The industry is evolving very rapidly, so data collection and evaluation are particularly difficult. Consequently, one has to rely largely on surveys by both government and private agencies.
"
1769,BKNG,"According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the manufacturing sector is the largest contributor to e-commerce sales (46.4% of their total shipments), followed by merchant wholesalers (24.6% of their total sales). These two segments make up the business-to-business category.
"
1770,BKNG,"Retailers and service providers generated just 4.4% and 2.3%, respectively of their revenues online, a slightly higher percentage than they were in the prior year. The Bureau categorizes these two segments as business-to-consumer.
"
1771,BKNG,"This places the business-to-business category at 90% of total ecommerce sales, with the balance coming from the business-to-consumer category. The latest numbers from the Bureau suggest that the fastest-growing segments were manufacturing and retail. [All the above data from the U.S. Census Bureau relate to 2010, as published in May 2012]A.    Retail
"
1772,BKNG,"Total retail e-commerce was 5.1% of total retail sales in the second quarter of 2012, up slightly from 4.9% in the first quarter, according to the quarterly retail trade survey by the U.S. Census Bureau. Forrester Research estimates that this share will go up to 11% by 2015.
"
1773,BKNG,"Recent data from comScore (as compiled in the table below) indicates that this segment recovered much faster from the economic downturn and continued to grow at an accelerated rate over the last few years.Key Drivers
"
1774,BKNG,"Since the industry is in evolution, the drivers are changing. For instance, the initial push came from the time savings and convenience of online transactions. To this were added the benefits of comparison shopping and personal recommendations. As technology required for personalized recommendations developed, became more available and its benefits more evident, most e-tailers started adding the feature until it is now considered a must-have.
"
1775,BKNG,"Today, the biggest driver of growth in the industry is the adoption of smartphones, tablets and other mobile Internet devices. In fact, trends indicate that consumers prefer mobile browsers when shopping, searching and entertaining themselves, while preferring apps for navigation and acquiring information.
"
1776,BKNG,"comScore sees global mobile Internet users increasing very rapidly and surpassing desktop Internet users by 2014. A June 2012 study by comScore on behalf of Paypal revealed that mobile ecommerce tripled from 3% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 9% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The trend is likely to continue since 4 out of 5 smartphone owners used the devices for shopping and related activities in July (September 2012 study by comScore). Men and women in the 25 to 44-year age group are doing most of the shopping on both Android and iOS devices.
"
1777,BKNG,"While smartphones are extremely convenient when on the move, tablets have several advantages of their own. In fact they are a boon to the ecommerce industry, since the larger screens offer better visibility of online stores and merchandise, thus facilitating purchases. This is the reason that tablets remain the device of choice for making online purchases while smartphones are the preferred devices for store location, coupon redemption and such other “ön-the-go” activities. Given the unique advantages of smartphones and tablets, it appears that they are working in conjunction to boost total online retail sales.
"
1778,BKNG,"Around 37% of customers in the third quarter were comparison shopping on their mobile devices while in retail stores, something the industry now calls “showrooming.” Because of the resultant cost savings and convenience, this trend is likely to continue (comScore, November 2012).
"
1779,BKNG,"Continued advancements in technology are improving navigation and customer experience on ecommerce sites, which is improving reviews and thus drawing more traffic to the sites.
"
1780,BKNG,"The digital consumption of books, music, video and games all over the world is extending the reach of these goods and thereby boosting sales. Therefore, previously unconnected electronic goods, such as TVs and game consoles are now being modified to enable connectivity. On the other side of the fence, online versions of books, music, video and games that can be downloaded and consumed on a traditional computer or any other connected device are becoming available.
"
1781,BKNG,"Since the shift in consumption patterns is resulting in multi-functional electronic gadgets that are no longer optimized for a particular activity, there is a great drive to develop technologies that could improve the quality of each experience.Free shipping remains a major lure, as seen from the recent e-tailing group survey, where 85% of surveyed consumers said they intended to make use of it this holiday season.  Top-selling items
"
1782,BKNG,"A July 2012 study by Forrester Research points to the most popular products being sold online. The 10 hottest individual product categories are women’s apparel, books, computer hardware, computer software, apparel, toys/video games, video DVDs, health and beauty, consumer electronics and music.Apparel is a huge market and although online sales are currently under 10% of total apparel sales, the category already generates the most dollars. Selling tools, such as zoom, color swatching and configurators are helping the process. Even primarily brick-and-mortar outfits like Macy’s (M) sees that consumers purchasing through multiple channels (online and offline stores) tend to spend more. This is encouraging traditional retailers to offer an online store to supplement sales. Online sales also show better conversions since searches usually draw consumers with a prior intention to purchase.
"
1783,BKNG,"The increase in technology purchases over the Internet is driven by not only individual consumers, but also companies and governments. The efficient and timely processing of orders, choice of payment options, subscription-selling and sales under the SaaS model are all facilitators.  
"
1784,BKNG,"The Association of American Publishers says that ebook sales in the U.S. continue at a steady rate and are likely to touch $1.5 billion this year. What is more encouraging is however the growth U.S. players are seeing in international markets (sales up 333% in 2011). Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) are the primary channels facilitating international expansion, although Barnes & Noble (BKS), other smaller players and local companies in international markets are also playing a part.Google’s (GOOG) Youtube remains the forerunner facilitating online video consumption, with significantly higher unique viewers (UVs) and unique streams. VEVO and AOL Media Network are in second and fourth positions, respectively in both respects. While Yahoo! (YHOO) managed to steal the third position in terms of UVs, Hulu took its place with respect to the number of streams. Highest hours of viewership however went to Netflix (NFLX), which pushed Youtube and Hulu to numbers two and three, respectively. [Nielsen estimates, September 2012]
"
1785,BKNG,"The digital consumption of music has grown greatly since Apple announced its first iPod. Amazon and others are also seeing their business grow. Nielsen estimates that in the first three quarters of 2012, U.S. digital album sales increased 15% from the comparable period last year, with shipments on track to set a new record in 2012.
"
1786,BKNG,"The gaming segment has suffered over the last few quarters, impacted by the economic slowdown that affected consumer spending. However, while this affected total gaming spend, it did not affect the online segment, which gained from the increasing digitization of games, the desire to play across multiple platforms and the availability of free-to-play games to draw customers. As a result, sales through online channels continue to grow at the expense of traditional retail.
"
1787,BKNG,"Since video, games and music are often social activities, they are increasingly being marketed on social platforms such as Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Pinterest.
"
1788,BKNG,"Facebook’s SocialStore, as it is called uses MarketLive's Intelligent Commerce Platform that enables marketers to display product information, promotions/discounts, shopping carts and check-out options. Both comparative shopping and comparative pricing are possible. The basic advantages of the system that are currently being touted are that it allows easy brand building, creates meaningful commercial relationships and makes use of account-holders’ social connections to attract new buyers.
"
1789,BKNG,"A recent study by the E-tailing Group reveals that of 100 U.S. consumer product merchants with e-commerce websites surveyed, 98 had a Facebook account. Around 90% of these redirected the user to the merchant’s own page, 96% had loaded brand-building videos, 56% had product-oriented videos, 44% had store locators and 38% had promotions.
"
1790,BKNG,"According to comScore, Pinterest is currently the third largest social networking site. While the company is yet to get into the advertising business, its users are already making money and engagement compares favorably with Facebook.
"
1791,BKNG,"Selling discount coupons is also helping retail. Groupon (GRPN  -  Free Report) is the leader here, which along with its closest rival LivingSocial offer discount coupons with a very low shelf life from local players looking for sales. The company offers huge discounts to attract buyers and collects a percentage of the sales thus generated. This kind of business is very competitive, since it has very low barriers to entry.
"
1792,BKNG,"As a result, not just Amazon and Google, but also a host of other much smaller parties have started doing some business in this format. Technology investments are also required in order to serve customer needs effectively. Considering the prospects, we don’t see the platform as a major contributor to e-commerce sales in the near term.Market Position
"
1793,BKNG,"comScore estimates that Amazon remains the leading Internet retailer based unique visitors (UVs), followed by eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report), Apple, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Target Corp. (TGT) and Best Buy (BBY), in that order. The top 3 have a much higher penetration on both Android and iOS platforms.B.    Travel
"
1794,BKNG,"The U.S. Commerce Department expects international travel to the U.S. to continue over the next few years. Visitor volume is currently expected to increase 6-8% a year from 2012 to 2016 leading to a 49% increase in the number of users during the period. Visitors from the Middle East are expected to be the slowest-growing (29%). South America, Asia and Oceania growth rates are expected to be comparable at 83%, 82% and 82%, respectively.
"
1795,BKNG,"The fastest growth is expected to come from China (232%), South Korea (200%), Brazil (150%), Russian Federation (139%) and India (94%). Travel and tourism is one of the country’s strongest industries, contributing a trade surplus in each of the last 20 years.  
"
1796,BKNG,"According to research from eTrack, eMarketer and Alexa.com compiled in September 2012, Internet-based travel booking revenue has grown 73% over the last five years, with 57% of all travel reservations being made online. The bookings and revenue generated by source and category (latest estimates) are represented in the following graphs.
"
1797,BKNG,"The top travel booking sites are Booking.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com (recently acquired by Priceline), Travelocity.com, Orbitz.com and Hotwire.com. Since Booking.com and now Kayak are part of Priceline (PCLN) and both Hotels.com and Hotwire.com part of Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), this narrows down the top companies in the segment to Priceline, Expedia, Orbitz Worldwide (OWW) and Travelocity.
"
1798,BKNG,"According to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the improving economy will result in a 1.8% increase in demand for hotel reservations this year, which along with a 0.5% increase in hotel supply will lead to higher occupancy rates (60.9% expected in 2012 compared to 60.1% in 2011). This will also raise hotel rates by 5.1%.
"
1799,BKNG,"Smartphones are playing a key role in travel purchases, especially for last minute purchases. eMarketer expects smartphone travel researchers to grow from 23.7% of total online travel researchers in 2011 to 53.9% in 2016. Similarly, smartphone travel purchasers are expected to grow from 12.6% in 2011 to 32.5% in 2016.
"
1800,BKNG,"Another report by PhocusWright mentioned that when online penetration of the travel market reached 35% in any country, growth rates were likely to slow down to single-digits. The research firm mentioned that only the U.S., U.K. and Scandinavia had reached this level of penetration and most other markets across Europe, Asia and Latin America would continue to show good growth rates.C.    Payment Systems
"
1801,BKNG,"With practically all market research indicating solid growth in ecommerce sales over the next few years, online players are vying with each other to come out with convenient and secure payment solutions. The FIS Mobile Wallet from Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) is basically a bar code reader that feeds information related to the purchase into the user’s smartphone and uses it as a medium to transfer the information to the cloud. Online purchase of merchandise is also possible. The solution provides maximum security, since the transaction is carried out entirely in the cloud through the retailer’s and banker’s applications and personal information is not shared at the time of purchase.
"
1802,BKNG,"While QR code payments (as the technology is called) have already been made by half the smartphone users in the U.S. (report compiled by eMarketer), the usage was mainly out of curiosity. It appears that the safety of the system comes at a price, which is the time it takes to complete a transaction. This is the reason that Google is still betting on its digital wallet.
"
1803,BKNG,"Google’s digital wallet allows a customer to make a payment by waving his mobile phone over a POS terminal. While the near field communication (NFC) technology used in the system is already in use in some parts of Europe, the concept is relatively new to the U.S. Other than the convenience of the whole thing, the main attraction being highlighted is the security of the payment channel, since neither the customer nor the retailer would be recording the personal information related to the customer. Adoption of the device, although it is some way off, will have a remarkable effect on the volume and value of mobile transactions, since it should increase the percentage of higher-value sales.
"
1804,BKNG,"However, the cost of POS terminals is a downside to the system that could easily turn away retail partners. This is an evolving area and much could change over the next few years.
"
1805,BKNG,"The greatest success however is currently being enjoyed by eBay’s Paypal, which has seen some success at traditional retailers such as The Home Depot (HD) and Office Depot (ODP). One drawback that remains is that although the system is itself secure, there is always a security risk for a buyer not used to dealing with Paypal, since it requires personal information.
"
1806,BKNG,"According to an Emphatica study, mobile banking has not picked up sufficiently in either the U.S. or Canada, due to security-related concerns. However, an analysis by Deloitte shows that mobile banking could become the most-preferred banking method by 2020. The study estimates that 20-25 million gen Y consumers will become new banking customers by 2015.
"
1807,BKNG,"A study on banking.com shows that 48% of ""Generation Y"" (gen Y) consumers are already using online banking services. Moreover, their preference for online banking is so high that around 30% said they would consider switching financial institutions if they did not provide the service. Both online and mobile banking by gen Y largely consists of checking account balances and transferring funds, although they also like to pay bills on the platform.   
"
1808,BKNG,"It is believed that high smartphone penetration, higher income within this group and greater digital sophistication will drive increased demand for mobile banking services. Since mobile banking is expected to be the most cost efficient for banks, investment in technology to improve and expand mobile banking services is likely to increase.D.    Security
"
1809,BKNG,"With online transactions expected to boom over the next few years, the topmost concern remains security. While banks will spend significantly on secure payment systems, hackers are expected to have a field day, largely targeting the flood of customers going online. Last year saw a huge increase in security breaches, something that may be expected to continue.
"
1810,BKNG,"Alternative payment systems will continue to gain popularity. While some of these payment systems, such as eBay’s PayPal have been around for a while, other systems, such as Google’s digital wallet and the FIS Mobile Wallet are still in the making. Alternative payment systems never really gained momentum in the past because of the low volume of transactions. However, as online transactions continue to increase, many more such systems could suddenly become more available.
"
1811,BKNG,"We expect mobile security to become a major focus area for technology companies, since this is the stumbling block to payments through the mobile platform (currently just 2% of U.S. online spending). Additionally, hackers continue to multiply and data breaching has become commonplace.E.    Online Advertising
"
1812,BKNG,"The U.S. online advertising market has seen some very strong growth in the past few years, despite the recession that impacted the entire economy. 2012 numbers will benefit from the national election and the summer Olympics. eMarketer estimates that the market will grow 23.3% in 2012 to $33.8 billion, compared to the 23.0% growth in 2011.
"
1813,BKNG,"However, growth rates are expected to drop over the next few years: 17.7% in 2013, 13.5% in 2014, 8.9% in 2015 and 7.8% in 2015. Falling growth rates notwithstanding, the share of online ad spending in total ad spending is expected to increase from 20% in 2011 to 31% in 2016. By contrast, TV ad spending is expected to drop slightly from around 38% of total ad spending in 2011 to less than 37% in 2016. Print is expected to decline even more significantly from 22.6% in 2011 to 16.4% in 2016.
"
1814,BKNG,"The current strength in online advertising is coming primarily from the growing popularity of the display format. Of all the forms of online advertising, display (including video, banner ads, rich media and sponsorships) is expected to see the strongest growth over the next few years. Also, of all the forms of display advertising, video and banner ads are expected to grow the strongest from 2011 to 2016.
"
1815,BKNG,"Contrary to previous expectations, it now appears that search will remain supreme throughout, although its share will give way slightly to video ad spending which will nearly double. The lower pricing of video and banner ads has made them popular with brand advertisers, so ad inventories are solid. Another factor favoring display ads is the proliferation of smartphones, where the smaller screens make display ads more effective than text ads.
"
1816,BKNG,"Facebook was the largest player in the display ad segment with a 14% share in 2011. Google was close on its heels with 13.8%. eMarketer estimates that Facebook and Google will remain neck-to-neck this year, with Google pulling ahead in 2013 and widening the gap in 2014. Yahoo, which was in third position with 10.8% share in 2011, is expected to see a steady decline in sales and market position. Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and AOL (AOL), while growing revenues are expected to maintain market share.
"
1817,BKNG,"The underlying drivers of growth of the display format are the continued increase in the number of users, greater propensity of users to consume online, a growing inventory of advertisements that serve to lower advertisement prices and the push into display advertising.
"
1818,BKNG,"Search advertising is expected to remain popular, because results are measurable, and therefore, more predictable than other media. This also makes the market more resilient in recessionary conditions, since advertisers are more confident about the results of their spending.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1819,BKNG,"As evident from the above table, online travel companies are the picks for the sector, particularly Priceline and Expedia. International expansion is a key factor driving growth for these companies and collaborative agreements with local players are helping. The ADR is something to watch here, as lower-value inventories are on the rise.
"
1820,BKNG,"Of the retail companies, we recommend eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report), which has an attractive growth rate and has shown solid execution over the last few quarters. Moreover, eBay’s turnaround story continues and its many initiatives to drive growth are likely to pay off. Another stock that looks attractive for longer-term investors is Zynga (ZNGA), which has a history of beating estimates and is also seeing upward revision in estimates.WEAKNESSESAmazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is currently in the investment phase and there is a great deal of uncertainty as to how long it will continue in this phase. The uncertainty is leading to repeated downward revisions to estimates, which in turn is pushing down the Zacks Rank. The largest online retailer is by no means a write-off, but short-term investors would gain little from its solid revenue growth and international investments.
"
1821,BKNG,"We also have reservations about Groupon (GRPN  -  Free Report), which operates in a highly competitive segment with low barriers to entry.
"
1822,BKNG,"The stock market has erased most of the early summer losses and is now within striking distance of the spring high. While the gains earlier on were concentrated largely in defensive and counter cyclical stocks, the momentum seems to have broadened a bit following the Friday jobs report. But the gains lack in conviction, as the small caps have lagged the large-caps -- likely a reflection that the market remains ambivalent about the economic and Fed policy outlook.
"
1823,BKNG,"We will not get any clarity on those fronts given the dearth of economic reports this week. But the clamor for more Fed support does not seem to have died down following the July jobs report as indicated by the Boston Fed President’s interview with the Wall Street Journal, where he advocates for an open-ended new round of bond purchases by the central bank.
"
1824,BKNG,"Eric Rosengren, the Boston Fed chief, does not have a vote on the FOMC, but his policy stance is a reflection of others like New York President Bill Dudley and Fed vice chairwoman Janet Yellen, who do have votes.
"
1825,BKNG,"We will get more clarity over this debate within the FOMC later this month at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole huddle. Bernanke had used the Jackson Hole platform in 2010 to telegraph his QE2 plans in 2011. We will have another monthly jobs report and a host of other economic indicators before the Fed’s next scheduled meeting on September 12 and 13th.
"
1826,BKNG,"Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and Priceline (PCLN) on tap to report results after the close today.
"
1827,BKNG,"Of this morning’s basket of results, CVS Caremark’s (CVS  -  Free Report) report incorporated the two key elements that we have seen repeatedly this earnings season – two thirds of the companies have beaten earnings expectations, but more than 60% have fallen short on the revenue side. In fairness to CVS, however, the drug store chain guided higher while many others have done the opposite.

1837,BKNG,"In 2011, Travelzoo was the darling of the travel stocks as it soared to over $100, with a sky-high P/E to match. Then the rug was yanked out from under it and the stock has been in a slide ever since.
