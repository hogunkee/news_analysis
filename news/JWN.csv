Nordstrom delivered surprise earnings growth and lifted the bottom end of EPS guidance, but quarterly sales matched views and comps fell short.The home-improvement retailer beat first-quarter earnings estimates, but revenue and same-store sales came up short, as a cold spring season kept people from buying gardening and other outdoor supplies. Home Depot first held to its full-year financial outlook, citing ""a favorable housing and macroeconomic backdrop."" Online sales jumped, and rising prices of lumber, copper and other materials bumped up sales. Credit Suisse analysts also expected a rebound for Home Depot in the second quarter, but said ""we expect that the near-term direction of the stock to be dictated by weather in the coming weeks.""Retail sales data for April showed that the consumer soft patch to start the year has given way to strength, likely helped by delayed tax refunds.

And Wall Street appeared unconvinced the pickup in sales marked a sustained turnaround, sending Macy's shares reeling after the release of the figures from November and December.The company is working its way through plans, announced in 2016, to close 100 stores.

37,JWN,"Amid a growing battle with Amazon (AMZN), word has it that Wal-Mart (WMT) is looking to build a mall in the sky — or cyberspace, at least.XThe mega-retailer is reportedly close to an agreement to give department store Lord & Taylor some of its valuable website territory on Walmart.com and open the doors to creating an ""online mall"" on the site, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing someone familiar with the matter.In the immediate term, the move would give Wal-Mart access to higher-end merchandise and designer brands, while expanding Lord & Taylor's presence. Owned by HBC (also a parent to Saks Fifth Avenue and Hudson's Bay), Lord & Taylor has about 50 locations in North America.And the battle for online shoppers is fierce: Amazon and Wal-Mart have slashed shipping prices, dabbled in drone delivery systems and nurtured their own in-house brands. Amazon's slew of nearly 20 private-label apparel brands, which include Goodthreads and Lark & Ro, are the e-commerce giant's latest attempts to up its fashion cred.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard has been outperforming the S&P 500 so far this year.Wal-Mart has been on an apparent quest to boost its own style factor. Amid its shopping spree over the last year or so, which has included e-commerce player Jet.com and meal-kit delivery service Parcel, it picked up online apparel shops with big indie followings, such as ModCloth and Bonobos.Jet.com founder and Wal-Mart's e-commerce chief, Marc Lore, reportedly wants to ""elevate"" Walmart.com brands, said the Journal.The company is also experimenting with perhaps avant-garde shopping tools, such as ""in-fridge delivery"" in conjunction with smart-lock maker August, in which Deliv drivers are given one-time access to shoppers' homes so they can put grocery orders in the refrigerator.Wal-Mart shares were up 0.2% at 86.40 in the stock market today.

42,JWN,"Who are people increasingly buying clothes from online? Not Macy's (M) or Nordstrom (JWN) but Amazon (AMZN) and Stitch Fix, according to the latest research.X Both Amazon and Stitch Fix were among 2016's top 10 retailers by online apparel wallet share, said NPD Group.Subscription boxes like Stitch Fix and Nordstrom-owned Trunk Club, which offer customers regular shipments of clothes, aren't exactly new. But they are looking to break out of their niche status as indie players. And once people subscribe to an apparel box membership, the model appears to have sticking power: NPD said Stitch Fix subscribers dedicate a third of their online clothing spend to the service, while Trunk Club subscribers hand over 40% of their online apparel budget to the box.Amazon recently staked out its turf with a subscription box of its own. Amazon Prime Wardrobe allows customers to have three or more items shipped to them for free so they can try on products at home, then decide what to keep and what to return. The more items they keep, the greater a discount they'll receive on their purchase.""We have entered a new world of retail where the traditional leaders are faced with unconventional channel competition, and subscription services are the newest player,"" said NPD Chief Industry Analyst Marshal Cohen in a statement. He believes the subscription box market has a ""great deal of room to grow,"" and that more competitors are on the way.Stitch Fix, Trunk Club and Le Tote subscribers have grown to nearly 5% of all online shoppers, spending an average of $170 per purchase annually, said the research group.And TechCrunch reported on Friday, citing sources, that Stitch Fix had filed confidentially for an IPO. The company, which in June named Paul Yee as its CFO, said it brought in $730 million in revenue in 2016.IBD'S TAKE: Retail is a different game than it used to be. Now, shoppers are practically omnipotent, and they expect stores to be able to read their minds — otherwise, they might take their business to Amazon. But just because the subscription box model is gaining steam doesn't mean that it will guarantee success with investors, particularly as Amazon looms large.Meal-kit company Blue Apron (APRN), is trading well below its IPO price of 10 since going public on June 29. Amazon has indicated interest in entering the meal-kit market; a recent trademark filing sent Blue Apron shares plunging 10.5% in one session.Blue Apron was down 0.7% at 6.69 in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Amazon shares fell 2.3% to 996.25 intraday, undercutting a recent 1,016.60 flat-base buy point and just breaching its 50-day moving average. Nordstrom lost 0.1%.RELATED:The 2017 IPO Market Was Supposed To Be Huge — What Happened?Prime Wardrobe: Is This How Amazon Kills Macy's In Fashion Game?Amazon Trademark Filing Puts Target On Blue Apron, Meal Delivery

The provider of automated advertising technology, which competes against Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL), guided Q3 and full-year revenue estimates higher. Trade Desk IPO'd in September at 18, saw a first-day pop of 67% and peaked at 57.87 in late July.

The optical device maker reported in-line Q2 profit but revenue was light amid weakness in the company's North America business as well as China. Lumentum management said it has $200 million in orders for 3D devices in calendar 2017 and manufacturing yields have been solid. One question, though is how much Apple business Lumentum will potentially share with Germany's AMS, Finisar (FNSR) and II-VI (IIVI). Lumentum said China's inventory correction could last until the December quarter.Drug and biotech earnings were a mixed bag with Perrigo (PRGO), Horizon Pharma (HZNP), Kite Pharma (KITE) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) topping views while Mylan (MYL), Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) lagged second-quarter expectations.

Jack in the Box (JACK) same-store sales came in better than expected, but some analysts hope the chain can reclaim customers with a bigger push on cheap combo offerings and other deals. The company also continued to weigh whether to sell, or do something else with, Qdoba, its Mexican chain. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) beat on the top and bottom line. McDonald's (MCD) set its sights on China, forming a partnership that will aim to expand the number of locations there to 4,500 from 2,500.Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) reported second-quarter EPS growth of 20% with revenue up 13% to $13.441 billion, both better than expected.

68,JWN,"Macy's (M) shares hit a seven-year low and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) breached its key 200-day moving average amid a report that department stores are now discounting prestige beauty products, a segment once thought to be untouchable by price slashers.XLord & Taylor and Macy's-owned Bloomingdale's are following Macy's in offering slight discounts on beauty products, according to the Wall Street Journal.Macy's fell 7% to 21.08 in the stock market today, hitting its worst levels since September 2010 amid the latest retail rout. Kohl's (KSS) shares skidded 4.2%, cutting its 50-day. Kohl's is near a recent 52-week low. Nordstrom (JWN) tumbled 2.7% to 46.24.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) sank through its 200-day line for the first time in 16 months. Ulta fell 2.9% to 268.82, continuing a downward march from a recent all-time high of 314.86 in early June.Specialty beauty retailers Ulta Beauty and Sephora have typically been regarded as Amazon (AMZN)-resistant companies, immune to the promotional downward spiral facing apparel sellers and the woes befalling Macy's and other department stores. Both also have strong rewards programs that court shoppers' loyalty.But Monday's story in the Journal, while not indicative of greater discounting at Ulta or Sephora, may point to concerns over potential ripple effects. It is unclear how much pressure specialty beauty retailers would experience should heavy cosmetics discounting at department stores become widespread.Estee Lauder (EL), a prestige brand found at major department stores (and to a certain degree at Ulta and Sephora), fell below its 50-day moving average for the first time in three months. Shares closed off session lows, losing just 1 cent to 94.27, but that's below the rising support line.Estee Lauder cleared a 94.57 entry point from a cup-with-handle base in late May, rising as high as 98.40.

69,JWN,"XProbably the biggest issue people have with shopping for clothes online is not wanting to buy something before they've tried it on — not to mention the hassle of dealing with returns — but here comes Amazon (AMZN) yet again with a fix sure to step on the toes of Macy's (M) and Nordstrom's (JWN).The e-commerce behemoth's newest unveiling — you know, outside of devouring Whole Foods Market (WFM) in a $13.7 billion acquisition last week — is Amazon Prime Wardrobe, a home try-on system that allows users to have three or more items shipped to them for free so they can try products on at home, then be charged for what they decide to keep.Amazon shoppers could, of course, just buy products online and return them, but this new apparel offering doesn't force them to plunk down cash beforehand, and even includes a discount of up to 20% discount, depending on how much of the Prime Wardrobe box they decide to not ship back.""The more you keep, the more you'll save,"" says the Amazon ad, providing more incentive for people to hang on to more items. Users have seven days to see what they like, and can leave their unwanted items in a returns box on their doorstep, which will be picked up for free.There are a number of try-before-you-buy services out there, including Stitch Fix, Bungalow Clothing and Nordstrom-owned Trunk Club, which all have the benefit of personal styling help.Prime Wardrobe is not a personal stylist, but that doesn't mean that capability isn't far off, given Amazon's penchant for sweeping users into its ecosystem. Amazon's recently launched voice-assistant speaker, Echo Look, comes equipped with a camera — for selfies, of course — and something call Style Check, which ""combines machine learning algorithms with advice from fashion specialists.""Cowen projected in 2015 that Amazon would overtake Macy's as the largest domestic apparel retailer this year, and the slide that department-store stocks have taken point to the impact that online shopping, fast fashion and a sluggish apparel environment have taken on what were once traditional shopping hubs.Amazon's clothes-shopping experience is growing, but certainly not without faults. By removing one of the last barriers of fashion e-commerce, Amazon's threat to brick-and-mortar department stores and clothing retailers, from Wal-Mart (WMT) to Nordstrom, becomes more apparent than ever.Amazon shares closed down 0.3% at 992.59 in the stock market today.

Revenue, including credit card income, grew 9% to $3.56 billion. But net sales of $3.47 billion only matched estimates.Additionally, the upscale department store lifted the bottom end of full-year earnings guidance; it now expects $3.35-$3.55 per share vs. prior outlook for $3.30-$3.55, the midpoint of which is better than current consensus for $3.42 a share.But same-store sales disappointed Consensus Metrix projections for a 1% gain, rising only 0.6%. Nordstrom shares are tumbling late after rising 0.5% during the regular session.Meanwhile, J.C. Penney clocked a major first-quarter same-store sales disappointment during its most recent quarter and took its full-year profit guidance into negative territory.The chain, which caters to a moderate-income consumer, lost 22 cents a share vs. a 6-cent profit in the prior-year quarter, while revenue slipped 1.3% to $2.67 billion, a narrower decline than expected by analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.Same-store sales ticked up 0.2%, far worse than Consensus Metrix analysts' projections for 2.1% growth.Jewelry, Sephora beauty products and salon items sold well during the quarter ending in early May. But amid heavy industrywide competition, J.C. Penney slashed guidance for the year, and now expects adjusted EPS to range from a 7-cent loss to a 13-cent gain, down from previous guidance for a profit of 5 cents to 25 cents per share.

The move surprised the markets; MSCI had given a red light to mainland stocks or ""A shares"" on three previous tries.EQT Corp. (EQT) agreed to buy Rice Energy (RICE) for around $6.7 billion. The deal, set to close in Q4, would create the U.S.' largest natural-gas producer and strengthen EQT's position in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions.Accenture (ACN) reported in-line fiscal Q3 profit and reported top-line growth slightly above views as new digital, cloud and security products and services reached 50% of revenue but management commentary on weakness in the health care market sent shares down.

104,JWN,"Shares of Sears Canada (SRSC) crashed Wednesday following reports that the ailing retailer could be headed for liquidation after moving to seek protection from creditors, deepening the wounds suffered by brick-and-mortar chains as Amazon.com (AMZN) continues to pluck customers from malls.Sears Canada could have trouble selling off its locations to a single purchaser, as many of those locations are in lower-tier shopping centers, Bloomberg said.Sears Canada earlier this month raised ""significant doubt"" over its ability to continue operating after struggling to obtain sufficient financing. Meanwhile, Sears Holdings (SHLD), which owns 12% of Sears Canada, warned in March that ""substantial doubt"" existed over whether it could survive.Sears Canada shares tumbled nearly 20% to 47 cents on the stock market today. Sears Holdings dropped 5.4% to 6.43. J.C. Penney (JCP) fell 5.7%, Dillard's (DDS) dropped 2.3% and Kohl's (KSS) lost 1.3%. Mid-tier Macy's (M) slid 2.3% while upscale Nordstrom (JWN) edged down 0.3% after both sold off Tuesday on news that Amazon will start a service that allows customers to receive clothes at home and try them on before buying them.IBD'S TAKE: Running a retailer in recent years has become a lot more about managing real estate. Macy's is even looking at how to rework its parking lots.A liquidation of Sears Canada would follow Target's (TGT) plans, announced in 2015, to exit Canada, and it would join a growing list of retailers in bankruptcy or on the brink.In March, discount department-store chain Gordmans Stores filed for bankruptcy with plans to liquidate. Wet Seal, BCBG Maxzria and Payless ShoeSource have filed for bankruptcy in recent months as well.In April, women's apparel chain Bebe (BEBE) said it would close all its stores by the end of May to become an online-only retailer, and Vince (VNCE) said it had ""substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue"" over leverage debt ratio concerns.Sears Canada's potential move toward creditor protection would also come as Sears' legal disputes with suppliers increasingly occur out in the open.Sears Holdings has sued two suppliers of Craftsman tools in the past two months over their agreements to deliver products to the retailer. Sears this month settled with the first of those companies, One World, which Sears CEO Eddie Lampert said had tried to ""embarrass us in the media to force us to let them out of their contract.""RELATED:Amazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesWhat Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailMacy's Doesn't Know How To Fix Its Stores, Hopes Something Will Work

105,JWN,"XWhole Foods Market (WFM) shares continued to climb Monday, signaling increased belief that someone else could top the $13.7 billion Amazon.com (AMZN) deal for the high-end grocer.Barclays analyst Karen Short said she ""would not be surprised if there is a bidding war"" for Whole Foods, upgrading the high-end grocer to overweight from equal weight and raising her price target by 26% to 48, well above Amazon's announced acquisition price of 42 a share.A fresh bid could be as high as 57 a share, Short says, giving a big potential upside. Meanwhile, the regulatory risk for Amazon's deal is low, so the potential downside from buying Whole Foods shares is low in her view. And beyond fending off the e-commerce giant, Short added that a strategic retail bidder could create up to $600 million in synergies.Is this a plausible scenario? Barclays isn't the only one that seems to think so. Oppenheimer upped its price target to 45 on Friday, not long after the deal was announced, on the grounds that the deal undervalued Whole Foods' prospects and ""powerful brand."" Analysts there see a mid-40s-range buyout as more appropriate.Shares of Whole Foods Market rose 1.3% to 43.22 in the stock market today — even after closing up 29.1% on Friday to 42.68.So who, exactly, could pop out of the woodwork to beat Amazon's $13.7 billion offer? In Short's view, the list of suspects is long: ""all retailers that sell food and compete with (Amazon) because we think most have too much to lose not to bid."" Kroger (KR), Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT) are on that list.The nation's grocery chains and big-box stores have already lost a lot since Friday, as shares of Kroger, Target, Wal-Mart and Costco (COST) suffered mightily from the merger announcement.(The only grocery retailer that isn't getting further kicked Monday on news of the deal is Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) — and that's likely because Oppenheimer pegged it as the next possible takeover target. Sprouts rose 3.5% on Monday.)Kroger rose 1.6%, but after crashing nearly 28% last week. Wal-Mart edged up 0.3% while Target fell 1.7%.Costco continues to suffer Monday, falling 2.7% to a 2017 low and undercutting its 200-day moving average. Deutsche Bank downgraded Costco to hold, citing intensifying competition from efforts by Amazon and Wal-Mart to ramp up their in-store and online business.The Whole Foods acquisition ""represents a game changer with (Costco's) competitive moat of grocery under greater threat while its digital platform lags peers, putting membership renewal at higher risk for decline,"" wrote Deutsche's Paul Trussell. He cut his price target on Costco to 172 from 187.Still, the membership warehouse's traffic and margins are solid, he said. And Cowen's Oliver Chen, who has an outperform rating on Costco, believes the retailer's vertical integration and low prices will continue to be brick-and-mortar traffic drivers.For his part, Chen isn't so sure that Costco would be interested in — or Target would be capable of — proposing a buyout for Whole Foods, and Wal-Mart might only have interest insomuch as a buyout would be a defensive measure. But he is wondering about Amazon's next shopping spree.""We believe there are likely capabilities, routes to market, and specialized brand propositions at retailers which could be synergistically combined with largely pure-play online retailers such as (Amazon),"" wrote Chen.Who? Why, Nordstrom (JWN), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Ascena Retail Group (ASNA) or even RH (RH) (formerly known as Restoration Hardware).Those might be some pretty unexpected names for a potential Amazon takeover — but then again, so was Whole Foods.RELATED:Are These Amazon's Next Five Targets?What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, Eateries

The Dow held its ground, closing 0.4% higher.A hat trick of negatives hit tech stocks at the end of a confusing news week. A report released late Thursday by Bank of America concluded that the tech sector currently ""trades at its highest relative multiple since the Tech Bubble."" The BofA report alone wasn't enough to restrain the Nasdaq early progress Friday, with the index hauling in a new high, but peaking in the first 45 minutes of trade.IBD 50 stock and recent highflier Nvidia (NVDA) appears to have helped trigger the slide, after a report from short-selling specialist Citron warned of weakness in the chipmaker's core gaming businesses. It also called the price target hike assessed Thursday by Citigroup on Nvidia ""irresponsibly bullish.""Nvidia dived 6.5% in heavy trade, despite a rebound off lows in afternoon trade. Shares remained extended above a 121.02 buy point but the reversal came in the highest volume of the stock's run, a bad sign.The move sent chip stocks sprawling, with IBD's three chip-related groups posting three of the session's four worst losses among industry groups. Ichor Holdings (ICHR), Nova Measurement (NVMI) and Brooks Instruments (BRKS) falling sharply. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) caved more than 5%. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) suffered a 7% loss.The tech sell-off broadened on reports Friday that Goldman Sachs called into question the what it named the FAAMG group of stocks — Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — declaring the group in a ""valuation air pocket."" Goldman said the group was due for a pause, and had been inappropriately valued as stable, staple issues, acting as key drivers of the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 this year.The combination sent technology industry groups to 19 of Friday's 20 worst performances among all 197 groups tracked by IBD.  The only non-technology industry in that lineup, automakers, were dragged by the heavy-volume 3% loss in the industry's most techish name, Tesla (TSLA).There were winners on Friday.The Dow gained ground, hauled higher by Pfizer's (PFE) 3% advance and gains of better than 2% from JPMorgan (JPM) and Chevron (CVX). Apple tanked more than 4%, but found support at its 10-week moving average. Microsoft dropped 2%.Dillard's (DDS) spiked 10%. J.C. Penney (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS) vaulted 7% each, after the announcement on Thursday that Nordstrom (JWN) was considering a deal to be taken private sent its shares up 10%. The high-end department store gained 6% in heavy trade on Friday.Makers of drilling rigs and equipment, and international oil exploration names rebounded after Thursday's harsh sell-off. Oil prices warmed ever-so-slightly, leaving West Texas intermediate up less than a half percent, still well below $46 a barrel and down almost 4% for the week.Heavy construction firms also found some love on Friday, the last day of President Trump's official ""infrastructure week"" on the bully pulpit. The President laid out some specific numbers for the first time earlier in the week, proposing to stir $1 trillion in total infrastructure spending by throwing $200 billion in federal moneys into the kitty for projects.

107,JWN,"X A brutal retail earnings season walloped department stores and knocked around the shares of all but a few major names, such as Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), as retail's ongoing existential crisis flails on.Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which reports late Thursday, is something of an outlier, with consistent quarterly beats and double-digit same-store sales growth at a time when other stores are posting declines or mild single-digit gains.Shares have generally made modest moves, with the stock rising in line with the S&P 500 over the last nine months. But Ulta has had big swings in the session following after-the-close earnings reports, with shares getting punished for two of the last three quarters, even when the retailer has posted a beat-and-raise quarter.Investors are extra jittery this time around: Ahead of Thursday's results, shares fell 3.5% to 280.51 in the stock market today on a downgrade to hold from buy from Edward Jones, diving below their 289.37 buy point. Before Wednesday's tumble, Ulta stock has nearly doubled since February of last year to an all-time high of 301.40 in early May, with shares testing the 300 price mark in recent weeks.""While we expect profit margins still have some room to expand, we do believe it will become more difficult over the longer term as more business shifts to online,"" wrote Brian Yarbrough of Edward Jones. ""Online sales have lower profit margins than sales in the stores.""He otherwise sounded positive on the company, calling it ""one of the most compelling growth stories in the retail landscape due to its store-growth opportunity and because it operates in an attractive industry and has the potential to realize further profit expansion.""For Q1, profit is expected to rise 24% to $1.80 a share on a 19% revenue rise to $1.27 billion. Expect laser-focus on same-store sales growth, a closely watched metric in the retail space.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy, who rates the stock overweight, expects 11.5% in comparable-sales growth, a tick higher than Street views.IBD'S TAKE: Need a refresher? Ulta Beauty has reported same-store sales growth of 16.6%, 16.7%, 14.4% and 15.2% in the most recent four quarters. Consensus is for 11% comp growth in Q1, says Piper Jaffray. There are reasons why Ulta and other specialty beauty retailers haven't succumbed to the Amazon Effect.Like off-price stores, the beauty sector frequently gets a call-out for being impervious to Amazon's (AMZN) offensive tactics in the retail sphere. Experts chalk it up to the in-store experience, the test-and-trial nature of beauty products and robust rewards programs, among other factors.Murphy cited confidence in Ulta's loyalty program and indicated that Ulta is likely to benefit from the decline of department stores, noting that only J.C. Penney (JCP) and Nordstrom (JWN) are notching cosmetic sales gains. Plus, the firm's biannual teen survey revealed that Ulta was gaining ""considerable share"" as a go-to shopping hot spot.J.C. Penney in particular has benefited from its Sephora shops-in-shops, and said earlier in the month that it will open another 16 in-store Sephoras in June, with plans to open 70 new locations of the upscale makeup retailer in 2017. That will bring its end-of-year total to 650 shops, in 75% of all J.C. Penney stores.Ulta Beauty offered up light Q1 guidance in March. But that doesn't worry some analysts.""Ulta has beaten its sales guidance in all but one quarter since (the first quarter of 2010) as one of the best guiders we cover,"" wrote Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel in March, following the company's most recent earnings report.

109,JWN,"To the ever-expanding list of Things Uber Is Disrupting, add malls and their parking lots.At Macy's (M) investor day on Tuesday, Doug Sesler, executive vice president for real estate, suggested that the increased use of Uber had led to a decrease in the need for the vast stretches of land reserved for mall-customer parking.""We're all talking about driverless cars, we're talking about the increased use of Uber,"" he said. ""The fact of the matter is we don't need the massive parking lots that we needed in the 1970s.""Macy's has been bruised by retail's woes in the era of Amazon.com (AMZN) and a reinvigorated Wal-Mart (WMT). It's thrown a variety of ideas at the wall to make use of its stripped-out floor space and 130-plus million square feet of real estate, and half-filled parking lots could offer a new option.Sesler said that when Macy's owns store space, they also typically own parking space with it. He said those swaths of pavement can be used for other retail space – a Starbucks (SBUX) at the corner of a parking lot, he suggested – or residential, office or hotel space.The company has formed an alliance with Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), a real estate company, to look at different ways to use its stretches of real estate.Macy's has also considered bolting restaurants onto the outside of its big-box locations to generate traffic and add atmosphere and rental income. The company has put office space above its stores in Seattle and is marketing the upper portion of its State Street flagship store in Chicago, where it hopes to make similar conversions to office space.The company is overhauling its large Union Square location in San Francisco to create 10,000 square feet for small shops across the front – space the company has just started to market for rent, Sesler said. In New York, the company said it is looking at ways to jumpstart shopper traffic in its Herald Square flagship – possibly with an indoor-and-outdoor rooftop area featuring restaurants and after-work hangouts.IBD'S TAKE: As Amazon and off-price retailers wear down department stores, retailers like Ulta Beauty have gotten by relatively unscathed. Here are five takeaways from Ulta's most recent quarterly earnings. What's more, Sesler said, Macy's department stores are in 72% of the nation's high-end 'A' malls — those most likely to weather the ongoing storm of store bankruptcies and closures.Still, nothing at the 2-1/2 hour presentation could distract Wall Street from the company's gross-margin forecast.Shares finished 8% lower on Tuesday after CFO Karen Hoguet during the presentation warned that gross margins for the year were on track to be 60 to 80 basis points lower than last year. Among the factors she cited were excess inventory following the holidays and heavy promotions in the beauty business. She said she expected inventory levels to even out by the fall season.Macy's fell 0.4% to 21.81 on the stock market Wednesday, sinking intraday to their lowest level since September 2010.Macy's initially rebounded Thursday morning after Nordstrom (JWN) announced that it is mulling a ""going private"" move, but Macy's closed down 0.2%. Nordstrom shares skyrocketed 10.3%, though that was well off their intraday highs.J.C. Penney (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS), which tumbled Tuesday on Macy's warning, reversed lower Thursday to end down 4.8% and 2.3%, respectively. Sears (SHLD) closed off 1.7%.Still, management on Tuesday said that beauty and home products were doing well within its off-price ""Backstage"" concept. Within apparel, where Amazon has become a big threat, Macy's is trying to rid its inventory of duplicate items and bring more exclusive items and faster fashion to store racks.CEO Jeff Gennette also emphasized the changes in the way people shop – the way physical stores and websites can play off one another when a consumer weighs what they want to buy – and Macy's opportunities in that evolution.""There's a place for both Amazon and Macy's to succeed with our customer,"" he said.Management said that it was ""open to all options"" in developing its e-commerce, and said that Wal-Mart's approach to its online business – including buying outlets like Jet.com – was ""quite interesting.""Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, in a research note Wednesday, said Macy's had done a ""good job articulating its challenges"" and that if its turnaround succeeded, ""America's love for shopping will be reengaged."" But he said an epic battle with Amazon would continue.""We think customers are 'familiar' with Macy's but don't really 'love' it,"" he wrote.Wal-Mart edged higher Thursday after rising slightly Wednesday following a retreat Tuesday. Amazon on Tuesday offered discounted Prime subscriptions to people on government aid, going after key Wal-Mart customers.RELATED:This Is Keeping TJX Bullish Amid The Broader Retail MeltdownSears Stock Tanks As CEO Accuses Suppliers Of Exploiting It

110,JWN,"X Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 rose slightly early Wednesday morning.During the regular session, the major averages faded for modest losses late as Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reversed lower or pared gains. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index slid 0.3% while the Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.2%.The FANG stocks' market impact is striking, given the modest moves. Facebook fell 0.5%, Alphabet 0.7% and Amazon 0.8%, with Netflix clinging to a 0.1% gain. But because their valuations are so high, those tiny percentage declines translated to a loss of $11 billion market cap, with bigger declines from their intraday highs.Until the final slide in the FANG stocks the major averages were hovering around break-even. That's despite another wipeout for retailers. Macy's (M) warned on gross margins, sending the stock down 8.2% to a fresh five-year high. Kohl's (KSS) tumbled 5.8%, Nordstrom (JWN) 3.6%, J.C. Penney (JCP) 4.1% and Dillard's (DDS) 3.4%. But department stores' market valuations have tumbled over many years, so those big losses shaved little more than $2 billion from their collective market cap.Simply put, despite the still-large presence of department stores for consumers, investors have largely written them off. The merest breeze from FANG stocks is more important to the broader averages than a retail hurricane.(Investors haven't written off discount giant Wal-Mart (WMT), which has been a market leader in 2017. Wal-Mart sank 1.7% on Tuesday, trimming its market cap by $4 billion.)Futures for the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 index rose more than 0.1% vs. fair value Wednesday morning. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.2%. U.S. crude oil futures edged lower, just under $48 a barrel, ahead of U.S. inventory and production data this morning from the Energy Information Administration.Tesla (TSLA) edged down 0.5% in Wednesday's morning after rising fractionally late Tuesday as the company held its shareholder meeting. Tesla rose 1.6% to 352.85 in Tuesday's session, hitting a fresh intraday high of 359.49.Tesla investors voted to keep three-year terms for board members, rejecting a bid by some pension funds for annual votes amid concerns that the board is too beholden and too closely tied to CEO Elon Musk.Musk once again spoke optimistically about the upcoming Model 3, the new solar-roof tiles and the future of a Model Y crossover SUV and a September unveiling of an electric semi-truck.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei closed just above break-even, while China's Shanghai composite advanced 1.2%.In European trading intraday, stocks rose modestly.

111,JWN,"Sears Holdings (SHLD) crashed yet again on Monday after the CEO aired grievances with a supplier and said ""the recent wave of dire predictions about our company's future have done harm to our business.""The remarks, made in a corporate blog post, come after Sears in March said ""substantial doubt"" existed over its survival prospects.Sears, like other retailers, have struggled to retain sales and store traffic amid competition from value retailers and what analysts have called an ""over-stored"" retail environment as more people shop online.Sears CEO Eddie Lampert said some companies it does business with were ""trying to take advantage of negative rumors about Sears to make themselves a better deal — a deal that is unilaterally in their interest.""""In such a case, we will not simply roll over and be taken advantage of — we will do what's right to protect the interests of our company and the millions of stakeholders we serve,"" he added.Investors, perhaps sensing it was a bad sign that a retailer was publicly haggling with suppliers, bailed after Lampert accused some partners of taking advantage of the company. Shares tumbled 12.4% to 8.31 in the stock market today.Rival J.C. Penney (JCP), whose earnings last week hastened Wall Street's retreat from the industry, fell 4.8% to a fresh record low after diving 17% last week. Macy's (M) lost another 1.7% after plunging 18.5% last week. Nordstrom (JWN) edged up 0.5% following its 15.9% weekly loss.Lampert said that one supplier, One World, which has made tools for Sears' Craftsman brand, has threatened to sue the retail giant and refused to meet the terms of a supply agreement. Sears sold off Craftsman earlier this year.One World, a subsidiary of the Chinese conglomerate Techtronic Industries, seeks ""to embarrass us in the media to force us to let them out of their contract,"" Lampert said, adding that Sears had ""nothing to be embarrassed about.""He also said that Sears would defend itself against any legal action, ensured that One World met its contractual obligations, and said Sears was able meet its own.""Sears has paid and continues to make all payments to One World as they come due, and we are fully capable of continuing to meet our obligations under the Supply Agreement,"" he said.Sears said that it had paid One World more than $868 million since 2007 and helped the company become a bigger player in the tool industry.""If we allowed One World to break their agreement, it would effectively reduce the flow of products they are required to deliver to Sears, harming our ability to sell tools, supply parts, and provide goods to Sears' members and customers,"" Lampert said.

113,JWN,"X Stocks opened in very tightly mixed formation Friday, as retailers took hard hits for a second day and General Electric (GE) and Apple (AAPL) fought a tug-of-war for the direction of the Dow.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 opened to very narrow losses, while Nasdaq opened a fraction into positive territory.Apple opened at the top of the Dow industrials, up 1% after a securities filing showed the company had issued $7 billion in corporate bonds due between 2020 and 2027. Apple has used bond markets to fund its shareholder rewards initiatives since 2012, raising its debt from nil to $84.5 billion.The company reported $256 billion in cash held overseas in its second-quarter report, and raised its share buyback program to $300 billion. The company has increased debt more than cash in two of the past three quarters.

Discounting can draw customers, but it means less money for retailers.He also noted the company's unique product lines, its appeal to higher-end customers and the number of ways it has to attract them. That includes the company's e-commerce efforts, which other analysts say are more developed than rivals, and its off-price Nordstrom Rack division.RELATED:Death Stalks Retail Stocks, But Hope Lives OnThese 3 Retailers Could Reap $1 Billion From J.C.

119,JWN,"During Macy's (M) first-quarter earnings call on Thursday, the typical analyst refrain of ""great quarter, guys"" was often replaced with some version of ""good luck, guys.""Shares of the ailing department store giant crashed 17% to 24.35 in the stock market today as the stock hit their worst levels since late 2011 after Macy's said same-store sales slid 5.2%, badly missing estimates for around a 3% drop. The key measure fell 4.6% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Earnings per share of 24 cents missed expectations for 34 cents. Total revenue of $5.34 billion fell 8%, short of estimates for $5.469 billion.Macy's grim report triggered a broad, sharp sell-off in the retail sector as investors questioned if brick-and-mortar stores have much of a future.Management didn't exactly answer how it'll turnaround the retail giant's fortunes. Instead, it's trying a variety of initiatives to see what, if anything, works.Executives left open the possibility that store closures could creep higher than the 100 that Macy's has said it would shutter.""I'm not going to say that we're not going to close more stores beyond those hundred, but we do feel like we got to the right level when we made the decision that we did in 2016 that we're executing now in '17,"" said new CEO Jeff Gennette during the call.Still, Macy's said it remained ""on track to meet our 2017 guidance."" Sensing that analysts would ask how that was at all possible, management tried to address those questions early in the call.CFO Karen Hoguet said that Macy's had expected the first quarter to be its weakest as it rolled out turnaround plans, adding that the benefits of closing stores, and the accompanying going-out-of-business sales, weren't going to kick in until later in March.She also said that weaker trends seen in the first quarter would rebound later in the year, citing expanded pilot programs, a revamped marketing strategy, heightened consumer engagement — something Gennette characterized as a ""nexus of technology and the human touch"" — and growth in digital and mobile shopping.Macy's has rolled out new offerings including self-service shoe sections, a jewelry pilot program and new furniture and mattress offerings — initiatives that the company wants to introduce nationwide this year and says will clean up what has been a messy few years for an industry struggling to find itself in an ever-digitizing shopping landscape.""These are unusual and challenging times for retailers,"" Gennette said. He later added that ""we've known for some time that the United States is over-retailed,"" so the contraction in square footage was not surprising.The company has tried a variety of ways to make use of vacant store space, converting floors to office space or installing its off-price ""Backstage"" stores, which have been set up in unused areas of traditional Macy's stores.But analysts at Gordon Haskett, in a research note this week, worried that Backstage was ""a defensive move and one that could cannibalize core M sales.""Management said it was careful to avoid cannibalizing full-price items. Gennette also tried to position Backstage as an appeal to millennials — many of whom he said came to Macy's to seek bargains.The company said it would add 19 more Backstage locations this year and that it was ""encouraged"" by those combined stores' performance as well as its new clearance section, called Last Act. Whichever does better will be rolled out ""aggressively"" next year, Hoguet said.The company said it was encouraged by double-digit growth in digital sales, but said it was difficult to break out what constituted a digital sale, given the increasingly connected way people shop, using a combination of electronic devices and stores.Many brick-and-mortar retailers are seeing big percentage gains in online sales, but the absolute e-commerce activity isn't enough to move the needle as in-store sales deteriorate.When asked how the company could compete with Amazon.com (AMZN), which has been bulking up on its artificial intelligence and Big Data capacity and aimed to push fashion, Gennette insisted that aspects of the department store were as relevant today as ever, and said that exclusive products and the pilot programs, along with working harder to be part of local communities, would help the company maintain relevance.And as more retailers try to make being in a store a memorable experience in and of itself, he said he hoped Macy's would have a store platform that addressed consumers' experience needs by the end of next year.As with the other big middle-class retailers, Macy's has suffered at the hands of higher-end and discount retailers, as well as Amazon.Meanwhile, Kohl's (KSS) reported mixed results early Thursday. EPS of 39 cents beat views for 29 cents. But revenue of $3.84 billion slightly missed expectations as same-store sales slid 2.7% vs. forecasts of a 0.6% dip.  Shares for Kohl's tumbled 7.8% to 47.77.Regional department store chain Dillard's (DDS) dived 17.5% on its mixed results Thursday.Nordstrom (JWN) closed down 7.6% to 46.21. After the close, the upscale department store topped EPS views, but comps fell more than expected.

123,JWN,"TJX (TJX), the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, disappointed investors with a first-quarter revenue and profit guidance miss early Tuesday, but shares started creeping back up during the call as management announced plans to introduce a new home-decor concept, Homesense, to American shoppers and expressed bullishness in the face of broader retail combustion.""Home is a driver for TJX,"" said CEO Ernie Herrman in response to an analyst query, adding that the company's home businesses have been ""a little stronger than apparel."" He also alluded to home goods being less susceptible to the impact of poor weather, which weighed on comparable sales during the quarter.""We think nobody can replicate the fashion and the quality level we have at our home businesses,"" he said on the call. ""We think strategically this is not a short-term vision.""Herrman was fairly mum about the details, but said that there would be an ""extremely visible difference"" between Homesense and its American sister, HomeGoods, that would propel customers to shop at both stores.While Homesense shares the same name as TJX's home-goods stores in Canada and Europe, spokespeople told Investor's Business Daily that the U.S. Homesense would be different.In Canada, the self-described ""home fashions off-price"" store can be found as stand-alone locations or as superstores, in which a HomeSense is teamed up with a Winners or Marshalls store, according to the HomeSense site. There are currently 106 stores across 10 Canadian provinces.The U.S. concept is slated to debut toward the end of the summer, said Herrman.While TJX's Marshalls and T.J. Maxx locations in the U.S. logged flat comparable sales, HomeGoods comps grew 3% during the April-ended quarter, better than FactSet views for 2.4% growth.Aware of the broader troubles of the retail sector, management brushed off the threat of e-commerce and Amazon (AMZN). People are still shopping for clothes at TJX-owned stores, was the message.Herrman said Q2 is ""off to a solid start,"" with inventory in a good position, and later added that the company is ""still gaining apparel market share in the U.S.""Shares of TJX tumbled 4.1% to 73.76 on the stock market today after falling to a six-month low of 73.17 earlier. On May 10, TJX tried to break out of a consolidation resistance area. But shares have sold off since then in the wake of grim news from other retailers. Off-price rival Ross Stores (ROST), which reports earnings on Thursday, was down 1.4%.In Q1, TJX's profit rose 8% to 82 cents on 3% revenue growth to $7.78 billion, vs. consensus for 79 cents a share and $7.88 billion in sales. Same-store sales rose 1%, below some estimates.Management sees Q2 EPS of 81-83 cents vs. 84 cents a year earlier. Analysts had expected 92 cents. TJX sees full-year profit of $3.71-$3.78, up 5%-7%, also below views. The company said currency effects and wage increases weighed on its guidance.Off-pricers like TJX and Ross enjoyed a reputation for being untouchable by Amazon, thanks to the in-store treasure-hunt nature of bargain-rack shopping. But Tuesday's weak sales and guidance raised concerns that status may be under threat as the rest of retail suffers a face-melting sell-off.Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), J.C. Penney (JCP), Nordstrom (JWN) and Dillard's (DDS) plunged last week amid grim results and a growing fear that department stores don't know how to stop the bleeding. Macy's and Dillard's have hit their lowest levels in more than five years, while J.C. Penney is at record lows.And Sears Holdings' (SHLD) CEO has resorted to blasting vendors in a blog post, in a bid to un-smear the long-ailing retailer's name in the press.

On the upside, Nvidia (NVDA), OLED play Coherent (COHR) and new IPO Trade Desk (TTD) were big winners.The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3% for the week, hitting a new record high Wednesday as Apple (AAPL) and Netflix (NFLX) were among the big-cap techs setting all-time bests. The Dow industrials sank 0.6% and the S&P 500 0.4%. Higher oil prices lifted energy stocks, while bad news from Macy's, J.C. Penney (JCP) and several other retailers sent the broader sector tumbling. Snap fell close to its IPO price as Facebook (FB) competition takes its toll. But Nvidia skyrocketed to record highs on huge demand for its chips for graphics, artificial intelligence and more.Delivering its first earnings report since coming public, Snapchat-operator Snap missed on the top and bottom line. Snap said average revenue per user rose 181%, to 90 cents, but fell from $1.05 in the prior quarter. User growth was weaker than expected, with Facebook successfully cloning Snapchat's most popular features. Shares plunged more than 21% on Thursday to a post-IPO trading low, though they did rise 6% on Friday.3 top-rated IPOs also reported earnings. Digital ad platform Trade Desk (TTD) spiked Friday morning on better-than-expected earnings and revenue.

Results were mixed as revenue growth of 3% to $13.34 billion missed estimates and profit gains of 10% to $1.50 a share topped. 21st Century Fox (FOXA) turned in mixed results, topping on profit views, but cable ad revenue was weak.

Macy's sold off 17% on Thursday, then continued falling Friday, hitting its worst levels since 2011. Nordstrom (JWN) tumbled on disappointing same-store sales, while Kohl's (KSS) sold off mixed results. J.C. Penney (JCP) crashed to a record low Friday on its weak comps while Dillard's (DDS) also plunged.

But Saudi Arabia's production increased by nearly 50,000 barrels per day, according to OPEC's report. The increases come as OPEC and its allies debate extending the current production deal. On Tuesday, the International Energy Agency said an extension would reduce supply even further in the second half of the year. But U.S. shale is curbing the effectiveness of the cuts. On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. stockpiles fell by 5.2 million barrels last week, a larger-than-expected drop. On Tuesday, the EIA raised its full-year U.S. oil production forecast for 2018 to 9.96 million barrels per day.

128,JWN,"The major indexes rebounded off early-morning lows despite a bullish report in smaller jobless claims last week, yet stocks still traded moderately in the red Thursday. Given the market's strong gains in recent weeks, it would not be a surprise to see the averages finish lower for the week.However, the market continues to show elements of strength as well. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 major averages are all still well above their rising 50-day moving averages. Watch to see if the Dow Jones industrial average can hold above its 50-day line.The Dow Jones industrial average at 1 p.m. ET shaved its loss further down to just 0.2%. The 30-member blue chip index hit as low as 20,798, just 11 points above its 50-day line.The Nasdaq composite whittled its initial large decline of nearly 0.9% to less than 0.5% while the S&P 500 was off 0.4%. The NYSE composite, down 0.5%, is also facing a fresh test of support at the 50-day moving average. Snap (SNAP), meanwhile, suffered its worst single-day decline since going public March 2 at 17 a share. The stock dropped more than 18% to 18.76 and skidded to as low as 17.59. The stock would now need to rally more than 56% just to match its all-time high of 29.44.The 18% drop represented a $5.4 billion hair cut in market value for Snap, which has 1.157 billion shares outstanding, including Class A, B and C shares.Investors were clearly disappointed by the much bigger than expected net loss of $2.31 a share for the Snapchat social networking site operator, vs. a net loss of 14 cents in the year-ago quarter. Research and development costs ballooned to $805.8 million vs. $28.1 million. A lot of that likely had to do with high stock-based compensation expense, which totaled almost $2 billion for the quarter.Another concern: Snap showed a $155 million drop in operating cash flow. But the company does have $1.43 billion in cash and $1.82 billion in marketable securities, which usually tend to be highly liquid bonds. Elsewhere in the market, Essent Group (ESNT) continued its rebound, rising nearly 2% to 37.30 in light trade. The mortgage insurance firm retook a 36.91 buy point in a shallow double-bottom base.Coherent (COHR), a specialist in industrial-use lasers, also defied the market's decline, rising more than 1.4% to 254.37 in heavy turnover.Other top-rated growth stocks to keep watching for potential entry points include IPG Photonics (IPGP) and Grubhub (GRUB), formerly on IBD Sector Leaders. Grubhub, which enables restaurants to attract more customers by being on the company's popular food service app, edged slightly up to 45.03, extended 6% past a 42.35 buy point in a long double-bottom base.Grubhub, currently No. 26 in the IBD 50, was featured as early as mid-January in IBD's Sector Leaders column, which noted that the software firm's 22% decline from head to toe in a new base was well within the appropriate range for a good cup base or double bottom.IPG gained nearly 1% to 136.73 and volume is running slightly ahead of its normal pace. The stock, which gapped up sharply on May 2 on a strong Q1 report (adjusted earnings up 50%, revenue up 38%), is for now well extended past a 124.37 flat-base entry.Meanwhile, certain retailing stocks got pummeled, reaffirming the problems that some brick and mortar store chains continue to have amid big gains in e-commerce.Macy's (M), which had joined the Leaderboard Short Sales list on March 6 when it crossed back below its 50-day moving average near 31.72, got slammed on Thursday with a 14% drop to 24.99. Volume has already shot well beyond 29 million shares vs. its 50-day average of 5.7 million. The department store chain, which already has plans to close 100 locations, reported a 40% drop in earnings to 24 cents a share, missing views by 31%, as revenue dipped 8% to $5.34 billion.That marked the ninth straight quarter of falling revenue.Luxury furnishings firm RH (RH) and Nordstrom (JWN) also fell hard in the stock market today, losing 8% and 7%, respectively. Unlike Macy's, however, both stocks continue to tread on the north side of their 50-day moving averages.RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, has generally been acting well since it cleared a first-stage deep bottoming base pattern with a 39.38 buy point on March 29 in triple average turnover.RELATED:Where Is The Market Headed?

131,JWN,"Last week, we learned from Piper Jaffray that teens love Apple (AAPL) iPhones, Nike (NKE) and Disney (DIS) movies.This week, a Conde Nast-Goldman Sachs report reveals the fashion, retail and beauty brands that their slightly older millennial peers love. L Brands' (LB) Victoria's Secret, LVMH-owned Sephora and Nike make the top three in favorability rankings, said Bloomberg, which acquired the results.And unsurprisingly, what millennials like and what Wall Street likes doesn't always overlap. Despite the recent softness in handbag trends, all three major purse makers made the list.Rounding out the top 10 favorites list were Coach (COH), Kate Spade (KATE), Michael Kors (KORS), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Lululemon (LULU), DSW (DSW) and Nordstrom (JWN).Still, it's perhaps worrying for brick-and-mortar-based retailers that their greatest online nemesis is also climbing the ranks.IBD'S TAKE: The Conde Nast-Goldman Sachs study is but another reflection of the ongoing existential crisis faced by retailers — but the situation has created potential shorting opportunities for investors.Amazon (AMZN) topped the list as men's favorite retailer across all categories, said Bloomberg, citing the report, which also bestowed Amazon with the title of ""Most-Loved Brand"" overall.The recent Piper Jaffray teen survey showed similar results: Amazon gained ground as the No. 1 preferred shopping website among teens, reaching 43% share, said analysts.""(Amazon) Prime adoption has increased across all income brackets in each of the past six surveys,"" said Piper Jaffray analysts in last week's note.L Brands rose 1.5% on the stock market today. Nike fell 0.45%. Kate Spade lost 0.6%. Michael Kors dipped 0.1% while Coach fell 0.3%.Ulta Beauty fell 1.2% to 279.46, still above a 274.09 buy point but dipping below its 50-day moving average after undercutting that support level for the first time this year.Amazon slipped 0.5% to 899.20, just in range from an 860.96 four-weeks-tight entry.

"
133,JWN,"The retail industry is facing an existential crisis — and not while mired in the depths of recession, but as the economy notches its eighth year of expansion.XIn March alone, Sears Holdings (SHLD), the parent of Sears and Kmart stores, said ""substantial doubt"" exists about its survival prospects after losing more than $10 billion over six years and watching sales fall for even longer. Urban Outfitters (URBN) likened the troubled industry to a housing bubble that has popped. And Bloomberg reported that women's apparel chain Bebe Stores (BEBE) plans to close all its 168 stores and go online only. (On Wednesday, it said it will close 21 stores and explore options for the rest.)As retailers take a hard look at the future in the age of Amazon.com (AMZN), investors face a big question of their own: Are retail stocks just flat-out doomed?No analyst interviewed for this story was ready to declare the physical store dead. But retail's wounds still run deep, and there are almost certainly too many stores in the U.S. Many stocks of top chains, while not as low as during the Great Recession, are rolling over into pronounced downtrends. The weak stock action creates short-selling opportunities for investors who believe the worst for retail is yet to come.A Yardeni Research report estimated that online shopping has grown to 29.1% of retail sales of items like general merchandise, apparel and accessories, and furniture — but not autos and fuel. That's up from less than 10% in the late 1990s. Over the same period, department stores' share of sales withered to 12.6% from around 30%.Still, companies that sell things within walls, floors and ceilings still have options in a $4 trillion market.""There's no way Amazon becomes a $4 trillion e-tailer in 10 years,"" said Jeff Roster, vice president of retail strategy at IHL Group. ""That's just not going to happen.""Analysts say physical stores can still be vital in a connected, buy-anywhere, retail-everywhere world, with chains experimenting with new uses for their locations and even e-commerce companies seeing the value of in-store experiences.""There's plenty they can do,"" Roster said of retailers. ""The question is: Will they do it?""Meanwhile, the weight has accumulated on retail stocks. Take Macy's (M), which earlier had been praised for its aggressive efforts to integrate online and in-store operations. The department store's shares have lost more than half their value since July 2015. Earnings and sales have fallen for eight consecutive quarters.L Brands (LB), whose Victoria's Secret brand ought to be more insulated from e-commerce, has seen its stock halved since late 2015. The SPDR Retail ETF (XRT) has fallen some 20% over the past two years.IBD'S TAKE: Retail stocks trending below their declining 200-day moving averages offer shorting opportunities. For example, Macy's is struggling to get back in the 30s, but that would set up yet another test of the 50-day average and a possible short entry. Dillard's has stumbled this year, down as much as 25%, and just got turned away from its 50-day. See if it can hold support at 46.56.As those trends have solidified, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett, who prides himself on being a long-term investor, divested almost all his stake in Wal-Mart (WMT) in Q4. He told CNBC in February that ""the online thing is very hard to figure out, you know?""Amazon, Buffett said, was a company ""that's gonna have everybody in their sights. And they've got delighted customers.""""Now, Wal-Mart's pushing forward online themselves and they've got all kinds of strengths,"" he later added. ""But I just decided that I'd look for a little easier game.""For much of the past 60 years, retail was an easier game. The postwar population explosion held consumerism aloft for years, says Doug Stephens, founder and CEO of retail advisory service Retail Prophet. When baby boomers' spending slowed as they reached their 50s, growth in personal credit — spurred by financial deregulation — helped pick up the slack, or at least masked weaker trends, he says.""It allowed a lot of retailers to get away with being pretty average,"" Stephens said. ""The average American aspired to be average. They aspired to the middle-class average lifestyle, and retailers like JCPenney (JCP) and Sears and others were happy to accommodate them by selling average goods and average prices with average experiences.""Then the financial crisis and recession hit. The resulting consumer flight to either luxury or deep discounting hollowed out retail's middle-of-the-road set, he added.That has left the retail industry with too many stores, not enough shoppers, and more bankruptcies. Sports Authority was liquidated last year. Payless ShoeSource filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday and disclosed plans to close 400 stores. Markets are wondering if Sears and JCPenney are next.U.S. retail square footage per capita is more than six times that in Europe or Japan, Urban Outfitters CEO Richard Hayne said in March. Deutsche Bank in February estimated that among the retailers it follows, more than 13,100 stores will have closed during the decade ending this year. The analysis indicated that 6,400-plus locations could still be pruned from those companies' store counts.With more companies clearing out of their store space, malls can try to re-anchor their properties with grocery stores and fill in other spots with restaurants and fitness centers. The anchor stores tend to draw foot traffic, but their long stretches of square footage make those spaces hard to fill, Deutsche Bank analysts say.""Fewer retail stores should translate into a direct decline in the number of viable retail properties, including malls,"" Deutsche Bank analysts Ed Reardon and Simon Mui wrote in February. ""An enclosed mall can quickly reach a 'tipping point' where a decline in foot traffic leads to further closures and rent declines (aka the mall death spiral).""And yet the store persists, with even e-commerce companies recognizing its value. In fact, the physical store is still an efficient way to grab customers, especially as the cost of acquiring them online has gone up, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said.Nordstrom's (JWN) Trunk Club, an e-commerce site that delivers clothing according to the wearer's tastes, has opened physical stores in recent years. Amazon has opened pop-up stores and plans to launch grocery stores.The pop-up, often backed by heavy online promotion, can also lend brick-and-mortar retailers flexibility and intrigue.""When you start to see a pop-up store by Amazon, that to me validates (the idea) that there is still a place for a brick-and-mortar, touch-and-feel type of retail experience,"" said Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce.Newcomers to the business, particularly in clothing, also found different ways to retail, like using real-time data and greasing their supply chains to respond more quickly to fashion trends, said Peter Dixon, who runs a number of consumer discretionary-focused funds at Fidelity, noting that it was shortsighted for some retailers to blame their problems solely on the rise of e-commerce.""Hiring star merchants to forecast fashion trends 12 months ahead of time and then commit to inventory orders nine months in advance of a season?"" he said. ""It just doesn't seem to work on a consistent basis anymore.""IBD'S TAKE: Other potential shorts include Ralph Lauren, whose stock is bumping up against its 50-day moving average. A decisive move below 75 would dump it at the lowest levels in nearly seven years. And L Brands last touched its 10-week moving average in December. Wait for an attempted rebound to that line before betting on another plunge.What may work, after retailers shrink their real-estate footprint, is a hybrid approach to stores that accommodates online orders and has more attractive floor space.Analysts say vacant stores could be used as warehouses and pickup spots for online orders. Or, in existing stores, a smaller floor space might be used to display merchandise, while a larger back area would serve the e-commerce end.Macy's and Target (TGT) are already considering such a store layout. Target has said 55% of online orders are completed at its stores, potentially strengthening the case for the strategy.Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has tried to stay digitally relevant through acquisitions. The company last year shelled out $3 billion for online discounter Jet.com. In March, Wal-Mart acquired ModCloth, which sells indie-and-retro-leaning women's apparel. Wal-Mart in February also bought online outdoor-gear retailer Moosejaw.Long-term, the ratio of apparel retailers' physical-store and online purchases could reach 50/50, Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar says. Along with a bigger focus on e-commerce, analysts stress the importance of shrinking store-counts and using the remaining stores as areas that are more ""experiential.""Several chains are trying different things along those lines, though their ability to replicate such formats on a large scale is questionable:""Specialty stores often know their customers on a personal level more closely than big-box stores do, but retailers like Target, Sears, and Wal-Mart also break up their stores into departments,"" Caporaso said over email. ""They can therefore create experiential services in those areas that target specific subsections of their customer bases.""Stephens, of the Retail Prophet, said stores could apply the pop-up approach to the way they handle in-store experiences, replenishing them several times a year to give consumers a reason to return.Such experiential offerings also speak to one of Amazon's weaknesses, especially as it picks up more merchants.""If you want a white T-shirt, and you search for a white T-shirt, you're going to get thousands of results at all different price points, and no one wants to weed through that,"" Weishaar said.She and others say that retailers that can both build out their online infrastructure and maintain a unique identity are the most likely to weather the current storm of falling sales and fleeing investors.""They'll be fine as long as they have a coolness to them,"" said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management. ""Amazon will never be cool. It's just efficient and easy.""

134,JWN,"Macy's (M) stock plunged to its lowest level since 2011 on Tuesday, reflecting a broader market sell-off and an ongoing plunge for department stores and many other brick-and-mortar retailers as they deal with an ever-larger Amazon.com (AMZN) and a reinvigorated Wal-Mart (WMT).The department store chain's stock was down 3.2% to 28.42 in the stock market today, tumbling through its January support levels. Shares closed off their session lows but are nearing their next level of support — 22.66 — the low point of a cup base formed in the summer and fall during that year.J.C. Penney (JCP) fell 3.8% to a fresh 3-year low, Dillards (DDS) 3.6% to a five-year low. Nordstrom (JWN) lost 1.9% and Kohl's (KSS) 2.4%, both hitting their lowest levels since last August. IBD's Retail-Department Store group, ranked dead last out of 197 industry groups, is one of Tuesday's big losers after being Monday's worst performer.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) stabbed through the bottom of a flat base, falling 2%.IBD'S TAKE: After a wave of grim holiday-quarter reports, retailers have been rushing to invest more in e-commerce. The existential crisis among brick-and-mortar retailers has grown more acute in recent months.Grim holiday-quarter results, bankruptcy filings and planned store-closures have piled up as Amazon sucks the life from malls and a younger generation of shoppers spends its money on experiences rather than things. Home-improvement and off-price retail, which are seen as more immune to e-commerce, are among the few bright spots. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, has begun a new price war — pinching discounters, department stores and grocery stores. Wal-Mart had strong online sales, and has continued an e-commerce buying spree and expansion.Amazon fell 1.6% after hitting an all-time high in morning action. Wal-Mart edged down just 0.1%.Department stores are working to develop their own small-but-fast-growing e-commerce sales, but closing physical stores also limits the omnichannel pickup and return options.RELATED:Department Stores Continue To Dive As Investors Doubt Viability Vs.

Preliminary data showed volume mixed, higher on the Nasdaq, lower on the NYSE, vs. action on Wednesday.Bank and financial groups comprised seven of the 10 largest gains among industry groups, buoyed by the Commerce Department's revision of its fourth-quarter GDP estimate, to 2.1% growth, up from 1.9%. Foreign banks and gold miners were two of the five worst industry declines on the stock market today.A half-dozen stocks on the Dow industrials clocked gains of better than 1%. Exxon Mobil (XOM) topped the group, rising 1.8%, aided by a second straight 2% gain in oil prices that sent West Texas Intermediate prices back above $50 per barrel.Nike (NKE) was the only Dow Jones industrial average play that dropped more than 1%.ConocoPhillips (COP) led the S&P 500 with a 9% advance. The Houston-based energy producer announced Wednesday plans to sell its Canada tar sands assets to Calgary-based Cenovus Energy (CVE) for $13.3 billion. The move earned Conoco an upgrade to buy, from hold, along with an 8% price target increase from UBS. Cenovus shares dived 13%.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) slumped 4% in big trade. The network solutions leaders said late Wednesday that it would acquire software startup Soasta for an undisclosed cost. Soasta reportedly counts Apple (AAPL), Target (TGT) and Nordstrom (JWN) among the customers for its performance testing and analytics program CloudTest. The loss sent Akamai to a test of support at its 40-week line.IBD 50 stock Momo (MOMO) hammered out a 5% gain, sending shares to new highs and up more than 7% for the week. Shares are up 49% since clearing a 23.96 cup-with-handle buy point in February.Also taking out new highs among IBD 50 stocks was Commscope Holding (COMM). The provider of telecom connectivity services bumped up 3% in above-average trade. Shares are up 11% since topping a 38.10 flat-base buy point in February.RELATED:5 Dow Index Stocks That Are Near Buy Points: Investing Action PlanWill Snap, Mulesoft IPOs Kick Up A Stampede Of Tech Unicorns?  
"
136,JWN,"The Dow industrials stumbled at the finish Wednesday as the major indexes posted a mixed close.The Nasdaq led by strides, up 0.4% and lifting the index to a 1.2% gain so far for the week. The S&P 500 managed a 0.1% gain, while the Dow Jones industrial average backed off 0.2%.Trading volume was weak Wednesday in a session complicated by bleed-through from overseas, where the U.K. officially set in motion its two-year deadline to negotiate an exit from the European Union. U.S. legislators also weighed in, approving a bill late Tuesday that would permit much broader use of consumer data by internet service providers. Rising oil prices, analyst upgrades and downgrades, and the season's slowing trickle of earnings reports also had their say on today's stock market action.Department stores, ranked dead last among IBD's 197 industry groups, scored Tuesday's best gain among industries. Dillard's (DDS) surged 8%, JCPenney (JCP) jumped 6% and Nordstrom (JWN) rung up a 5% gain.Home-furnishings retailers posted the second-largest gain among industries. RH (RH), formerly Restoration Hardware, was the big winner here, marking up a 15% gain. The high-end-furnishings retailer reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings declines slightly better than its pre-announced guidance. Management's first-quarter revenue guidance was well above consensus projections.Williams Sonoma (WSM) caught some of the updraft, posting a 4% gain in heavy trade — enough to retake support at the stock's 200-day moving average.Chevron (CVX) led the Dow industrials, up 0.8% and aided by a 2% pop in oil prices. UnitedHealth (UNH) notched the Dow's weakest move, down 1.1%.The S&P 500's top dog Wednesday was Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX). The Boston-based biotech vaulted 20% higher after reporting positive results from clinical trials of its experimental cystic fibrosis treatment pill combining tezacaftor and ivacaftor. The gain sent shares beyond buy range above a double-bottom-base buy point of 98.03Amazon.com (AMZN) led the FANG group of big tech names, rising 2.2% in firm trade. Barclays initiated coverage on Amazon, Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) with overweight ratings. Facebook rose 0.6%; Alphabet jumped 1.2%.Amazon's move lifted the IBD Leaderboard stock past an 860.96 buy point in a four-weeks-tight pattern.Among IBD 50 stocks, China-based Weibo (WB) swatted a 4% advance after Barclays also launched coverage of the microblogging site with a 66 price target. Shares ended in buy range above a prior buy point of 52.59.RELATED:The Other NATO Faces This Threat: Investing Action PlanCrude Nears $50 On Weak Inventory Gain, Gasoline Supply Drop

137,JWN,"Shares of Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN), J.C. Penney (JCP), Costco Wholesale (COST) and other retailers are getting slammed Monday, but it's not yet clear what exactly is weighing on the sector.Macy's closed down 3.4% at 30.69 on the stock market today after losing 4.4% on Friday. Kohl's also lost 3.4%, Nordstrom 1.8%, J.C. Penney 4.8%. IBD's Retail-Department store group fell 3.3% Monday, one of the very worst performers out of 197 industries that IBD tracks.IBD'S TAKE: Macy's has been added to IBD's Leaderboard, which provides annotated chart analysis of actionable stocks. Leaderboard typically focuses on growth stocks at or near buy points, but Macy's is among a new crop of possible short sales.February store sales sank 17%, said Business Insider on Monday, citing Bloomberg and First Data. That data appeared to be public last week, per a tweet from Bloomberg reporter Jodi Xu Klein:U.S. department store Feb sales downs 17%, tax refunds may help, says Bloomberg Intelligence #retailers— Jodi Xu Klein (@jodixu) March 3, 2017Meanwhile, the New York Post reported late Friday that Macy's bidder Hudson's Bay isn't pleased with the ""high price"" being asked for the nation's largest department store chain. Hudson's Bay also hasn't lined up financing yet for a Macy's bid, Reuters reported on Friday.And NPD Group said Monday that apparel sales grew 3% in 2016 to reach $218.7 billion, but were struggling to rise beyond that.""The industry had positive overall performance with growth in most categories, but it has struggled to exceed 3% sales growth since 2013, as significant gains in select consumer and retail segments were offset by declines in others,"" said NPD.Costco and Target (TGT) are also swept up in Monday's downward action. Costco fell 2.1%, undercutting its 50-day line intraday. Costco gapped down 4.4% on Friday following its report of weaker-than-expected earnings and sales.Target, which crashed 14% last week on its own weak results and guidance, lost 2.2%. But Wal-Mart (WMT) dipped just 0.2%.Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins says there's ""no specific reason"" he's aware of for the broad sector decline, though ""you can probably take your pick.""Among those issues he cited: delayed tax refunds, broader Q4 earnings weakness — down 2.1% year-over-year, he said — concern over the border adjustment tax, high levels of distressed debt in retail, and of course, Amazon (AMZN).Perkins also noted that retail earnings pre-announcements ""are running 5-1 negative-to-positive so far this earnings season.""RELATED:Target Dives To 2014 Levels: 'We're Slow And Have Too Much Inventory'Costco To Raise Membership Fees After Fiscal Q2 Earnings, Sales MissJ.C.

138,JWN,"Nearly a week after Nordstrom (JWN) said it would stop selling Ivanka Trump-branded merchandise — reportedly due to poor sales performance — President Trump has finally weighed in on the matter.My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017He, like many others in the social media sphere, appears to believe that politics motivated the brand drop. Campaigns such as #GrabYourWallet and others have been urging consumers to boycott retailers that sell merchandise affiliated with the Trump family brands.It is widely reported that Nordstorm has decided not to sell the Ivanka Trump brand for this season, ostensibly leaving the door open to picking up the label in the future.The upscale department store reiterated on its own Twitter page the reasons for its decision.@TimmyLupusbased Based on the brand's performance we've decided not to buy it for this season.— Nordstrom (@Nordstrom) February 8, 2017The White House doubled down, with spokesman Sean Spicer saying that Trump ""has every right to stand up for his family,"" accusing Nordstrom of making a ""direct attack"" on the president's policies.Nordstrom touched a six-month low intraday, but closed up 4.1% at 44.53 on the stock market today, marking its biggest one-day gain in two months.IBD's TAKE: Predictably, the #BoycottNordstrom hashtag took on a different flavor last week following Nordstrom's decision: ""#BoycottNordstrom Swings From Left To Right After Ivanka Trump Drop.""There are now just three styles of Ivanka Trump shoes on the Nordstrom site, down from four late last week. That's a sharp drop, however, from the 71 styles reportedly available as of early December, according to Grab Your Wallet.Fashion news site Racked.com reported that Neiman Marcus, Belk, HSN and ShopStyle have also dropped Ivanka Trump's label in recent days.

Victoria's Secret parent, L Brands' price target was lowered to 51 from 62 at Mizuho and to 60 from 83 at Telsey.Telsey also cut Nordstrom's price target to 50 from 52, after the department store chain reported mixed Q4 results and gave weak earnings guidance late Thursday.Earlier Thursday, Kohl's reported quarterly earnings above analyst views but revenue was in line with expectations. On Wednesday, L Brands reported mixed Q4 results and gave weak Q1 and full-year guidance as it warned of a 20% plunge in February same-store sales at Victoria's Secret.Kohl's shares rose 5.1% Friday after falling 2.1% Thursday. L Brands rallied 4.2% after tumbling 16% on Thursday to its lowest level in nearly four years.

At no point during this conversation did Gary make a statement of support or opposition to the House border adjustability plan,"" reported Axiom, which also issued the original news on Cohn's comments at a private meeting of The Business Council.It's a new a layer of contradictory statements and signals from Trump and his administration on a border adjustment.  On Thursday, Trump told Reuters that he supports ""some sort"" of border tax.Before he took office, Trump panned the idea of a border tax, saying it would be too ""complicated"" and push up the dollar.Trump will have a new opportunity to clarify his position on a border tax —  or add to the confusion — in a speech before Congress Tuesday night.But a 20% border tax would raise some $1 trillion in revenue, helping to pay for a cut in the federal corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%.Chiefs at General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and four other members of the Dow Jones industrial average are among 16 CEOs who recently endorsed a House GOP plan. But fellow Dow stock Wal-Mart and many retailers are strong opposed, saying it will send prices soaring for consumers.

145,JWN,"The ""Amazon (AMZN) effect"" is well documented. Foot traffic at brick-and-mortar stores across America are declining as people spend their dollars online.But it's also shaping what is perhaps the new normal among department stores and other retailers as they fight for market share through a beefier online presence.At Kohl's (KSS), sales for the key holiday quarter were ""weak,"" said CEO Kevin Mansell in the company's earnings release Thursday, as brick-and-mortar traffic declined. But that softness was ""offset somewhat by strength in online demand.""Kohl's shares fell 2.1% to 40.91 in the stock market today. For the key holiday quarter, total sales fell almost 3% to $6.21 billion, missing views for $6.22 billion, as comparable store sales drooped 2.2%. Per-share profit fell 9% to $1.44, besting expectations by 11 cents. Kohl's also raised its dividend by 10% to 55 cents.Fellow department store Macy's (M) logged similar Q4 results on Tuesday, with sales and comps down but ""double-digit growth"" in its online business.Wal-Mart (WMT) on Tuesday boasted a 29% U.S. e-commerce gain as its overall 1% revenue gain came up short.Soft in store, strong online is a recurring theme. Target's (TGT) November-December comparable store sales fell 3% as digital sales popped 30%. (That discounter reports next week.)But online sales are still a fraction of traditional stores' business, so it's hard for even strong e-commerce gains to move the needle.IBD'S TAKE: In an e-commerce-driven consumer landscape, the raison d'etre of malls is waning. Some shopping arenas are calling on mayhem and drama to boost foot traffic.Reducing store count is one way to combat crummy foot traffic. Kohl's said it closed 19 locations in 2016 and opened nine small-format locations, as well as a number of outlets.Macy's is 66 stores into its 100-store closure plan. The rest will be shuttered over the next few years. That will give the department store operator a ""healthy physical portfolio"" that will complement its growing online sales, said CEO Terry Lundgren on the Macy's earnings call on Tuesday.But the kicker is: as department stores close more stores, that may only in turn weigh on their e-commerce sales.""Our customers buying online love to return in store,"" said Macy's CFO Karen Hoguet on the same call. ""They love to shop in store, buy online. So we are, I think, forever going to lose some of that Macys.com business when we close a single-store market.""Macy's shares rose 0.3% on Thursday but are continuing to find resistance at their 50-day line.Wal-Mart has taken a slightly different tack with its acquisition of smaller Amazon rival Jet.com and its push into online groceries. That helped drive its strong online sales gain as the big box retailer also gave bullish overall revenue guidance. Wal-Mart's 29% online sales gain is faster than Amazon's overall revenue growth of 22%, and that's flattered by its Amazon Web Services cloud division.""We're the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top three online retailers by traffic and our Wal-Mart app is among the top three apps in retail,"" said Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon on the call Tuesday.Wal-Mart shares fell 0.6% on Thursday but are still up solidly for the week.Wal-Mart recently dropped its Amazon Prime membership rival and announced that it would offer free two-day shipping for minimum orders of $35. Amazon this week dropped its free shipping minimum order to $35 for non-Prime members, but deliveries will take five to eight business days.Meanwhile, faster fashion and athleisure — two other ongoing trends — appear to be on the minds of Kohl's execs going into the new fiscal year.""In 2017, we will accelerate our focus on becoming the destination for active and wellness with the launch of Under Armour (UAA) in early March,"" said Mansell. ""We will also extend our efforts on improving our speed to market across all of our proprietary brands into all apparel areas and home.""Kohl's said it expects $3.50 to $3.80 in diluted per-share earnings for fiscal 2017 and a 1.3% decline to 0.7% growth in total sales, vs Wall Street forecasts for $3.73 EPS on flattish sales.Comps are expected to range from a decline of 2% to flat sales for the year.Nordstrom (JWN) reported so-so results and guidance late Thursday. The upscale department store said Nordstrom.com sales topped $2.5 billion in 2016, more than 17% of total revenue.

147,JWN,"Macy's (M) earnings and sales continued to decline in the holiday fourth quarter as the struggling department store gave cautious guidance.  The Terry Lundgren-led retailer vowed to invest in the shopping experience as e-commerce erodes its customer base.Macy's, which also operates the upscale Bloomingdale's chain, earned $2.02 a share, down 3% vs. a year earlier. Revenue fell 4% to $8.52 billion. It was the eighth straight quarter of year-over-year declines on the top and bottom line. EPS did top estimates for $1.96 but analysts had expected $8.62 billion in sales.Same-store sales fell 2.7% on an owned basis and were down 2.1% when also including licensed stores. Online sales grew at a double-digit pace, Macy's said.Macy's sees EPS for the current year of $2.90-$3.15, below consensus of $3.20. It expects sales to sink 3.2%-4.3%, in line with Wall Street forecasts. Company-owned comps are seen falling 2.2%-3.3%, with total same-store sales off 2%-3%.""We will be investing for the future in 2017. Looking at the continued challenges in the retail environment and changing consumer shopping behaviors, we know we must evolve our strategy and execute faster,"" said Lundgren in a statement.""Key to this is enhancing the customer experience in our stores where we are developing and testing concepts that feature new merchandise and entertainment options alongside enhanced technology to make shopping simpler. Additional initiatives that we believe will improve sales trends in 2017 include continued omnichannel improvements, an updated marketing strategy and a simplified pricing structure.""Macy's said its off-price Backstage brand as a store-within-a-store format is boosting productivity. The retailer also is working on a plan to revive its beauty business.Macy's plans to invest $900 million this year.RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Tunick called Macy's report a ""non-event.""""We continue to be intrigued by M's real estate optionality but believe business trends will remain challenged despite the company's ongoing initiatives,"" he wrote.But Cowen analyst Oliver Chen called the profit beat ""encouraging, given that we believe investor sentiment and expectation bar was low heading into the quarter.""Macy's stock rose as high as 33.49 in morning trade, but found resistance at its 50-day line. Shares fell 1 cent to 32.29 on the stock market today.Nordstrom (JWN), which reports results Thursday, advanced 0.4%, also well off morning highs. J.C. Penney (JCP), which reports Friday, added 0.4% as well. Kohl's (KSS) fell 0.45%.IBD'S TAKE: In an e-commerce-driven consumer landscape, the raison d'etre of malls is waning. Some shopping arenas are calling on mayhem and drama to boost foot traffic.It's been quite the roller coaster for Macy's stock in recent months. Department stores got a postelection bump, but that rally was short-lived after Macy's, Kohl's and others reported disappointing holiday-period sales figures. Shares have been trading below their 50-day moving average since mid-December.Macy's shares rose in recent weeks on reports that Macy's might be looking to sell itself, according to reports. Saks Fifth Avenue parent Hudson's Bay approached Macy's about a potential acquisition, said the Wall Street Journal in early February, although real estate talks were also said to be on the table.Macy's said it would not discuss ""rumors or speculation,"" but executives did say they would ""work closely"" with its real estate team and ""get a lot done"" this year.Broadly, department stores have been in a rut, to put it gently. Amazon (AMZN) and e-commerce alternatives threaten to pressure brick-and-mortar stores even further, and retailers are stuck in a vicious cycle of heavy discounting that's tough to escape.Macy's insists that brick-and-mortar stores can thrive, with the goal of grabbing a larger of share of a declining pie.""There's enough customers in the mall,"" CEO Lundgren said on the conference call. ""It's just a matter of where they are shopping.""Meanwhile, Dillard's (DDS), which also disclosed results Tuesday, reported diluted per-share earnings of $1.72 a share, including a 13-cent-per-share after-tax asset impairment, on 6% in revenue declines to $1.98 billion. Analysts had expected $2.26 a share on $2.01 billion in revenue.""Our operating results reflect another quarter of mall traffic declines from continued retail industry challenges,"" said Dillard's CEO William Dillard II, in a statement. ""In response, we are ramping up our efforts to bring more distinctive brand and service experiences to Dillard's, both in-store and online.""Shares of Dillard's tumbled 8.3% to 53.55, hitting a five-year low intraday.RELATED:How Mayhem, Drama Can Help The American Mall Cheat DeathAmazon Expected To Introduce Line Of Private-Label Intimate ApparelSears Could Sell More Brands, Real Estate To Cut $1 BillionMacy's For Sale?

148,JWN,"Once the cool new kid, Under Armour (UAA) is now sitting solo at the proverbial high-school cafeteria table after being perceived as getting chummy with the school bully.Following high-profile backlash to seemingly pro-Trump remarks in a recent CNBC interview, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank has since clarified his statement, even taking out a full-page ad in the Baltimore Sun on Wednesday to highlight the company's values, which include equal rights, job creation, and a pro-immigration stance.""We are publicly opposing the travel ban,"" detailed the letter. ""With an anticipated new executive order on immigration set to come out, we will join a coalition of companies in opposition to any new actions that negatively impact our team, their families or our community.""Last week, Plank told CNBC that having a pro-business president was ""a real asset to this country,"" sparking headlines that the Under Armour chief was in favor of Trump, while leaders from Netflix (NFLX), Starbucks (SBUX) and elsewhere have been vocal in criticizing the president's actions, particularly on immigration.Nevertheless, the damage seems to have been done, and according to one analyst, it's going to take a while for the Nike (NKE) rival to shake off its newly acquired bad rap.""Commentary by the CEO in a CNBC interview in a polarized political climate, and pointed response by Stephen Curry, The Rock, and Misty Copeland make it nearly impossible to effectively build a cool urban lifestyle brand in the foreseeable future,"" wrote Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser, referring to the brand's endorsers who have spoken out against Plank's comments.Poser, a longtime bull on Under Armour, has downgraded his rating twice in less than three weeks.Disappointing Q4 results last month spurred Susquehanna's initial cut from positive to neutral, but the latest slash to negative (read: sell) is mostly driven by the ""reputational risk"" that the athletic apparel brand now faces in the wake of those comments.In a report that was written and published prior to seeing Plank's Baltimore Sun letter, Poser also highlighted the high anti-Trump political sentiment at the Grammy Awards on Sunday, noting that Nike and Adidas both ran commercials ""celebrating each brand's relationship to the community.""""It is clear to us and UAA management that Under Armour needs to build its casual and lifestyle business in order to return to historical growth rates,"" said Poser. ""Unfortunately, the brand's cool factor is generally dictated by the style influencers who were likely insulted by CEO Plank's comments, or at least the media's characterization of his comments.""Poser also called for Plank to get ""on air, in person, and fully address the issues facing Under Armour,"" adding that corporate releases lack perceived sincerity.Shares of Under Armour edged up 0.6% to close at 21.89 on the stock market today. Nike shares rose 0.3% to 56.64.IBD's TAKE: Shoppers threatened to boycott Under Armour for Plank's comments. The brand isn't the only retailer finding itself at the center of a Trump-related controversy. Nordstrom and Sears have both made headlines for dropping certain Trump-affiliated items from their product assortments.The Susquehanna analyst also cited challenges in building a lifestyle brand and said Under Armour's $55 hoodies and other items are ""too basic."" He slashed his price target on the stock to 14 from 24.Conversely, Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole — a longtime Under Armour bear — on Tuesday upgraded the stock to equal weight from underweight, in light of the lower valuation. He has a 20 price target on Under Armour.""The stock price suggests the market now believes (Under Armour) is a much more mature brand than it previously thought,"" wrote Sole.RELATED:Sears Dumps Some Trump-Branded Goods But Aims To 'Leave The Politics To Others'President Trump Attacks Nordstrom To Defend Daughter's Business

149,JWN,"A yawning trench of dirt, wood and exposed cables currently sits at the mouth of the Westfield Century City in west Los Angeles. The Apple (AAPL) store is still open and the Tesla (TSLA) showroom has been moved to a different spot, but much of the shopping center remains under construction.When it reopens this year, it will have expanded into a glamorous 1.2-million-square-foot beast of a mall — 422,000 square feet larger — complete with Italian food emporium Eataly, hip burger joint Shake Shack (SHAK) and ""new high-fashion streetside boutiques.""XIn fact, the Century City mall won't just be a mall, it will be ""an immersive sensory experience unprecedented in the modern retail space,"" according to a 2015 Westfield press release. This location hardly needs a tuneup. With $1,457 in sales per square foot, it is the ninth-most productive mall in the country, according to a CNBC story from May, citing real estate research firm Green Street Advisors. So why spend $800 million on a makeover?Looks matter more than ever, particularly as social-media bragging rights become an essential part of the millennial shopping experience. So these days, every retailer has to put on a good show, ramping up the drama to boost foot traffic and cheat death as Amazon (AMZN) spells doom for more and more American malls.""(Young people are) very into cataloging everything they do via social media, and so these more luxury experiences have more social currency,"" said Talmage Advisors CEO Liz Dunn.That could mean Snapchatting from inside a Tiffany (TIF) — regardless of whether you buy something — or taking a topside photo of your artisanal lunch. (Never has flat lay photography been so popular.)""Whatever it is, there's a lot more social currency to that than saying 'I'm at a TGI Friday's,' "" she said.The mall's transformation into an ""immersive sensory experience"" contrasts with the post-World War II bloom of malls, which attracted Americans to cookie-cutter hubs with their one-stop-shopping convenience. That has since given way to the splendid isolationism of two-day shipping via Amazon Prime, hollowing out traditional malls and forcing the survivors to become purveyors of experiences that can be shared online.Fellow L.A.-based shopping center The Grove, owned by Caruso, underscores the trend and is a social-media maven's dream.It houses many of the same stores as a regional mall does — like Banana Republic, J. Crew and Anthropologie — but also features a fountain, trolley and live music, helping put it at No. 2 on CNBC/Green Street Advisors' list with a $2,200 in sales per square foot. The photogenic plaza was even once the backdrop for Hollywood-gossip show ""Extra,"" which has no doubt upped its social cred among tourists who want a glimpse of glam.""This is where all the B-list celebs, YouTube stars, and Instagram influencers shop (I saw an Instagram male model there myself when I went),"" gushed one Yelp reviewer visiting from Toronto.The lure of exclusivity, that close cousin of luxury, is another way retailers have amped up the theatrics.It's a tactic long employed by an athletic-footwear industry that routinely releases shoes in small batches, driving up demand from sneakerheads and high-schoolers alike. There's even a sneaker stock exchange, StockX, devoted to the resale of Jordans, Kobes and anything Kanye has ever designed for Adidas.Other retailers have since caught on. Coach (COH) and Disney (DIS) last year introduced a limited-edition House of Mouse-themed handbag line. Spice Girl-turned-fashion designer Victoria Beckham is behind Target's (TGT) upcoming capsule collection. And H&M seems to have an endless series of designer linkups in the pipeline.The New York Times even declared 2016 ""the year of the drop,"" referring to the slew of limited-edition releases and pop-up shops, like Kylie Jenner's blink-and-it's-gone store, designed to create shopper frenzy.The Hollywood Reporter called the December opening of Jenner's pop-up, located within the Westfield Topanga Mall in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, ""mayhem.""Mayhem is the antithesis of convenience, when it comes to shopping. But that is the point. No one wants to stand in line outside for hours waiting for laundry detergent. A Kylie Lip Kit, however, is not long for this world.To get a teen or 20-something to the mall — and most ""drop"" shoppers are under 30, noted the Times — the mall must act a little more like a nightclub, velvet ropes and all.Even supermarkets are in on the action: Some Whole Foods Market (WFM), Kroger (KR) and Gelson's locations feature wine bars, a premium add-on meant to keep grocery shoppers in stores longer.Such theater may seem gimmicky, but it works, and is also being seen in actual theaters. The local cineplex, a requisite component of any shopping mall, is also undergoing a revamp.On the defensive from Netflix (NFLX) and massive TVs, theaters have been making screens bigger, audio better, and seats more spacious. And as an alternative to grabbing popcorn from the concession stand and trying to find a decent seat, more theaters now serve cocktails and dinner to your reserved Barcalounger while that summer blockbuster plays in Imax 3D.AMC (AMC), for example, embarked three years ago on a $600 million reseating project to rip out traditional chairs and replace them with recliners.AMC, which has called its collective upgrades a ""winning playbook,"" outlined at a recent presentation that attendance has grown 53% and revenue leapt 70% in its 1,500 or so reseated theaters. It has thousands more theaters in line to be updated.Top exhibitor chain Regal Cinemas (RGC) also recently attributed recent outperformance to plush seating, calling out recliner sites as the ""biggest driver.""""Theaters have to do something to differentiate themselves from the in-home experience,"" said RBC analyst Leo Kulp. ""That's really what's driven these investments over the past several years.""Theaters, full-service restaurants and other bells and whistles have woven themselves into a successful mall's narrative, but it may be a while before the experiential stuff surpasses retail stores that sell shirts and shoes.""The future will certainly bring less retail, but it will take a few years to tip the scale"" so that retailers become a mall's minority residents, said NPD Group retail analyst Marshal Cohen.There is also some hope for once-reliable mall anchors like Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), even as Macy's reportedly considers selling itself after a brutal holiday season.The Grove has a Nordstrom, and the revamped Westfield Century City is actually adding a department store to the mix, for a total of three major names. It will now house a two-story Macy's, three-story Bloomingdale's and a three-story Nordstrom that is being relocated from the next mall over.But the massive upgrades being made to shopping arenas could even further widen the gap between top-market malls and their less-moneyed brethren.Of the more-than-1,000 malls in America, the 300 or so top-market ""A-malls"" account for 75% of mall value (a metric comprised of sales productivity, size and other factors), according to Green Street Advisors.So what's a midtier mall to do? For developers, the answer may be: Change or die.Strong anchors are ""imperative"" for a shopping center's long-term viability, according to Green Street's 2017 mall outlook report, since income-generating tenants want malls with ""vibrant,"" traffic-driving anchors.As department stores waver, Green Street's research points to restaurants, movie theaters and ""traditional power-center tenants"" — like Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and pet stores — as rising power players.But Talmage Advisors' Dunn is not optimistic.""The problem is, it's a little bit of a self-fulfilling prophesy,"" she said. ""The landlords aren't willing to invest in the lower-tier centers, and the thing that would potentially take a lower-tier center to help it jump a bracket is investment. But it's hard to justify the investment if the center's performance isn't in that top-tier range.""

150,JWN,"Add Sears Holdings (SHLD) and Sears-owned Kmart to the list of companies that are shedding some Trump-branded products — but the company insists that politics has nothing to do with it.The major retailer said on Saturday that Sears and Kmart would no longer carry several dozen Trump Home products, according to Reuters.""As part of the company's initiative to optimize its online product assortment, we constantly refine that assortment to focus on our most profitable items,"" said Sears Holdings spokesperson Brian Hanover, according to a statement acquired by the outlet.""Amid that streamlining effort, 31 Trump Home items were among the items removed online this week,"" he said. Those products were reportedly sold only online and not in brick-and-mortar Sears and Kmart stores.But responding to recent headlines via blog post, Sears said Monday that the changes reflect a routine shuffle of its product assortment and that ""hundreds"" of Trump and Ivanka Trump items are available on Sears.com through third-party marketplace sellers.""I think any fair observer can understand why this confusion was generated and why we prefer to remain focused on serving our members and our marketplace sellers and leave the politics to others,"" wrote Sears Holdings Vice President of Corporate Communications Chris Brathwaite.Sears shares plunged 8.1% to close the regular trading session at 6.40 on the stock market today. But the stock rose nearly 26% Friday as the ailing retailer said it will slash costs further and could sell more core brands and real estate. The stock hit its lowest level since 2003 on Wednesday.Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday a 32% sales decline of Ivanka Trump-brand merchandise at Nordstrom (JWN) in the prior fiscal year, citing internal Nordstrom data. The data also reportedly shows a more-than-70% sales tumble of the brand's footwear and clothing items in the second, third and fourth weeks of October vs. prior-year sales. Those weeks marked the period leading up to the election.IBD'S TAKE: With or without scrutiny from the president, retailers have been facing challenges, and malls have been forced to ramp up the drama in the age of Amazon (AMZN). Here's what that looks like.Boycotts of Trump-branded goods have surfaced in the form of the Grab Your Wallet campaign and criticism online. The President fired off a tweet at Nordstrom on Wednesday, less than a week after reports emerged that the upscale department store was dropping his daughters line of merchandise.My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017Nordstrom said the change was a reflection of sales performance.While this is far from the first time that Trump has singled out an individual company on Twitter (TWTR), his tweet at the department store has raised concerns about ethical conflicts of interests and a blurred line between his roles as president and businessman.Despite the attack, Nordstrom shares rose sharply on Wednesday to notch its biggest one-day gain in two months. But Nordstrom dipped 2.3% Monday morning.Fashion news site Racked.com has reported that Neiman Marcus, Belk, HSN and ShopStyle have dropped Ivanka Trump merchandise.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (WMT)-owned Jet.com also appears to have pulled Trump-branded goods, Mic reported, though Wal-Mart itself still offers Trump merchandise.T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, both owned by off-priced retail specialist TJX Cos. (TJX), also seem to be pulling back on Ivanka clothing.In other news, Under Armour (UAA) CEO Kevin Plank is under fire from his own brand's endorsers after calling Trump ""a real asset to the country"" in a recent CNBC interview.RELATED:President Trump Attacks Nordstrom To Defend Daughter's Business Sears Could Sell More Brands, Real Estate To Cut $1 Billion

151,JWN,"Look up ""sad mall"" or ""dead mall"" online and you're likely to be confronted with images of desolate, shuttered shopping centers that have been left for dead. Overgrown plants crack through abandoned storefronts; crumbled tile litters broken-down escalators. It's a common-enough phenomenon that entire photography projects revolve around the state of the country's retail centers.Is this what 2017 holds for American shoppers?Not quite, but the upcoming year isn't exactly going to be a cakewalk, either. The hundreds of collective store closures (from Macy's (M), Wal-Mart (WMT) and others, combined) and bankruptcies (Sports Authority, Sports Chalet) in 2016 are enough to make even the most devoted shopaholic wonder if the future of commerce is one big Amazon.com (AMZN) screen.""It's going to be a year of transition and a year of reckoning and a year of awakening for retailers,"" said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst.Retail sales excluding autos and gasoline rose 4% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to MasterCard's SpendingPulse. That suggests a stronger-than-expected holiday season, perhaps reflecting more optimistic consumers. But while digital sales continued to boom, with Amazon grabbing an ever-larger e-commerce share, brick-and-mortar locations faced declining traffic. And those trends are likely to intensify into the new year.The big discounts offered at apparel stores this holiday season echoed prior sales-heavy years, particularly 2015's. While retailers generally went into this important shopping period claiming that inventories were lean, stores feel they have no choice in an already cutthroat environment.""Consumers have been trained that if they hold out, they will get a promotion,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. ""The other problem is that it's a really overcrowded space with no barriers to entry. A lot of retailers are choosing to compete on price.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins said that outside of a few busy hours on the weekends, Holiday 2016 was ""somewhat eerily quiet"" at the mall.During store checks, his research firm observed but a ""handful of people"" at Foot Locker (FL), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) brand Hollister, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Macy's. L Brands' (LB) Bath & Body Works ""always seems to have a buzz,"" he said, but even Apple (AAPL) stores seemed less bustling than in years' past.""Each year it feels like that lull is a bit deeper and deeper,"" said Perkins.Some of the lag can be attributed to holiday promotions being pushed up earlier in November, said NPD's Cohen, spreading out the spending. But the perhaps greater problem is the lack of product innovation and uniqueness on shelves, he said.In other words, there's not enough new, fun stuff to buy — for other people or for self-gifting purposes.NPD, which tracks the November-December shopping period week by week, said in its latest report that as of the week ending Dec. 10, dollar sales in the first six weeks of the holiday retail season were lagging the prior-year period by 4%.Brick-and-mortar traffic fell about 10% at stores through Dec. 17, according to Prodco Retail Traffic Index.One saving grace for brick-and-mortar locations: Christmas Eve — also the start of Hanukkah this year — was on a Saturday, while Dec. 26 was also a day off.The issues that faced retailers in 2016 are likely to continue to face them in 2017, without much abatement. Perkins highlighted the ongoing shift to online and mobile spending, a consumer taste for experiences instead of products, high promotional activity and a ""hollowing out"" of the middle class that leaves less disposable income on the table.And, of course, Amazon's insistent gains. On top of Prime shipping and Prime Video, the company's smart-home device, Alexa, can help Prime members place orders.""(Alexa) cuts retailer out of the equation for consumers that are pressed for time,"" he said.Upper-tier malls — the kind that house Tiffanys (TIF) and Louis Vuittons and Shake Shacks (SHAK) — are expected to continue to perform well enough. But the average mall might still see some individual stores close up shop, say experts, unless they go out of their way to attract more foot traffic.""Mid-tier malls are going to need to step up their game"" with restaurants, movie theaters and lifestyle stores, said NPD's Cohen, adding that ""the food court won't be good enough.""Simon Property Group (SPG), a major mall operator, has tumbled 24% over the last five months, sinking Wednesday to the lowest level in nearly 16 months.That young people are doing more mobile shopping and are craving experiences is no surprise. But how retailers respond may foreshadow the brick-and-mortar industry's fate.Wal-Mart (WMT) investments (which include its e-commerce efforts) may weigh on short-term income growth but lead to foreseeable rewards in the future, said Perkins, whose store checks found that Wal-Mart has been ""one of the busier stores"" this season.In 2017, the top-performers list should feature some familiar names, by Perkins' estimate. Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are ""two of the strongest performers in retail."" He also sees off-price trio TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) continuing to do well, as well as Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which is ""obviously a standout player.""Home improvement, off-price and beauty all involve some element of in-store necessity: looking for just the right part, digging through bargain racks and trying on new makeup brands are usually best done in person.Department stores have had a choppy year, though Nordstrom (JWN) frequently gets a shout-out from analysts for being an ""omnichannel"" retailer that knows how to engage its customers across platforms. And unlike Macy's or Kohl's (KSS), which compete ""with Amazon and everyone else on the internet,"" says Morningstar's Weishaar, Nordstrom has differentiated itself by catering to more affluent shoppers with a highly curated selection.""If you go to Amazon and type in 'red dress,' you're going to get literally hundreds of pages of results to sift through that (are) not useful,"" she said. ""If you go to Nordstrom, you're going to get 10 (products in line with) your price points and brands.""Even so, Nordstrom was recently handed a downgrade from JPMorgan after the department store's management team said brick-and-mortar levels hadn't been that bad since 1972.In the future, being omnichannel might not be enough, particularly in a world increasingly populated by Alexa and Google Home devices.Retail ""omnipresence"" is key, said NPD's Cohen.That is, instead of simply giving customers a way to buy products both in-store and online, it would behoove retailers to latch onto shoppers before, during and after the transaction, he said. Educate them and anticipate their needs ahead of potential transactions, allow them different ways to buy, then stay in touch via product reviews or other methods following the purchase.The goal, said Cohen, is ""that the store becomes the epicenter for the entire process.""RELATED:Amazon's Top Selling Holiday Products Came From ...

162,JWN,"The biggest shopping season of the year is upon us. Will holiday sales get a Trump bump? Is Amazon's (AMZN) gradual decimation of brick-and-mortar shops an inevitability? Is this still a terrible time to be a department store?Like a white elephant exchange at an office holiday party, it's not clear whether everyone will be happy once all the gifting's done.Among clothiers, Gap (GPS), parent to Banana Republic, Old Navy and its flagship brand, is expected to log a 1.2% same-store sales decline during the December quarter, according to Retail Metrics estimates. Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works parent L Brands (LB) is seen growing comps 1.5%.Handbag makers Kate Spade (KATE) and Coach (COH) are likely to have a merry Christmas quarter with projected comp growth of 6.8% and 2.1%, respectively, while peer Michael Kors (KORS) is expected to drop 4.4%.Overall, early December figures appear sluggish so far. Research firm NPD Group said Wednesday that dollar sales for the week ending Dec. 3, the fifth week of the holiday shopping season, had dropped 5% from the same prior-year period.Shoppers are still buying sneakers, though. Athletic footwear sales for the week rose 2%, the only industry to outperform that week, said the firm.Nike (NKE) shares fell 1% to 51.29 on the stock market today. Nike will report quarterly earnings next Tuesday. Under Armour (UA) shares sank 2.9%.Personal computers, home automation, athletic leisure footwear, outdoor and sports toys made NPD's top five, with wearables cracking the top performers list for the first time.Fitbit (FIT) widened its lead in the wearables market in Q3, said tracking firm IDC earlier in the month. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) Watch shipments plummeted 71% during the period. But Fitbit issued a grim holiday outlook, while Apple might fare better now that its Apple Watch 2 is out.Apple iPads were widely reported to be big sellers over Thanksgiving weekend, thanks to doorbuster deals. The Apple iPhone 7 also should be a solid seller, even if the latest generation isn't seen as revolutionary.Apple shares rose 0.55% to 115.82, closing in on a 118.79 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: After initially lagging during the Trump market rally, Apple, Amazon and other big-cap techs are shaping up for potential breakouts.For November, department stores sales slipped 0.2%, and apparel sales were flat, according to the Commerce Department on Wednesday. Overall retail sales rose 0.1% from October, falling short of expectations.Retail Metrics sees a 1.5% drop in Macy's (M) holiday-quarter same-store sales but expects rival department stores J.C.

163,JWN,"Never accuse the country's biggest retailer of resting on its laurels. After disrupting and transforming one retail segment after another, Amazon (AMZN) has the checkout line in its sights. And investors are returning to ETFs that have big stakes in the stock.Amazon Go, unveiled Monday, promises a new kind of brick-and-mortar store. Its marquee feature is checkout-free ""grab and go"" shopping. So no more dealing with long lines at cash registers or scrambling for a debit card, although details of Amazon's plans are scarce.Convenience is highly valued by consumers, and the Amazon Go news should help exchange traded funds tied to consumers' disposable income, said David Haviland, a managing partner at Beaumont Capital Management.""This appears like a positive announcement in a very exciting technology,"" he added. ""If it works as described, it seems like it could be applied to all retail.""A positive development tied to Amazon matters in the ETF investing world, where roughly 100 funds hold the stock. It matters especially to investors who make tactical and strategic bets on equity sectors to tap growth, diversify portfolios and manage risk.Amazon's stock was down 9.70, or 1.26%, at 758.95 Monday. Amazon accounts for 13% of the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500, more than any other company.That makes Amazon the top stock in the $11.11 billion Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY). Amazon also is the No. 1 holding with a 10% to 16% portfolio weighting in cap-weighted ETFs such as Vanguard Consumer Discretionary (VCR), iShares U.S. Consumer Services (IYC), Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary (FDIS) and VanEck Vectors Retail (RTH).Of them, the Fidelity ETF has the lowest expense ratio at 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: New products or services represent the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system. Strong earnings growth (the C and A in CAN SLIM, for Current earnings and Annual earnings) is the No. 1 factor to look for in a stock, but new products or services often generate stellar profitability.Haviland, whose Massachusetts-based firm has $2.7 billion in assets under management, is cautiously optimistic about the consumer discretionary sector for two reasons.""We think the sector will do relatively well as the Trump administration is focusing on tax cuts and government spending, and this will put more money into the economy,"" he told IBD via email. ""Also, the proposed infrastructure spending may be inflationary, which may help Americans by reducing their debt burdens in real terms.""Consumer discretionary funds have had a hard slog of late, but are starting to perk up.Apart from the Trump factor, the seasonal factor is in play. Holiday shopping often delivers a boost to retailers in the run-up to the ""Santa Claus rally"" that stocks tend to see in the final week of the year.In the month ended Dec. 8, XLY leapt 6.7%, outpacing the S&P 500, and it pegged a 52-week high of 84.34 on Thursday.Year to date, XLY is up 8.9% vs. 12.2% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). Consumer discretionary has outperformed virtually all S&P 500 sectors over the past five years and longer periods of time.Investors have piled back in as the sector regains its footing. XLY saw $1.1 billion in net inflow in the month ended Dec. 7, according to FactSet data. That contrasts with a $1.1 billion in net outflow since the start of this year.XLY and most of its peers had bled money earlier in the year amid a multitude of woes: falling foot traffic in brick-and-mortar stores; disappointing reports across the retail landscape; and an uncertain economic outlook that made consumers reluctant to spend.Sheraz Mian, research director at Zacks Investment Research, finds it worrisome that all major industries in retail came out with weaker-than-expected results in the third quarter.""We saw that with the online vendors, the restaurants and even the big-box retailers,"" Mian said. One big exception was Best Buy (BBY).Department stores such as Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN) and Kohl's (KSS) did relatively better, ""but that was largely as a result of tight inventory controls,"" Mian added.Haviland of Beaumont Capital, despite his increased optimism about the sector, notes a big risk in rising interest rates.""If Americans have to spend incrementally more of their incomes servicing debt burdens, then they'll have less to spend on discretionary items,"" he said.Consumer discretionary ETFs that skew toward small caps and value stocks have beaten their cap-weighted peers on the stock market so far this year.PowerShares S&P SmallCap Consumer Discretionary (PSCD) is up 21.5% through Dec. 8, while Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary (RCD), SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) and First Trust Consumer Discretionary Alpha (FXD) are up between 11% and 13%.Small-cap and value stocks are also favored by some strategists in the changing landscape under President-elect Donald Trump.RELATED:Small-Cap Value ETFs Show Again Why They Are Darlings Of The MarketHow To Play Small-Cap ETFs In Strong Equity Markets With Rising Rates

165,JWN,"The stock market closed mixed Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average lagging the major indexes.The Dow closed 0.2% lower while the S&P 500 edged up 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite gained less than 0.2%. The S&P and Nasdaq erased mild losses earlier in the day, continuing a pattern of mild price changes.Small caps lagged again, with the Russell 2000 dropping about 0.2%. Volume was moderately higher, according to early figures. Winners led losers by a 9-to-7 ratio on the NYSE and by 6-to-5 on the Nasdaq.After the close, cybersecurity company Qualys (QLYS) slid in extended trading. The company's fourth-quarter sales missed views and its guidance was weak. Chipmaker MaxLinear (MXL) also tumbled after hours. Its Q4 results beat estimates but the Q1 revenue forecast was light.There was some cheer for the struggling retail sector. Department stores, discount shops, apparel chains, restaurants and auto parts stores were among the 12 best-performing industry groups in today's market.Some retail stocks fell earlier Wednesday after President Trump took to Twitter to attack Nordstrom (JWN) for dropping his daughter Ivanka's fashion line. But Nordstrom shares rose in late trading and closed with a 4% increase.Nearly all eight stocks that make up the department-stores group were up, though they are barely starting to recover from 52-week lows or worse.The retail sector has deeper problems than Trump tweets or political boycotts. Brick-and-mortar stores continue to be pressured by Amazon.com (AMZN) and other online sellers.The mobile-home and RV industry also led, as Thor Industries (THO) broke out of a cup-with-handle base. The RV manufacturer surged past the 106.43 buy point and closed in buy range. But the base is a later-stage pattern, and volume was less than enthusiastic on the breakout. An analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. upgraded Thor to outperform from neutral, citing optimism among dealers and upside potential on margins, according to TheFly.com.Steel, heavy-construction and some other cyclical stocks lagged. Banks and financials also were weak as bond yields continued to drop, threatening margins. Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) touched their 50-day lines, where they now test support.On Thursday, earnings are due out from Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Beazer Homes (BZH), Coca Cola (KO) and Cummins (CMI).

168,JWN,"Some markets just don't produce winners, no matter how hard you look. Sitting on the sidelines is a justifiable alternative — it's much better than losing money. However, you could take another approach: If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.When you have a segment of stocks breaking down or reversing lower while the market is weakening, this can be an ideal time to short stocks. Shorting reverses the order of buy low and sell high for stock profits, instead, you sell high and buy low. You borrow stock from your broker and sell it on the open market.If the stock goes down, you can buy it back at a lower price and return the shares you borrowed. The difference in price is your profit. If the stock goes up, at some point you may need to ""cover"" your position to reduce your losses. When buying the shares back at a higher price, the difference in price is your loss on the trade.An attractive part about buying stocks is that your risk is always limited (the worst that can happen is the stock goes to 0), while the potential reward is unlimited. With shorting it's the opposite, your reward is limited and your risk is unlimited. Another downside to shorting is you don't get the effects of compounding within a trade. On the long side, if your stock goes up 5% one week and another 5% the next, you will make more money on the second week because of compounding. With shorting, if the stock goes down 5% the first week and down another 5% the second week, you make less money the second week. That makes swing trading for shorting particularly attractive.The things to look for in a short sale are lower Relative Price Strength ratings, a struggling market, a weak industry group, and either a reversal from an area of resistance or a breakdown below a prior level of support.Nordstrom (JWN) checked out last year and was eventually added on to IBD's SwingTrader product. The stock was in a downtrend for nearly a year when it started to rally back above its 50-day moving average as the market firmed up a year ago (1). The rally was short lived and on April 7, the stock fell below the 50-day again (2). Nordstrom rallied back to the 50-day and reversed (3) followed by another attempt and reversal (4). At the second reversal, the Market Action on SwingTrader turned to Downtrend suggesting more of a bias toward shorting.The stock was added as a short sale to SwingTrader at 50.86 on April 29 as the stock broke below the support level for the week (5) on a pickup in volume. The Relative Price Strength Rating was weak at 20 and the department stores industry group was a dismal No. 196 out of 197. The stock dropped and in just four days the position was covered at 48.30 on May 5 with a 5% profit (6).A complete history of past trades, as well as current ideas, is available to subscribers and trialists of IBD's SwingTrader.

169,JWN,"George Soros took stakes in Facebook (FB) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) in the fourth quarter, while Appaloosa cut its stake in Apple (AAPL), and both followed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) in appearing to find a bargain in airlines. Here's a look at how some big investors managed their portfolios in the last quarter of last year.Soros Fund Management bought 353,686 shares in Facebook and bulked up its stake in Alphabet (GOOGL) by nearly 60% to 20,200 shares, according to a regulatory filing out late Tuesday. Soros also increased his T-Mobile (TMUS) stake to 685,700 shares.Soros bought 62,100 shares in Goldman Sachs. Dan Loeb's Third Point last week disclosed that it had scooped up shares of Goldman, Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Bank stocks have risen on greater expectations of lighter regulations, higher interest rates and greater volatility, which Goldman's trading desk could benefit from in particular.Soros also took a 40,000-share stake in Delta Air Lines (DAL), but dropped United Airlines (UAL).Shares of Apple ended regular trading up 0.4% to 135.51 on the stock market today, after hitting a record high yesterday. Facebook fell 0.3% to 133.44, while Goldman Sachs rose 0.4% to 250.54. Delta climbed 2.6% to 51.17, American rose 2.1% to 47.54, and United gained 2.7% to 75.75.IBD'S TAKE: Even as big investors flocked to the airlines last year, Cowen analysts last month said shares of airlines could be ""due for a break"" after taking off in Q4. Meanwhile, Soros dropped Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Herbalife (HLF), Harley Davidson (HOG), PepsiCo (PEP) and JCPenney (JCP). He also dissolved his stake in Nordstrom (JWN)Soros also offloaded his position in consumer-care products giant Procter & Gamble (PG), which got a lift Tuesday after activist investor Trian took a more than $3 billion stake in the company.Hedge fund Appaloosa Management increased its stake in Facebook by 47% to 2.2 million shares. The fund also upped its holdings in Qualcomm (QCOM) and more than doubled its stake in Southwest (LUV). Appaloosa also took a 160,000-share stake in United Airlines.The fund loaded up on the health sector, taking new stakes in companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Centene (CNC), McKesson (MCK) and Pfizer (PFE). It also took a new stake in JCPenney.Appaloosa cut its position in Apple by 350,000 shares, slashed its stake in Yahoo (YHOO) and rid itself of Bank of America and General Motors (GM).Along with boosting its stake in Apple, David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital dissolved its stake in Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), U.S. Steel (X) and Michael Kors (KORS).Like Buffett, Greenlight also took a stake in Monsanto (MON).But the moves by Soros and Appaloosa into airlines are notable in that they could signal other big investors are following Buffett, who announced Q3 stakes in the sector last year.Buffett, after years of avoiding the airlines, has come around to the industry. Airlines last year showed more signs of discipline, and the wave of consolidation over the past several years has kept the major airlines relatively insulated from new competition.""When we launched on the sector late last year, we found most investors generally in agreement that airlines represented deep value,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote in a research note dated Tuesday.""The biggest question remains: when will the market and, more importantly, large long-term investors begin to care? We think tonight's Berkshire Hathaway 13F will go a long way to attract sector interest.""RELATED:Airline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The AtlanticJPMorgan Sets Fresh High, Goldman Hits Highest Since 2007 On Yellen

172,JWN,"Most major stock-index ETFs opened lower Wednesday as the Trump rally faded and concerns about U.S. oil stockpiles mounted. But the retail sector made a modest advance amid a slew of mixed earnings reports.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) dipped 0.2% on the stock market today in early trading.This exchange traded fund, a proxy for the broad U.S. market, is flirting with its August high of 219.60, having advanced almost 2.0% since the Nov. 8 election.Consumer sectors topped advancing S&P 500 sectors with a 0.3% gain. The financial sector, which has led the postelection rally, trailed as banks pulled back from a run that took them to their best level since 2008.SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) popped 0.5% higher in morning trade. Among retailers, Target (TGT) gapped up nearly 9.0% on its earnings beat and holiday guidance.Major department store chains like Nordstrom (JWN) and Macy's (M) also have reported strong results or given upbeat guidance in recent trading sessions.IBD'S Take: The retail ETF has had a lackluster showing in the past year. While Amazon has left Macy's and Kohl's struggling to maintain and expand their customer base, Ulta Beauty hasn't been as easily disrupted by online shopping and free shipping.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) traded around the flat line Wednesday, a day after making a stand at the 115 level for the third time since April. The yellow metal has come under pressure postelection as investors flocked to risk assets and the U.S. dollar rallied.The gold ETF's trend remains under pressure following the breach of the 200-day moving average last week, Ari Wald, a senior technical analyst at Oppenheimer, told IBD on Tuesday.In the current market, he favors risk trades and is looking for GLD to stabilize.Here's a look at the performance of major exchange traded funds across key asset classes on the stock market today.The Relative Price Strength (RS) Rating measures a stock's price performance over the last 12 months vs. all stocks and ETFs, on a scale of 1 to a best-possible 99.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), -0.2%, RS 56PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), +0.5%, RS 56SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), -0.2%, RS 58IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), +0.1%, RS 65IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), +0.3%, RS 73IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), -0.9%, RS 34Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), -0.6%, RS 48SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), -0.3%, RS 34United States Oil (USO), +0.4%, RS 25IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), 0%, RS 31PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), +0.3%, RS 51IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), +1.2%, RS 1

173,JWN,"Target's (TGT) strong digital sales in the third quarter added to surprisingly bullish earnings and holiday-quarter guidance Wednesday, ahead of Wal-Mart's (WMT) quarterly report Thursday.The big-box retailer's adjusted EPS jumped 21% to $1.04 vs. forecasts for a 3.5% dip, while revenue slipped 6.7% to $16.44 billion, better than views for $16.34 billion. Same-store sales dipped 0.2%, while digital sales grew 26%. The chain has been scrambling to boost its e-commerce capabilities to better compete against Amazon (AMZN).Target sees Q4 EPS of $1.55-$1.75, with the midpoint above consensus for $1.60, and comp sales down 1% to up 1%, up from its prior outlook of down 2% to flat. Full-year EPS is now seen at $5.10-$5.30, up from its prior guidance of $4.80-$5.20 and above consensus for $4.94.Shares jumped 6.4% to close at 76.03 on the stock market today. The stock retook its 50-day line last week, as top department store chains like Nordstrom (JWN) and Macy's (M) reported strong results or gave upbeat guidance for the holidays. Shares of Wal-Mart inched down 3 cents to 71.39.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Nordstrom are nearing profit-taking territory after re-clearing a 53.81 flat base entry last week as rival department stores were bullish on the holidays, then extending those gains on its own estimate-beating quarterly report.In August, Target slashed its full-year earnings guidance after reporting Q2 results and said it plans for a ""challenging environment"" during the rest of 2016. For Q3, it forecast EPS of 75-95 cents.Target also saw some weakness in Q2, though it attributed some of that to declining sales of Apple (AAPL) products. But in its Q3 report last week, Macy's noted strength in Apple sales and signaled a cheery holiday season ahead. Target also noted ""meaningful"" improvements in sales of Apple products in Q3.On Tuesday, however, Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) gave weak earnings guidance for the holiday quarter after cruising past Q3 forecasts.RELATED:Department Store Rally Continues Despite Weak J.C.

174,JWN,"Major index-tracking ETFs retreated from their stunning postelection rally on Cyber Monday despite a surge in oil prices and amid mixed news tied to holiday shoppers.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) slipped 0.5% on the stock market today.This exchange traded fund serves as a proxy for the broad U.S. market and set a fresh all-time high of 221.56 last week.Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), which tracks energy stocks in the S&P 500, booked a 1.4% loss despite strong gains in the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for January delivery. WTI settled 84 cents higher at $46.90 a barrel.Oil rose on reports that Iraq will lend support to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in its efforts to curb or freeze production at a Wednesday meeting.Defensive sectors, such as real estate, consumer staples and utilities, advanced. Most other S&P 500 sectors tracked lower, weighing on ETFs holding the related stocks.However, Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) nudged up 0.1%, scoring a fresh high of 48.26 intraday.In total, 13 ETFs focused on diversified exposure to technology stocks or targeted exposure to chipmakers posted 52-week highs. However, trading volume was lackluster and many of these funds closed flat to lower.Among them, iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) and SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) saw their relative strength (RS) lines pierce new high ground.Retailers Amazon.com (AMZN), Best Buy (BBY), Macy's (M), Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Nordstrom (JWN) were in focus as some analysts lowered their holiday outlook on Monday.Tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) — as well as their parts suppliers — may benefit from new product releases, including the iPhone 7, MacBook Pro and the Pixel phone.Many retailers, such as Best Buy, offer exceptional bargains on Apple products and other tech items on the Monday following Thanksgiving, known as Cyber Monday.Online retailers like Amazon saw better results than the traditional brick-and-mortar retailers this past holiday weekend, according to the National Retail Federation.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for stocks that are at or near proper buy points? Apple, Amazon, Best Buy, Ulta Beauty are stocks to watch.

175,JWN,"J.C. Penney (JCP) reported third-quarter sales early Friday that missed forecasts and cut its outlook after strong results or guidance from Nordstrom (JWN), Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) on Thursday. But that didn't derail the department store rallyEstimates: Per-share loss narrowing to 21 cents from 47 cents a share, with revenue up 1.9% to $2.95 billion.Results: Per-share loss of 21 cents on revenue of $2.86 billion. Same-store sales dipped 0.8%, worse than views for an increase of more than 2%.Outlook: Full-year same-store sales now seen growing 1%-2%, down from a prior forecast for 3%-4% growth.Stock: J.C. Penney rose 4% to 9.16 on the stock market today, moving back above its 50-day line and closing just below its 200-day. Shares surged 5.4% Thursday on strong results from other department stores.IBD'S TAKE: While Amazon has been leaving rivals like Macy's and Kohl's struggling to maintain and expand their customer base, Ulta Beauty hasn't been as easily disrupted by online shopping and free shipping.Late Thursday, Nordstrom said EPS jumped 47% to 84 cents, crushing views for a decline to 41 cents, with sales rising 7.2% to $3.54 billion, above views for $3.485 billion. Same-store sales rose 2.4%. Nordstrom shares rose 4.8% Friday after jumping 7.15% on Thursday.Nordstrom also raised its full-year EPS outlook to $2.85-$2.95, well above Wall Street estimates for $2.73, from a prior view of $2.60-$2.75.Earlier Thursday, Kohl's reported Q3 EPS rose 7% to 80 cents, beating analyst views by 10 cents, with revenue down 2.3% to $4.33 billion, also topping estimates. Kohl's rose 4.4% to 53.22, hitting a 14-month high. Kohl's stock leapt 11.5% on Thursday.And while Macy's missed estimates, it was upbeat on the key holiday season early Thursday. It now sees its 2016 same-store sales drop at 2.5%-3%, up from a prior view for a decline of 3%-4%.""Our customers tell us we are their holiday shopping destination, and we are excited about our gift assortments, marketing strategies and digital enhancements, all of which should set us up for a stronger finish to the year and position us well for an improved performance in 2017 and beyond,"" said Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren in a release.Macy's rose 2% Friday after Thursday's 5.6% pop.

176,JWN,"As malls die, Macy's (M) plans huge job cuts, and Sears (SHLD) closes 150 stores, online sales on sites like Amazon (AMZN) and devices like your Apple (AAPL) iPhone, to the surprise of perhaps nobody, were higher during the 2016 holiday season.Online sales rose 11% a record $91.7 billion, Adobe (ADBE) said Thursday, slightly surpassing the company's own expectations for $91.6 billion. More of those sales were made via mobile devices, which drove half of site visits, Adobe said. Mobile sales jumped 23% to $28.43 billion.Other surveys have suggested that Amazon grabbed a huge share of that e-commerce growth. But it didn't entirely hog the spotlight. Online auction site eBay (EBAY) was the most mentioned retailer on social media, ""with eBay sellers promoting their items for purchase and eBay buyers highlighting products they bought that they couldn't find in stores,"" Adobe said.Amazon shares rose 3.1% to 780.45 in heavy volume on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average. Amazon hadn't closed above that key support level since Oct. 27, when the online giant missed earnings estimates and gave cautious guidance.Shares of eBay edged up, continuing to trade comfortably above their 50-day. Apple, which announced December App Store revenue hit $3 billion in December, also nudged higher, close to a buy point.Amazon, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) lagged eBay in social-media mentions.Pokemon Sun/Moon was the most frequently mentioned product, followed by Barbie, Oculus and Legos.""But it's not just the total online sales figure that made this a historic holiday shopping season,"" said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst and director at Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. ""This year, Black Friday set a new record by surpassing the $3 billion mark for the first time at $3.34 billion, with high growth in the evening hours.""Black Friday also became the first day in retail history to bring in more than $1 billion in mobile sales, she said.And Adobe's report indicated that more people are doing their buying later in the holiday season — posing more challenges to the delivery infrastructures of UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).Sales accelerated closer to the end of last month, Adobe said, as shipping cutoff dates approached and more customers made purchases online and picked them up in stores.IBD'S TAKE: As malls become relics of the retail and real estate world and Amazon comes to dominate more forms of commerce, many store chains will face a reckoning this year.The gains in online sales have come at the expense of many brick-and-mortar retailers. Macy's and Kohl's (KSS) slashed earnings views late Wednesday as both reported a 2.1% same-store sales decline in November and December. Barnes & Noble (BKS) also said holiday sales were grim, while Sears announced a new raft of store closures and sold its Craftsman tool line.Macy's shares crashed 14% Thursday, Kohl's 19% and Barnes & Noble nearly 7%. Other department stores, apparel retailers and makers and other retail-related groups were big losers Thursday.Those follow other signs that physical stores were suffering.Handbag maker and retailer Kate Spade (KATE) is reportedly exploring a sale, while Nordstrom (JWN) management, according to a JPMorgan report, said brick-and-mortar traffic was at its worst levels in more than 40 years.Off-price retailers, however, have fared better against the likes of Amazon in part due to their ""treasure hunt"" appeal, in which shoppers don't entirely know what kind of bargain they're going to find.RELATED:Christmas Meltdown: Macy's, Kohl's, Kors, Fossil, L Brands, OthersWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Ross Stores: A No-Nonsense Retailer Free From Amazon's Clutches
"
177,JWN,"Department stores Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) cut earnings estimates late Wednesday, citing weak holiday sales, sending shares of both department stores sharply lower after the close.Kohl's said its full-year earnings per share target to $2.92-$2.97 from $3.12-$3.32 and estimates of $3.94. November-December same-store sales fell 2.1% vs. a year earlier.Macy's cut its EPS target to $2.95-$3.10 vs. its prior goal of $3.15-$3.40. Macy's also reported a 2.1% November-December comps decline.Macy's also gave more details on its late 2016 announcement to close 100 stores. It set plans to cut 68 stores as part of that effort, cutting 10,000 jobs as part of the closures and other restructurings. The closures will cut 2017 sales by $575 million.""We continue to experience declining traffic in our stores where the majority of our business is still transacted,"" Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren said. ""We had anticipated sales would be stronger. We believe that our performance during the holiday season reflects the broader challenges facing much of the retail industrySeveral reports indicated that brick-and-mortar chains and malls saw weak traffic during the holiday season as shoppers made purchases at Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce sites. Nordstrom (JWN) said its full-line stores were seeing the worst traffic since 1972.Macy's plummeted 8.9% in late trading on the stock market today. Kohl's crashed 13.5%. Nordstrom fell 6% and JCPenney (JCP) 4.7%. Amazon was little changed.Lundgren noted that handbags and watches were weak for Macy's during the holidays. That hit handbag makers Michael Kors (KORS), Coach (COH) and Kate Spade (KATE) and watchmaker Fossil (FOSL) in late trading.

178,JWN,"J.C. Penney (JCP) and Nike (NKE) have joined forces to launch Nike ""brand shop environments"" in more than 600 J.C. Penney stores, the department store chain said Tuesday.The linkup between the midlevel department store company and major sports apparel brand pits them directly against another similar duo. Under Armour (UAA) announced last July a move to roll out products at around 600 Kohl's (KSS) locations starting early this year.On the surface, the most notable difference in the two alliances appears to be the gender of their target consumers.The 500 sq. ft. Nike shop-in-shops, which are now available, have been placed in a ""prominent location within the men's department,"" said J.C. Penney, and will feature basketball, training and running product areas. The details found in the press release appeared primarily geared toward men's products, though the company said ""similar visual elements are available in select stores for women and kids.""Meanwhile, Under Armour Chief Executive Kevin Plank acknowledged last year that the majority of Kohl's customers are women shoppers.""We think Kohl's is a great evolution for us,"" said Plank in Under Armour's second-quarter call in late July, adding he thinks there's ""a big opportunity"" in the women's market.IBD's TAKE: What's in store for American shoppers? A ""reckoning,"" says one expert.The move comes at a time when athletic wear remains popular but department stores have largely been struggling to keep abreast of Amazon.com (AMZN) and other online shopping destinations.A brief postelection rally for department stores soon gave way to a downswing that was further weighed down by weak holiday sales figures. Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN), Kohl's, J.C. Penney have all been trading well below their key 50-day and 200-day moving averages.But shares of J.C. Penney advanced 2.7% on the stock market today, as retailers and apparel makers generally rallied following President-elect Trump's negative comments about a House GOP plan to tax imports. Nike climbed 1.4% and Kohl's 1.45%.

Macy's is also selling assets in San Francisco and Portland, Ore.Meanwhile, Kohl's (KSS) said Thursday that Q3 EPS rose 7% to 80 cents, beating analyst views by 10 cents, with revenue down 2.3% to $4.33 billion, also topping estimates. Same-store sales fell 1.7%.""We are pleased to see continued improvement in our sales trends. Our back-to-school season was strong, followed by a soft September, and progressive improvement throughout October,"" CEO Kevin Mansell said in a release. ""We are encouraged by these trends as we enter the holiday season.""Shares surged 11.5% to 50.97, helped by a boost to its buyback program to $2 billion, shooting past its buy zone with a 46.79 entry point. The stock had been moving sideways after a downturn, forming a three-month base over its 200-day line.RELATED: Retail Sales Winners, Losers: Best Buy, Home Depot, Macy's, Domino'sHoliday Hires Show How Amazon Is Leaving Retail Rivals In The Dust
"
183,JWN,"Black Friday. Cyber Monday. Super Saturday. The annual retail running of the bulls is a treacherous terrain of sharpened elbows and trigger-happy mouse clicks for shoppers trying to get the best deal possible.The stakes are even higher for the stores themselves: The National Retail Federation has said that sales in November and December can account for anywhere from 20%-40% of a retailer's yearly sales. Perhaps fortunately for department stores like Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and others, there's nowhere to go but up this Christmas.""Given the fact that last year was so horrible, the comps are easy,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar.As weather, inventory issues, heavy discounting and e-commerce giants like Amazon (AMZN) weighed, Macy's reported a 4.7% same-store sales decline in November and December of last year. Kohl's Q4 2015 comps edged up a mere 0.4%. Overall, last year's holiday retail sales disappointed with only 3% growth, said the NRF, less than expected.Holiday 2016 should prove to be a little less dire. The NRF predicts a 3.6% retail gain in November and December to $655.8 billion; online sales are seen rising 7%-10% to $117 billion. And retailers are feeling bullish. Target (TGT), Macy's and Nordstrom (JWN) all raised guidance going into the all-important shopping season.Predictably, online sales continue to eat into brick-and-mortar market share. Traditional stores are again gearing up to do battle with Amazon and friends.Wal-Mart (WMT) is pushing up its ""Cyber Week"" deals from Monday to Friday so that they start essentially the minute Thanksgiving Day is over. Target's ""10 Days of Deals,"" which include both in-store and online promotions, already started on Saturday.""If you look at the companies that reported earnings, it's e-commerce that's driving a significant amount of the growth,"" said Weishaar. ""What's unique in it is mobile is becoming a higher penetration of the digital section, so that would be something new. I don't think a lot of the companies have figured out how to convert the sales on mobile.""Shopping via smartphone is the next frontier. Thanksgiving Day and Christmas are projected to be the biggest mobile-shopping days of the year, said Adobe.One consequence of a ramp-up in retail digital wars, however, is that fewer people head into brick-and-mortar shops.Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins says the industry could see a ""significant slowdown"" in Black Friday foot traffic.Traffic fell in the mid-single to high-single-digits on Black Friday 2015, and retailers could see an equal or even greater decline this time around, he said, particularly as other shopping events during the year dilute the impact of the post-Thanksgiving sales day.Besides Cyber Monday and Super Saturday, the menu of existing shopping holidays has grown to include Amazon's Prime Day and even China-based Singles Day, among others.Foursquare's data are a little more optimistic; the company predicts a 3.5% year-over-year slide in Black Friday foot traffic, which would be ""far less severe"" than the prior year's figures.""The importance of Black Friday from a traffic (perspective) to brick-and-mortar stores is going to continue to decelerate,"" said Weishaar. ""With more people shopping online, the one specific day becomes less important.""IBD'S TAKE: Adobe data indicate that Black Friday sales will be the ""biggest ever,"" growing 11.3% from last year to $3.05 billion in sales. For a look at what else is happening this week, check out IBD's Investing Action Plan. Broadly speaking, inventory levels are cleaner in Q4, which translates to more targeted, strategic discounting instead of promotional wars, said Weishaar. But even in the absence of ""everything must go""-type sales, that doesn't mean that consumers shouldn't expect to see a whole lot of deals floating around.Which retail names will be winners this year?Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel pointed out in a recent note that execs at various retailers have alluded to a challenging, promotional holiday season. But there are gems to be found.""Although the election triggered a surprising sense of hope (and short squeezes), we believe much uncertainty remains and would rather buy quality companies that have lagged,"" he wrote, calling out Ulta Beauty (ULTA) as his top pick and noting that the recent Lululemon Athletica (LULU), HBI and Kate Spade (KATE) sell-offs look ""interesting.""Still shining is the off-price sector, as consumers remain hesitant about paying full retail for products and stores have a tough time escaping the ""always-on-sale"" cycle. Athletic wear also continues to dominate street fashion.Nike (NKE), TJX (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST) remain Siegel's long-term choices.Holiday shoppers, unconcerned about the fate of retail stores, will continue to like what they like.Millennials, who favor experiences over tangible goods, may not be retailers' favorite customers. But PwC research found that the teen set, Generation Z, likes ""stuff — and shopping in stores.""""To them, stuff matters,"" said the report. ""Stuff like personal electronics, clothes, shoes, and toys. Which is what they're hoping to receive this holiday season.""RELATED:Black Friday Is The New Cyber Monday: Wal-Mart Pushes Up Sale

185,JWN,"Retail sales rose 0.8% in October, the Commerce Department said Tuesday morning, providing fresh evidence of consumer strength. Retail stocks have rebounded after the election and heading into the holiday season, though many pulled back Tuesday.Sales also rose 0.8% excluding autos and 0.6% excluding autos and gasoline.Economists had expected retail sales to rise 0.6% with sales up 0.5% ex autos and 0.3% excluding autos and gasoline.Meanwhile, September figures were revised up, with total sales now up 1% vs. 0.6% initially. Ex auto sales were revised up two-tenths to 0.7%, whith ex auto and gas sales revised up two-tenths to 0.5%.Auto dealers, grocery stores, restaurants, apparel chains reported solid gains, with gas station sales jumping on higher fuel prices.Year over year, retail sales rose 4.3%, the best since November 2014.The recent gains in retail sales are a good sign for the U.S. economy and holiday shopping. And it comes amid big gains in retail stocks, though several notable retailers fell after reporting earnings Tuesday morning.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Home Depot (HD) and TJX (TJX) reported earnings before Tuesday's open. Home Depot and TJX topped views and raised their outlooks but fell nearly 2% in morning trade on the stock market today. TJX edged higher. Dick's Sporting Goods tumbled 7% on weak holiday guidance.Home Depot and TJX found resistance at the 200-day moving average on Monday, reversing to close down nearly 2%. Dick's nearly broke out of a base Monday, but that doesn't seem likely Tuesday.Department store sales fell once again in the retail sales report, but the department store stocks are rebounding from downtrends. Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) reported strong results, Macy's (M) missed but raised full-year guidance while JCPenney (JCP) gave generally weak results. But all four enjoyed double-digit gains last week, and continued to climb Monday. They pulled back on Tuesday, retreating 1%-3% in morning trade.E-commerce and other nonstore sales jumped 1.5% in October, the best gain since May. The sector has been a big retail leader for years. But Amazon (AMZN) shares have been selling off hard since reporting weaker-than-expected profit growth on Oct. 27. Amazon profit tripled (up 206%), but fell well short of views. Amazon also gave cautious holiday guidance.Amazon stock fell 2.7% Monday, approaching its 200-day line.

187,JWN,"Donald Trump's unexpected presidential win shook up global markets, triggering a major sector rotation. Alibaba (BABA) reported solid sales for Singles Day. Walt Disney sees better growth, but not until 2018, while most department stores generally see a positive holiday season while Nvidia (NVDA) led strong chip results.Stock futures crashed Tuesday night as Donald Trump won the presidential election, but rallied Wednesday as investors saw upside to his tax and infrastructure plans. Investors rushed into banks, drugs, materials-related stocks and out of big-name techs such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), as well as defensive consumer staples and gunmakers. The Dow soared 5.4% for the week, its best since December 2011, hitting a record high Thursday. The S&P 500 jumped 3.8%, its best week in two years, rebounding above its 50-day line. The Nasdaq also rose 3.8% but ended the week below its 50-day. Gold prices initially jumped on Trump's win but crashed  as stocks rallied, Treasury yields skyrocketed and Fed rate-hike expectations firmed. Copper prices boomed. Nvidia and Priceline (PCLN) were among leading stocks reporting strong results.Top chip companies Nvidia, Microchip Technology (MCHP), MaxLinear (MXL) and Microsemi (MSCC) saw their stocks rise after posting better-than-expected quarterly results. Graphics chipmaker Nvidia earned 84 cents a share, up 91% year over year, on sales of $2 billion, up 54%. Wall Street expected 57 cents and $1.69 billion. Nvidia also raised its Q4 sales target above views. Microchip EPS rose 42% and sales 56%. MaxLinear also topped views, though guidance was weak due to legacy-product declines. Nvidia shares skyrocketed 30% on Friday to a new high. For the week so far, Microchip rose 4.8%, MaxLinear 12% and Microsemi 9.7%.Walt Disney (DIS) missed fiscal Q4 estimates and warned that 2017 would be ""an anomaly"" in its growth arc, with the box-office-melting success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" making for a tough year-over-year comparison. But investors may already be looking to fiscal 2018, when Disney will release four Marvel movies and two more ""Star Wars"" films. Disney also said that the factors that have caused ESPN to lose subscribers ""have abated,"" and that the sports network would likely continue to grow as ESPN adapts to more digital platforms. Disney shares rose nearly 6% for the week so far.Macy's (M) missed Q3 estimates but cited strong results from Apple and Michael Kors (KORS) products that should continue in the current holiday quarter. (But luxury apparel maker Kors itself warned on its holiday sales). Macy's raised its full-year same-store sales forecast. Kohl's (KSS) reported Q3 EPS and revenue above expectations, with strong back-to-school and October sales that should continue into the holiday season. Nordstrom (JWN) crushed EPS growth estimates. The upscale department store operator raised its full year EPS guidance to $2.85-$2.95, well above Wall Street estimates. However, J.C. Penney (JCP) sales missed expectations and cut its sales forecast.But shares of all four retailers enjoyed double-digit percentage gains for the week.Priceline reported Q3 earnings and revenue that topped estimates, sending its shares to an all-time high. Priceline also said interim CEO Brett Keller is taking over as permanent chief executive, effective immediately. TripAdvisor (TRIP), a Priceline rival, reported weaker-than-expected Q3 revenue, sending shares falling.E-commerce giant Alibaba Group processed $17.8 billion worth of sales on China's biggest online shopping day of the year, known as Singles Day. That busted last year's record of $14.3 billion. But growth slowed to 24% from 60% last year. Alibaba takes a small percentage of sales for managing the transaction for vendors. Alibaba shares fell 1.4% Friday, extending a slide since late September.The Singles Day event towers over the U.S. shopping events known as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Black Friday last year had total sales of $4.5 billion, and Cyber Monday had $3 billion.Chinese online game maker and portal NetEase (NTES) earned $3.42 per U.S. share excluding items in the third quarter, up 47%. Sales rose 38% to $1.38 billion in Q3. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected NetEase to earn $2.89 per share excluding items on sales of $1.43 billion. Online games accounted for 71% of revenue. NetEase tumbled 3.6% for the week afternoon, falling significantly below its 50-day line for the first time since April.Gold prices skyrocketed Tuesday night as stock futures and the dollar initially tumbled on fears that a Trump win would spur massive selling and put the Fed on ice. But with stocks actually faring well and bond yields spiking, gold prices quickly reversed for a weekly loss of more than 6%, the worst since 2013. Gold mining stocks that retook some key technical levels went back down. Newmont Mining (NEM) fell 16%, Barrick Gold (ABX) 19%. Meanwhile, industrial miners rallied as Trump infrastructure plans lifted copper, other industrial metals and materials.China-based Momo (MOMO) reported Q3 earnings that beat estimates, which the company credited to its success with live video. The provider of a video streaming website and mobile social platform said revenue surged 319% to $157 million, soaring past estimates of $130.5 million. Momo sees Q4 revenue of $185 million-$190 million, above forecasts for $140.2 million.But Momo's stock, which initially rose to a new high, reversed sharply lower to trade down more than 8%.Acacia Communications (ACIA) late Thursday reported Q3 earnings minus items that rose 240% to $1.01, as revenue jumped 107% to $135.3 million. Analysts had modeled non-GAAP EPS of 81 cents and revenue of $130.8 million after Acacia revised guidance twice during the quarter. The maker of high-speed optical devices for communications networks sees adjusted EPS of 85-92 cents vs. views of 78 cents. But revenue of $138.5 million at the midpoint of its guidance is just above the consensus for $137.2 million. Acacia fell 1% Friday but rose 12.8% for the week.Fabrinet (FN) late Monday said fiscal Q1 EPS leapt 78% to 80 cents while revenue was up 53% to $332 million, its fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth. Both easily beat analyst estimates. Fabrinet also gave upbeat EPS and sales guidance for the current Q2. Fabrinet shares rose 8.9% for the week.Oil prices initially rose but closed down 1.5% to $43.41 a barrel — the third straight weekly slide — amid concerns about rising supply and weak demand. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has called for less regulation and more drilling for the U.S. industry, which could ultimately boost supply further. Weekly U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 2.43 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said, an increase that was above analyst expectations. OPEC said its October production hit a record high, adding doubts that it will finalize and implement a production-cut agreement. The International Energy Agency warned that sluggish economic growth will continue to weigh on oil demand, and ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its capital spending for next year.

Also keep an eye on shares of Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB).Political scores will finally be settled on Tuesday, when Americans vote. Stock indexes in the U.S. and elsewhere sold off over the past week as poll numbers showed Hillary Clinton's once-comfortable lead over Donald Trump shrinking or even disappearing. The S&P 500 dropped for eight consecutive sessions, marking its longest losing streak since the financial crisis in 2008.Some analysts believe that the possibility of a Trump victory still isn't fully priced into markets, suggesting a further dive if he wins Tuesday night. Results of House and Senate races will also determine how much gridlock the next president could face. But close calls in key battleground states may add another wrinkle, if any recounts delay a final result for the presidential contest.With the market uptrend under pressure and distribution days piling up, growth stocks presenting actionable buying opportunities have been few and far between.

Horton reports fiscal Q4 results on Tuesday and is expected to grow EPS by 26% to 77 cents with revenue up 20% to $3.67 billion. LGI Homes, which reports Q3 results on Tuesday, is expected to report EPS up 12% to 85 cents, with revenue rising 22% to $213.78 million. LGI Homes late Thursday said October home closings rose 33% vs. a year earlier. Year-to-date closings are up 24%.

191,JWN,"Retailers aren't a particularly highflying group right now, but it's perhaps worth keeping an eye on shares of Nordstrom (JWN) and Children's Place (PLCE) as both broke through resistance at their 10-day lines Thursday.The gains come despite mixed economic data Thursday. The Commerce Department reported August retail sales fell 0.3% from July, worse than forecasts for a 0.1% dip. But clothing stores saw a 0.7% gain, while general merchandise stores saw flat sales and department stores saw a 0.7% decline from July.Nordstrom stock rebounded off its 200-day lines and moved above the short-term 10-day average. Shares rose 4.6% to 51.70 on the stock market today, while rival Macy's (M) only saw a 1% uptick. Macy's also remains below its 50-day and 200-day lines.The high-end department store reported profit that exceeded expectations last month, with retailers broadly rallying on better-than-anticipated quarterly results.Meanwhile, kids clothing retailer Children's Place rose above its 10-day line and its 50-day. The stock was forming a cup-shaped base in the late spring and early summer, but failed to properly break out.Shares jumped 3.2% to 83.46.IBD's TAKE: Nordstrom cleared a 50.57 entry point Thursday, but the current market environment means that buys can be risky. To learn how to properly evaluate bases and times to buy, read IBD University's ""How To Buy Stocks.""IBD's Retail-Department Stores group, an 8-member segment that includes Nordstrom, Macy's, JCPenney (JCP) and others, is well off collective highs reached in April 2015.Children's Place is a member of IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which is collectively above its 200-day line and looking to find support at the 50-day.

192,JWN,"U.S. stock indexes returned to their upward path Thursday, ending three days of hesitant action. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.6%.

193,JWN,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) beat on both the top and bottom lines in its second quarter and raised full-year profit guidance -- so why are shares down Friday?The beauty retailer has consistently delivered strong numbers. In Q2, same-store sales growth accelerated to 14.4% from 13.9% in Q1, and up from 12.5% in Q4, 12.8% in Q3, and 10.1% a year earlier. Meanwhile, Gap (GPS) and department stores like Nordstrom (JWN) have posted negative comparable sales (-2% and -1.2%, respectively, in their most recent reports).The one blemish on Ulta's Q2 was the company's earnings guidance for Q3 -- a range of $1.25-$1.30 vs. consensus for $1.29 -- which might have dampened some enthusiasm.Still, Ulta's recent track record of outperforming retail peers has started to stir some disdain, at least online. But Zacks Research Equity Strategist Tracey Ryniec tweeted that some investor-commenters on StockTwits were ""getting more hostile"" amid Ulta's success ""because they don't 'get' the biz.""When asked whether it's male investors who aren't getting it, she replied:@IBD_elow Yes. They don't understand how it can be doing that well. But don't want to learn about it either.— Tracey Ryniec (@TraceyRyniec) August 25, 2016One male commenter acknowledged not getting Ulta's business, as he regretting missing out on its stock run.$ULTA Wish I'd invested in it ages ago. I look at it as a male and I think, ""how can so much money be spent on all this nonsense?"" #stocks— Hugh J. Robbins (@HughJRobbins) August 26, 2016Ulta shares were down 6.1% to 254.85 in the stock market today, undercutting their 50-day average for the first time since March. The stock is still up around 38% so far this calendar year.IBD'S TAKE: Got in on Ulta before this year's run but not sure if you should sell? IBD University has a few tips on when to take profits.The reaction from Wall Street analysts has been more positive. Nomura upped its Ulta price target to 287 from 244, and Cowen raised its target to 286 from 265 late Thursday following earnings, days after Piper Jaffray bumped up its target to 290 from 250.Lofty expectations appear to have gotten the better of Ulta on Friday, particularly as its previous three quarterly reports have prompted big gap-ups. And analysts note that high valuation is prompting some investor pushback.""We believe Street's high expectations were likely already priced into the shares ahead of the solid print, and we would be buyers on weakness,"" wrote Cowen's Oliver Chen, who has an outperform rating on the stock.Meanwhile, other Ulta metrics continue to shine. Its loyalty program grew about 28% to 20.6 million active members during the quarter, well ahead of other strong loyalty players such as Starbucks (SBUX), which has 12.3 million active U.S. and Canadian members at last count.RELATED:Ulta Beauty EPS Guidance Is Blemish On Priced-For-Perfection Stock

194,JWN,"Off-price earnings are scheduled for this week, with TJX (TJX) reporting early Tuesday, and off-price peer Ross Stores (ROST) slated to disclose results after the close on Thursday.A number of department-store retailers surprised the Street last week with earnings and revenue beats, so what can investors expect from the two major off-price stocks?The parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshall's and HomeGoods, TJX is expected to earn 81 cents in per-share profit, a 1% gain from the prior year. Revenue is seen growing nearly 7% to $7.85 billion.IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry group, which includes TJX, Ross Stores, Gap, Foot Locker (FL) and others, has been on a four-session win streak, collectively rising 4% since last Tuesday.While the off-price sector has generally been outperforming the broader bricks-and-mortar retail space, the Retail-Department Stores group is up 19% over the same time frame, on the backs of well-received results from Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) last week. Nordstrom did well on its off-price Nordstrom Rack stores.TJX shares briefly popped out of buy territory earlier Monday but are now back in the zone, dipping 0.1% to 82.77 by the close. The stock had broken out of a flat base with 79.30 entry point in mid-July.IBD'S TAKE: Several companies set to report this week are near buy points. For more on those stocks, read IBD's Investing Action Plan for Tuesday.Meanwhile: Ross Stores, which also operates DD's Discounts, is expected to grow per-share earnings by 6% to 67 cents on a 5% sales rise to $3.1 billion.Shares hit buy range in late July after building a 4-months-long flat base with 59.78 entry. But the stock is slightly overextended now past the range's 62.77 ceiling, closing at 63.22 on Monday.Among other retailers reporting this week: Gap (GPS), Urban Outfitters (URBN), American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB).

195,JWN,"The major market indexes hovered near the flat line early Friday as investors weighed disappointing economic data and earnings results continued to drive stock action, with Acacia (ACIA), Nordstrom (JWN) and Alibaba (BABA) scoring big gains.The Nasdaq, Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 fell less than 0.1%. Volume was mixed, tracking lower on the NYSE but higher on the Nasdaq vs. this time Thursday. The major averages are on track for wafer-thin weekly gains after all three hit record highs during the week.Telecom-fiber optics, oil and gold stocks were leading the upside in the stock market today, while banks, drugmakers and transport issues underperformed. West Texas Intermediate crude prices rose more than 1% to $44.04 a barrel.Baker Hughes' weekly oil drilling rig count is due out at 1 p.m. ET.Alibaba extended its win streak for a fifth straight session with a 3.5% jump to its highest level since May 2015. The Chinese e-commerce giant surged 5% Thursday after reporting fiscal Q1 results that beat views, thanks to strong mobile and cloud computing growth. Shares were well extended past an 86.52 buy point cleared Wednesday.Nordstrom gapped up and rose 9% in heavy trade, popping above its 200-day moving average for the first time in nearly a year. The upscale department store operator's earnings came in above views after the close Thursday.On the IBD 50, Acacia Communications gapped up to soar 34% to a new high in massive volume, following its Q2 earnings report late Thursday. Shares have more than tripled in price from their 23 offering price at the company's May 13 IPO.In economic news, producer prices dipped 0.4% in July, below June's 0.5% increase and forecasts for a 0.1% climb. Core prices, minus food and energy, slid 0.3% vs. June's 0.4% gain and views for a 0.3% advance.July retail sales were flat, below expectations for a 0.4% rise and down from June's upwardly revised 0.8% increase. Sales ex autos fell 0.3% vs.views for a 0.3% gain and June's 0.4% increase.

196,JWN,"JCPenney (JCP) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, providing further evidence that consumer spending isn't as bad as investors had feared.The department store reported a 5 cent per-share loss minus one-time items, narrowing from a 41 cent loss in the same quarter a year earlier, as JCPenney pushed ahead with a reorganization. Analysts expected a 15 cent loss. Revenue grew 1.4% to $2.92 billion, a bit below consensus for $2.93 billion. Comparable-store sales increased 2.2%.Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said in a client note after JCPenney earnings that it was ""the only positive comp"" among reporting department stores. Cowen has a market perform rating on JCPenney with a 10 price target.JCPenney Chairman and CEO Marvin Ellison, credited 60 more Sephora store-within-a-store cosmetics and beauty stops, center core refreshes and the rollout of ""buy online, pick up in store same day"" for lifting results. JCPenney stock has climbed 69% since hitting a 2016 low at 6 per share on Jan. 20, including an 8.6% gain Thursday. JCPenney rose 6% to 10.54 in the stock market today, a four-month high.On Thursday, Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) also beat on earnings, providing what Retail Metrics analyst Ken Perkins called ""rays of hope"" that the struggling retail sector may be bottoming. Macy's skyrocketed 17%, and Kohl's jumped 16% on Thursday, rebounding from recent and longer-term downtrends. On Friday, Macy's rose 2 cents to 39.83, while Kohl's climbed 1.7% to 44.95.Nordstrom (JWN) late Thursday reported better-than-expected profit, but revenue was a bit light. Still, Nordstrom rose 8.1% to 51.40 -- back above its 200-day line -- after soaring 7.5% Thursday.The upbeat reports are seen as part of a relief rally after many consumer-related companies, from General Motors (GM) to Ford (F) to McDonald's (MCD), reported sluggish U.S. demand.IBD'S TAKE: JCPenney shares are climbing the right side of a cup base with a 12.09 entry point. Cup and cup-with-handle bases are among the most common patterns stocks form. For more on how to spot winning bases, see the IBD University.Overall retail sales were flat in July, with non-auto sales down 0.3%, the Commerce Department said Friday. July's total was well under estimates of a 0.4% gain. However, June's gain was revised up to 0.8% from the initial 0.6% reading.

197,JWN,"The major averages ended little-changed near record highs Friday after weak retail sales and producer price data tempered investor sentiment.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.2%, and the S&P 500 edged down 0.1%. The Nasdaq eked out a 0.1% gain.Volume in the stock market today was mixed, rising about 10% on the NYSE, but falling a fraction on the Nasdaq compared to Thursday, according to preliminary data.Telecom stocks broke out of the stock market's doldrums, led by IBD 50 issue Acacia Communications (ACIA), which rocketed 41% after a blowout quarterly earnings report announced after the close Thursday.Acacia, a maker of high-speed interconnect modules for internet cloud infrastructure, went public in May and has doubled after clearing a 45.85 buy point of an IPO base in early July.Lumentum (LITE) climbed nearly 3%. The provider of optical communications products for the telecommunications and other industries recently rose 20% past a 28.01 buy point of a 15-week consolidation. Those who bought at the breakout should consider selling at least some shares, as growth stocks tend to correct after rising more than 20% past their buy points.Chinese e-commerce website Alibaba (BABA) was another big mover, soaring 7% in heavy volume and adding to Thursday's 5% jump following a strong quarterly earnings report.The stock is now well out of buying range from a 85.10 buy point of an odd-shaped cup-with-handle base.Department stores had another good day despite a government report showing retail sales were flat in July, trailing expectations for a 0.4% gain.JCPenney (JCP) jumped 6% in heavy volume after reporting a much lower-than-expected loss of 5 cents a share in the latest quarter. Sales edged up 1% to $2.9 billion after slipping 1% the prior quarter.High-end department store Nordstrom (JWN) continued to climb after a better-than-expected earnings report Wednesday. It rose 8%, capping an 18% gain for the week.In other economic news, producer prices unexpectedly fell 0.4% last month amid cheaper oil prices. Weak inflation puts pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low.Vipshop Holdings (VIPS), Fabrinet (FN), Home Depot (HD) and TJX (TJX) are among companies due to report quarterly earnings in the coming week.Economic reports due out next week include the Empire State Manufacturing Index for August and the consumer price index and industrial production data for July.
"
198,JWN,"Even with Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day, retail sales were merely flat in July, with non-auto sales down 0.3%, the Commerce Department said Friday.While July's totals came in well below expectations for an overall 0.4% gain, and a 0.2% rise outside the auto sector, the disappointment was softened by an upward revision to June numbers. The overall gain was revised to 0.8% from 0.6%, with sales outside autos rising 0.9%, up from 0.7%.Still, the year-over-year gain in retail sales slowed to 2.3%, which may slightly ding confidence in the strength of the American consumer. While a 2.7% drop in gas station sales held down July spending, consumers didn't put the money to work elsewhere.Non-store retailers continued to stand out, with sales rising 1.3% on the month and 14.1% on the year. That was surely helped by Amazon's 24-hour sales event for Prime members. Amazon said Prime orders in the U.S. surged 50% from the company's inaugural event in 2015, but it didn't reveal its sales tally.But efforts by Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and others to piggyback or cut into Amazon's big day may have fallen flat. General merchandise store sales dipped 0.1%, while department stores saw sales continue to decline, off 0.5% on the month and down 4.0% from a year earlier.Both Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) slightly beat modest revenue expectations on Thursday, while Nordstrom (JWN) saw a much smaller drop in same-store sales than analysts expected. All three companies saw sales drop from a year earlier. JCPenney (JCP), a relative bright spot, said on Friday that same-store sales rose 2.2% from a year before, about as expected.IBD'S TAKE: While the consumer continues to be the main driver of U.S. economic growth, most retailers have underperformed the stock market because the retail sector is overbuilt and online competition is intense. Watch this IBD Video for tips on how to quickly identify and research leading stocks that may be ready to be bought.July is typically a slow month for retail before the back-to-school season kicks in, so it's possible the sales push could lead to an upside surprise. Two unknowns: Will Prime Day sales by Amazon and competitors eat into back-to-school shopping, and how will July sales look on a seasonally adjusted basis? The latter may depend on how much the Commerce Department has adjusted its seasonal models after last year's Prime Day.Building-materials and garden-equipment retailers like Home Depot (HD) saw sales ease 0.5% after an upwardly revised 4.2% surge in June. Home Depot and rival Lowe's (LOW) will report quarterly earnings next week.Sales at food services and drinking places continued to be soft, falling 0.2% after an upwardly revised 0.3% rise in June. The problem cited by McDonald's (MCD) and multiple industry players is that food at home is looking like an unusually good deal relative to the cost of food away from home. On Wednesday, Wendy's (WEN) scaled back same-store sales growth guidance for 2016 from 3% to a range of 1%-2%.

199,JWN,"Analysts changed their minds on a number of stocks Monday, including Nike (NKE), Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN) and Qualcomm (QCOM). Acacia Communications (ACIA) and new issue Coupa Software (COUP) both received fresh attention as well.Bank of America downgraded the athletic apparel giant to underperform from neutral, citing competition from Under Armour (UA) and Adidas abroad, according to Seeking Alpha.Shares fell 3.5% to 50.18 at the close on the stock market today, falling to their lowest level since August 2015.Deutsche Bank handed Macy's an upgrade to buy but cut Nordstrom's rating to hold on Monday. Analysts at the bank believe Macy's can increase profit margins through the end of next year, according to CNBC, but are concerned about Nordstrom's valuation.Department store stocks, as well as shares of many specialty retailers, have been choppy amid ongoing concerns about the health of the retail environment.Macy's shares rose 2.6% to 36.49 while Nordstrom fell 1.3% to 52.The chipmaker was upgraded to buy by Nomura, which cited benefits from its recently announced acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) -- in particular a 30% per-share profit boost to $6 in 2018, an accretion that will be ""too substantial for investors to ignore,"" according to the note acquired by StreetInsider.Nomura raised its Qualcomm price target to 80 from 55.Qualcomm rose 0.5% to close at 68.72.William Blair initiated coverage on the fiber optic stock, giving it an outperform rating.Shares of the May IPO are still well above their IPO price of 23 a share but are downtrending from a 128.73 peak in September and have remained below their 50-day line since early October.Acacia dropped 2.2% to 69.69 at the close.Wall Street initiated coverage on the software company, which started trading on Oct. 6, with a neutral rating from JPMorgan, equal weight from both Barclays and Morgan Stanley, plus outperforms from RBC Capital Markets and JMP Securities.Shares haven't yet retaken their first-day high of 41.61 but remain well above their 18 new issue price.Coupa fell 1.3% to close at 25.RELATED:Qualcomm Inks Deal To Buy NXP For $39 BillionAcacia Communications Hammered On Customer ZTE's Sales MissCoupa Software Doubles, Giving Another Big Boost To IPO Market

200,JWN,"More than 9 million posts on Facebook's (FB) Instagram get the hashtag #selfiesunday, 6 million-plus are marked #selfienation, about 275 million are tagged #selfie, and 302 million are simply tagged #me.So is it any surprise that products like Make Up For Ever's ""Ultra HD"" foundation, Temptu's airbrush foundation kits, or Pur Cosmetics' ""Love Your Selfie"" palette exist?""Millennials have a mindset of being 'selfie-ready,'"" Piper Jaffray analyst Steph Wissink told Investor's Business Daily. That has helped drive lip and eye products to become two of the best-performing cosmetic categories for the last three years, she says, highlighting that the beauty sector's growth tracks ""almost exactly"" with the rise of smartphones and mobile devices.Camera-friendly cosmetics — once the realm of news anchors and movie stars — are now mainstays at specialty beauty stores Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora. But as Amazon (AMZN) continues to suck up more dollars from consumers, brick-and-mortar chains are increasingly latching on to the social media-driven fire for cosmetics and skin care products, which are proving to be a glimmer of hope for a surprising range of shops trying to lure Instagram-savvy shoppers.Last year, cosmetics, skin care and fragrance made up a $37.7 billion market in the U.S. vs. $266.8 billion in apparel and footwear sales, according to Euromonitor research. But beauty has been the fastest-growing retail segment for at least the last three years, outpacing apparel, footwear, food, in addition to being one of the fastest-growing segments online, said NPD Group analyst Karen Grant.Echoing that trend, Ulta continues to crank out double-digit same-store sales gains — 14.4% in its most recent quarter — while the Gap (GPS) and Macy's (M) each posted comps of negative 2% in their latest reports, while Nordstrom (JWN) reported a 1.2% decline. Their respective stocks have followed the diverging sales trajectories as well.IBD'S TAKE: Robust and reliable growth appeals to institutional investors, so it's not surprising that Ulta has seen eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, four typically better-performing mutual funds have reported a position in the stock.The major chains have taken notice, and are looking for a makeover with some social-media flair.Retail icon Macy's, which by Cowen & Co.'s estimates will be overtaken by Amazon next year as the biggest U.S. clothing seller, is planning to open more in-store locations of luxury beauty retailer Bluemercury, a 2015 acquisition, and is expanding its brand assortment beyond traditional prestige names to include smaller labels.And for any shoppers who bought $35 in Rampage accessories, the nation's largest department store also recently offered a free selfie stick.""Beauty is the new hoodie, in terms of being a product that works well with social media,"" said Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, noting that retailers are looking for categories that are less vulnerable to promotions and unseasonable weather. ""You can't deny the power of social media. On average, someone will spend over 15 hours a week on social media.""Social media help shape and stimulate new trends, he added, as well as educate others about those trends. Makeup lovers now scour Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube for contouring tips and skim hashtags for brow-shaping tutorials from the seemingly endless parade of self-appointed beauty gurus with a domain name and an Instagram account.Department store beauty counters remain a fixture but are in particular danger of losing relevance in this digital age. NPD Group said that compared to two years ago, 11% more women are doing cosmetics product research online.By the time the customer enters the store, she's frequently past the product research stage, says Wissink. ""She walks in, she says 'I need palette 212,' and (the salesperson) goes 'Wait a second, don't you want to see our lip, our eye (products)?'""The social-media driven shift in habits means retail heavyweights have to enhance the store experience. In fact, chains that previously had no service aspect are adopting in-house experts to guide customers through the beauty aisle.For example, CVS Health (CVS) now has in-store beauty consultants and last year upgraded its makeup and skin care offerings in a few thousand locations. In its August earnings call, CEO Larry Merlo said the drugstore chain was focused on shifting its assortment toward health, beauty and store brands, all of which are higher-margin segments.And Target (TGT) features a ""beauty concierge,"" clad entirely in black and available to answer questions about the big-box retailer's brands.""It's meant to create retail theater,"" said Wissink, noting that customers ""crave that tactile in-store experience.""Shoppers enjoy sampling new products in store, and the quest for a Holy Grail blush can become a day out with the girls. In the process, it's not uncommon to snap a selfie and send it to a friend — or to Twitter (TWTR) followers — for immediate feedback.For their part, premium brands like Estee Lauder and Clinique are loosening their grip on exclusivity as they accept that shoppers like to sample different brands from a variety of retailers.They've broadened their distribution to specialty retailers like Ulta and lower-tier department stores like J.C. Penney (JCP), which nixed creating a whole new in-store beauty experience in lieu of bringing in an already-successful titan: Sephora.Its in-store Sephora locations were among the department store's top-performing divisions, the company said in its Q2 earnings release in August, and there are plans for more Sephora shop-in-shops to drive beauty-revenue growth.""Seems like everyone's trying to get a piece of that pie,"" said FBR analyst Susan Anderson. ""It's working, at least for Sephora and Ulta, so everyone jumps on the bandwagon.""And as beauty products increasingly drive traffic to stores, chains that traditionally haven't sold them are now testing them out.A Barnes & Noble store seems like a peculiar place to open up a beauty counter, but it may be inclined to seize trends early, given that Amazon laid waste to book sellers.The Glossary, as it is cleverly called, is a college-focused shop-in-shop stocked full of makeup and skin care products from Smashbox, Burt's Bees and other millennial-friendly brands, not far from the Jane Austen paperbacks and math textbooks needed to survive freshman year. Barnes & Noble College — a subsidiary of Barnes & Noble Education (BNED) -- has rolled out the pilot program at a handful of locations, including Emory University, Southern Methodist University and the University of California at Riverside.""(It's) similar to what they did a few years ago with coffee shops,"" said NPD's Grant. Barnes & Noble wants shoppers ""to browse, to know that they can hang out."" After all, the longer retailers can get customers to stay in the store, she said, the better the chances of them buying something.Apparel stores like Urban Outfitters (URBN) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) are also cultivating nascent beauty offerings. Teen retailers have broadly been trying to reconfigure their identities now that their millennial consumer base has grown up and out of midaughts trends.Urban's curated ""Back-to-School Beauty"" collection showcases a small mix of products, including trendy Korean brand Tonymoly and uberhip Milk Makeup. (Besides select Urban Outfitters, the only other place to buy Milk in a store is Sephora.) In its mid-August earnings call, Urban Outfitters management called out the strength of its beauty segment, as well as its home and intimates divisions.American Eagle's foray into the beauty space has been more hesitant, though it may have more up its sleeve. Its Aerie Global Brand President Jennifer Foyle noted in American Eagle's May earnings call that the company has assembled a team ""to venture into the beauty business, but we are going to walk before we run."" It, too, sells Tonymoly face masks, plus some assorted Aerie-branded lotions and body washes.Rolling out new display cases is one thing, but building up a healthy following on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram is another.Out of all of its department store brethren, Nordstrom has the strongest social presence, with 2.1 million Instagram followers to Bloomingdales' paltry 608,000 and J.C. Penney's 300,000 follower count. It was one of the first major companies to incorporate Like2Buy into its Instagram profile, allowing customers to click through and buy the pictured products.All of them pale in comparison to Sephora's 8.8 million followers and Ulta Beauty's 2.4 million Instagram devotees. Still, the department stores are seeing progress at the cash register.Nordstrom's summer ""Glam-Out Days"" offered free makeup tips and services during its yearly ""anniversary sale"" event. According to Piper Jaffray research, beauty products had the highest sellout rate during the promotional period, with 51% of Nordstrom's makeup and skin care products selling out, up from 30% last year and 8% in 2014.""One of the things that makes beauty important within department stores is (that) it's a gateway,"" said Grant. ""It helps the retailer attract other consumers, whether it's apparel or footwear. One of the things they've used the beauty space to do is carve out new consumers or drive traffic through the rest of the store.""RELATED:Beauty's A Hot Industry, But Does That Make E.L.F.

201,JWN,"The stock market saw mild morning losses expand a bit by lunchtime on Friday, but the decline masked a nice rebound by leaders in the brick-and-mortar space. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) continued to struggle in the wake of bearish commentary by Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 slipped around 0.6%, while the NYSE composite fell 0.7%, hurt by sharp losses in aerospace, steel, paint, meat-product and toy stocks. Small caps slid harder; the Russell 2000 was off more than 1%. Volume was mildly lower on both exchanges vs. the same time Thursday.Airplane-components giant TransDigm (TDG) dropped nearly 2% to 280.73 and slid further below its 50-day moving average in volume running quadruple average trade. Failure to hold above the 50-day line would result in a sell signal; the stock initially broke out of a long saucer with handle at 233.87 on May 10.TransDigm is falling in sympathy with Honeywell (HON), a former Dow 30 component that is on pace for a weekly drop of more than 9% after issuing weak sales and profit guidance for the full year. The stock, at 105.95 is trading below the 40-week moving average for the first time since early March.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5%, seeing drops of 1 point or more in at least six of its 30 component stocks including Home Depot (HD). The home improvement chain giant has struggled to rebound back above its 200-day moving average since crashing below it on Sept. 9.Tesla, the big stock market winner in 2013 to 2014, fell more than 1% to 197.33 in heavy volume. While the leader in all-electric vehicles failed to surpass upside resistance at the 200-day moving average, it also isn't giving up much ground considering that the stock is still above recent lows of 187.87 in late June and 193.45 on Sept. 13. Watch to see if the stock can find support near the 200 price level.Tesla's RS Rating of 12, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, continues to be terrible since it reflects the stock's poor action over the past 12 months vs. all other companies in IBD's database. Meanwhile, Tesla's 50-day moving average has crossed back below the slower-moving 200-day moving average, a bearish sign.Tesla is still forecast to report its first profit in eight quarters when it releases third-quarter results, likely in early November. The Street on consensus expects earnings of 7 cents a share, but the range of estimates of 15 analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters varies widely, from a net loss of 46 cents to a net profit of 60 cents.On the upside, Nordstrom (JWN) defied the skeptics of mall-based retail selling, rallying more than 1% to 54.58 for a fourth straight gain.The stock is still more than 30% below an all-time high of 77.65, yet it's certainly on the verge of snuffing out a shorter-term downtrend. Notice how the stock has traded relatively tightly for six weeks, forming a long handle on a long, deep cup base. While the stock is still nearly 22% below a 52-week high near 70, aggressive traders could consider an entry point at 53.81, 10 cents above the long handle that recently formed.Nordstrom is likely gaining ground on upbeat earnings guidance for the third quarter from clothing rival Gap (GPS). Gap stores tend to be in the same mall locations that are anchored by large department store operators such as Nordstrom and Macy's (M).Gap gapped up in price, rising more than 14% to 26.17 in whale-like volume to jump back on the north side of its 50- and 200-day lines. It too is trying to fashion a bottoming-style base pattern since hitting a multiyear peak of 46.85 back in September 2014.RELATED:What Is A Bottoming Base?

202,JWN,"U.S. stock indexes suffered routine losses Friday afternoon as the market neared its final hour of trade.The Nasdaq slouched 0.2%, while the S&P 500 matched that loss. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was flat, but the small cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.7%. Volume in the stock market today was running slightly higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq.The Dow Jones utility average delivered one of the day's better gains, up 0.6%. A weaker than expected payrolls report might have helped the dividend-paying utilities, but the utilities were also due for some kind of rebound.Consolidated Edison (ED) had dropped 10 sessions in a row, making Friday's gain a trivial triumph. Southern Co. (SO) fell nine sessions in a row, and it too rose Friday. The two utilities rose about 2% and 1% respectively but then reversed to nominal gains.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, five of the day's nine top gainers were from retail or the related apparel makers groups.Gap (GPS), the owner of the namesake and Old Navy chains, thrust 15% as it retook its 200-day and 50-day lines in huge volume. September sales were a bit more than expected. Francesca's (FRAN), another retailer in the same apparel/shoes group, popped 2%. The stock cleared a 16.30 buy point in an awkward pattern. Volume was below average.Other retailers doing well included department store Nordstrom (JWN), which added to Thursday's breakout; Best Buy (BBY), which climbed closer to an entry in a flat base; apparel maker PVH Corp. (PVH), which padded a recent breakout; and big box retailer PriceSmart (PSMT), which advanced 3% as it tries to build the right side of a pattern.On the downside, the day's worst performer was Food-Meat Products. Allegations that the poultry industry conspired since 2007 to fix prices rattled the group. Tyson Foods (TSN) dropped 9%; Sanderson Farms (SAFM), 6%; and Pilgrim's Pride (PPC), 5%.RELATEDU.S. Added Just 156,000 Jobs In September; Won't Change FedOil Rig Count Rises, But Texas Plays See Dips

203,JWN,"The overall 0.6% bounceback in retail sales last month comes with a caveat: Total spending looked healthy, but much of the gain came in categories that may not drive growth going forward.A core measure of goods spending that strips out restaurants, cars and gas, as well as building materials, rose just 0.1% in September. That was well below the 0.4% gain expected by economists and came after a 0.1% decline in this broad ""control group"" category of retail spending.Sales at electronics and appliance stores like Best Buy (BBY) remained a sore spot. Despite the midmonth launch of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7, seasonally adjusted sales fell 0.9% from August and 3.8% from a year ago. Best Buy shares fell 1.3% on the stock market today but are still near 52-week highs. Apple is near 2016 highs amid strong initial iPhone 7 demand and rival Samsung's overheating problems with its Note 7, which finally prompted the company to end sales and production of the smartphone.Slumping demand for PCs and printers led Hewlett-Packard (HP) on Thursday to announce a gradual reduction of 3,000 to 4,000 jobs. Electronics retailers also are being squeezed by the likes of Amazon (AMZN). Nonstore retailers saw September sales rise 0.3% from August after a 0.1% dip the prior month. Though online sales momentum has cooled a bit in the past few months, nonstore retailers still are posting double-digit year-over-year gains — 10.6% in September.Department store sales slid 0.7% from August and 6.4% from a year ago. Some of the slide reflects store closures. Still, analysts at Sterne Agee downgraded shares of Macy's (M) to neutral from buy on Friday, noting a slowdown in same-store sales growth. JPMorgan cut price targets and Q3 estimates on Macy's, JCPenney (JCP), Kohl's (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN) and Dillard's (DDS).Macy's, Kohl's shares fell about 3% Friday while Dillard's skidded 4.6%. Kohl's and Nordstom fell fractionally.Everything to do with the housing market shined in September. Sales at building materials and garden equipment stores like Home Depot (HD) surged 1.4% from August, more than reversing a 0.8% decline the prior month. Meanwhile, furniture store sales rose 1.0% from August and 2.7% from a year ago.Home Depot shares rose 0.1%.One of the surprises in the retail report was the strong gain in spending at food service and drinking places, up 0.8% from August, when sales rose 0.7%. Sales have moderated on a year-over-year basis to 6.1% from the 8%-plus pace that prevailed for most of 2015. Still, the gains over the past two months are a pleasant surprise given that McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN), Jack in the Box (JACK) and others have cited pressure from the growing cost gap between eating in and eating out.McDonald's stock fell 1.1%, while Wendy's and Jack in the Box rose fractionally.IBD'S TAKE: The Retail-Restaurants industry group is ranked in the lower tier by IBD, No. 113 out of 197 based on share performance. Investors will generally have more success buying leaders in top-tier groups, when the market trend is favorable. Sill, Papa Johns and Dunkin' Brands, are close to buy points and worth watching. Go to IBD Stock Checkup to find out why they're the two top stocks in the group.September restaurant sales data out Thursday from TDn2K covering 25,000 locations shed further light on industry trends. Overall, same-store sales fell 1.1% from a year ago in September, while customer traffic slumped 3.5%. The sector is on pace for its worst performance since 2009.Still, overall sales are performing better than same-store sales because of continued industry expansion, and the quick-service industry is doing a whole lot better than the rest, growing same-store sales 2.2% from a year ago in the third quarter, Nation's Restaurant News reported.On Friday, Bank of America analysts upgraded Domino's Pizza (DPZ) to buy from underperform, noting that the research firm expects 10.4% U.S. same-store sales growth in the third quarter. Domino's reports on Tuesday before the open. Domino's rose 0.5%.Auto sales jumped 1.1% in September, as U.S. vehicle sales rose to a 17.76 million annual rate from 17 million the prior month. Sales of higher-margin pickups and SUVs outperformed at Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), helping offset their unit sales declines vs. a year ago.""The decline in gasoline prices relative to a year ago is likely to continue to support SUV sales,"" wrote Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons. ""Nonetheless, overall vehicle sales are at a level that may be close to a ceiling.""Ford shares closed unchanged. GM rallied 1.1% and Fiat Chrysler shares 2.3%.Gas station sales helped pump up the overall retail sales gain, rising 2.4% from August. McCarthy and Simons noted that the big rise was based on seasonal adjustments: Gas prices fell in 0.8% in September, but they usually fall 2.8% during the month after the peak summer driving season.RELATED:Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

204,JWN,"One of the first things Fred Fern learned about the stock market was how little he actually knew about the market. Around 1960, soon after graduating from college, Fern bought shares in IBM (IBM) on the advice of a friend's father, who was a broker.It cost him about $20,000, a king's ransom for the young man back then. ""I did it because I was young and I thought I had all of the answers,"" he said.The hammer dropped in December 1961. In the bear market that mauled investors for six months, shares of Big Blue fell by almost 50%. ""I realized how little I knew,"" said Fern. ""I wanted to learn more.""That he did, and then some. Fern is now the 78-year-old CEO and chairman of Churchill Management Group and of Chartwell Properties, a business that invests in commercial real estate, both based in Los Angeles. Churchill, a registered investment advisory (RIA) firm, has about 5,000 clients and $3.9 billion in assets under management, plus another $109 million under advisement for clients who execute their own trades or use their own brokers.Fern founded Churchill in 1963. He has been in the top 10 on Barron's list of the Top 100 Independent Advisors for six years in a row, including the No. 1 rank this year.From his office in Los Angeles, Fern discussed his career and approach to investing with IBD.IBD: How did you get started in the business, Fred?Fern: Believe it or not, I grew up in L.A. My parents bought a home next door to John Wayne. I don't know if it cost much money. I had a friend whose father was a broker with one of the big firms. He had me push what little money I had into IBM, which was already a blue chip, in the Dow, a leader in computers and would take over the computer world.In late 1961, a bear market set in after JFK (President Kennedy) attacked the steel companies. (Kennedy was angry with steel makers that reneged on a wage deal with workers that JFK had helped to broker.) The market dropped and stayed down for six months. I realized I needed to learn more about the market.IBD: How did you go about doing that?Fern: I went to a market seminar. The speaker really seemed to know his business. He wasn't the typical guy just trying to get new business. He talked about how stocks behaved. He had studied Bernard Baruch (a financier and investor who had advised presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt) and Gerald Loeb (an investor who was a founder of brokerage E.F. Hutton), and he spoke about everything from investing to charity.IBD: Was the speaker from Texas?Fern: Yes.IBD: I think I can guess who he was, Fred. Continue your story, please.Fern: Of course, it was Bill O'Neil, who founded your newspaper, IBD. At that time, he worked for the brokerage Hayden, Stone. After the seminar, I asked him if he would become my broker, and he said yes. I explained that I didn't want to just invest, I wanted to understand the market.IBD: How did O'Neil's advice work out for you, Fred?Fern: I did pretty well in the later half of 1962. In the spring of 1963 he called and told me there was a stock with a perfect pattern. It had gone from 15 to 30, built a perfect flag base and was breaking out. It turned out to be the greatest fundamental story of our lives. It was a company called Syntex, and it (was one of the companies that) invented the contraceptive pill. It revolutionized life. The stock went from 30 to 190.IBD'S TAKE: Smart investing rules pave the way to success for both financial pros and individual investors. For extensive information on how to invest, including finding great stocks to buy, timing the market and when to sell stocks, visit our IBD University section, or go to our Stock Lists section for ideas on stocks worth considering now (subscription or free trial required).IBD: And how did you end up as a financial advisor?Fern: I was in my twenties. Bill was four or five years older. Now that I had made all of this money, I thought I had all of the answers. Long story short, I wanted to set up as an investment advisor. I wanted to do the right thing for clients.IBD: How did you start your business?Fern: I was talking with John Wayne's oldest son, Michael. He was a friend and neighbor. He told me to name the company after Winston Churchill. I asked him why. He said, you're a history buff now. And Churchill helped save the free world. What could be more reliable? And Chartwell was the name of one of Churchill's homes.I set up my office with a card table and two chairs. It was at the corner of Beverly Drive and Wilshire Boulevard in the heart of Beverly Hills. I was on the sixth floor. You know how I sum up the whole story? It's called America.IBD: What's the most important element of your success?Fern: Bill O'Neil gave me a book that described crowd psychology. It described how the crowd is wrong when it gets too extreme. I did not want to repeat my experience with IBM falling in value for my clients. And I learned from Bill O'Neil that you must have a stop-loss policy. Bill had a guru on the technical side of the market, who recommended that I study the market on a daily basis going back to World War II. I made charts, and I still have those charts in my chart room. I learned from Bill to follow technical, fundamental and sentiment factors.IBD: I gather you've incorporated those lessons into your investment approach, aiming to grow clients' capital in favorable markets and protecting principal in higher risk environments. Describe your investment approach in more detail, please.Fern: On weekends I look at charts. We look for the ones with the strongest relative strength, cup with handles (and other basing patterns) and strong fundamentals.Then on Monday we narrow down our pool to the ones that are best, that look like leaders. We make sure they have a strong business formula. We check for fundamental, technical and sentiment factors.Every week, we rate our stocks 1 through 10, based on where the market is in a cycle. It takes a rating of 7 through 10 to get into a portfolio, 1 to 3 to be sold. Most are between 4 and 6. We follow CAN SLIM rules quite closely.IBD: What are some of your top holdings?Fern: Facebook (FB). We also have a partial position in Amazon (AMZN). That's a great story, but very overvalued at this point. They lead the world in taking over the retail side of the economy. They're hurting Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN).IBD: What sets your approach apart from what other advisors do?Fern: So many (other advisors) have a short-term mentality. You must take a longer view. Most firms have a formula that comes from bright guys who are strong on fundamentals, or maybe even on technicals. But you've got to put the two pieces together.IBD: Why are you different?Fern: I don't know how good I am, but I sure am lucky. I met a guy named William O'Neil early.I found his formula and common sense. He studied history. If not for him, I doubt I would have gone into investment advice. Remember, in the 1960s, the business was dominated by full-service brokerages.IBD: What aspects of Mr. O'Neil's investment strategy are most important to you?Fern: Several things. One is how history repeats itself. Another is how you've got to have discipline. A third is the importance of keeping your losses small. That sums it up. I know he is in love with this place called America, and I am right behind him.RELATED:Wanna Be A Successful Advisor?

205,JWN,"Stocks maintained solid gains in late morning trade Thursday, led by Macy's (M) and other department stores.The Nasdaq was up 0.4% and the S&P 500 rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.6% in the stock market today, hitting a fresh all-time high. Volume was mixed, trading higher than the same time Wednesday on the NYSE, while the Nasdaq was trading lighter.Macy's gapped up 17% after it reported second-quarter earnings of 54 cents a share, a 16% decline from a year earlier but still beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of 48 cents. Sales came in at $5.87 billion, besting estimates of $5.77 billion.The company also announced that it would close 100 stores out of 728, mostly by early 2017, and that it will heighten its brand with exclusive products and will improve the shopping experience, as well as promote its digital business.IBD'S TAKE: Are department store stocks worth the investment? Find out with IBD's Stock Checkup.Department store stocks have been laggards in recent years as consumers turned to online purchasing, and all the stocks are well off their highs.Macy's earnings beat was infectious: Nordstrom (JWN), JCPenney (JCP) and Target (TGT) were all higher, even though they haven't reported yet.Nordstrom reports after the close Thursday. Analysts expect 56 cents a share, a 40% decline from a year earlier. Penney reports Friday morning, and Target reports Wednesday.The department store group was one of the day's best performers out of 197 indusries, with a gain of 9%. Several other retail and consumer groups rose sharply.Alibaba (BABA), which gapped out of a consolidation Wednesday, jumped another 5% Thursday after reporting better-than-expected earnings of its own.

206,JWN,"Department stores staged a tight little rally Thursday after Q2 earnings surprises from Kohl's (KSS) and Macy's (M). Kohl's spiked 16% after a 14% EPS gain and despite a 2% slip in revenue; both topped analysts' consensus estimates. Macy's paraded out an 17% gain, as EPS and revenue slipped less than projected and the company announced that it would close 100…
"
207,JWN,"Stock indexes chugged ahead Thursday afternoon, as strength in the retail and apparel sectors aided the market.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.8%, hitting fresh all-time highs after consolidating for three weeks. The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, also setting a new record. The Nasdaq rose 0.6%, just below its peaks. Volume was running narrowly lower on the NYSE but much lower on the Nasdaq in the stock market today.The S&P 500's biggest gainers came from the retail and apparel sectors. Macy's (M) surged 17%; Kohl's (KSS) rose 16.5%; Nordstrom (JWN) climbed 7%; Ralph Lauren (RL) added nearly 6%; and Under Armour (UA) was also up 5%.Macy's, Kohl's results were not great, but they topped Wall Street's consensus earnings estimate by margins of 18% to 20%, a day after Ralph Lauren did the same. Nordstrom will report after the close. Under Armour reported in late July and matched estimates. Macy's also said it will close 100 stores.None of the stocks is top-rated. The department stores and apparel groups are market laggards. Under Armour has the best earnings rating of the five -- its EPS Rating is 72, which means about 28% of the stocks in IBD's database are growing earnings faster than Under Armour.Despite the weak ratings, the retail and apparel groups are relevant. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of overall U.S. economic activity.On Friday, the Commerce Department will report retail sales for July. The consensus estimate is for a 0.4% increase. Wall Street's estimates range from 0.2% to 0.7%. If the report is positive, it will be the fourth consecutive month of improvement. The report for June came in at 0.6%, easily topping the Street's consensus estimate for 0.1%.Recently, retail sales reports around the world have favored the optimists.In Britain, retail sales in July increased 1.1% vs. the year-earlier period, defying those who said the exit from the European Union would act as a depressant. The July sales pop, which was reported Tuesday, was the biggest in six months.Brazil, which is in a recession, reported Tuesday that retail sales inched up 0.1% in June. While the gain was tiny, most economists expected a drop. Consumer confidence and business confidence have been climbing since Michel Temer, the acting president, took over in May. Temer is seen as more business-friendly than recent presidents in Brazil have been. Deposed president Dilma Rousseff, a leftist, faces an impeachment trial.On Wednesday, Hong Kong's largest mall operator, Wharf Holdings, said revenue jumped 12% in the past six months. This was rare good news on Hong Kong's retail front. A downturn in tourism has hammered Hong Kong retailers. On Aug. 2, the South China Morning Post reported that retail sales skidded 10.5% in the first half of this year. Q2 retail sales, however, improved compared with Q1.

IBD's Retail-Department Stores industry group soared 13% for the week as earnings lifted names like J.C. Penney (JCP), Nordstrom (JWN), Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS).

209,JWN,"U.S. stocks kept to a narrow range Friday afternoon, as the major indexes edged down in mixed volume.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each trimmed 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.3%. Volume in the stock market today was running lower on both major exchanges vs. the previous session's pace.Blue chips were mostly down. In the Dow, losers led winners by a 4-to-1 ratio. The biggest winner in the Dow was Exxon Mobil (XOM), up 1.4% in below-average volume. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures popped 1.5% to $44.16.The biggest loser in the Dow was DuPont (DD), off 1.7% in moderately higher volume. On Thursday, the European Union's antitrust unit announced an investigation into DuPont's plan to merge with Dow Chemical (DOW).In the Nasdaq 100, the biggest gainers were BlackBerry (BBRY), up 4% in strong volume; QVC home shopping TV network owner Liberty Interactive (QVCA), up 3% in heavy volume; and chipmaker Micron Technology (MU), up 3% in soft trade. None is a market leader.In the S&P 500, the day's top gainers were department store Nordstrom (JWN), up 8% in huge volume as it followed through on Thursday's earnings-inspired rally, and managed health care provider Cigna (CI), up 4% in strong volume.
"
210,JWN,"Stocks remained near session highs Thursday in late trading amid surging oil prices, upside earnings surprises and big gains by Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UA) and other retail stocks.The Dow Jones industrial average sprinted ahead by 0.7%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite each advanced 0.5%. Volume was tracking lower across the board vs. the same time Wednesday.Retailers, apparel makers and oil stocks led the upside in the stock market today, as West Texas Intermediate crude surged 4.3% to just under $43.50 a barrel. Oil prices rallied after Saudi Arabia said it is watching oil prices closely and would take action if needed to help prop up the market.Under Armour vaulted 5% to retake its 200-day moving average as it works on a 10-month consolidation. The athletic apparel and footwear maker announced three additions to its executive team: Kip Fulks as chief product officer, ex-Amazon (AMZN) executive Andy Donkin as chief marketing officer, and Colin Browne as global sourcing president.Rival Nike, up 2.5%, took the lead among the Dow's blue chips.Macy's (M) gapped up to soar 17%, retaking its 200-day moving average in hefty trade en route to a three-month high. The embattled department store operator reported Q2 results that fell from last year but still topped views. It also announced plans to close 100 stores and focus on its online business.Kohl's (KSS) also gapped up, leaping 17% to a three-month high of its own and jumping above its 200-day line for the first time in more than a year. The department store chain's results beat forecasts, but it trimmed its full-year earnings guidance to lower-than-expected same-store sales.Nordstrom (JWN) jumped 7% to its best level in three months ahead of its quarterly results, due out after the close. Analysts expect a 40% drop in per-share earnings.Economic data slated for Friday, meanwhile, include retail sales for July.Alibaba (BABA) surged 6% to a 13-month high after reporting Q2 results that topped estimates. Yahoo (YHOO), which owns a stake in the Chinese online retailer, enjoyed a 4% pop to its highest level since June 2015.LGI Homes (LGIH) and CyberArk Software (CYBR) led the IBD 50 with gains of 3% or better. But Dycom Industries (DY) sank 7% to sharply breach its 50-day line, while China's Yirendai (YRD) fell 3.5% from Wednesday's all-time high.
"
211,JWN,"The major indexes lost some more gains Friday afternoon after an August payrolls report showed decent gains on the jobs front, but not enough to spur a fast move to raise the cost of money.The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%, backing a bit from its early gain of almost 0.7%. So far this week, the Nasdaq is up about 0.5%. The NYSE Composite gapped up at the open and advanced 0.7% on the back of solid gains by oil, mining, security software, gaming software, long-term Medicare facility and hospital stocks.Oil and silver futures shot higher. Government bonds sold off as the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield climbed to 1.61%, up 4 basis points.Analysts gave a nearly unanimous response that the 151,000 increase in August payrolls was not enough to spur the Federal Reserve to go ahead with its first new increase in short-term interest rates when the U.S. central bank meets later this month. In December, the Fed raised the fed funds rate for overnight loans to a 0.25%-0.5% range.""This number definitely doesn't force a rate increase in September and is at the lower end of expectations -- a weak overall report,"" Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at Florida-based EverBank, said. ""If the data continues to match the recent pattern of disappointment we could see the chances of ANY rate increase in 2016 fade away.""The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.3%. On the Dow, big price movers included Chevron (CVX) (up 1%, still lagging below its 50-day moving average), Boeing (BA) (up 1%, testing resistance at the 200-day line), and Home Depot (HD) (up 0.7%, just shy of a 137.92 base-on-base entry).Volume on both exchanges was running mildly lower on both exchanges vs. the same time on Thursday. The stock market will be closed Monday for Labor Day.Apple (AAPL) helped all the major indexes with its heft and market cap of $577 billion. The iPhone maker, set to announce new products next week, gapped up at the open and rose as much as 1.2% to 108. It is now up 0.3% to 107.04, yet the stock continues to slowly position itself for a potential breakout, at 110.33. That's 10 cents above the top of downward-sloping handle in a consolidation.Indeed, Apple is no longer a big growth stock. The savvy CAN SLIM investor will keep both eyes open for brand-new names that have the kind of awesome growth in profits, sales, and outstanding return on equity and profit margins that Apple once had. Stocks that went public within the past three to eight years are often great candidates.One may be Impinj (PI), a brand-new name on the Nasdaq. The semiconductor play surged 13%, to 31.17 in heavy trading Friday, adding to Thursday's 21% rally.After peaking at 24.93 on Aug. 18, Impinj cooled off for 10 trading sessions -- enough time to form a narrow IPO base. The stock burst past the 25.03 pivot point on Thursday in the heaviest trade since its July 21 debut at 14 a share. It's now sharply extended from proper buy range.Impinj produces RF (radio frequency) ID tags that get placed in medicine bottles and other consumer products that allow manufacturers to make better supply-chain decisions. Late Wednesday, the Seattle-based firm reported earnings of 5 cents a share, smashing Wall Street's consensus view yet down 44%, but that may have been due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. Third-quarter earnings are expected to jump 500% to 6 cents a share. Revenue rose 37% to $25.9 million.The stock has just 19 million shares outstanding and a float of 9 million, so keep in mind that it tends to swing more wildly than the average stock. Plus, it hasn't yet reported quarterly earnings of more than 10 cents a share, so year-over-year gains may be in part exaggerated by the small figures.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Amplify Snack Brands (BETR), another young gun and fast-growing food firm, rallied 1% to 16.98, moving a bit further past a new 16.76 V-shaped cup base entry. The Austin, Texas-based company went public on Aug. 5 at 18 a share, so watch for potential upside resistance at the price level.Lululemon (LULU) plunged 8.5% to nearly round-trip its gains after breaking out past a 68.03 flat-base buy point in July. The yogawear firm posted fiscal Q2 earnings of 38 cents a share, up 12% and the best bottom-line growth in 11 quarters, but it only matched Wall Street's consensus view. Revenue jumped 14%, the 10th quarter in a row of modest double-digit increases, but slightly below views. Lululemon's guidance was cautious.But some names in the apparel and clothing retail field still joined Friday's rally. They included Anthropologie chain operator Urban Outfitters (URBN) (up 0.6%, holding a recent powerful upward price gap) and Nordstrom (JWN) (up nearly 2%, trying to hold its rebound back above the key 200-day line).IBD's TAKE: Impinj is part of a top-performing sector. Within IBD's ranking of 33 broad industry sectors, the chip sector ranks easily in the top 10 at No. 2.

215,JWN,"Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) reported better-than-feared second strong quarter earnings, boosting shares of both department store chains and the broader retail sector. Nordstrom (JWN) late Thursday reported better-than-expected earnings.JCPenney (JCP) is queued for early Friday. Retail groups dominated the top-performing industries Thursday on the stock market today.The department stores offered some relief after a procession of consumer-oriented companies -- aside from e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) -- reported sluggish demand, from Ford Motor (F) to McDonald's (MCD), that fueled sector sell-offs often led by department store stocks.Macy's reported a 16% drop in earnings per share minus one-time items to 54 cents, beating estimates for 45 cents. Revenue slid 3.8% to $5.87 billion, the sixth straight quarter of year-over-year declines, but still topping consensus for $5.75 billion.Macy's said overall same-store sales fell 2% vs. a year earlier.The Cincinnati-based company plans to close 100 Macy's full-line locations, or 14%. Most of them will close in early 2017. Coach (COH) said on Tuesday it will shutter some 250 locations -- known as ""doors"" -- or about 25% of the total it has within North America, as part of ""the strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning.""Macy's said it's still seeing lower-than-normal store spending, but left its full-year guidance intact. The company sees EPS of $3.15-$3.40, with the midpoint slightly above consensus.Kohl's Q2 EPS rose 14% to $1.22, easily topping views for $1.03. Sales fell 2.1% to $4.18 billion, better than the expected $4.16 billion.Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman and CEO, said in a statement, ""Our sales improved over our first-quarter results but were below our expectations."" As a result, the company cut its full-year earnings guidance to $3.80-$4, down from $4.05-$4.25 previously but still above analysts' consensus for $3.83 at the midpoint.Macy's stock spiked 17.1% to 39.81 Thursday, the highest since the beginning of May. Macy's is trading above 200-day line for the first time in a year, as it tries to break a long downtrend.Kohl's rose 16.2% to 44.19. It's still well below below its 2016 high of 52.06, set on Jan. 7.Retails Metrics analyst Ken Perkins said in a report that for Macy's and Kohl's earnings provided ""rays of hope"" as inventories and margins improved. Still, he noted that ""both retailers guided FY16 earnings below the current consensus.""IBD'S TAKE: Traditional department stores such as Macy's, Kohl's and Nordstrom are getting beaten down by online retailers like Amazon. Giant Wal-Mart is trying to stem the tidy by buying a strong online presence.Retailers are under pressure due to a confluence of negatives. Fashion houses Kate Spade (KATE) and Michael Kors (KORS) noted in their reports that tourists visiting certain key cities have cut back on spending at their stores. The strong dollar is seen as the culprit, making some affordable luxury items too pricey for tourists.Spade and Kors also cited less foot traffic in malls. Consumers continue to opt for online bargains shipped to their home, for free if they're members of a service like Amazon's $99 a year Amazon Prime free shipping and video streaming.Brick-and-mortar retailers may continue to lose share in the crucial holiday buying season, while Amazon and other online retailers continue growing.Nordstrom jumped 7.5% at the close, then spiked after hours after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings. JCPenney climbed 8.6%, with analysts expecting a smaller loss Friday morning.The Commerce Department's July retail sales report, due Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show a 0.4% rise, or a 0.2% increase when excluding autos. There could also be an Amazon Prime Day effect in the data.

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each added 0.5%.Crude prices spiked 4% to the highest level since July 22 after Saudi Arabia, the world's top exporter, suggested it would trim output to ease a supply glut and bolster prices.After the close, Nordstrom (JWN) soared 11% following its quarterly earnings report, capping a banner day for department store stocks.The high-end retailer reported mixed results, beating Wall Street estimates on profit but falling short on revenue.

Nordstrom rose more than 7% during the regular session, approaching resistance at its 200-day moving average.Also after hours, Nvidia (NVDA) climbed 3% after the producer of graphics chips used in video-game consoles posted better-than-expected profit and sales for the latest quarter. It also issued a bullish outlook.And Planet Fitness (PLNT) rose more than 2% in post-session trading following its Q2 results.

217,JWN,"McDonald's (MCD) and Best Buy (BBY) were downgraded Monday, while Lululemon (LULU) and JCPenney (JCP) saw their price targets raised, and Valeant (VRX) was upgraded to buy.McDonald's was downgraded to hold from buy at Argus. The fast-food giant's profit margins are likely to be squeezed by rising labor costs and slowing same-store growth over the coming quarters. McDonald's last month posted weaker-than-expected U.S. comps, something several other restaurants have also reported.McDonald's stock lost 0.8% to 118.52 at the close on the stock market today.Telsey Advisory Group raised Lululemon's price target to 92 from 82 and kept its outperform rating on the yoga-wear retailer's stock.Lululemon shares rose 1.2% to 80.27 at the close, hitting a three-year high.Best Buy was downgraded to hold with a 36 price target at Jefferies. The analysts said that the electronics store will see weaker same-store sales and margins due to a ""maturing"" 4K TV cycle.Best Buy shares fell 1% to 34.51. The stock is at a resistance area around 35.Nordstrom's (JWN) price target was raised to 47 from 38 at RBC Capital Markets.

Still, Nordstrom rose 8% on Friday and was up 18% for the week.Telsey Advisory hiked JCPenney's price target to 13 from 12. On Friday, JCPenney reported a smaller-than-expected Q2 loss, as same-store sales rose 2.2%. JCPenney was the bright spot among department stores in Q2, according to Cowen analysts. JCPenney shares rose 6% on Friday and 12% for the week.Nordstrom shares rose 3.1% to 52.96 intraday. JCPenney stock jumped 7% to 11.29.IBD'S TAKE: Nordstrom and JCPenney are rebounding, but they are still working on bases while their fundamentals are mixed. Meanwhile, Home Depot and Lowe's are holding at or near buy points, as their profit and sales have held up.

218,JWN,"Stocks moved sideways at all-time highs this week, but the week was packed with market-moving news. Alibaba (BABA) broke out as growth accelerated, while Acacia Communications (ACIA) exploded as fiber optic and IPO growth names sparked. Macy's (M) triggered a huge relief rally, and Wal-Mart (WMT) bought Jet.com to better compete vs. Amazon (AMZN). Oil prices rebounded, but solar stocks crashed.After weeks of the S&P 500 and Dow industrials hitting all-time highs, the Nasdaq eclipsed its 2015 peak. All three major indexes rose fractionally for the week -- the Nasdaq and Dow closed up 0.2% while the S&P 500 climbed 1 point. More quality breakouts appeared. Retailers, energy plays and some hot growth stocks led the market amid earnings reports and higher oil prices. But solar stocks tumbled on weak SunPower (SPWR) guidance. REITs struggled as investors sought growth names -- and worried about store closures.Alibaba reported revenue of $4.84 billion, beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $4.53 billion. Revenue rose 59% in local-currency terms, the best gain since Alibaba's September 2014 IPO. EPS rose 33% to 74 cents, beating the consensus of 63 cents.JD.com reported revenue of $9.8 billion, slightly above the consensus and up 42% in local currency. It reported earnings per share of 4 cents, double the 2 cent consensus, but its Q3 revenue estimate fell short of projections. Both companies showed strong growth in mobile users.Alibaba stock soared 16% for the week, breaking out of a base to their highest level since January 2015. JD.com leapt nearly 13%.Next week, messaging giant Tencent (TCEHY), perhaps Alibaba's biggest Chinese rival, reports earnings.

To get an in-depth look at Alibaba, Acacia and other top-rated stocks -- and how they fare vs. rivals -- go to IBD Stock Checkup to develop your watch list.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih hinted at a production freeze, which could come at a meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum next month. But Russia's energy minister said he didn't see a reason for renewing talks. The International Energy Agency said the oil glut has disappeared, but it warned of weaker demand on a ""dimmer macroeconomic outlook"" in 2017. OPEC said Saudi Arabia pumped a record amount of crude oil in July, and the cartel left its 2017 demand outlook unchanged at 95.41 million barrels per day. The Energy Information Administration said that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.1 million barrels to 523.6 million for the week ended Aug 5. And U.S. production fell by 0.2% to 8.44 million barrels, a second straight week of declines.U.S. oil rigs in operation rose by 15 to 396 in the week ended Aug. 12, Baker Hughes said. That's the seventh straight weekly gain and the highest level since late February.Still, U.S. crude oil prices closed the week at $44.49 a barrel, up 4.4%.Wal-Mart Stores, looking to keep pace with Amazon, agreed to buy Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Wal-Mart has sizable online sales, but growth has been decelerating. Wal-Mart also will put Jet.com CEO Marc Lore in charge of all of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations, though Jet.com will remain separately. Lore previously founded Quidsi, parent of Diapers.com, before Amazon bought it.Wal-Mart stock rose 0.2%, hitting a 14-month high during the week.Solar stocks after SunPower cut its 2016 guidance and inverter-supplier SolarEdge (SEDG) cited a slowdown at U.S. installers. For Q2, SunPower's Q2 revenue growth and adjusted loss topped estimates. But SunPower sees Q3 revenue of just $700 million to $800 million vs. the consensus for $1.13 billion, as demand for utility-scale solar projects tumbles. And SunPower also cut its 2016 view to $2.8 billion-$3 billion, missing analysts' view for $3.3 billion.SolarEdge's $124.8 million in fiscal Q4 sales missed analysts' expectations for $129.4 million, but 44 cents EPS minus items beat by a nickel. The midpoint of current-quarter sales guidance for $130 million-$139 million trailed the consensus at $137 million, and EPS missed by a penny.SolarCity (SCTY), which has agreed to a takeover deal by Tesla (TSLA), topped analysts' Q2 projections for adjusted loss and revenue. But its current-quarter view for $155 million-$168 million in revenue lagged the consensus for $174.6 million.SunPower stock crashed 28% to a 3-year low.Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), involved in everything from gaming to autonomous driving and AI, rose 8.3% for the week to a fresh high after the Tesla partner reported $1.43 billion in sales and 40 cents earnings per share. That topped the consensus for $1.35 billion and 37 cents, and was up 24% and 700%, respectively, vs. last year. Nvidia sees current-quarter sales at $1.68 billion, plus or minus 2%, beating analysts' model for $1.45 billion.With China, telecoms and data centers spending heavily for higher-speed connections, makers of fiber optic components are seeing huge demand.Hot IPO Acacia Communications said Q2 revenue rose 101% to $116 million, and adjusted earnings soared 305%. Lumentum (LITE) and Inphi (IPHI) also reported stronger-than-expected figures. NeoPhotonics (NPTN) sales growth fell short due to sluggish demand for older parts, but production of 100-gigabit gear is ramping up. IBD's 14-company Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group hit a 15-year high Thursday and ranks No. 10 out of 197 groups.Acacia rose 41% Friday and nearly 50% for the week, blasting to new highs. Lumentum rose more than 4% and Inphi 16%, also to new highs. NeoPhotonics climbed 2.6% to 14.01, clearing a 13.85 buy point on Friday.Related:IBD'S TAKE: Acacia Communications is among several tech leaders that have risen 20% past a buy point, putting them in profit-taking zone. But when you should you sell these top stocks? IBD's latest Tech Leaders column explains when to hold onto winning stocks, and how those rules apply to Acacia, Weibo and others right now.Recent IPO Twilio (TWLO), a communications software firm, reported a narrower than-expected non-GAAP loss. Q2 revenue jumped 70% to $64.5 million, vs. Wall Street estimates of $58.2 million, although sales from its top customer, Facebook (FB)-owned WhatsApp, fell 8% year over year. Twilio's full-year guidance edged consensus estimates.Twilio shares surged 28% for the week, hitting a new high.Medpace Holdings (MEDP) soared 20% to 27.79 in Thursday's debut after pricing at 23, the high end of its expected IPO range. Shares edged up 0.9% to 28.04 on Friday. Medpace provides outsourced clinical development services for drug and medical device companies.Specialty drugmakers ended what had been a strong Q2 season for the drug industry on a more ambiguous note. Allergan (AGN), freshly divested of its generics business, beat expectations slightly but trimmed its sales guidance. Shares fell 1.7% for the week. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) missed Q2 numbers but affirmed its guidance as it reorganized. It said its deal with Walgreens (WBA) was finally turning profitable and that it was willing to sell $8 billion worth of non-core assets. The stock soared 25% Tuesday, but pared weekly gains to 13.5% on a report that Valeant could face criminal charges of defrauding insurers.Medivation (MDVN) reported a ho-hum quarter, but profit will likely be flat until an expected market expansion for its drug Xtandi in Q4. Shares rose 4.4% to 66.02, a 14-month high and just barely in buy range from a 63.04 entry. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed EPS estimates and lowered guidance, partly due to a change in tax reporting and partly due to higher costs. Its stock dropped 9.3%. Mylan (MYL) beat its profit estimate slightly and affirmed its guidance, with its controversially high-priced EpiPen making up for light generic drug sales. Mylan closed the week unchanged.Walt Disney (DIS) topped Wall Street estimates late Tuesday and said it had bought a 33% stake in streaming company BAMTech. As it vies to remain competitive in digital, the media conglomerate plans to launch an ESPN-branded over-the-top service, but it will not include current ESPN content. Q3 EPS rose 12% to $1.62 on 9% revenue growth to $14.28 billion. Shares were up about 1% for the week, but failed to hold above their 50-day line.Southwest (LUV) cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook and said it expected higher unit costs due to 2,000-plus flight cancellations in July after a single router failure blacked out much of its technological infrastructure. The guidance came as Delta Air Lines (DAL) spent much of the week trying to recover from some 2,000 of its own flight cancellations caused by an outage early Monday. American Airlines (AAL), meanwhile, forecast an improvement in its Q3 unit revenue.Southwest and Delta shares fell 3.5% while American Air climbed 1.4%.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) reported lower sales, while Macy's also had declining earnings and said it would cut 100 stores. But they both topped forecasts after weeks of bad news from consumer stocks such as Ford (F) and McDonald's (MCD). So Macy's and Kohl's skyrocketed 16.7% and 14.3%, respectively for the week. Nordstrom (JWN) and JCPenney (JCP) topped on earnings and missed on revenue, with their shares also soaring for the week. But overall, retail sales were flat in July -- and down 0.3% excluding autos -- according to the Commerce Department. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST) are among the retailers reporting this coming week.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to a 14-month high in August, climbing 2.9 points to 48.4. That's still below the neutral 50 level.

Brent crude eased a half percent to just below $44.Valeant Pharmaceuticals slid 7% at the open, with the shares' weakness coming after news agencies reported a federal investigation looking into a possible insurance fraud scheme based on ties with a mail-order pharmacy.Kohl's kicked up 15% after a second-quarter earnings beat and an as-expected revenue decline outweighed lower comparable sales and trimmed full-year guidance.Macy's soared 15% after reporting stronger-than-forecast second-quarter results. The chain also said it would close 100 stores to focus on its most profitable locations.Nordstrom (JWN) joined the fracas and jumped 9% at the open ahead of its Q2 report, scheduled after today's close.China's Alibaba Group (BABA) climbed 5% after its fiscal-first-quarter sales and earnings zipped past analysts' targets. Alibaba ended Wednesday's session in a buy range above an 85.10 buy point in an odd cup-with-handle base. Yahoo (YHOO), which owns 15% of Alibaba, rose 3%.Shake Shack (SHAK) suffered a 4% loss after second-quarter earnings reported late Wednesday eked past analyst views and a 37% revenue gain easily topped expectations, but same-store sales were less than half of last year's second-quarter pace and below forecasts.The dollar moved broadly higher, gold eased to near $1,350 an ounce, and the 10-year Treasury yield flattened at 1.51%.Overseas, China's  markets ended mixed, but both the Shanghai composite and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index are up more than 1% each so far this week.

224,JWN,"Suburban Detroit's Lakeside Mall, with midrange stores such as Sears (SHLD), Bath & Body Works and Kay Jewelers (SIG), is one of the hundreds of retail centers across the U.S. being buffeted by the rise of e-commerce. After a $144 million loan on the property came due in June, owner General Growth Properties (GGP) didn't make the payment.The default by the second-biggest U.S. mall owner may be a harbinger of trouble nationwide, as a wave of debt from the last decade's borrowing binge comes due for shopping centers. About $47.5 billion of loans backed by retail properties are set to mature over the next 18 months, data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch show. That's coinciding with a tighter market for commercial-mortgage backed securities, where many such properties are financed.For some mall owners, negotiating loan extensions or refinancing may be difficult. Lenders are tightening their purse strings as unease surrounding the future of shopping centers grows, with bleak earnings forecasts from retailers including Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), and bankruptcy filings by chains such as Aeropostale and Sports Authority. Older malls in small cities and towns are being hit hardest, squeezed by competition from both the internet and newer, glitzier malls that draw wealthy shoppers.""For many years, people thought the retail business in the U.S. was a bit overbuilt,"" said Tad Philipp, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service. ""The advent of online shopping is kind of accelerating the separation of winners and losers.""Landlords that can't refinance debt may either walk away from the property or negotiate for an extension of the due date. It can be hard to save a failing mall, leading to high losses for lenders on soured loans, Philipp said.General Growth already extended the mortgage on the Lakeside Mall once before, in 2010. It was part of the Chicago-based company's plan to emerge from the biggest real estate bankruptcy in U.S. history after piling on $27 billion in debt. Fitch Ratings flagged the property as potentially problematic in August, citing declining occupancy.The mall -- anchored by JCPenney (JCP), Sears, Macy's and Lord & Taylor stores -- was built in 1976 and last renovated 15 years ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Occupancy was 79% as of December.The loan has been transferred to C-III Asset Management, a special servicer that handles troubled commercial mortgages on behalf of bondholders, and General Growth failed to pay the mortgage that was due June 1, Bloomberg data show. In February, Chief Financial Officer Michael Berman said the company expected to address their 2016 maturities ""successfully.""Representatives for General Growth and C-III declined to comment on the loan.The 1.5 million-square-foot (139,000-square-meter) mall in Sterling Heights, Mich., isn't typical of General Growth's holdings, which include some of the world's premier shopping destinations, such as Honolulu's Ala Moana Center and Las Vegas' Fashion Show. General Growth spun off most of its weaker malls into a separate company in 2012 and has been looking to dispose of assets that don't fit into its strategy of owning the best properties in top markets.It's getting more difficult to find takers for lower-tier malls, according to Green Street Advisors. The pool of buyers is shallow and funding is elusive, the real estate research firm wrote in a note to clients last week.""The criteria to get financing is getting a little bit more stringent and cutting off the lifelines for some of these malls,"" DJ Busch, a senior analyst at Green Street, said in an interview.Green Street estimates that several hundred malls could shut down over the next decade, with properties reliant on Macy's, JCPenney and Sears at the most risk. Sales at department stores, once the engines that powered shopping centers across the U.S., have declined almost 20% since 2006, according to the firm. About 800 department stores would need to shut down to restore balance between sales and profitability, Green Street said in an April report.Insurance companies and banks that are eager to issue loans on high-end shopping complexes aren't as willing to take a chance on a shaky mall. That pushes borrowers toward Wall Street firms that underwrite loans to sell to investors as CMBS. CMBS lending, which stalled earlier this year with the volatility in global markets, remains subdued in the face of new regulations taking effect in December. Wall Street banks have sold about $18.5 billion of CMBS deals this year, a 30% drop from the same period in 2015, according to Deutsche Bank. That's making borrowing more expensive and choking off funding just as loans from the boom years of 2006 and 2007 come due.""You're definitely seeing some problems as the loans reach their maturity,"" said Roger Lehman, a debt analyst at Credit Suisse Group.Walking away from a poorly performing mall is often the best thing a landlord can do for its balance sheet, according to Green Street's Busch. If the debt is greater than the value of the property, it might not make sense to invest in a costly redevelopment, he said.""It takes a lot of hope and a lot of capital to reinvent a mall that's already somewhat uncompetitive in its market,"" Busch said.WP Glimcher (WPG) plans to hand over five of its malls to lenders, four of which have mortgages coming due in the next 12 months, the company said in a June 8 presentation. Chief Executive Officer Michael Glimcher last month said that it had multiple offers from lenders to refinance one of the loans, a $87.3 million mortgage on the Mesa Mall in Grand Junction, Colo., which was due June 1.A representative for Columbus, Ohio-based Glimcher declined to comment on its financing plans.Late payments are creeping upward on CMBS loans backed by all property types. More than $1 billion of mortgages tied to shopping malls, office buildings and hotels soured in May, up from $884 million in April, Wells Fargo data show.That figure will probably increase as more loans issued in the run-up to the 2008 crash fail to refinance under the tougher underwriting guidelines in place today, according to Rich Moore, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.""In 2006 or 2007, everything was beautiful,"" Moore said. In the current environment, ""if you got to a bank and you want to refinance junk, the bank says no.""

227,JWN,"Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) early Tuesday posted better-than-expected first-quarter sales and earnings, but its soft earnings outlook and the exit of the company's chief financial officer set investors on edge.Best Buy stock dropped 7.4%, to 30.55 on the stock market today.The Richfield, Minn.-based company earned 44 cents a share excluding items on sales of $8.44 billion in the quarter ended April 30.

229,JWN,"The consumer stock sell-off intensified and broadened Tuesday, as bad news from General Motors (GM) added to concerns from McDonald's (MCD), Ford Motor (F) and others.The consumer slide fueled a general market retreat. But it's also a warning for the broader U.S. economy.Recent economic data on consumers have been positive. Consumer spending rose at a robust 4.2% annual rate in the second quarter, with a Tuesday report showing a 0.4% monthly gain in June. But consumers were a rare bright spot, with business investment falling for a third straight quarter and homebuilding spending also falling. If consumer spending falters, the economy may struggle to match its anemic second-quarter growth of 1.2%.General Motors and Ford reported July U.S. sales that fell vs. a year earlier. Fiat Chrysler Automotive (FCAU) eked out a gain, but less than expected. Ford had reported weak earnings last week amid rising incentives spending and stalling U.S. demand. It sees U.S. industry sales falling in 2016 and 2017 after years of big gains.General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler shares fell 4.4%, 4.3% and 4%, respectively, on the stock market today.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which has been a top-rated restaurant stock, fell 12.4% Tuesday. The steakhouse chain missed on second-quarter revenue and said same-store sales growth was slowing in the early weeks of the current third quarter. Dave & Buster's (PLAY) dived 5.6%, taking a round trip on its breakout.Those follow weaker demand at McDonald's, which had been a great turnaround story in recent months. But last week McDonald's said U.S. comps in the second quarter fell short of Wall Street forecasts, and cited ""softening industry growth."" Starbucks (SBUX) also reported weak U.S. comps.More generally, analysts have been issuing warnings about the retail sector.McDonald's fell 0.3% Tuesday and Starbucks 1.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Texas Roadhouse and Dave & Buster's have been among the best-rated restaurant stocks in recent weeks.

Also hitting the sector: A Zika virus warning for a Miami neighborhood and  German carrier Lufthansa saying that terror attacks and global unease have had a ""tangible"" impact on demand. Delta Air stock fell more than 7% intraday, while American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) fell 6%.Department stores were among the biggest losers, with Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) down 8% and Nordstrom (JWN) tumbling 7%.Kroger got a downgrade from BMO Capital Markets to market perform from outperform, citing the deflationary environment for groceries. Shares are off 4.1%, on track for their lowest close since early January 2015. That follows weak same-store sales from natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM).One relative bright spot for consumer stocks has been consumer products producers such as Procter & Gamble (PG). P&G edged past profit views Tuesday, rising 0.4% to 86.78 for a 52-week high.

Shares are up more than 120% from that price, and recently broke out of an IPO base with a 45.85 buy point.The stock hit a new all-time high Thursday, closing up 5.7% at 52.43.Analysts see growth potential for Acacia as big-name tech companies upgrade internet transmission and data center equipment.New issue Twilio also hit new high ground Thursday, but reversed and finished 1.2% lower at 41.75. Twilio shares are up nearly 200% from their June IPO at 15.Some of the cloud-based company's customers are Uber, Airbnb, Box (BOX) and Nordstrom (JWN).Web hosting provider GoDaddy is up about 45% from its April 2015 IPO at 20.

231,JWN,"According to U.S. mall landlords, the rumors of the death of brick-and-mortar retail are greatly exaggerated.“There is no question there is a lot of change,” Taubman Centers Chief Operating Officer Bill Taubman said in an interview at the International Council of Shopping Centers annual convention, which was held in Las Vegas this past week. “But retail has always been about evolution. Someone is always bemoaning the change in the market and how it’s impacting things.”Bleak earnings forecasts from department-store companies, including Macy’s (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), along with bankruptcy filings by firms such as Sports Authority and teen-clothing chain Aeropostale, have rattled investors in retail landlords. A Bloomberg index of regional mall landlords, which includes the shares of Taubman Centers (TCO) and Simon Property Group (SPG), has dropped almost 8% recently, double the decline in the broader Bloomberg Real Estate Investment Trust Index.Retailers are being hurt by the rise of Internet shopping, changes in consumer tastes and declining visits to big-city shopping districts by tourists deterred by the strong dollar. Retail rents on Madison Avenue in Manhattan have fallen to $1,644 a square foot on average, down 3% from last year, according to a report this month by the Real Estate Board of New York.Sales have suffered this year at malls that rely on shoppers from Europe and Latin America, said Taubman, whose properties include high-end destinations such as the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey and Beverly Center in Los Angeles. Spending by travelers from China hasn’t dropped off much, he said.Despite the turmoil, demand for space has held up, Kimco Realty (KIM) Chief Executive Officer Conor Flynn said during a panel discussion at the Las Vegas convention. New Hyde Park, N.Y.-based Kimco is adding more grocery stores to anchor its shopping centers, a reliable source of business, he said.The market will get more clarity on retailers’ demand for space when Sports Authority auctions off its stores, Flynn said. Once the largest U.S. sporting-goods retailer, the company filed for bankruptcy in March after saddling itself with $643 million of debt.“We are watching shadow supply,” Flynn said. “We don’t want a shock to the system where there is a ton of square-footage coming online at the same time.”Plenty of retailers are thriving, said Matt Lougee, a senior vice president at DDR (DDR), a company that owns shopping centers across the U.S. Lougee cited TJX (TJX), the owner of discounters T.J. Maxx and Marshalls that last week boosted its earnings forecast, as an example of a company that is benefiting from the shift away from full-price apparel. The perception that lost revenue is all going online isn’t accurate, he said.“Those dollars are going somewhere,” Lougee said in an interview in Las Vegas. “They went to a different channel, not necessarily the Internet.”Property owners in the retail business will always have to contend with filling empty stores as part of the normal course of business, Vereit (VER) Chief Executive Officer Glenn Rufrano said on a panel in Las Vegas.“Retailers will always lose space, not because they are retailers, but because they are bad merchants,” he said.Related: Dollar Tree, Discount Retailers Dominate New-Highs ListWal-Mart Re-Thinks Small Format Strategy As Dollar Stores SwarmSluggish Retail Sales?

239,JWN,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Wednesday: what you need to know as an investor.Quarterly results for Michael Kors (KORS) and Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) are on tap for Wednesday, following a string of depressing results out of the retail sector.Will the Federal Reserve rates soon? May U.S. auto sales from General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and others, the May ISM manufacturing index and the Fed's own beige book will offers strong clues.Many apparel and accessories retailers this year have been shaken due to competitive discounting, a warmer winter and a colder spring, and lackluster trends. Michael Kors, which sells luxury clothing and accessories like handbags and watches, has been no exception, and Nordstrom (JWN) is reportedly purging its inventory of Michael Kors bags.But Wall Street expects the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share to rise 6.6% to 96 cents on sales up 6.2% to $1.147 billion.Michael Kors' shares plunged below their 200-day line this month after dire sales and profit forecasts from Macy's (M), which cited poor demand in handbags. Fossil (FOSL), which makes some of the watches that appear on Kors' shelves, also reported ""a malaise in watches"" as wearable technology like the Apple (AAPL) Watch becomes more popular.Some analysts, however, remain upbeat. Jefferies this month said Kors has strengthened its brand internationally and could get a lift from spring trends and reduced promotions.

Power and LMC Automotive forecast puts May sales at 17.4 million.Experian this month said open auto loans climbed past $1 trillion in the first quarter and said auto lenders should ""keep a close eye on delinquency trends to ensure the market remains healthy,” even though delinquencies were low compared to before the recession.S&P Global ratings last week also cited ""increasing risk in the market that packages and sells low-rated auto loans.""

In his view, its performance will determine whether the market feels more confident or more hesitant moving forward.On Friday, the latest economic data showed retail sales improved in April, rising 1.3% to top expectations.However, the drumbeat of disappointing retail earnings continued, with Nordstrom's (JWN) stock crumbling 13% Friday and J.C. Penney (JCP) falling 3% after posting quarterly results. Dillard's (DDS), like Nordstrom, missed on both the top and bottom lines.Another department store retailer, Kohl’s (KSS), reported that weak traffic trends drove a 3.9% decline in comparable store sales, the worst decline since 2009, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.Earlier this week, Macy’s (M) earnings beat, but the company significantly lowered guidance citing weak sales growth and uncertain consumer spending.SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) gave up 1.3% on the stock market today and posted a 4.5% weekly loss.Consumer discretionary and real estate were the worst-performing sectors of the week.

Cowen, for one, had estimated a 4% gain.

245,JWN,"Home Depot (HD) crushed first-quarter estimates and raised its full-year guidance, as customers of the home improvement retail giant paid an extra 2.4% per visit, or an average $60.03 during the period, the company said Tuesday.But its shares fell early on the stock market today after Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome told analysts on the earnings call that sales at stores open at least a year fell from 10.2% in February to 6.7% in March and then to 4.3% in April. Home Depot stock stayed down and ended the trading day off 2.5% to 132.""It does dovetail with a bit of a spending slowdown we saw at a number of retailers that pointed to April being a slower month,"" Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins told IBD.Home Depot is more insulated from the Amazon.com (AMZN) effect than other retailers, such as apparel chains, Perkins said. So its slowing same-store sales at outlets open more than a year aren't as much of a red flag as they are for top chains like Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN), Kohl's (KSS) and Gap (GPS). Those four retailers reported dismal results last week, sparking a sell-off in the sector.Perkins likes prospects for Home Depot and rival Lowe's this year.""We visited a number of retailers including Home Depot throughout the spring and they and Lowe's (LOW) were the busiest stores we visited,"" Perkins said.Home Depot's adjusted first-quarter earnings of $1.44 a share were up 24.1% year over year, according to figures provided by Thomson Reuters. Revenue grew 9% to $22.76 billion amid continued strong housing market growth, favorable spring weather and sustained consumer spending.Wall Street expected $1.36 earnings per share and $22.39 billion in revenue for the fiscal quarter ended May 1.Home Depot Chief Executive Craig Menear said in a press release that it was a ""stronger-than-expected start to the year"" and noted it came in ""a quarter marked by week-to-week demand spikes caused by weather variability.""Home Depot raised its 2016 earnings view to $6.27 a share, a penny above analysts' forecasts. It also lifted its sales projection for the year to 6.3% growth to about $94.097 billion, topping estimates of $94.082 billion. The company also projects same-store sales -- sales at outlets open more than a year -- will be up about 4.9% for the year, though that would be below first-quarter same-store sales growth of 6.5%.Shares initially fell more than 2% in morning trading, falling through their 50-day moving average. They recovered somewhat before tumbling even further by the close.After consolidating for nearly three months, the company's stock climbed above a 135.57 buy point on April 18 and rose to a fresh all-time high at 137.82 on May 10 before consolidating again.Jared Wiesel, partner at corporate consulting firm Revenue Analytics noted that the company is focusing on engaging millenials. For example, Home Depot is employing omni-media marketing that employs everything from print to digital.""Their online sales were up 21.5% for the quarter, which is excellent,"" Weisel said.Wiesel said that some investors may be concerned that what would normally be early summer sales were pulled into the first quarter because of favorable weather, which could hurt second-quarter results.""There could be an expectation that this quarter was so strong at the expense of future quarters,"" Wiesel said.Home Depot’s earnings came on the heels of the Commerce Department's announcement on Monday that U.S. housing starts climbed a strong 6.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.17 million units, topping estimates of 1.13 million.The government also revised March starts up a bit to a 1.10 million-unit rate from 1.09. The housing starts data and strong April retail sales indicate that economic growth is picking up momentum after getting off to a sluggish start in 2016.""Our view of the macro environment remains consistent. We believe housing data indicates continued tailwinds for our business,"" CEO Menear told analysts on an earnings call early Tuesday.CFO Tome added: ""We estimate weather driven demand positively impacted U.S. sales growth by approximately $250 million.""Lowe's (LOW) is set to announce first-quarter financial results early Wednesday. Analysts predict earnings per share will rise 21% to 85 cents and revenue should jump 5.1% to $14.87 billion. Shares lost 1.2% at the close.

247,JWN,"Home Depot (HD) reports first-quarter earnings Tuesday morning, and archrival Lowe's (LOW) will announce Q1 financial results early Wednesday, after dismal results from top chains like Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN), Kohl's (KSS) and Gap (GPS) sparked deep sell-offs in most retail and consumer stocks last week.But top home improvement retailer Home Depot and peer Lowe's are insulated from some of the retail woes because they're closely associated with the housing market, which continues to show healthy growth. And home repairs are a high priority for consumers, especially in springtime.Consensus is for Home Depot to record a 17% increase in earnings per share to $1.36 on a 7.1% hike in revenue to $22.37 billion. If it meets EPS expectations it would be the 12th quarter in a row of double-digit profit growth on a year over year basis. At the end of 2015, Home Depot said it expects to reach $100 billion a year annual revenue in a couple of years.Shares closed up 1.7% at 135.34 on the stock market today.IBD's Take: How healthy are the shares of Home Depot and its rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupHome Depot stock has been consolidating for about 4-1/2 months, possibly forming a base with a 135.57 buy point.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Lowe's EPS to climb 21% to 85 cents and sales to grow 5.1% to $14.85 billion. Lowe's shares were up 2.1% at 76.61 in early Monday trading after Oppenheimer raised its price target to 85 from 77. Oppenheimer maintained an outperform rating, saying that home improvement spending remains brisk.Lowe's shares rose 2.65% to 77.00, nearing a 78.23 buypoint.The reports come in a challenging environment for retailers. Retail Metrics president Ken Perkins said in a report on Friday, ""It was a terrible week for retail earnings reports!"" He noted earnings misses by Dillard's (DDS), Fossil (FOSL) and a whopping 96-cent miss by flooring stores operator Lumber Liquidators (LL).Even Ross Stores (ROST), which has held up well amid the retail carnage, fell 5.4% last Wednesday after Piper Jaffray cut its rating on the stock to underweight from neutral, citing multiple headwinds including softening in the discount apparel sector.

248,JWN,"Walt Disney (DIS), Macy's (M), Gap (GPS), Kohl's (KSS), Fossil (FOSL) and others reported weak earnings or guidance, triggering a broad sell-off in retail and other consumer stocks -- but not for shares of Amazon (AMZN). Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) tumbled to a two-year low amid fresh evidence that iPhone demand remains weak. The major indexes ultimately closed modestly lower, with the S&P 500 and Dow industrials falling below key support.The major averages fell for a third straight week, with most or all of the losses coming Friday. The Dow fell 1.2% and the S&P 500 0.5%, both closing below their 50-day moving averages for the first time since Feb. 29. The Nasdaq, already below that key line, retreated 0.4%. The market uptrend remains under pressure. Retail and consumer groups were big losers after a raft of weak earnings reports and guidance from the likes of Walt Disney and Macy's. Oil prices rose to six-month highs during the week.Retail sales rose 1.3% in April, their best gain in more than a year. But that couldn't shake the gloom surrounding retail and consumer stocks.Macy's, Kohl's, Nordstrom (JWN), JCPenney (JCP) and Dillard's (DDS) tumbled on dismal first-quarter reports and/or guidance. Macy's and upscale Nordstrom slashed outlooks after sharp EPS declines. Kohl's posted a same-store sales drop that was the worst ""since the height of the Great Recession,"" according to Retail Metrics.Macy's stock fell 17% to a four-year low, and Kohl's fell nearly 14%, setting to its seven-year worst. Nordstrom, JCPenney and Dillard's lost 18.5%, 8% and 11%, respectively.Meanwhile, watchmaker and seller Fossil collapsed 31% after missing Q1 views and slashing guidance. Fossil hinted at competition from the Apple Watch and other wearables. Gap said Q1 same-store sales sank 5%, with April comps down 7% ahead of its full Q1 results on May 19. Its shares plunged nearly 19% to the worst since late 2011.Wal-Mart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Ross Stores (ROST) also continue the flood of retail earnings next week.The media conglomerate delivered its first earnings miss in five years as per-share profit grew 11% to $1.36 and revenue grew 4% to $12.97 billion, short of consensus. ESPN lost subscribers once again, but the media networks segment didn't appear to disappoint Wall Street too badly. Studio revenue shot up 22% on ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and ""Zootopia"" fanfare. ""Captain America: Civil War"" should keep movie box office receipts high in Q2.Disney shares tumbled 4.8% to 100.52, falling out of a cup-with-handle base and well out of buy range. Disney closed just above its 50-day line.Apple stock fell last week amid new evidence that Apple suppliers are seeing weak orders for the upcoming iPhone 7. That suggests Apple's sales woes may continue for quite some time.

Sanford Bernstein analyst Carlos Kirjner on Tuesday raised his price target on Amazon to a whopping 1,000.Wal-Mart (WMT) announced its subscription service would offer two-day free delivery vs. three days before. But, as brick-and-mortar retailers struggle, Amazon rose 5.3% to 709.92, with investors betting its share of consumer spending will keep expanding.Facebook released guidelines revealing that the social media giant relies far more on people for its ""trending"" news topics, contradicting earlier company claims that they were largely driven by computer algorithms. Earlier, Gizmodo suggested that Facebook was suppressing news stories from conservative media outlets. Facebook strongly denied the allegation, saying it has “rigorous guidelines in place” for its review team, seeking to ensure consistency and neutrality.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he would meet with conservatives to discuss Facebook's policies.Facebook stock rose 0.3% to 119.81 for the week, extending a recent breakout but still in buy range.Staples (SPLS) and Office Depot (ODP) called off their proposed merger late Tuesday after a federal judge agreed with the Federal Trade Commission that the deal would have limited office supply competition with big corporate customers. Staples crashed 19%, and Office Depot dropped 40%. The Obama administration has blocked several megamergers recently, including that of Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI).

Several large and small banks halted work with Lending Club. Shares shed 51%, hitting a record low.Peer-to-peer lending firm Prosper recently announced a large round of layoffs, and disappointing quarterly results from OnDeck (ONDK) have prompted worries over insufficient loan-volume growth.Online gaming platform NetEase (NTES) more than doubled revenue in Q1, beating estimates, boosted by mobile games such as “Fantasy Westward Journey” and newer releases such as “Kung Fu Panda 3.” EPS also topped. Shares rose 9.3% for the week, moving above the 200-day line.Weibo (WB), a Twitter (TWTR)-like social-media platform majority owned by Sina (SINA), fared well, helped by mobile-user growth, strong ad revenue and expansion beyond major cities. Shares rose 2.1% for the week.Online media company Sina itself also topped Q1 views, with better sales and a narrower net loss than expected. The strong Weibo performance was a key help. But ad revenue from its Web portal segment lagged. Shares lost 11.2%, plunging through the 50-day line but closing just above the 200-day.Online retailer JD.com (JD) reported a Q1 loss in line with expectations. Sales surged but were just below expectations, and Q2 revenue guidance was just shy of analysts’ consensus. Shares tumbled 10.2%.LGI Homes (LGIH) on Tuesday reported a surprisingly strong 73% surge in first-quarter adjusted earnings per share. But the entry-level homebuilder's revenue fell short, and gross profit margins declined. LGI Homes, which briefly flirted with a 29.87 buy point, fell 8.9% to 25.69.Trex (TREX), the world’s largest maker of wood-alternative decking and railing products, topped Q1 views.

Shares of the July 2015 IPO rose 2.8% after the prior week's breakout.Several housing reports, including housing starts and existing-home sales for April, are on tap for next week.SolarCity (SCTY) torched Wall Street’s Q1 sales views late Monday, but losses swelled, and the No. 1 residential installer cut 2016 installation guidance as bookings fell short after Nevada cut net-metering payments to solar customers.Also Monday, rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) reported a 93% revenue rise that still missed views as losses widened.But No. 2 installer Sunrun (RUN) late Thursday reported a surprise Q1 profit ex items, while revenue nearly doubled.SolarCity fell 10.3% for the week, while Vivint was off nearly 8.9%, hitting record lows. Sunrun was down nearly 12%, even with Friday's 7.5% pop.Israeli giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) beat Q1 earnings and sales estimates, but it guided Q2 slightly below consensus. Teva said its $40 billion buyout of the Allergan (AGN) generics business is on track to close in June, despite some earlier delays. Teva stock rose 3 cents to 50.30 for the week.Allergan reported mixed Q1 results -- earnings beat and sales missed -- but the drugmaker said it'll buy $10 billion in stock. Allergan, fresh off a failed takeover by Pfizer (PFE), signaled it'll focus more on improving operations than on making big buyouts in the near future. Shares rose 10.8%.A third generics giant, Perrigo (PRGO), hit a four-year low after its Q1 report on Thursday, though since it issued guidance last month there were few surprises. Perrigo fell 4.4% for the week, working on its fifth straight weekly loss.Smaller player Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed estimates, but its stock rose on news of a deal with two generic drugmakers not to sell knock-offs of its lead drug Xyrem until the end of 2025.

But Amazon stock rose 1.45%, hitting a fresh high.Macy's report followed Gap's (GPS) forecast late Monday of a 5% drop in Q1 same-store sales and weak earnings. The chain also noted a ""tepid macro environment for apparel retail.""""In light of AMZN and M's recent results, we feel more confident that AMZN will displace M as the #1 US Apparel retailer by '17,"" wrote Cowen analyst John Blackledge in a Wednesday note, doubling down on his assessment from last year.Macy's earnings fell 29% to 40 cents a share, 4 cents above views, on a 7% revenue decline to $5.77 billion that fell short of estimates for $5.93 billion.Same-store sales -- sales at facilities open more than a year -- at both Macy's-owned outlets and licensed operators dropped 5.6%. For Macy's-owned stores only, comps fell 6.1%.Shares plunged 15.2% on the stock market today to the lowest since December 2011. Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN), which report Thursday, fell 6% and 7%, respectively. JCPenney (JCP), which reports Friday, lost 1.85%. On Monday, it said it topped its own goal for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.IBD's Take: Is Macy's a premium or discount stock? And how does it compare to retail rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupMacy's is still in the best position among its department store peers, said Retail Metrics' Ken Perkins, despite Macy's recent struggles, although ""Amazon is doing so many things that a retailer like a Macy's, Target (TGT), Wal-Mart . . . just aren’t able or willing to do.""Adding to the sell-off was Macy's warning on weak consumer spending. Shares of companies not in direct competition with Amazon dropped as well, including McDonald's (MCD) and Panera (PNRA).""We are seeing continued weakness in consumer spending levels for apparel and related categories,"" Macy's Chief Executive Terry Lundgren said in a statement. ""In particular, our sales trend relative to expectations meaningfully slowed beginning in mid-March, and first-quarter results are below our original outlook.""The company now sees full-year per-share profit of $3.15-$3.40, down from its previous outlook of $3.80-$3.90 and far below Wall Street estimates for $3.80 a share. It also expects 2016 same-store sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis to fall 3%-4%, vs. prior outlook for a 1% decline.""We are not counting on the consumer to spend more,"" Lundgren said, so the department store is ""working harder to give customers more reasons to buy from us by delivering outstanding style, quality and value.""For the second straight year, tourist spending is falling in the double digits, he said, and noted a slowdown in some ""center core"" categories. But he also said that the first quarter is a ""relatively small portion of the total year"" and sees a chance to play catch-up over the next three quarters.Still, Macy's isn't exactly the next Sears Holdings (SHLD), which has seen years of falling sales and store closures.""That's a leap,"" laughed Perkins, though he also said the department store's current struggles are more than just a bump in the road.But like Sears, Macy's is evaluating real-estate proposals for joint ventures or similar arrangements. Macy's has been under pressure to spin off its real estate holdings to raise cash.

253,JWN,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has toppled Sephora to become the favorite beauty destination of average-income teen girls, says Piper Jaffray, which highlighted Ulta's rewards program and hiked its price target to 220 from 188 following the results of its semi-annual Taking Stock With Teens poll.Ulta now has 27% share among average-income teen girls vs. 15% in the previous spring, and it has gained popularity even as it sits in the No. 2 spot behind Sephora among more affluent female teens.Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink, who also raised her fiscal 2017 and 2018 profit estimates on Ulta, wrote that the price-target increase reflects confidence in the company's position as a share-gainer, as customers ""shift from legacy to emerging purchase environments.""Mass merchandisers, department stores like Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), and drugstores like Walgreens (WBA) and CVS (CVS) are no longer the de facto places to buy cosmetics and skin care products, as Ulta, LVMH's (LVMUY) Sephora and even Amazon's (AMZN) beauty offerings have grown in popularity.While teens are spending less than they used to in general, they are nevertheless willing to shell out money on beauty products, with beauty wallet share hitting a new high of 10.5% among upper-income female teens. Beauty spending rose 20% from last year among more affluent teens, the firm said, with growth in all areas: makeup, skin care and fragrance.Wissink specifically called out Ulta's rewards program as a successful lure for return customers.""From surveys of both women and teens, the single common thread is that beauty spending is rising, and the shift to specialty and (e-commerce) formats is accelerating,"" wrote Wissink in a separate note on Ulta. ""Ulta's loyalty program is a key asset, driving frequency and reinforcing a growing content library to inspire brand discovery, test & trial, and basket value.""The company's Ultamate Rewards program now has over 18 million members, with over 80% of sales coming from those customers.Shares of Ulta were up 1.7% in the stock market today. U.S.-listed shares of LVMH climbed 2.5%. Macy's and Nordstrom rose less than 1%, while Walgreens and CVS fell fractionally.And there's room for more share gains in the beauty space.""Ulta and Sephora represented over 50% of destination preferences but only 10% of industry share, implying significant runway for growth,"" she said.RELATED:Ulta Beauty’s Amazon-Resistant Model Impresses Wall StreetWhy Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.

262,JWN,"Ross Stores (ROST) will raise its minimum hourly wage for eligible employees to $10 from $9 in the second quarter to attract stronger talent, the off-price retailer said Tuesday, matching Wal-Mart’s (WMT) plans for a hike to $10 this year.The planned increase, discussed on Ross’ Q4 earnings call, echoed similar moves from retailers last year, when Wal-Mart raised wages to a minimum of $9 per hour. After Wal-Mart's pay hike, retailers like Ross, off-price rival TJX (TJX) and Target (TGT) followed.The planned pay hike also weighed on Ross’s full-year earnings per share guidance of $2.59-$2.71, which missed forecasts for $2.75. Comparable-store sales are seen rising 1% to 2%. For Q1, the company sees EPS of 69-72 cents, lower than views for 76 cents.The dimmer forecast comes amid broader fears of a recession, more aggressive off-price offerings from Macy’s and Nordstrom, and pressures for better accommodations for labor across the industry.“As we enter 2016, we continue to face our own challenging multiyear comparisons in an increasingly uncertain and volatile macroeconomic and retail environment,” Ross CEO Barbara Rentler said in a statement.“As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a somewhat cautious outlook when forecasting sales and earnings for the coming year.”Q4 earnings per share rose 10% to 66 cents, topping by 2 cents. Sales increased 7% to $3.25 billion, edging past views for $3.21 billion. Comps rose 4%.Those results came despite tough holiday promotions from rivals. The Midwest continued to be Ross’s strongest performer, while its largest region, California, outpaced the company’s average.Shares were up 0.75% after hours in the stock market today. The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 96, having cleared a consolidation in January but fizzling in the days after. Still, shares have generally found support at their 50-day line.Earlier Tuesday, Dollar Tree (DLTR) said Q4 earnings fell 13% to $1.01 per share, falling short of views for $1.07 a share. Revenue shot up 117% to $5.37 billion, thanks to the company’s Family Dollar takeover, but still missed estimates for $5.41 billion.For the year, the company guided for $3.35-$3.65 a share in earnings, below forecasts for $3.76 a share. The midpoint of targeted revenue of $20.76 billion-$21.11 billion is a hair above current estimates for $20.93 billion.Dollar Tree shares closed up 2.2%.

263,JWN,"Are department store chains sitting ducks in the new retailing jungle of the Amazon.com (AMZN)?It seems that in 2016 so far, bullish investors would disagree.IBD's Retail-Department Stores industry group has a trashy rating for six-month relative price performance -- at No. 158 out of 197 groups and subgroups as of Thursday's newspaper. Yet the group is also up more than 10% since Jan. 1. Only four other groups, including Food-Meat and Mining-Gold, can match that performance.What's more, a positive trend within the Retail sector is emerging; five more retail subgroups -- discount & variety, leisure products, apparel and shoes, restaurants and auto parts -- show year-to-date gains of 3% or more. The S&P 500 is down 5%.Macy's (M) has the largest market cap in Retail-Department Stores at $13.6 billion. The 37 RS Rating is wretched. Yet the stock is up more than 23% since Jan. 1. Even with the stout gains, Macy's is still 41% below its 52-week peak of 73.61.Macy's continues to see slumping sales; in the past four quarters, they fell 1%, 3%, 5% and 5% below year-ago levels. Yet the big box retailer is still profitable; Wall Street sees earnings in fiscal 2017 (ending in January next year) slipping only 3% to $3.80 a share. That's still sharply above the $1.29 it pocketed in fiscal 2009 amid the Great Recession.Macy's has mastered the practice of making every week feel like Black Friday. Customers are bombarded with big-discount coupons nearly every week via email, the Sunday paper or by snail mail. It seems to be working. Its one-day Saturday Sale events have brought loyal customers into its cavernous stores.Macy's strives for innovation; on Feb. 18 it unveiled a new line of men's clothing with snowboarding and skateboard superstar Shaun White. The collection pledges to reflect White's ""adrenaline-pumping, eclectic style.""Macy's has driven its annual pretax margin to the 7% to 8% level over the past five years, up from the 3% to 5% range seen from 2008 to 2011.Nordstrom (JWN), No. 2 in market cap at $9.6 billion, has rebounded in recent days following its Q4 report of a fifth quarter in a row of declining EPS (-11% to $1.17, despite a 4% pickup in sales) and is up more than 5% year-to-date. Watch to see if the stock can climb back near its 200-day moving average, near 63 for now.Kohl's (KSS)  ($8.7 bil market cap) and Dillard's (DDS) ($3 bil), both forecast to grow FY 2017 profit by 6%, are also struggling to regain their long-term 200-day moving averages.

264,JWN,"So the mkt does the dance (again).....we woke up yesterday with a renewed disaster story in oil - the commodity came under immediate pressure and by the opening bell - it was trading 4.% lower, which then caused all of the algo's to hit the sell button on stocks...and why again? Why is it that stocks are so connected to oil? Why are stocks trading in lockstep with oil?How about - the talking heads have married to the two - thereby forcing the movement on a daily basis...the thinking goes like this: If oil is weak then that MUST mean that the global economy is weak. Period - The end. Let's not even discuss the absurdity of this argument at all.....this is NOT a lack of demand issue, it is all about a huge over SUPPLY issue - and this issue is not going away anytime soon - the Saudi's have made that quite clear.The lunacy could not have been more obvious yesterday.....you see - we woke up to a buildup in crude oil supplies and the negative banking story about how JP Morgan (JPM) and others are building up reserves to cushion the blow of failing oil and gas companies and what is expected to be the next disaster for the global economy. Add in the not so vague commentary by the Saudi oil minister that they are prepared to slaughter the competition and you have every reason to think - 'Hey - this could get a bit ugly....' (never mind that none of this is new news - but that's another story).The mkt opens lower and then proceeds to trade even lower from there....by 10:30 am - the DOW was down 266 pts or 1.6%, the S&P down 30 pts or 1.5%, the Nasdaq lost 77 pts or 1.74%.....and then we got 'The News' that ignited the fire....sending oil and stocks higher.....The US Dept of Energy reported that the gasoline inventory drawdown from last week as 2.236 million barrels vs. the expected drawdown of 1.033 million barrels....so essentially we used double the amount of gasoline in one week vs. what the brain trust predicted...and this one piece of data, this one piece of fairly 'irrelevant' data (in the big scheme of things) sent the algos into a buying frenzy....Why? Because the geeks who program the computers can only think A or B. If A then do X, If B - then do Y.. in this case A & B are:IF: drawdown is bigger than expected - then initiate BUY ordersIF: drawdown is less than expected - then initiate SELL ordersSo - folks - this one data point - which on the face of it appears 'bullish' - bigger drawdown means that we are using more gas - which then means that businesses must be doing more business and consumer must be spending more money, and construction companies must be building more houses and car companies will surely be selling more cars and the summer driving season most assuredly will be full of families packing up their cars with bikes and surfboards and luggage racks and once again driving to the oceans and lakes around he country to celebrate a strengthening economy.... which then means that hotels and motels will raise prices to take advantage of this surge and KMart, Target (TGT) & Nordstrom (JWN) must be gearing up to sell more bathing suits and summer outfits and restaurants will have to remodel to handle the onslaught of Americans going out to eat.....(See how I did that...I connected all those dots with one weekly gasoline report)REALLY? We get all that out of one weekly gasoline inventory report? I mean what happened to oversupply in crude inventories that is about to bankrupt the country? It's almost comical, isn't it?Bottom line is that crude oil prices once again survived the $30 support level and now faces another test. That test is a challenge of the 50dma which is at $34.44.....A failure for oil to pierce this resistance level will ensure that oil and stocks will hit another road block. An advance up and thru the 50 dma will ignite another rally in stocks - taking us up and thru the 50 dma at 1946 on the S&P - which will then cause sellers to back off as the bulls will push the mkt back to 2000 - in what I still think is a 'counter cyclical rally inside of a bearish longer term trend - due to all of the uncertainty around the FED policy decision.Any more suggestions of multiple rate hikes will kill any move higher....one single hike will be hard enough for the mkt to swallow while other central banks move to negative rates. Multiple hikes in the face of weakening European and Asian mkts will cause investors to punish stocks in order to re-price them.And this morning we get these headlines:""Pressure on ECB Mounts as Euro-Area Inflation Revised Lower""""The Big NEW Threat to Oil Prices: A GLUT of Gasoline - Several refineries in the Midwest have opted to reduce activity for economic reasons..."" We are swimming in crude and refined gasoline products - which should only further undermine prices.....""Banks Brace for Potential Energy Losses - Drop in oil prices is hitting lenders' energy loans; latest figures are a grudging admission of the truth..."" - this is more of the Jamie Dimon story...but this time the featured bank is Wells Fargo (WFC)....and they released this statement:""If oil prices remain low for a prolonged period of time, there could be addition performance deterioration in our oil and gas portfolio resulting in higher criticized assets, nonperforming loans, allowance levels and ultimately credit losses...""Translation of that very sophisticated statement: ""We are .....(insert word that begins with ?).And so - what do the smart logic algo's think about that? Do they even have the definition of that word programmed into their memory banks? I mean that word has so many meanings.....based on how it is used, so..... I'm just sayin....
"
265,JWN,"Now this morning we are seeing European mkts in rally mode......after we saw that strong demand for gasoline yesterday....Reuters puts it this way:""Markets have taken comfort from the fact that US crude oil futures held steady in early trading on Thursday as strong demand for gasoline was offset by a new record in crude stockpiles...""How crazy is that? European investors are jumping in on stocks because Americans used more gas than expected. You can't make this up...who would really believe it? Never mind that Eurozone inflation was just revised lower - which only forces Uncle Mario's to consider MORE stimulus.....FTSE + 2.38%, CAC 40 + 2.41%, DAX + 1.47%, EUROSTOXX +2%, SPAIN +2.7% and ITALY +2.7%.US futures are now up 4 pts - teasing 1934.....resistance (1946) is now only 12 pts away....This will be the third time that we challenge it....(we challenged it on the 22nd and the 23rd) ...I would not be surprised to see us pierce it today.....It just feels like it wants to.....(it's a gut thing, nothing more).Today we will hear from Dennis Lockhart (Atlanta FED) at 8:15 am and San Francisco's John Williams at noon.Take Good Care

On Monday, Valeant said it would report its Q4 results on March 15, more than two weeks after the drug maker’s originally scheduled date of Feb. 29.Valeant delayed the report due to the return of CEO J. Michael Pearson, who had been on leave for two months while being treated for severe pneumonia. The company’s stock price tumbled late last month after it withdrew its 2016 guidance and news surfaced that it was the subject of a previously undisclosed SEC investigation.Valeant shares closed down 3.8% on the stock market today.Meanwhile, Brean Capital assumed coverage on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals with a buy rating and a 489 price target.Regeneron shares lost 3.3%.Panera was upgraded to overweight with a 250 price target by Morgan Stanley.

Baird, which has a 110 price target on the stock. Last week, the rare-disease specialist said its drug for Batten disease was on track for approval after a successful trial.

268,JWN,"Clever advances start with the inkling of an idea. How developers break gizmo ground:See possibilities. A little observation led Augment CEO Jean-Francois Chianetta to a big leap.He was shopping online and reading reviews that described a product as the biggest of its type.“With photos, you couldn’t really see that,” Chianetta told IBD.The mechanical engineer came up with a solution: “The first application with which you could visualize 3D models in the real world,” he said.Step forward. Termed augmented reality, Chianetta’s technology lets users superimpose 3D images over real-world settings via smartphones and tablets.Say a sales representative wants to show a retail client how a display case will look in his store.That rep can aim an iPad at the wall in question -- as if taking a photo -- and superimpose a 3D image of the display case onto the screen.Make it real. Client L’Oreal Professional, the beauty firm, uses the tool to help retailers eliminate guesswork when choosing point-of-sale displays.“You can also use it for design,” Chianetta said. “Before building the first prototype, you can show it to customers before it’s even manufactured.”Expand capabilities. Augment app users keep finding ways to tap the technology. Denture makers demonstrate how new teeth will look. A teacher used a 3D model of a molecule to quiz students.“For me from the start, I thought it could be used potentially by everyone,” Chianetta said. “I’m still surprised by some of the user cases.”Address a need. ChargeItSpot CEO Douglas Baldasare was on vacation in Miami with friends when he ran into a typical 21st century problem.“All of our phones were dying,” he said, and he saw they were surrounded by retail shops.“I thought: Why can’t I walk in there and charge my phone?” Baldasare said.Make it pay. While finishing his MBA at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Baldasare developed ChargeItSpot kiosks. They let shoppers charge smartphones in secure drawers.The upshot for retail clients, including Urban Outfitters (URBN), Nordstrom (JWN) and Whole Foods Market (WFM): Shoppers browse and buy while their phones charge.A study by market research firm GfK reported that shoppers using ChargeItSpot kiosks stayed twice as long in the store, “and they spent 29% more dollars,” Baldasare said.Spot weaknesses. Troubleshooting problems -- including a procedure for opening a drawer remotely when a customer forgets the security code -- was essential for getting retailers buy in.“The last thing they want is to have to manage the device,” Baldasare said.Enrich it. Retailers do want ChargeItSpot kiosks to look like they belong, so they’re wrapped in brand-specific colors and messaging.The kiosks also allow for opt-in collection of shoppers’ email addresses and mobile phone numbers, plus an option to deliver messages on store deals.“We’re looking at this as an engagement platform,” Baldasare said.Achieve finesse. “It takes a long time to get to simple.” That’s one refrain from Dana Oliver’s book “Mantra Design.”Achieving a user-friendly experience is worth the extra effort.“Trust me when I say no one wants to struggle with the application of a new technology, although customers will tolerate it momentarily if it offers them a capability they don’t presently have access to,” Oliver wrote.Rush to market with a clunky approach, and competitors will find a way to repackage it and beat you. Image provided by Shutterstock.

302,JWN,"Off-price retailers such as TJX (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST) have been among the brightest spots in retailing during recent years, and the sector should continue to outperform in the foreseeable future.
"
303,JWN,"That was the conclusion of analyst Brian Tunick of RBC Capital Markets in a detailed report that put TJX and Burlington Stores (BURL) at the top of his most favored list of off-price retailers, with outperform ratings.

304,JWN,"The top four off-price retailers — TJX, Ross Stores, Burlington Stores and Nordstrom's (JWN) Nordstrom Rack, which touts more stores than its traditional department-store counterpart — collectively gained 9% market share from midtier department stores and $12 billion of added sales since 2008, he noted, while their operating margins surpassed those of department stores.

"
307,JWN,"2. Off-price has come a long way from its ""bottom fishing"" days, when stores carried many overruns, end-of-season merchandise and damaged goods. Merchandise is fresher and more fashion forward, and includes a number of upscale brands featured in department stores, Tunick noted.

337,JWN,"Discount giant Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and high-end department store operator Nordstrom (JWN) will likely report yet another quarter of weaker earnings over the holiday season. And sales won't be so hot either.The 2015 holiday quarter was tough sledding for many retailers. Abnormally warm weather kept shelves bulging with cold-weather goods at many retailers, leading to heavy markdowns that hurt margins. Another drawback: The ongoing shift to online shopping and growing competition from e-commerce giants like Amazon (AMZN) led to a slowdown in traffic at the malls.Friday's retail sales report showed January purchases rose 0.2%. But while Amazon and nonstore retailers reported a 1.5% jump, department store sales slid 0.8%. Earlier this month, Kohl's (KSS) issued a big warning, sending its shares down 19% on Feb. 4. (Amazon, for its part, crashed 16% over five sessions after its 122% EPS gain failed to reach even-loftier expectations.)There are no such lofty expectations for Wal-Mart. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Wal-Mart to see an 11% decline in adjusted earnings from a year earlier to $1.43 a share when it reports Thursday before the open. Much of that expected EPS slide is ""attributable to increased labor costs,"" Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said in a report on Q4 retail earnings.This would be the sixth straight EPS decline for Wal-Mart, though smaller than its Q3 drop of 14%. Still, analysts expect weaker profits for the next four quarters as well.Wal-Mart's earnings have been under pressure due to costs from boosting wages, watchers say.Last month, the giant discounter announced more than 1.2 million Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam’s Club associates will receive a pay increase under the second phase of the company’s two-year, $2.7 billion investment in workers. The pay raise, which takes effect Feb. 20, will be ""one of the largest single-day, private-sector pay increases ever,"" Wal-Mart said in a statement.All associates hired before Jan. 1, 2016, will earn at least $10 per hour. New entry-level associates will continue to start at $9 per hour and move to at least $10 an hour after successfully completing the company’s new retail skills and training program known as Pathways, the company said.Also last month, the company said it will close 154 locations in the U.S., including the company’s 102 smallest format stores, Walmart Express, which had been in pilot since 2011.Analysts expect Wal-Mart's Q4 revenue to slip 0.6% from a year earlier to $130.75 billion. That would be less than the decrease the company saw in Q3. U.S. same-store sales have risen for the past several quarters.Wal-Mart shares rose 1.3% on the stock market Friday, finding resistance near the 200-day moving average.Analysts forecast Nordstrom will see Q4 earnings slip 7% from a year earlier to $1.22 a share when it reports results Thursday after the close. That would be less than the 22% earnings decline in Q3. But it would be the fifth straight quarter of EPS declines -- with the streak continuing for the next three quarters.Analysts see sales rising 4.5% to $4.224 billion.While Nordstrom is an upscale retailer, much of its growth has been in its off-price (but not cheap) Nordstrom Rack chain.Nordstrom just unveiled the footprint and exterior design of its first Nordstrom store in New York City. The store will encompass four properties in the Columbus Circle neighborhood in Manhattan. The approximately 363,000 square-foot store is expected to open in 2019.Nordstrom stock fell 0.6% on Friday.

338,JWN,"It doesn't have an online shop. It doesn't promise luxury brands. And its fluorescent lighting and long, uninterrupted racks of merchandise aim in no way to replicate the glossy feel of a Bloomingdale's or Macy's.But Ross Stores (ROST) is widely considered a solid, if not particularly flashy, find as other retailers struggle against the Web tide, and as shoppers increasingly take their business to off-price channels.""They are so well positioned. They’re one of the best,"" Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar said of Ross, adding that the off-price industry overall has hit the ""sweet spot of pricing and distribution.""Ross is also a safe bet in this  increasingly hostile world for retailers, where online giants like Amazon (AMZN) are swallowing market share away from conventional brick-and-mortar stores by the plateful.The realities of the modern retail landscape reflect a consumer base that is increasingly drawn by Amazon's gravitational pull and the appeal of ordering things online. Last summer, Cowen had predicted that Amazon would topple Macy's (M) as America's No. 1 apparel retailer by 2017.""In 2016, we believe investors can't ignore Amazon, the growing giant in the retail world,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen said in a recent note to clients. ""We suggest buying companies who can offer an 'un-Amazon-able' brand proposition.""Ross appears to have done just that. It is included in that brief list of companies impervious to Amazon's market-share grab, along with off-price retail rival TJX (TJX), upscale furniture retailer Restoration Hardware (RH), Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) and beauty-product vendors Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH) and Ulta (ULTA).The distinction is notable for this unassuming chain of off-price stores, since the rest of the retail field has been working hard to fend off the creeping advance of e-commerce.Macy's has turned each and every store into a mini-fulfillment center in order to expedite online shipping orders. Nordstrom (JWN), known for its tech spending, has set aside $1.5 billion, or 35% of its $4.3 billion five-year capital plan, for tech and supply chain investments.Even TJX has an e-commerce presence, though it remains a relatively small one. In general, selling items online isn't easy for off-pricers that have a revolving door of merchandise.""Such a potpourri is not necessarily conducive to traditional online (shops),"" said Cowen's Chen.Visitors to Ross's website won't see any online offers, and no way to peruse its inventory outside of a physical store. Could its lack of an e-commerce segment hurt the company down the road?""I don’t think it’s a big issue right now,"" said William Blair analyst Daniel Hofkin. ""Could it become a big issue over time? Sure, it could. At this time, they don’t feel it could be profitable.""An online shop would bring greater access to shoppers.""I think it merits exploration because the reality is, with the prevalent use of mobile phones, it’d be nice for them to tap into that device that everybody has,"" said Chen. But with a selection of mostly low-ticket items, ""the main issue is shipping costs.""Hofkin highlighted one benefit that TJX has seen from its online efforts; it is reaping incremental traffic from customers who stop by stores to make returns and wind up picking up a few things while they're there. That happens about 70% of the time, he said.But shoppers are likely to want to visit Ross stores in person, even stopping by brick-and-mortar locations as often as once a week, said Chen.""It’s about the treasure hunt -- that isn’t something that you can replicate online,"" he said.Ross also retains other advantages.Unseasonably warm weather late last year prompted an inventory pileup for many stores, which in turn prompted heavy discounting as cold-weather gear didn't leave shelves as quickly as hoped. Other retailers' inventory management was ""appalling"" last year and over the holiday season, said Morningstar's Weishaar.But Ross is not expected to shoulder the same burden from winter's toasty start as its department-store brethren -- in fact, weather woes for other companies can translate to cheap buys for off-pricers, which often source from overstocked suppliers.""(It can) allow (Ross) and TJX to buy some excess merchandise in the marketplace at substantially better prices, which can support future sales and margins,"" William Blair's Hofkin said via email. ""(Ross) also likely has less weather exposure, given its larger (California) and sunbelt presence.""Between 20%-25% of Ross Stores are located in California, he said.Analysts also highlight Ross's buying strategy. The company purchases a lot of ""packaway"" inventory, i.e. basics that can be bought at a low price now but then sold seasons later, regardless of what's in fashion.While high inventory levels aren't generally regarded as a positive for most retailers, Ross' 48% packaway level doesn't trouble Wall Street. Morgan Stanley's Kimberly Greenberger called it a ""strategic advantage"" and wrote in November that packaway ""typically provides (Ross) customers with the greatest value and produces the highest merchandise margin, enhancing financial returns.""How does Ross rate against its primary rival, TJX, the parent of T.J. Maxx, Home Goods and Marshalls? Both are broadly well-regarded. Both have been outperforming their retail peers.The TJX customers, though, tend to come from from a wider range of household incomes, and they generally spend more per visit than the average Ross customer. TJX products also have higher price points. T.J. Maxx, for example, stocks a selection of high-end items more in line with what one might find at Saks Fifth Avenue, including $600 Versace watches and Fendi purses that go for a ""discounted"" price that is still nearly $3,000.Ross also is a domestic play. As of the end of its most recent quarter, the company had 1,276 Ross Dress for Less locations in 34 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, plus 172 DD's Discounts across 15 states. Conversely, TJX operates stores in Canada, Europe and most recently Australia, with its 2015 acquisition of Trade Secret.Ross shares are up roughly 13% over the last 12 months, in stark contrast to its broader category, IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry group, which has fallen 16%.Ross's third-quarter earnings for the period ended Oct. 31 grew 13% to 53 cents a share, topping views by three cents. Revenue growth of 7% to $2.78 billion pulled ahead of forecasts for $2.77 billion.Management is ""solid as a rock,"" said Cowen's Chen. ""I think they have good strategies that are balanced.""What kind of speed bumps could Ross encounter in the future?Wage increases could put pressure on margins, noted several analysts. But the minimum wage hike in California -- which is now $10 an hour as of the start of 2016 -- could also help Ross, said Chen, as the lower-income shopper now has more money in his or her pocket.And deeper discounts at Macy's and other department stores could also lure in bargain hunters as competition for shoppers heats up.Ross declined to provide comment for the story. Its executives generally do not grant media interviews, said a Ross spokesperson.""There’s a certain degree of privacy because in the industry you don’t want to reveal too much to your competitors,"" said Chen, ""and because there’s competition for goods and competition for how you should change your store to capture share.""

"
345,JWN,"TJX (TJX) topped estimates and raised its guidance going into the all-important holiday quarter, and the off-price retailer doesn't appear to be burdened by the same inventory and pricing issues that plague full-price peers.In contrast to Macy's (M) and Nordstrom's (JWN) weak results and forecasts last week, TJX lifted its full-year same-store sales growth estimate to 4%-5% from a prior outlook for 3%-4% growth. Q3 earnings edged up over 1% to 86 cents per share, topping by 2 cents, and revenue grew over 5% to $7.75 billion, vs. views for $7.73 billion.""It's a broader reflection of core middle- and lower-income consumers, which makes up 70% of the population,"" Retail Metrics' Ken Perkins told IBD. ""They are looking for value.""TJX shares climbed 3.85%, and Wal-Mart gained 3.5%.Fourth-quarter and full-year guidance fell short of expectations, however, as the company accounted for a variety of factors — including its late October acquisition of Australian off-pricer Trade Secret — that should weigh on EPS growth by 9%.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (WMT) saw a 14% drop in Q3 EPS to 99 cents, topping by a penny. Revenue dipped 1.3% to $117.4 billion, missing views, but U.S. comps grew for the fifth straight quarter amid turnaround efforts.Shift In Spending HabitsA ""healthy U.S. consumer backdrop,"" cleaner stores and upgraded staffing, among other factors, will likely drive holiday demand at Wal-Mart, noted Cowen & Co.'s Oliver Chen, who has a market perform rating on the stock.But Wal-Mart still faces competition from Amazon (AMZN), said Perkins, and the big-box retailer is also feeling the heat from dollar stores like Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR).Weighing on traditional retailers and department stores is a shift in spending habits. Perkins pointed to off-pricers' post-recession success as a reason why Macy's, Nordstrom and other companies are pursuing the discount space themselves, with offshoots like Macy's Backstage, Nordstrom Rack and Saks Off Fifth, among others.And in an increasingly cutthroat shopping environment that pits brick-and-mortar shops against Amazon and other online shopping destinations, the battle is being fought on several fronts.But shoppers also aren't as interested in apparel, say both Perkins and Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. Those dollars are going into a variety of different areas, including home goods and bigger-ticket items such as automotive needs.Outside of cheaper products, another advantage that off-pricers like TJX and Ross Stores (ROST) have is faster and higher inventory turnover, giving it a flexibility that makes it more akin to fast-fashion favorites Forever 21 and Zara than Macy's or Nordstrom.""The ones that are outperforming right now are the ones that are most responsive to what consumers want,"" Weishaar said.Traditional retailers have a six- to nine-month lead time for orders, she explained, while off-pricers can buy merchandise much closer to the start of each season. This helps to ""weatherproof"" against factors such as, say, a warmer fall that keeps shoppers enjoying the changing foliage instead of shopping for snow boots.When asked about the impact of warm weather — which several other retailers have blamed in recent earnings reports — TJX CEO Carol Meyrowitz said that she'd ""rather not talk about weather,"" focusing instead on her team's performance.""That's all about execution and delivering the right product to the right stores at the right time,"" she said on the post-earnings call. ""Every year, we learn and we get better at weatherproofing our business. It just comes back to the model — we keep ourselves very flexible.""For department stores, improving lead time is easier said than done, said Perkins. ""It's like trying to turn around a battleship.""The good news for shoppers, at least, is that Santa's likely to deliver plenty of discounts for the holidays.Perkins said he expects the promotional environment to be ""comparable, if not even steeper"" and potentially more aggressive than last year's holiday quarter, as retailers try to get rid of leftover inventory from the fall.Weishaar was even less optimistic: ""It's going to be horrible. It's going to be one of the worst we've seen in a long time.""

363,JWN,"Hoping to simultaneously bolster online sales and foot traffic in their brick-and-mortar locations, prominent department store chains and other retailers are aggressively shifting to omnichannel commerce. This form of retailing blends in-store and online shopping in a way that — if done successfully — taps into consumers' increasing penchant to check out new products online, particularly apparel, while capitalizing on…
"
364,JWN,"Handbag and accessories retailer Vera Bradley (VRA) beat third-quarter forecasts, helped by reduced promotions and stronger margins, and predicted a strong holiday quarter.Q3 EPS jumped 28.5% from a year ago to 27 cents, far better than views for a decline to 20 cents, reversing a trend of sinking profits in recent quarters. Sales rose 1.2% to $126.7 million, above expectations for $121.1 million.Vera Bradley's overall comparable sales sank 9.5%, as less promotional activity sent e-commerce sales down 19.1%. But for stores, comp sales declined 2%, ""which is a meaningful improvement in the trend from prior quarters,"" the company said.Vera Bradley shot up and closed 46.1% higher in the stock market today, touching its highest intraday level since March. The report contrasts with those from retailers like Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), which have warned of the effects from unseasonably warm weather.On Wednesday, Lululemon (LULU) also reported earnings weighed down by mounting inventory and issued weak guidance. Lululemon shares dropped 13%.But despite new products and management changes, Vera Bradley has struggled to draw customers. Consumers' interest in cotton-quilted bags, a mainstay for the company, has waned, and the company ""will have to work hard to educate consumers about the changes taking place and establish credibility in non-cotton product,"" Jefferies said in August.Vera's gross margin widened to 57.9% in Q3 from 52.5% a year ago, driven by sourcing efficiencies, made-for-outlet products, and reduced promotional activity.""In our full-line stores and on verabradley.com,"" CEO Robert Wallstrom said in a statement, ""we eliminated our hyper-promotions of 60% to 70% off and pared back our promotional days by approximately 50% during the third quarter.""The company expects fourth-quarter EPS of 40-43 cents, topping estimates for 39 cents. Expected sales of $151 million-$155 million came in above views for $149.18 million.Vera Bradley forecast fourth-quarter gross profit percentage of 58.3% to 58.7%.The results come as the handbag sector struggles to find a style or trend to drive meaningful business. Jefferies has also suggested in recent notes that more people are spending money on footwear, which has benefited from the popularity of athleisure.The investment firm also said that cash-strapped millennials are buying fewer handbags, and instead are ""increasingly dedicating their dollars toward experiences rather than material items.""However, the firm said handbags are unlikely to go anywhere: as people accumulate more electronic devices, they'll need something to carry them.Women's apparel retailer Francesca's (FRAN) also rallied today, gaining 6.2% after the company reported strong Q3 results and guided Q4 results above views.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

Saks OFF 5th and (Nordstrom) Rack, b) larger-scale incumbents where brands are key like (TJX's) T. J. Maxx (and) Marshall's, and c) price-conscious budget off-price stores incl.

498,JWN,"Target (TGT) topped on revenue and boosted its profit outlook, but that wasn't enough to fortify investor confidence in the big-box retailer as online sales slowed ahead of the holiday shopping season.
"
499,JWN,"Online sales grew 20%, a deceleration from the previous quarter's 30% growth. Target's Q3 digital sales missed management's earlier guidance for 30% year-over-year growth, said Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen in a Wednesday report.

586,JWN,"Did department stores Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) move their earnings out of the doldrums and back onto the growth track in the third quarter?Investors will learn the answer when the two top department stores kick off retail earnings season and report quarterly results this week. If analysts' expectations are on target, both companies will see their earnings decrease.So far, the signs aren't good, analysts say. The department store group saw their shares get hammered on Monday as several negative reports came out on the segment.Macy's shares tumbled after Citigroup lowered its price target on the retailer. Deutsche Bank also issued a negative report on Macy's and other mid-tier department store operators Kohl's (KSS) and Dillard's (DDS), noting they ""may be about to limbo underneath what is already a very low bar as they report potentially very underwhelming Q3 results and Q4/holiday guidance.""Macy's shares closed down 5.4% on the stock market today.JPMorgan also issued a negative report on several department stores on Monday noting Macy's, Dillard's, Kohl's and Nordstrom have ""too much cold-weather inventory,"" among other things. Nordstrom shares closed down 4.7% on Monday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Macy's to see earnings decline 13% from a year earlier to 53 cents a share when it reports third-quarter results on Wednesday before the opening bell. That comes on top of a 20% drop in the second quarter.They see a 1.6% decline in sales to $6.1 billion, following a 3% decrease in the second quarter, to mark the third straight quarter of year-over-year earnings declines.Macy's is generally regarded as a well-run chain, with a strong sales channels, but it has reported lower year-over-year revenue in five of the last seven quarters.The sales trend comes as spending has been shifting from traditional shopping-mall department stores and apparel chains toward experiences and non-tangible goods such as wireless services and entertainment, amid ever-growing competition from Amazon (AMZN) and other online players.Investor's Business Daily's department store industry group ranks retailers No. 192 out of 197 industry groups.Macy's has recently undertaken a number of initiatives to propel growth, including entering the lucrative off-price retail arena, where it would compete with operators such as TJX Cos. (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST). In September, Macy's debuted its new off-price retail brand, Macy's Backstage, with three New York City metro area stores and three more set to open in 2015.Nordstrom is also generally regarded as a well-run chain with a strong omnichannel presence. The company has fared particularly well with its growing chain of Nordstrom Rack off-price stores.Nordstrom is expected to see earnings slip 0.7% vs. a year earlier to 72 cents a share when the high-end department store operator reports third-quarter results on Thursday after the close. That would follow a 2% decline in adjusted earnings in the second quarter and mark the fourth-straight quarterly drop in earnings.Analysts expect the upscale department store operator to see a 7.4% rise in revenue to $3.4 billion. That would follow a 9% gain in sales in the second quarter.On Oct. 1, Nordstrom announced that it closed the sale of its credit card portfolio to TD Bank USA for $2.2 billion. The agreement also makes TD Bank the exclusive U.S. issuer of Nordstrom-branded Visa and private-label consumer credit cards.In connection with the closing, Nordstrom's board authorized a special cash dividend and an additional $1 billion share repurchase program. The company said it would pay a special cash dividend of $4.85 a share on Oct. 27, to shareholders of record on Oct. 12.Follow Marilyn Much on Twitter @IBD_MMuch.

Revenue rose 189% to $20.2 million.CEO Yehuda Shmidman said the company has ""fully integrated"" the Jessica Simpson brand, which was acquired in April.Sequential reaffirmed its revenue forecast for the full year of $78-$81 million, excluding the pending impact of the Martha Stewart acquisition.Beder noted that Martha Stewart will allow Sequential a ""deeper relationship"" with Macy's (M), while adding new partnerships with Home Depot (HD), PetSmart and Staples (SPLS).Ellen Tracy, he added, is rolling out this fall in Nordstrom (JWN), Lord & Taylor and Dillard's (DDS), among other venues.More license agreements are expected this year.

"
612,JWN,"While apparel company Oxford Industries (OXM) tries to find a buyer for its struggling Ben Sherman brand, it plans to step up nationwide expansion of Lilly Pulitzer, now popular among women across generations as well as incomes.
"
613,JWN,"It will also keep growing Tommy Bahama, its No. 1 brand, globally.
"
614,JWN,"'Foundation Brands'
"
615,JWN,"Oxford, with roots in men's suits and button-down shirts, is all about beachy casual wear now.
"
616,JWN,"In the firm's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release on March 26, CEO Thomas Chubb called Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer ""foundation brands.""
"
617,JWN,"And in a conference call that followed, he said: ""In both Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer, we believe we have cultivated a deep and powerful emotional connection with our customers.""
"
618,JWN,"After Oxford announced in the Q4 report that it was looking for a buyer for Ben Sherman — and that earnings in the quarter grew 21% from the prior year — the company's shares jumped 19% the next trading day.
"
619,JWN,"Tommy Bahama is targeted to an older and more affluent demographic than Ben Sherman's edgy, young male demographic. It markets to men and women 35 and older who, as Oxford likes to say, ""embrace a relaxed and casual approach to daily living.""
"
620,JWN,"Ben Sherman ""is a little bit out of their wheelhouse,"" said Pamela Quintiliano, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, who described the brand's heritage as ""60s rocker working class.""
"
621,JWN,"""It's more of a mid-tier brand and they tried to stretch the price point too high and alienated customers,"" she said.
"
622,JWN,"If Lilly Pulitzer was alienating to certain women outside of Palm Beach in its early years, that's not the case now.
"
623,JWN,"""There is a feeding frenzy for the (Lilly) product,"" Quintiliano said, driven by its ""aspirational"" appeal from its tony heritage and limited distribution in full-priced stores, largely in the East. ""Lilly has almost a cult following.""
"
624,JWN,"Lilly also happens to be in the ""sweet spot"" of current fashion trends, which are all about ""color, prints and patterns,"" said Quintiliano. ""And obviously that's what Lilly Pulitzer is about.""
"
625,JWN,"Analyst Eric Beder of Wunderlich Securities notes that Lilly ""has pretty much been a winner for Oxford from the get-go."" He also says that Oxford added much-needed retail expertise after it bought the brand in 2010.
"
626,JWN,"Lilly's growing appeal is partly the result of a national ad campaign launched this year by Target (TGT) .
"
627,JWN,"The campaign counted down the days until Target's April 19 launch of Lilly Pulitzer products. Target's limited, one-time launch gave customers the chance to buy into the brand for prices as low as $10 to $20.
"
628,JWN,"Too Hot To Handle
"
629,JWN,"The promotion essentially ended the same day it started. Items sold out within minutes at besieged Target stores as well as on the company's website, which went down from too much traffic.
"
630,JWN,"Target got bad press for being unprepared (again) to handle heavy volumes. But Oxford ended up sitting pretty. It got free publicity and enhanced consumer awareness for the brand.
"
631,JWN,"""Target spent more on the ramp up of that launch than Lilly spends in a year,"" said Beder. ""To get the Lilly name in front of consumers positions Lilly for more aggressive growth.""
"
632,JWN,"The Target promotion also lets Lilly know where demand is strongest for potential store openings and test how well certain products for the home did, Quintiliano says.
"
633,JWN,"Lilly Pulitzer operates 28 company stores. Another 70 ""Signature"" stores are franchised. All sell resort-wear-inspired apparel and related merchandise for women and girls. Many items in the new summer collection are priced from $100 to well over $200.
"
634,JWN,"Oxford plans to push Lilly stores farther West. Six store openings are planned for this year, the most that Oxford has ever opened in a year since it bought the brand.
"
635,JWN,"""Lilly Pulitzer has a lot of runway to go beyond the East Coast,"" Quintiliano said.
"
636,JWN,"Oxford also intends to open eight to 10 Tommy Bahama stores in the U.S. and internationally, including Japan and Australia. A planned store in Honolulu's Waikiki neighborhood will include a restaurant.
"
637,JWN,"Tommy Bahama ended last fiscal year with 157 retail stores globally, up from 141 a earlier year.
"
638,JWN,"Its stores carry casual apparel and beachwear as well as sandals, home goods and gift items. Most are full-price stores; 15 have linked restaurants.

"
642,JWN,"Oxford's total revenue during the quarter rose 10% from a year earlier to $274.5 million, with Tommy Bahama accounting for $186 million and Lilly Pulitzer $34.8 million.
"
643,JWN,"The rest came from Ben Sherman and Lanier Clothes' branded and private-label men's suits, sportcoats, separates and dress slacks.

644,JWN,"Oxford has been trying to fix Ben Sherman ahead of the brand's sale. Though Ben Sherman's sales have improved, it's still losing money, just not as much as before.

"
646,JWN,"Oxford's total revenue for the full year climbed 9% to $997.8 million. Earnings also rose in the single digits but are expected to climb in double digits this year with Ben Sherman out of the picture.
"
647,JWN,"Oxford excluded Ben Sherman from this year's forecast, which calls for net sales of $965 million to $980 million and adjusted per-share earnings of $3.45 to $3.60. That's up from an adjusted $920.3 million and $3.46, respectively, in 2014, excluding Ben Sherman.

""Outlet centers are a much more prominent part of the retail landscape than they were just 10 or 15 years ago.""While high-end mall owners and quality shopping center operators are expected to perform well this year, in a recent report Stifel analyst Nathan Isbee said most of the new development among the mall REITs has been focused on outlet centers.""The outlet center industry is experiencing a building boom, delivering eight outlet center openings in both 2012 and 2013 and another six in 2014, well above the historical average of (two to three) centers,"" he wrote.Simon Property Group (SPG) and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (SKT) are the two ""dominant"" outlet center developers, he adds, noting both have ""robust"" development pipelines in the U.S.Last month, Tanger and its 50/50 joint venture partner started construction on the newest Tanger Outlet center in Southaven, Miss., which is located four and one-half miles south of Memphis, Tanger said in a press release announcing fourth-quarter results Tuesday.

The REIT opened three outlet centers in 2014. It has four new outlet centers currently under construction, including ones in Gloucester, N.J.; Tucson, Ariz; Tampa, Fla.; and Vancouver, British Columbia, which will come online in 2015, Isbee says.High-end retailer Nordstrom (JWN) is among the store operators expanding its off-price concept, Nordstrom Rack. Nordstrom has 167 Nordstrom Rack stores and has announced plans to open 26 new stores in 2015, spokesman Dan Evans Jr. told IBD in an email interview.Among the openings planned for this year is a Nordstrom Rack at The Mall of Louisiana in Baton Rouge, La. The roughly 30,000-square-foot store is scheduled to open in fall 2015. The mall is owned and managed by General Growth Properties (GGP).""The Rack is a great fit for our overall strategy to serve more customers in more places in more ways,"" said Evans. ""The Rack also allows us to introduce the Nordstrom brand to customers who have never shopped with us. We serve customers through four channels: Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack stores, online full price at Nordstrom.com, and online off-price at Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook. We hope that by focusing on the customer and making it as easy, convenient and relevant for them, we are able to improve their experience with Nordstrom wherever they choose to shop with us.""While the Rack is a ""growing part"" of Nordstrom's business, online — primarily Nordstrom.com — continues to be the fastest-growing, Evans said.Simon Property Group, General Growth Properties and Tanger Factory Outlet are part of IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group.

The consumer discretionary sector is leading Q3 earnings growth, which is expected to continue in 2016, says a recent S&P Capital IQ report.…

659,JWN,"Home Depot reported strong third-quarter earnings and same-store sales Tuesday amid the housing recovery, after a series of weak retailer reports triggered a recent sector sell-off.

But Evercore ISI analyst Greg Melich said there has been an overemphasis on…
"
660,JWN,"Investment bank RBC Capital Markets on Monday turned Best Buy (BBY) into a ""best sell"" as it cut its rating on the stock to sector perform from outperform and lowered its price target to 36 from 42.Best Buy shares were down over 1% to below 32 in midday trading on the stock market today.""We have become increasingly concerned over what appear to be deteriorating sales trends in the consumer electronics channel,"" RBC analyst Scot Ciccarelli said in a report Monday. ""Specifically, government sales data for CE/appliances has continued to weaken on both a one- and two-year basis, and the last time we saw multiple months of negative CE retail sales growth (before this current streak) was late 2013/early 2014, when Best Buy missed its holiday sales plan.""Even Costco (COST) couldn't buck the recent trend as its October consumer electronics sales turned negative, Ciccarelli said. He also noted that major retailers Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) had missed top-line projections recently.""When combined with Best Buy's historical volatility around the holidays (since Q4 accounts for 50%-60% of earnings) and our view that the company needs to post sustained comp improvement for the stock to re-rate higher, we believe a more cautious stance is prudent,"" Ciccarelli said.On the plus side, Best Buy has vastly improved its competitive positioning through price-matching Amazon.com (AMZN) and others, and forming in-store vendor partnerships with technology leaders such as Apple (AAPL), Samsung, Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, he said. These moves have helped Best Buy gain market share in consumer electronics retail.Best Buy is scheduled to report fiscal third quarter earnings before the market open on Thursday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to earn 35 cents a share, up 3% year over year, on sales of $8.83 billion, down 2%, in the October quarter.For the holiday sales quarter, analysts are modeling for Best Buy to earn $1.45 a share, down 2%, on sales of $13.90 billion, down 2%.Ultrahigh-definition, or 4K, television sets are likely to drive sales in the holiday season and through 2016, Ciccarelli said. But recent fast-growth categories such as fitness wearables, led by Fitbit (FIT), and action cameras, led by GoPro (GPRO), are showing signs of maturity, he said.Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter on Monday maintained his neutral rating and price target of 37 on Best Buy stock.He expects the company to post robust Q3 results thanks to strong management execution and growth in appliance sales.RELATED:GameStop weakness exposed by retail sales report.Ultra HD TVs going mainstream this holiday season.
"
661,JWN,"Never mind ""Let It Snow."" Heading into the crucial holiday shopping season, retailers are more likely singing ""Let It Go"" from the movie ""Frozen"" as they try to shake off disappointing quarterly earnings results and a bad week that collectively sank merchant stocks.Nordstrom (JWN), Macy 's (M), J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS) were among those that reported the week of Nov. 9, with Nordstrom and Macy's turning in weak results and discounted forecasts, and J.C. Penney and Kohl's shares falling despite beating consensus views.An October retail sales data miss — a worse-than-expected 0.1% gain — didn't help either, though Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce sellers notably logged a 7.1% rise from the previous year as consumers continue to do much of their shopping online. Cowen & Co. predicted in July that Amazon would knock out Macy's as the top U.S. apparel retailer by 2017.Even much-lauded off-pricers haven't been immune to the pummeling that retail stocks were subjected to over the past week. Shares of TJX (TJX), the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, lost 12% over the past week.In a possible sign of things to come, Q3 same-store sales at Nordstrom's off-price arm, Nordstrom Rack, fell 2.2%.""This type of miss from Rack is surprising to us, and we acknowledge the Rack's off-price slowdown could be a negative indicator for TJX,"" wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen on Friday.But he added that TJX, which reports Tuesday, could ""offset some secular weakness"" based on a few factors, including the strength of the company's sourcing and buying teams, home goods offerings and international reach.The company is expected to report a slight earnings dip of 1% to 84 cents a share. That would mark the third straight quarter of earnings deceleration and a swing from earnings gains of 7%, 8% and 15% in the three preceding periods.Revenue is seen rising 5% to $7.73 million, which also would reflect a slowdown.With a 75 IBD Composite Rating, TJX is the highest ranking member of IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which ranks a feeble 144 out of 197 groups.Peers in the group include Ross Stores, Foot Locker (FL), L Brands (LB) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO).Fellow off-pricer Ross Stores (ROST) gapped down ahead of its Thursday earnings release, losing 11% for the week. Analysts expect over 6% EPS growth to 50 cents on 6% sales growth to $2.77 billion.And what about the big-box retailers?Target's (TGT) earnings are seen accelerating, with a predicted 59% climb to 86 cents a share on a 1% revenue dip to $17.57 billion. Shares retreated 6.9% last week.And Wall Street expects Wal-Mart (WMT) earnings to slide 15% to 98 cents a share on a 1% revenue decline to $117.79 billion. Shares slid 4%.""We believe retail is in a state of transition as brands wrestle with how to compete against growing & dynamic pureplay online retailers,"" wrote Chen.RELATED:Retail Sales Weak, Except For Amazon, EcommerceMacy's Stock Selloff Could Be Tip Of Iceberg4 Reasons TJX, Off-Price Retailers Will Keep Surging.

""Outlet centers are a much more prominent part of the retail landscape than they were just 10 or 15 years ago.""While high-end mall owners and quality shopping center operators are expected to perform well this year, in a recent report Stifel analyst Nathan Isbee said most of the new development among the mall REITs has been focused on outlet centers.""The outlet center industry is experiencing a building boom, delivering eight outlet center openings in both 2012 and 2013 and another six in 2014, well above the historical average of (two to three) centers,"" he wrote.Simon Property Group (SPG) and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (SKT) are the two ""dominant"" outlet center developers, he adds, noting both have ""robust"" development pipelines in the U.S.Last month, Tanger and its 50/50 joint venture partner started construction on the newest Tanger Outlet center in Southaven, Miss., which is located four and one-half miles south of Memphis, Tanger said in a press release announcing fourth-quarter results Tuesday. Tanger expects the center to be completed in time for a holiday 2015 opening.Construction of the other new developments the company intends to open in 2015 is ""ongoing,"" it said.  Current plans include an April 2015 opening at Tanger Outlets Savannah; a May 2015 grand opening at Tanger Outlets Foxwoods, at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Conn.; and a third-quarter 2015 grand opening at Tanger Outlets Grand Rapids, in Grand Rapids, Mich.The company and its 50/50 joint venture partner expect to be able to start construction of Tanger Outlets Columbus, a pre-development stage project in Columbus, Ohio, in time to complete construction and open the center during the first half of 2016.Most of Simon Property Group's new development activity is concentrated in the outlet center sector, Isbee said. The REIT opened three outlet centers in 2014. It has four new outlet centers currently under construction, including ones in Gloucester, N.J.; Tucson, Ariz; Tampa, Fla.; and Vancouver, British Columbia, which will come online in 2015, Isbee says.High-end retailer Nordstrom (JWN) is among the store operators expanding its off-price concept, Nordstrom Rack. Nordstrom has 167 Nordstrom Rack stores and has announced plans to open 26 new stores in 2015, spokesman Dan Evans Jr. told IBD in an email interview.Among the openings planned for this year is a Nordstrom Rack at The Mall of Louisiana in Baton Rouge, La. The roughly 30,000-square-foot store is scheduled to open in fall 2015. The mall is owned and managed by General Growth Properties (GGP).""The Rack is a great fit for our overall strategy to serve more customers in more places in more ways,"" said Evans. ""The Rack also allows us to introduce the Nordstrom brand to customers who have never shopped with us. We serve customers through four channels: Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack stores, online full price at Nordstrom.com, and online off-price at Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook. We hope that by focusing on the customer and making it as easy, convenient and relevant for them, we are able to improve their experience with Nordstrom wherever they choose to shop with us.""While the Rack is a ""growing part"" of Nordstrom's business, online — primarily Nordstrom.com — continues to be the fastest-growing, Evans said.Simon Property Group, General Growth Properties and Tanger Factory Outlet are part of IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group.

""The decline in energy should add billions in spending. Some of that will accrue to malls. The real question is how much and will that be enough to offset the impact of store closings?""The top firms should still be regional mall REITs that focus on ""A"" malls — those that sell the most per square foot and tend toward more upscale retailers and trade areas — real estate experts say.""Class A malls should continue to have low vacancy and strong rent growth (in 2015),"" said Severino. ""But for the remainder of the subsector, vacancy could actually rise, and rent growth will probably accelerate only slightly.""At year end, the national mall vacancy rate was 8%, up 10 basis points for in 2014. Rents grew by 1.8% during that year, says Severino. He forecasts that in 2015, rents should grow by roughly 2% to 2.5%.But the national vacancy rate is not likely to change much in 2015 as store closures will offset rising demand and the outlook for lower-caliber malls ""is murkier,"" he said. ""Although a strengthening recovery in the economy and labor market, coupled with a decline in energy prices, should bolster the subsector, this will compete against the store closings (in lower-caliber malls) of some important retailers such asJ.C. Penney (JCP) and Sears (SHLD).""Class A OverachieversStifel Nicolaus analyst Nathan Isbee is also upbeat about prospects for ""A"" malls. ""Retailer demand for high-quality mall space will remain robust in 2015 from international and domestic retailers,"" he wrote in a report, calling high-quality mall space is ""extremely limited.""General Growth Properties is his top regional mall pick for 2015. The REIT focuses exclusively on owning, managing, leasing and redeveloping Class A regional malls and urban flagship locations in the U.S., spokesman Kevin Berry told IBD.He says the firm believes that owning these retail properties positions it well for the long term.Generally, he adds, the properties' leases have ten-year terms with annual contractual increases in rent. ""On average, 10% of the leases expire,"" he said. ""The majority of the annual revenue (is) in place when the year begins.""General Growth Properties' strategy since Sandeep Mathrani became CEO in 2011 has been the creation of a redevelopment/expansion pipeline of projects, Berry says. As of Dec. 31, the firm had development and redevelopment activities totaling about $2.4 billion ""at share,"" of which projects totaling about $418 million have opened, $1.2 billion are under construction and $825 million are in the pipeline.Redevelopment is all tenant driven, says Berry. General's largest redevelopment project is at Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, which it is expanding with a new luxury wing anchored by Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom (JWN). General also focuses on improving the shopping experience by adding options such as movie theaters and restaurants, which give shoppers more reasons to come to the malls and spend time.""Mall vacancies in the U.S. are currently at a five-year low of 5.7% and at 5.5% for just the major markets,"" said Greg Maloney, CEO of the Americas Retail Group at commercial real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), citing real estate data company CoStar as the source.He says that malls are going into 2015 with probably the best fundamentals seen in the past five years.""Liquidity and appetite for product has been here for a few years, but now consumers are feeling much better about the economy, and that is the driving force,"" he adds. ""We now have positive momentum. Retailers are looking to expand with new stores, and there's a renewed interest in terms of retailers looking for new space.""He says that there's some new mall development for the first time in a long time, including three or four projects that JLL is doing.Isbee notes that shopping center REIT fundamentals are ""healthy as occupancies are approaching or exceeding pre-recession levels.""Kimco Realty is among REITs he rates a buy. It operates North America's largest publicly traded portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers. CEO David Henry calls fundamentals for such shopping centers strong. ""We've been very fortunate that there's been no new building of shopping centers for six years,"" he told IBD.While the supply of centers hasn't grown, the U.S. population has grown at between 2.5 million and 3 million people a year. And the need for restaurants, grocers, dry cleaners and other businesses has grown with the population.""That's why occupancies are moving up and all the vital signs are looking good for shopping centers,"" he said, adding that shopping centers are still in ""recovery mode"" and rents not back to all-time highs. But he says Kimco is benefiting from more demand and limited supply.Henry says that occupancy at ""quality"" centers is at 95%, close to Kimco's all-time high of 96% before the recession.Redevelopment Vs. New MallsKimco has been doing a lot of redevelopment, he says, and the best place to invest capital is in its own properties — the value of projects in the pipeline is nearing $1 billion.Most of the new development among the mall REITs has been concentrated on outlet centers, with six opened in 2014, says Isbee.David Ober, president of Global Outlet Management, says that among the reasons behind building more outlet centers is retailers' desire to include outlet stores as a part of their ""omnichannel"" distribution mix along with full-price stores.Still, Garrick Brown, vice president of research at property services firm DTZ, says, ""We are nearing a saturation point"" in outlet center building and adds that there's room for only ""a little more product.""""Everyone wants to jump on this bandwagon to build these because they have performed so well in recent years,"" he said by email. ""But they will probably build too many.""

730,JWN,"Holiday hiring is in full swing, and this year — like last year — the biggest employment gains are expected in a handful of retail sectors, according to the Pew Research Center.In November, clothing companies and department stores accounted for more than half of retail job gains, adding 121,600 and 114,700 jobs, respectively, noted Pew Research in a report issued Friday.Last year, nearly a third of the retail-job surge over the holidays occurred in clothing/accessories stores, with 202,400 jobs added from October through December. Department stores followed with 177,400 new jobs.Retail payrolls typically rise 3% to 4% between October and December, Pew said. Some 626,200 retail jobs were added in November and December last year, for a 4.1% gain over the earlier year.Other big holiday hirers are general merchandise stores and sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores, Pew said.Macy's (M) announced in late September that this year it would hire seasonal associates for about 86,000 positions at its Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores and in other parts of the company, up about 3.6% from 2013, with 10,000 of the jobs based in fulfillment centers that support online ordering and other aspects of Macy's ""omnichannel"" selling strategy.This holiday shopping season is broadly shaping up stronger than expected so far in terms of retailer revenue, despite some reports of a lackluster Black Friday. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 5% year over year in November, according to a Retail Metrics index, while forecasts had called for just a 3.4% rise.Considering factors such as earnings growth and stock market gains, Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX (TJX) are the highest-rated stocks in IBD's retail-apparel group, which is ranked 34 out of 197 industry groups in stock market performance. Nordstrom (JWN) and Macy's are the highest-rated stocks in the retail-department store industry, though the sector itself is ranked relatively low.What happens after all that holiday hiring? What goes up must come down. Retail payrolls typically fall 5% to 6% between December and February, Pew's research noted. Last year, the retail sector shed 888,000 jobs in the two months after December. That was more than the number hired over the holidays, as some retailers with disappointing results laid off staff or closed poorly performing stores.""If history is any guide, retail payrolls will rise again this month before dropping sharply after the New Year,"" wrote Pew Research's Drew DeSilver.Sectors that don't much change their hiring policy over the holidays are nonseasonal grocery and drug stores and building materials and garden supply stores, which hit their peak payrolls in summer.Related: Costco, Gap Lead Solid November Holiday Start.

"
744,JWN,"Steep early promotions led to a disappointing Thanksgiving weekend. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) and other online rivals continue to take a bigger slice of a limited retail pie.Still, retailers are on track to deliver the best holiday season in three years.Michael Niemira, principal of The Retail Economist, is sticking to his forecast for combined November-December sales growth of 2.9% after a Scrooge-like 0.9% increase last year. That's based on Census Bureau's GAFO (general merchandise, apparel, furniture and other, including electronics and sporting goods), and would be the best gain since 2011.""The key difference this holiday vs. last year and the last few years is the stronger economy, which is the underpinning for holiday spending,"" Niemira said.Mobile Still ActiveTop gift items were consumer electronics, especially mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, says Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst. Home decor products, small appliances and activewear were also big winners, he says.Bill Martin, founder of ShopperTrak sees retailers on track to show a 3.8% gain in GAFO sales for November and December.""That's a pretty good number,"" he told IBD.November retail sales rose 5.4%, fueled by an ""early push"" that helped offset an underperforming Thanksgiving weekend, says Martin. It took until the week before Christmas for consumers to get ""ramped up again, which is going on right now.""Sales on the last pre-Christmas Saturday likely rose 0.5% above last year to about $9.16 billion, according to Martin's preliminary tally. That would just top Black Friday's sales of roughly $9.1 billion, making Super Saturday the No. 1 shopping day for the first time in 10 years.Thomson Reuters analysts see December same-store sales rising 4%, up from 2013's 3.5%.""That suggests shoppers hit the malls this month,"" said Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research, via email.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, says it was a ""decent holiday, fueled by a good jobs picture and significantly lower gas prices.""But apparel was ""soft"" due to a lack of fashion and as consumers focused spending on other areas, such as home furnishings, electronics and accessories.Best Buy (BBY), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD) were among retailers with good holiday sales, he says.Thomson Reuters analysts forecast the home improvement segment will be the big winner in the November-to-January quarter with a 5.3% same-store sales rise, followed by footwear at 4.6% and jewelry at 4.1%.""The season shows that the consumer is alive and kicking a lot harder than you would think,"" adds Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors. ""You really got a good feel of what 5% GDP (growth) meant for retailers during this holiday.""Consumers were buying the priciest items at stores such as Best Buy, J.C. Penney (JCP) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Sozzi said. At Best Buy they snapped up GoPro (GPRO) action cameras and the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.Expensive lightweight jackets and hoodies from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) were also hot, says Sozzi.Cohen says the season turned out OK. ""Retailers had an early start, a lull (later) that was expected, and a strong finish through Christmas (Eve),"" he said. ""Now they have the gift cards, the returns and exchanges. There's still more revenue to come for retailers.""Retailers Didn't 'Panic'Retailers did a ""very good job"" all year managing inventory, including doorbusters, Cohen said. Except for mall-based apparel chains, they mostly stuck to their planned holiday promotions, a good sign for profit margins.""They weren't in a panic mode,"" Cohen said.Perkins estimates holiday online sales — from pure play e-tailers to brick-and-mortar stores — rose 15%, with traditional chains' online business up 10% to 15%.He says traditional stores such as Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) are getting a ""handle on"" ecommerce with features like ordering online and in-store pickup.""They're doing a better job of capturing online sales and not just feeding them to Amazon.""

774,JWN,"Gordon Segal was clueless about retailing when he opened the first Crate & Barrel in 1962.He forgot to buy a cash register for opening day.He didn't realize that he was selling many products at cost when overhead was factored in.The store lost rising amounts of money for the first four months.But Segal learned from his mistakes and studied masters of upscale retailing such as Nordstrom (JWN) and Neiman Marcus.By the time he retired in 2008, the privately held Crate & Barrel had $1.3 billion in annual revenue and was profitable, with 7,000 employees and 104 stores.""Retailing is like theater,"" Segal told IBD. ""The store is the stage, with scenery, lighting and music. The products are the script — each item has an interesting story. The employees are the actors who make it come alive and bring the customers back.""And C&B's customers have indeed come back.Stanley Marcus, former CEO of Neiman Marcus, told Inc. magazine in 1985 that Gordon Segal is ""one of the great merchants of this century.""Illinois RiseSegal, 75, was born into a restaurant family in Chicago.He earned a business degree from Northwestern University in 1960 and went to Europe to study restaurant supply houses for a fresh perspective on the industry he expected to enter.The next year, he and his new wife, Carole, honeymooned in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where they discovered European shops with snappy housewares that they had seen sold for much higher prices in America.Back home, Segal began wondering whether there might not be a lot of other young couples with good taste and no money who would buy well-designed items for the home at an affordable price.In 1962, the Segals spent $7,000 to refurbish a factory in Old Town Chicago and bought $10,000 — worth $77,000 now — of unique merchandise from European manufacturers.They didn't have money left for fancy displays, so they opened the shipping crates and barrels, and put them on the floor, underscoring the store's no-frills, direct-import value.As they grew more sophisticated in creating a distinctive look that would also drive sales, they drew attention with big stacks of merchandise, rough-hewn wood shelves, music, spotlights and lots of plants.Later, they brought in furniture and pioneered vignette displays, like a dining room with the table set and accompanying decor.These days, C&B stores have a sleek Northern European look.Segal emphasized to employees the need to build long-term relationships rather than pushing hard for the immediate sale.A thick handbook explains how to treat customers. Also at the stores, employees undergo product training to make them passionate experts. Most managers rise from the ranks and are not above helping customers on the floor.Neither was Segal. He was there daily for the first 15 years.""I liked to hire teachers and others with upbeat personalities,"" Segal said. ""We didn't call them salespeople. They were merchandising specialists who would manage a department of 1,500 or 2,000 square feet like a ministore.""We created jobs that would be challenging for intelligent people. Competitors would try to copy us but didn't really understand what we were doing, and 30 days later their stores looked disheveled.""Barbara Reimann, who retired as executive vice president of C&B's operations in 2012, said: ""Gordon's curious nature, entrepreneurial spirit, passion for the details and enthusiasm are a winning combination and contagious. He constantly elicited feedback from associates on the front lines, knowing they were closest to the customer, and he's a great listener and wants to hear it all. He would tell them if they were comfortable in their jobs they weren't growing, and he encouraged them to take on new responsibilities in uncharted waters.""Associates knew that the company's leadership cared about and respected them. That's why the longevity at the company was remarkable; 15 and 20 years was common. I was there over 37 years.""C&B signs explain the origin of each item to emphasize its quality and uniqueness.One current example: ""Our picnic-style indoor dining table is handcrafted of Northern European solid Baltic pine certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. Historically used by the British Royal Navy for ship masts, Baltic pine is extremely strong, with very few knots due to the colder climate. Select planks are hand-planed by skilled craftsmen, wire-brushed to bring out the grain and then whitewashed in a multistep process.""Right from the start, Segal periodically went to Europe to seek out small companies that were not represented in America. Some had been burned by department-store buyers, who placed large initial orders and promised more. The vendors had expanded, but the stores didn't follow through.Global ReachSegal had to build trust so they would ship to him on credit.Eventually, he also established solid relationships with unique producers from India to the Far East.Segal aimed to grow slowly to make sure the formula was right.""We wanted to be the best, not the biggest,"" he explained.His wife retired to start their family in 1965, and it would be another three years before Crate & Barrel opened a second store in suburban Wilmette, then a third in Oak Brook in 1971.Its first store outside the Chicago area was in Boston in 1977.Eight years later, the firm had reached 17 locations, bringing in $50 million a year, with a cult following for C&B's combination of high style and affordable prices.In need of cash to expand, Segal was afraid to go public because the market could be unforgiving of mistakes. But he wanted the benefit of ""being able to take risks and learn from the experience.""So in 1998, he sold a majority stake to the Otto Group, a giant German direct marketer, which became sole owner when he retired 10 years later and the family sold its shares. ""They were great partners, and it was a pleasure running the company with them,"" Segal said.Going YoungIn 2000, C&B opened CB2, a home furnishings division geared to young adults, then set up a partnership with the founders of Land of Nod, which sells children's furniture and gifts.Meanwhile, C&B made a name for itself with sales online and by mail, especially with its bridal registry. When Segal stepped down, online accounted for a quarter of sales. Now it's 32%, says the firm.""The Internet is a wonderful way to do research, but it doesn't replace the excitement of going into a store, where you can discover things that would go well with what you already knew you wanted,"" said Segal. ""If you want to buy a good sofa, you really need to try it out, to understand the quality of the wood construction, to see if the seats have enough cushioning, how the springs feel, and if the height is right for your legs and it's a good fit.""Said Reimann: ""I didn't have an MBA, but I earned a virtual Ph.D. in retailing by working with Gordon. He's a true leader. You'd often hear associates use the expression 'WWGD' — which stood for 'What Would Gordon Do?' He inspired people to work as a team; there was no 'I,' just 'we.'""Lately, the Segals have a Chicago office investing in startups with entrepreneurs ""who have the energy, communication skills and products we think will be useful,"" he said.He also heads up the educational properties committee on new buildings at Northwestern University and serves on the board of the University of Chicago Medical Center, looking for research projects, especially those aimed at pancreatic cancer, which has befallen close friends in and out of C&B.Sascha Bopp became CEO of C&B in 2012, with company headquarters in Northbrook, Ill.Some of its toughest competition comes from Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Restoration Hardware (RH), Pier 1 Imports (PIR) and Sur La Table.

859,JWN,"As the retail first-quarter earnings train moves full speed ahead this week, investors will get an idea of how high-end players Tiffany & Co. (TIF) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM) fared during the harsh winter when they report results on Wednesday.If followers are on the money, the two retailers likely saw both sales and earnings heat up during the quarter as consumers braved the cold weather and stepped up the pace of spending.Luxury consumers have been reaping the benefits of stock-market gains and increased home values, which have helped buoy spending at retailers that cater to this crowd — retailers like Williams-Sonoma and Tiffany.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect upscale jeweler Tiffany to see earnings rise 11% from a year earlier to 78 cents a share when it reports before the opening bell Wednesday. That would follow a 5% rise during the holiday fourth quarter. Sales are seen increasing 6.6% to $955.63 million. That would be up from a 5% increase in the prior quarter.High-end home-goods retailer Williams-Sonoma is seen showing a 7% increase in Q1 earnings to 44 cents a share when it deliver results after the close Wednesday. Analysts expect it to report a 6% increase in sales to $941.88 million.The high-end retail segment also includes players like upscale department store operator Nordstrom (JWN), which beat Q1 earnings views Thursday.

860,JWN,"The team at Vince Holding wasted no time getting its high-end contemporary fashion brand all glammed up with new products and categories after hitting the Wall Street runway late last year.Vince is a premium clothing brand known for its collection of everyday luxury essentials for women — from slouchy cashmere sweaters and understated leather jackets for colder temperatures to flowy silk blouses and linen pants for the warm seasons.Since going public in November, Vince (VNCE) has woven a new pattern for growth, which includes expanding its product offerings into new categories such as handbags. The idea is to evolve into a lifestyle brand and strengthen its position with the company's wholesale partners, including upscale department stores such as Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom (JWN) and Saks Fifth Avenue (owned by Canada's Hudson's Bay (HBC), as well as its own namesake retail stores.Men And Children NextIn addition to women's clothing, which accounts for about 85% of sales, Vince offers women's footwear through a licensing arrangement and is about to launch men's footwear with the same licensing partner, Brown Shoe (BWS). The line will come out in July, according to WWD.com.Vince also plans to launch children's apparel through a licensing partner in this year's second half. Early next year, the company plans to launch a handbag collection and other accessories.""This is a company that starts with a very distinct point of view in apparel, which today makes up the majority of its business,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy.""It's taking that everyday luxury aesthetic and pushing it into different categories,"" she said. ""The biggest opportunity is their next big launch of handbags and accessories in early 2015.""The move into handbags and accessories would put Vince in a market between players like ""jet-set"" lifestyle brand Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) and traditional European luxury players such as Celine and Louis Vuitton, Murphy adds.Murphy says that Vince is positioned to fare well in this category. It's a premium brand that's priced closer to luxury than so-called ""accessible luxury,"" she says, with sweaters from around $225 to $400, leather jackets at $995 and tops from $100 to $200.""What's unique about its positioning is it's taking what we believe is white space in the handbag market,"" said Murphy.She expects Vince's handbags to be priced between $700 to $1,000 in department stores, which she says would be a ""sweet spot.""There are few brands around that price point, she says, which means Vince could capture not only the ""trade-up consumer but the trade-down consumer.""That price would compare with handbags priced at around $300 to $400, where there are many competitors — such as Michael Kors, Coach (COH), Tory Burch and Kate Spade (KATE).Sweet Spot In PricingThe luxury end of the market is priced between $1,200 and $3,000.As Vince extends into accessories, it has a ""good opportunity"" in that space, Murphy adds.""It already has a captive audience in the premium wholesale market domestically because of how well it's performing in women's apparel,"" she said.Murphy says that Vince prevails as the No. 1 contemporary apparel brand in Nordstrom, Saks and Neiman Marcus.Vince has been faring handsomely on the financial front with its current lineup of products. In its fourth quarter ended Feb. 1, its first as a public company, earnings grew 15% to 23 cents a share. Sales grew 21% to $87.8 million.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect earnings to rise 21% to 88 cents a share in 2015. They see a 30% gain in 2016 and a 13% increase in 2017.Prior to the IPO and related restructuring transactions, Vince Holding was a diversified apparel company operating a broad portfolio of fashion brands, including Vince. As a result of the IPO and the related restructuring transaction, the non-Vince businesses were separated out, and Vince became the sole operating business of Vince Holding.Management is eying several growth drivers for the company in addition to expansion into new product categories.Covering New TerritoryAs of March 27, Vince had 28 stores in the U.S., 22 of which are full-price stores and six of which are outlet stores. It's on track to open six to eight new stores in the 2014 fiscal year, with a ""strong pipeline for 2015 and beyond,"" said CEO Jill Granoff on the fourth-quarter conference call.Murphy estimates that Vince could grow its retail-store base domestically to 100 over time.As of Feb. 1, Vince products were sold to consumers via about 2,300 points of distribution through its wholesale partners.Vince's U.S. wholesale business represented 71% of sales in fiscal 2013, and international wholesale represented 8%.In fiscal 2013, Vince opened 90 new shop-in-shops globally in the wholesale channel, and it expects to open more.""Given the success"" of its shop-in-shop investments last year, it's planning to open an additional 15 to 25 domestic shops in fiscal 2014, to bring the total at the end of fiscal year to 26 to 36 domestic shops, Granoff said on the call.On the product front, the company is looking to expand its existing categories with an ""increased focus"" on outerwear and dresses, said Granoff. It's also planning to launch an ""elevated"" product assortment in its men's business in the fall.Vince is also pursuing international expansion, which includes opening free-standing stores.The company recently opened its second Vince store in Istanbul, Turkey, with its distribution partner. Vince is also actively looking to lease its first international showroom in Paris to further build the brand's European business, Granoff said.William Blair & Co. analyst Amy Noblin called Vince a ""rapidly growing accessible-luxury brand"" in her initiation report on the company.She said it's ""well positioned"" to capitalize on three trends including the ""growth in the number of and wealth of global luxury consumers; a designer customer that is trading down; and consumers increasingly cross-shopping and mixing higher- and lower-end merchandise.""Noblin says the Vince brand has developed a ""cult following"" for its everyday luxury essential products.""The brand differentiates itself through a clean, modern and somewhat timeless aesthetic that is comfortable and effortless,"" she wrote.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Macy's to post a 7.3% increase in earnings from a year earlier to 59 cents a share when it reports first-quarter results before the open on Wednesday.

That would follow a 1% rise in Q1, but also would be the third straight quarter of single-digit profit gains. Revenue is seen rising 7.2% to $26.67 billion. That would be a faster pace than the prior quarter's 5% increase.Nomura analyst Robert Drbul initiated coverage on Costco with a buy rating in a Feb. 12 report. But he noted some challenges: ""While we are positive on the name, we note that head winds from FX have had a material impact on company results and anticipate this to continue throughout 2014,"" he wrote.On a positive note, he said: ""We admire the business model, membership fee renewal rates, consistent traffic gains, global square footage opportunity, and prospects for higher penetration of margin accretive private label products. We believe a premium valuation is warranted. We are also drawn to the warehouse club industry's membership fee structure, as it provides high visibility and predictability into the company's earnings.""Drbul is ""optimistic"" about the company's expansion opportunity. Costco aims to add 5% in total square footage this year, or around 30 new warehouses both domestically and overseas, he says. He expects a run rate of 30 to 35 new stores through 2016, with roughly half opening internationally.""We view international expansion as a great opportunity for both top-line growth and margin expansion as international stores are more profitable,"" he said.He pegs Costco's Q2 earnings at $1.18 a share.Retailers have faced some tough sledding this holiday-quarter earnings season with disappointing results the past week or so from many top chains, including giant discounters Wal-Mart Stores (WMT)andTarget (TGT)and upscale department store operator Nordstrom (JWN).Overall, Q4 retail earnings are expected to fall 6.1% from a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. That's actually a little better than prior estimates, thanks to better-than-expected results from Best Buy (BBY) and Sears Holdings (SHLD). That would compare with forecasts for S&P 500 earnings growth of 8.5%.

Nohe cited the rapper's business savvy — a lucrative endorsement deal with Vitamin Water, plus his own clothing line, body spray and energy drink. ""I think people don't just see him as a rap artist,"" Nohe told IBD. ""50 is an interesting guy. He never sleeps.""

"
1094,JWN,"What's the backbone of world-class customer service? Mint these habits at your firm:• Catch the ring. Think you can't afford your call center? Think again, says behavioral psychologist Jodie Monger. Her Sterling, Va.-based consultancy, Customer Relationship Metrics, helps firms figure out how to channel caller data. ""This is not a call center; this is a profit center,"" she told IBD. ""Individuals answering these calls have an idea of what's causing pain for these customers.""Knowing what's wrong from the buyer's viewpoint is a key ingredient to making strong corporate decisions, she notes.• Hear. ""The best ideas come from customers,"" Lianna Shen of clothing firm Zappos.com told ""The Zappos Experience"" author Joseph Michelli. ""They help us see things we would have never seen.""Monger agrees. Push beyond surveys, she stressed: ""If you have a static form of listening to customers, you are at risk of not being there five years from now, when everybody's talking about who's in the industry.""• Train to wow. Show workers the difference between really helping clients and passively offloading inventory, Monger teaches. Don't let time limits and scripts strangle that relationship. Build rapport with every contact.• Be zealous. ""When you feel passionate or you feel involved or engaged with what your company does or what you are selling, you are rising to a new level,"" said executive coach Ellen Lubin-Sherman, author of ""The Essentials of Fabulous.""Staffers who don't love working at your firm are a liability. Enthusiasm is such a vital ingredient that after a lengthy training period, Zappos offers a sizable sum — Michelli says it's close to $4,000 — to those recently hired who decide they'd rather do something else.""Zappos offers new hires an incentive to engage in a thoughtful self-assessment of their 'goodness of fit' with the company,"" he wrote.Lubin-Sherman tells the story of her son, who once worked at Nordstrom (JWN) for a month during one of its summer sales. His customer service training at the department store lasted three days. Then he had to take a test.""They didn't put you on the sales floor until you had passed the test,"" Lubin-Sherman said. ""He was selling men's socks, but he sold them like he was selling sports cars.""• Think like a healer. Front-line workers are in a unique position to tend to buyer well-being. A fully engaged rep will zero in on any opportunity to stitch customer bonds.View problems — particularly those that crop up more than once — as a path to improvement.""Take unstructured comments and make them into structured conversation,"" Monger said. ""Report that to the organization at large.""• Keep things fresh. Service is tough, Monger explains, and there's a shelf life to how long someone can maintain motivation at a call center or service counter.Understand the rate of burnout at your firm. Bust it through training opportunities, promotions and incentive programs.• Bridge. One Zappos rep once spent seven hours on a call with an elderly lady who was trying to find a pair of shoes she'd glanced at in a magazine in her doctor's office. It's an oft-repeated incident in Zappos history, yet outside the industry norm, even for that customer-savvy company.The real-world take-away, according to Monger: Become an active participant in your client's experience. ""Are your customers recognizing that these folks are in fact advisers,"" she said. ""Or are they still looking at them as order takers?""

1100,JWN,"The brand ""stuck with logos maybe a little bit longer than they should have,"" Macquarie analyst Liz Dunn told IBD. But fixing things that ain't broke can seem counterintuitive, and Coach rode on a C-encrusted wave of popularity until it petered out.

1127,JWN,"Shares of Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) slipped as much as 6% Tuesday after the firm laid out an ambitious five-year growth strategy “to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world.” ahead of its Investor Day meeting.Why Are Investors Doubtful?Tuesday’s dip is a reflection of investor concern about Nordstrom’s profitability moving forward. The company reaffirmed its fiscal year 2018 outlook, projecting $15.2 to $15.4 billion in net sales on between $3.35 and $3.55 in earnings per share. It also maintained comps growth projections of 0.5% to 1.5% for the year. Furthermore, Nordstrom expects net sales to grow 3% to 4% on an average annualized basis from 2017 to 2022These numbers fit within our Zacks Consensus Estimates of $3.45 in earnings per share and $15.7 billion in revenue. However, it is worth noting that firms are typically conservative in issuing guidance numbers.There are concerns about JWN’s competition with e-commerce brands such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other trendy names, as well as slowing foot traffic in malls. Edward Yruma, an analyst at KeyBlanc Capital Markets, downgraded the company from Overweight to Sector Weight, citing concerns about capital burden of the firm’s various initiatives. His argument is that while the moves are solid, they are not stopping the overall consumer trend of gravitating towards online shopping.Is Nordstrom Performing That Poorly?The short answer is no, not really. In its most recent earnings report, Nordstrom saw earnings of $0.51 per share on revenues of $3.56 billion, representing a 37.8% and 5.8% respective year-over-year increase. Both metrics comfortably topped our Zacks Consensus Estimates of $0.42 per share and $3.47 billion.A key highlight from the report is the company’s digital performance. Specifically, it saw an 18% increase in digital sales and a 4% boost in digitally-enabled sales contribution. The firm also expanded its physical presence, opening eight stores and closing one. Four of the stores were part of its full-price division and are located in New York City, Toronto, and Calgary, while the other four are its off-price Nordstrom Rack line. Nordstrom projects $1 billion in sales opportunity from its Canada expansion by 2020.Another point worth noting is that the company’s locations saw a 0.6% overall increase in comps for the quarter, which while positive is softer than expected. However, this is due to the cannibalization of off-brand store sales by the company’s growing online segment.Investors may also be concerned about the company’s profit margins. It lowered again by 21 bps to 34.1%, after a decline of 25 bps, 12 bps, and 42 bps in the second, third, and fourth quarters of FY17. While this downward trend is a reasonable source for concern, it is a result of the company spending cash to launch new locations and invest in digital technology. In other words, the company is sacrificing a portion of profitability now to make more cash later.  Earlier this year, the Nordstrom family attempted to take the company private through a $50 per share purchase proposal, representing a slight discount to the nearly $52 per share at the time. However, the board of directors turned down the deal, feeling that it was not in the best interest of the company. This could be seen as a sign that the board is confident in the company and its growth initiatives. They may be on to something, as shares of Nordstrom are performing respectably year-to-date compared to industry counterparts:OutlookThe market also seems to realize that Tuesday’s reaction was overblown, as shares of JWN are up 1.8% in morning trading on Wednesday. It sits just about 1% lower than its pre-announcement value, with the stock having now corrected most of the 6% loss that it saw through mid-day trading on Tuesday.While brick-and-mortar retail is under fire by the rapid rise of e-commerce, Nordstrom is positioning itself to grow in market share and reach a larger overall consumer population. Doing so will require money, making the short-term decrease in margins necessary and justified.The firm has seen mostly downward earnings estimate revisions for the current and following quarters, but revisions for the fiscal year are mostly positive, with six upward versus two downward revisions. This mixed activity has Nordstrom currently sitting at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Nordstrom’s ambitious growth plans still appear to be within reach, but cautious investors might consider continuing to monitor the firm moving forward.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

However, it was in beta phase up till now and available through invitations only. Now it is available to the U.S. Prime members.Amazon intends to enrich customer experience through this move. This will enable the customers to place the order online from separate section of Prime Wardrobe on its site. Following the placement of order, customers will get the wardrobe box delivered.

In fact, fashion retailers like Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Stitch Fix (SFIX  -  Free Report), Buckle (BKE  -  Free Report) to name a few, witnessed share price decline following the announcement of Prime Wardrobe last year.Further, Prime which is a subscription-based service will help Amazon to strengthen competitive position against Nordstrom owned Trunk Club, Stitch Fix and Le Tote.Moreover, the company has gained a competitive advantage against Stitch Fix which offers a shopping service similar to Prime Wardrobe.Nevertheless, Amazon seems to be more customer-friendly as it allows the customers to select the items unlike Stitch Fix which makes the collection for its customers.Consequently, Amazon will be able to grab significant portion of U.S. fashion market with all the above mentioned Prime benefits and other endeavors.Currently, Amazon flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1130,JWN,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is JWN due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Nordstrom Beats on Q1 Earnings & Sales EstimatesNordstrom reported solid top- and bottom-line numbers for first-quarter fiscal 2018 as both earnings and sales surpassed estimates. Results gained from the shift in Nordstrom’s loyalty event to the first quarter this year. This marked the company’s fourth earnings beat in the last five quarters and the third positive sales surprise in four quarters. However, the company’s comparable store sales (comps) were softer-than-anticipated due to soft off-price sales, reflecting from outsized digital growth.Nordstrom’s adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share for first-quarter fiscal 2018 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents. Additionally, earnings improved 37.8% year over year from 37 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.RevenuesTotal revenues advanced 6.2% to $3,561 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,468 million.

Further, the company had solid inventory position at the end of the reported quarter as net sales growth exceeded 2% decline in inventory. Additionally, merchandise margins were in line with expectations and the prior year, reflecting persistent momentum in regular price selling trends.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 32 bps to 32.3%.

As part of the plan, the company anticipates capital expenditure of $3.2 billion or 4% of sales, mainly directed toward investments in digital capabilities and new market opportunities in Manhattan and Canada. Further, the company plans to return value to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company bought back 0.3 million shares for $13 million. Following this, nearly $401 million remained under the current buyback authorization.

1131,JWN,"It is no secret by now that consumers, especially millennials and younger generations, increasingly desire products that are more convenient, up-to-date with currents trends, and reasonably priced. That is especially evident in the fast-paced and dynamic fashion retail industry, as shown by “fast fashion” and its effects on the entire business.The term fast fashion is defined by retailers that attempt to mimic current fashion trends as quickly as possible—at a price that general consumers in the clothing sector can afford. Companies are able to keep up with fluctuating trends and produce the products in a cost-efficient manner through the use of extremely advanced supply chains and dedicated market research.The Rise of Fast FashionThe move towards fast fashion was initially lead by innovation-focused companies like Zara (IDEXY  -  Free Report) and H&M. These European brands were able to revolutionize the fashion retail industry in the early parts of the 21st Century and become household names.An example of a company that has more recently been able to take advantage of the trend towards fast fashion is lifestyle brand Urban Outfitters (URBN  -  Free Report), which is known for catering to a mainly young adult demographic through hip and stylish merchandise.  The stock has soared since this time last year, with prices climbing up over 150% to its current position at around $44.One of the key drivers in the company’s progress has been its ability to accurately adapt to the newest fashion trends, and it is only expected to continue doing so in the future, according to analysts.  Increased analyst bullishness is one part of why Urban Outfitters currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Another recent victory for fast fashion was Japanese company Uniqlo partnering with tennis legend Roger Federer. The $300 million deal made headlines due to the shock value of someone as well-known as Federer leaving sports apparel giant Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) for the lesser known Uniqlo.The tennis star’s new sponsor doesn’t even focus mainly on sports like Nike does, but instead would be labeled as a fast fashion brand that tracks the world’s latest trends. Although it may not be a major hit for Nike right now, the move showed the power of fast fashion and its potential for even greater growth in the future.Traditional Retail’s ResponseCaught right in the middle of the fast fashion and online shopping storm are traditional retailers that have been staples in the clothing sector for a long time, including Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report).In order to survive, these major companies are forced to make decisions on how to respond to the changes in today’s retailing and clothing landscape. It comes with no surprise that both companies have already made moves in attempts to maintain their positions in the industry.On Tuesday, Nordstrom laid out a new five-year growth plan that was clearly influenced by the fast fashion movement. The plan centered on boosting the company’s e-commerce presence as foot traffic at malls has continued to decline.  However, the announcement was mainly met with negative reactions due to the costs associated with implementing all of the initiatives. It seems as if the company may have adjusted to consumer trends too and will now have to fight to catch up.While it’s still unclear as to how Nordstrom’s initial moves will play out, its apparel retailing counterpart, Kohl’s, struck gold with its own solution. The company signed a deal with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) in September of 2017, and the massive partnership has paid off big time, with the stock rising 64% since the move was announced.  Kohl’s teaming up with Amazon tremendously bolstered the retailer’s evolution towards becoming more convenient and faster.Bottom LineThere is no denying the shift towards clothing that is easily accessible and consistent with the latest fashion trends. Investors should take note of fast fashion brands, like Urban Outfitters, which are perfectly suited to the new fast-paced environment in retailing.On the other side, Nordstrom, Kohl’s, and similar traditional retailers should be looked at with greater caution as they continue to deal with how to adapt to fast fashion. These companies will have to pursue innovation and continue making strategic initiatives to stay at the forefront of retailing. Clothing retailers like Kohl’s that make successful changes should see growth, while others could be left behind.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1133,JWN,"Shares of Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) have climbed 10% over the last four weeks in a sign that investors might be anticipating strong quarterly financial results from the retailer. Let’s take a look to see what they should really expect from Gap in the first quarter.Gap follows a slew of other retail industry giants which have all reported their quarterly earnings results over the last few weeks, including Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), J.C. Penny (JCP  -  Free Report), and  Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report). Not all of these companies have performed well following the release of their Q1 earnings, which means Gap could be under even more pressure on Thursday.With that said, Gap stock has surged 42.5% over the last year as it successfully faces down continued pressure from online sellers such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), while also adapting to changing shopping patterns. However, a poor quarter could easily see Gap stock slip—at least in the near-term.Gap Q1 OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Gap’s quarterly revenues to climb by 4.9% to touch $3.61 billion. Moving on to the opposite end of the income statement, the company’s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to soar by 25% to reach $0.45 per share.Unfortunately for investors, Gap has experienced some downward earnings estimate revision activity recently. Meanwhile, investors also need to understand what chance Gap has to top our earnings estimate as this could help its stock price climb, especially following its earnings release.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, either way.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.Gap is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and sports an Earnings ESP of -0.37%. This means that investors can consider GPS a stock that could fall short of quarterly earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Thursday.  However, it is also worth remembering that the retailer’s earnings are still expected to surge by 25% from the year-ago period.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1135,JWN,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) announced that comfort-focused lifestyle brand — Tommy John — will expand its retail footprint by opening a store at SouthPark shopping mall in Charlotte, NC.The new store is slated to open later this summer in a 3,000-square-foot space between Neiman Marcus and Belk. This will mark Tommy John’s second brick-and-mortar outlet at a Simon property after its retail store launch at the iconic King of Prussia mall in suburban Philadelphia last October.Tommy John's physical store development is being helped by Simon Property through its New Business Team. This team makes diligent efforts with online brands to go from 'Clicks to Bricks.’The opening of a new store by Tommy John at SouthPark is a strategic fit. Developed in 1970 in the affluent SouthPark neighborhood, it is the largest shopping mall between Atlanta and Washington, D.C. The mall, which is anchored by Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Belk, Dillard's (DDS  -  Free Report), Macy's (M  -  Free Report) and Neiman Marcus, enjoys elevated demand for space.Notably, a rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences to online channels has jeopardized the traffic flow in malls. In fact, with e-commerce grabbing market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. Amid these, tenants are also demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. Such an environment has cast a pall over retail REITs like Simon Property and others.However, Simon Property is making every possible move to counter this challenging situation. The company is undertaking strategic measures to help online retailers fortify their physical presence, besides taking steps to support omni-channel strategy.Moreover, recently, the company announced the continuation of its plan to recapture the former Sears locations across its portfolio, transforming those into retail, fitness, dining and entertainment hubs, and thereby drawing more traffic at these destinations. In fact, it is making heavy investments not only to elevate the value of its retail properties, but also for exploring mixed-use development option which has gained popularity in recent years.Nevertheless, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and therefore, would limit any robust growth in the company’s near-term profit margins. Also, rate hike has added to its woes.Simon Property has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1136,JWN,"Bargain hunters continue with their shopping spree, as U.S. retail sales tick up again in the month of April, after rebounding sharply in March. Although the rate of sales growth moderated from the prior month, it still clearly indicates that the economy remains well on track after a muted start to the year. Evidently, consumers are splurging on clothing, grocery and furniture.In spite of recent hiccups in the stock market, Americans look much more confident now buoyed by strengthening labor market, tax reform and rising incomes. Certainly, consumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy — is likely to remain strong in the months ahead, unless arrested by a spike in gasoline prices that might lower their propensity to consume.Retail Sales Continue to Pop UpThe Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in April advanced 0.3% to $497.6 billion, following an upwardly revised reading of 0.8% gain in March. Analysts pointed that retail sales remained soft in the months of February and January, as consumers cut back on their spending due to delay in tax refunds. As a result, consumer spending increased 1.1% in the first quarter, marking the lowest growth rate in a span of roughly five years.Notably, retail sales improved 4.7% from April 2017. The report suggests that sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers inched up 0.1%, while sales at furniture & home furnishing stores rose 0.8%. Meanwhile, sales at both food & beverage stores and building material dealers grew 0.4%. Receipts at gasoline stations rose 0.8%, while sales at clothing & clothing accessories stores improved 1.4%. Sales at non-store retailers climbed 0.6% and surged 9.6% from the prior-year period.However, sales at sporting goods, hobby, book & music stores dipped 0.1%, while at food services & drinking places the same fell 0.3%. Sales at electronics & appliance stores edged down 0.1%.Retail Stocks to Continue MomentumPick up in retail sales is welcome news for retailers, whose fortunes depend upon consumers’ willingness to spend. A robust job market with unemployment rate at 3.9%, massive tax cuts and sound economic fundamentals are likely to boost consumer confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending. Certainly, favorable economic indicators along with friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current regime bode well for the sector.For obvious reasons, retailers are the end gainers. With digital transformation in shopping, retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores. Moreover, National Retail Federation’s projection of an uptick in U.S. retail sales of 3.8-4.4% this year raises optimism. Additionally, the recent cut in corporate tax rate will allow retailers to channelize the surplus money toward best possible alternatives.Notably, the Retail-Wholesale sector has advanced roughly 10% in the past six months and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of approximately 5%. The sector’s progress card this reporting cycle also looks quite impressive.Markedly, total earnings of the S&P 500 retailers that have already reported results increased 24.8% on the back of 13.6% jump in revenues, per the latest Earnings Outlook. Well, about half of the retailers in the S&P 500 index released their quarterly outcomes, with 70% topping bottom-line estimates and 60% delivering positive revenue surprise.Wrapping UpWith several retail behemoths queued up to report their quarterly numbers, the sector is likely to remain in the limelight. So, picking up stocks that are likely to trump estimates will be a prudent move. This is because a stock generally picks up steam on an earnings beat.These are stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP. Well, our research shows that the chance of a positive earnings surprise of stocks with this combination is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +8.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Let’s take a quick look to see how J.C. Penney’s top and bottom lines are projected to perform and if it is expected to beat or miss earnings estimates.J.C. Penny has seen its stock price fall 46% over the last year and 25% during the last 12 weeks.

1143,JWN,"It has been a busy week for retailers, with industry giants from Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) to Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) all reporting their first quarter earnings results. But Q1 hasn’t treated all of these companies the same, so let’s take a look at a few more big-name retailers that investors might want to consider buying ahead of earnings next week.Shares of Macy’s surged over 11% on Wednesday after the company topped both top and bottom line estimates, and raised its full-year earnings guidance. Meanwhile, fellow department store power Nordstrom did not perform as well and saw its stock price sink nearly 10% through morning trading on Friday after its comps climbed only 0.6%.With that said, there are clearly still gains to be had from retail stocks even as worries about Amazon (AMZN) and other online sellers mount. Investors just need to look in the right places and search for stocks that are expected to top quarterly earnings estimates.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three of these strong stocks ahead of their upcoming quarterly earnings reports. Check them out now:1.      Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report)Shares of Best Buy are up 55% over the last year and have also climbed 7.4% in the last four weeks. The big-box electronics retailer is expected to see its Q1 revenues pop by 2.8% to hit $8.77 billion, based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, Best Buy’s earnings are projected to surge by 25% to touch $0.75 per share.Best Buy’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for quarterly earnings of $0.76 per share, which is 1 cent better than our current consensus estimate. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an Earnings ESP of 2.01%. Therefore, investors can consider BBY as a stock that could top quarterly earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results before the market opens on Thursday, May 24.2.       Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report)Moving on, Ralph Lauren is another famous name in retail that has outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin. The stock has soared 59% over the last year and has also climbed 5.6% over the last 12 weeks. Ralph Lauren’s quarterly revenues are expected to dip by 4.7% to hit $1.49 billion. At the other end of the income statement, RL is also projected to experience a decline from the prior-year period.Our current estimates are calling for Ralph Lauren’s quarterly earnings to slip by 3.4% to hit $0.86 per share. However, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an earnings ESP of 2.92%, mostly because its bottom line estimates have climbed recently. RL’s Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.88 per share, which is 2 cents above our current consensus estimate. This means that the upscale fashion giant could impress investors with a bottom line beat that might send its stock up, at least in the near-term. Ralph Lauren is set to report its quarterly results before the opening bell on Wednesday, May 23.3.       Urban Outfitters (URBN  -  Free Report)Urban Outfitters has seen its stock price skyrocket 120% over the last year and 20% during the last 12 weeks. The trendy fashion retailer’s quarterly revenues are projected to climb by nearly 10% to touch $837.08 million. Investors should also be excited to see that Urban Outfitters’ earnings are expected to hit $0.30 per share, which would mark a 130.7% surge from the prior-year quarter. URBN is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with an Earnings ESP of 2.52%. URBN’s Most Accurate Estimate is also coming in 1 cent better than our current consensus estimate. This, of course, means that Urban Outfitters could top earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Tuesday, May 22.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1144,JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 17, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, it pulled off negative earnings surprise of 3.2%. However, the company outpaced earnings estimates in the preceding six quarters. Nordstrom has delivered an average earnings beat of 16.8% in the trailing four quarters.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2018 is pegged at 42 cents, mirroring a year-over-year decline of 2.3%. Nevertheless, the consensus mark has remained stable in the last 30 days.Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Factors at PlayNordstrom’s constant efforts to enhance footprint and expand e-commerce capabilities are commendable. The company has been persistently focused on store-expansion strategy to gain market share and generate higher sales. Furthermore, Nordstrom has been smoothly progressing with its expansion in Canada. In fact, the company also runs in coherence with the evolving retail industry that is focused on offering maximum choices to its customers for enhancing their shopping experience. These endeavors are likely to drive Nordstrom’s top line and profitability.Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,444 million, up nearly 5% from first-quarter fiscal 2017.Additionally, Nordstrom is making significant progress with respect to its customer-based strategy and is on track to reach long-term growth target of $20 billion by 2020. With regard to cost savings, the company plans to strike a balance between sales and expense growth. Further, management is making amendments to its operating model in response to the constant slowdown in mall traffic resulting from customers’ shift to online shopping. Also, it is focused on advancing in the technology space, by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, and improving its supply-chain channels and marketing efforts. These growth initiatives are likely to add value to the company’s first-quarter results.All these above-mentioned endeavors have raised investors’ confidence in the stock. In the past six months, shares of this leading fashion retailer have rallied 27.2%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 13%.However, on the darker side, investments related to occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing expenses are likely to weigh on the company’s near-term margins. In the last reported quarter, Nordstrom's Retail gross profit margin contracted 42 basis points (bps) mainly on account of increased occupancy expenses related to new store expansion for Nordstrom Rack. In addition, the company’s accelerated investments toward technology, supply chain and marketing led to a rise of 243 bps in SG&A expenses in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.All said, let’s wait and see what lies ahead of Nordstrom when it reports quarterly results.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Nordstrom is likely to beat earnings estimates in the fiscal first quarter.

1146,JWN,"Shares of Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) opened higher on Monday as investors assess how the retail powerhouse might perform in the first quarter. With that said, let’s take a look at some of Walmart’s latest Q1 estimates to see what investors should really expect from Walmart’s Q1 financial results during a big week for retailers.Walmart stock is up 9% over the last year, but its shares have fallen 19% during the last 12 weeks. The recent downturn comes after the company reported relatively solid fourth quarter results. Much of the concern likely comes from Walmart’s e-commerce sales, which slowed in Q4 after a sustained stretch of massive growth.Walmart’s e-commerce sales still surged over 20% from the year-ago period, but as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other online sellers continue to expand, investors have become increasingly worried about the long-term growth prospects of big-box powers. This means that Walmart will likely have to report strong top and bottom line numbers on Thursday in order to impress investors.Walmart Q1 OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Walmart’s quarterly revenues to climb by 2.2% to reach $120.13 billion. On the other end of the income statement, the retailer’s Q1 earnings are projected to surge 13% to reach $1.13 per share.Moving on, investors will also want to understand what chance Walmart has to top our earnings estimate as this can often lead to positive stock price movement in the near-term. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, either way.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.Walmart’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $1.14 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 0.77%.Therefore, investors should consider Walmart a stock that could top quarterly earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results before the market opens on Thursday.Other retail giants, including Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), J. C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report), and Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) also report their quarterly earnings result this week.

1147,JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc.’s (JWN  -  Free Report) significant progress on customer-based strategy along with solid store-expansion efforts and technological advancements is commendable. Moreover, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in seven of the trailing eight quarters. Also, sales outpaced the same in three of the last four quarters.In the past six months, shares of the company have gained 14.9%, outperforming the industry’s 5.8% upside. Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a Momentum Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 6%, which is impressive.Furthermore, analysts are growing bullish on the stock as evident from increase in earnings estimates over the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.45 for fiscal 2018 and $3.58 for fiscal 2019 moved up 3 cents, respectively. Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversNordstrom remains on track to reach the long-term growth target of $20 billion by 2020, driven by its solid customer-based strategy. Also, the company plans to strike a balance between its sales and expense growth. Further, Nordstrom is making amendments to its operating model in response to the constant slowdown in mall traffic resulting from customers’ shift to online shopping.In addition, the company is executing its strategy of enhancing market share through persistent store expansion and further investments, particularly in digital growth. Opening of new stores attracts customers and boosts the company’s top line via synergies across other channels. Notably, the company has successfully completed its planned full-line store expansion in Canada by opening six stores therein. Moreover, Nordstrom opened three stores in the Toronto and Calgary areas this spring and is on track to open three new stores in fall 2018. Simultaneously, the company remains keen on domestic store expansion.Apart from widening its footprint through store openings, Nordstrom is strengthening capabilities by advancing in the technology space. Management is boosting e-commerce and digital networks as well as improving its supply-chain channels and marketing efforts. It also purchased two major retail technology entities — BevyUp and MessageYes — to cater to customers preferring online shopping. While BevyUp is a leading digital selling device, MessageYes is an iconic platform for conversational trading. In fact, the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 results reflected significant progress on its digital strategy. We believe these efforts will help Nordstrom to deliver sustainable growth over the long term.Furthermore, Nordstrom runs in coherence with the evolving retail industry that is focused on offering maximum choices to customers to enhance their shopping experience. Recently, management announced the expansion of extended sizing for 100 brands across 30 stores. This will include various merchandising categories such as dresses, denim, swimwear, activewear and lingerie. Meanwhile, the company continues to efficiently allocate a major portion of its capital toward the multichannel growth strategy focused on improving its merchandise; developing IT infrastructure; renovating stores with a modern look; and developing fulfillment centers to enable speedy delivery to online customers. We believe these initiatives should build a healthy relationship with customers, thereby enhancing customer loyalty.DeterrentsWhile the aforesaid initiatives speak well about Nordstrom, investments related to occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing expenses remain a short-term headwind for the company. In fact, this has been impacting its gross margins, which contracted 21 basis points (bps) in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 after a respective decline of 42 bps, 12 bps and 25 bps in the fourth, third and second quarters of fiscal 2017. This, in turn, might hurt the company’s overall profitability, moving ahead.Want Top-Ranked Retail Stocks? Check TheseUrban Outfitters, Inc.

1148,JWN,"Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) saw its stock price pop marginally on Wednesday as part of a month-long climb that has seen shares of the off-price clothing retailer surge nearly 6%. Now, let’s see if Ross’ run looks poised to continue by taking a quick look at its first-quarter earnings outlook.Over the last year, shares of Ross have surged nearly 33%, outpacing its industry’s climb of roughly 23%—which includes the likes of Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report) and TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report). Ross also crushed the S&P 500’s 13.4% climb.With that said, Ross stock could stall if the company reports lower-than-expected first quarter financial results Thursday. Ross might be under even more pressure since fellow brick-and-mortar retailers Macy’s (M), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), J.C. Penny (JCP  -  Free Report), Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report), and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have all reported their Q1 earnings, with mixed results. This means investors need to pay close attention to Ross’ most up-to-date top and bottom line estimates.Q1 OutlookRoss is projected to report quarterly revenues of $3.53 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. This would mark a 6.9% climb from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company’s adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to soar by 29.27% to reach $1.06 per share.However, investors also need to understand what chance Ross has to top our earnings estimate as this could help its stock price keep on moving upward, while a miss could lead to a decline—at least in the near-term.  Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, either way.

1149,JWN,"Dillard’s, Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report) is expected to release its first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 10. A glance at the company’s earnings trend shows that it has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters. However, this leading departmental store retailer delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 49.6% in the last four quarters.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.73 for the first quarter remained stable over the past 30 days but reflects a 28.8% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Let’s see how things are shaping up ahead of the upcoming release. Dillard's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Dillard's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Dillard's, Inc. Quote Factors at PlayDillard’s looks appeasing on the back of its strategic initiatives that aided the company’s performance in the last reported quarter. Further, the company’s constant efforts to capitalize on growth opportunities in its brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce business remain encouraging. Dillard’s also continues to gain from its niche market position, offering a broad array of merchandise in its stores, featuring products from both national and exclusive brands.We expect the company’s top and bottom line to gain from its focus on increasing productivity at existing stores, developing a leading omni-channel platform and enhancing domestic operations. Apparently, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of $1.46 billion, up 0.3% from the prior-year quarter. Additionally, Dillard’s constant shareholder-friendly moves are impressive.These laudable efforts are well-reflected in the company’s share price movement. In a year’s time, Dillard’s shares have rallied 28.4%, faring better than the industry’s gain of 22.5%.However, persistence of challenging trends in the apparel space due to changing customer preferences remains a hurdle. Also, Dillard’s operates in the highly competitive retail merchandise industry, which might dent the company’s profitability.Zacks Model Our proven model does not show that Dillard’s is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1150,JWN,"It is again that time when the earnings outcome of companies grabs all the attention. Analyst opinion, at this time, is usually centered on whether a company delivers an earnings beat or a miss. The first-quarter 2018 reporting cycle has almost crossed the half-way mark, with a robust picture of all-round strength. With solid earnings and sales growth so far, this season is likely to record the highest growth in seven years.Among all the sectors, our focus here will be on Retail-Wholesale, which is presumed to be invariably in business. While the majority of the players generally report earnings in the last leg of the reporting cycle, we note that there is significant momentum in these stocks due to a favorable economic backdrop. The sector is gaining from favorable economic data, including steady rise in wages, stable labor market and improved consumer spending.Consequently, the sector has gained 5.1% in the past month, outpacing the S&P 500’s growth of 1.3%.Consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of the economic activity, rose 0.4% in March, following 0.2% growth in January and remaining flat in February. This renewed momentum in March emerged from continued rise in incomes, indicating that consumers may drive economic growth in 2018.The well-being of consumers is usually linked to the prosperity of retailers as this segment attracts a large sum of total spending. We believe that the increased spending in March will somewhere reflect in earnings of retailers, who will report first-quarter outcomes very soon.As per National Retail Federation (NRF), total retail sales increased 5% year over year in March and 0.3% from February. This included a 7.6% increase in online and other non-store retail sales. Moreover, NRF continues to project retail sales growth of 3.8-4.4% for 2018.A close look at the sector reveals that retailers are reaping the benefit of increased investments in digital commerce, as evident from significant growth in e-commerce sales. Digital sales have been the key contributing factor in the top-line growth of most retailers. Additionally, this has led to a revival in the comparable store sales (comps) trend of the sector on the whole.However, the sector is grappling with soft margins due to higher investments to enhance presence and increased operating costs. Increased promotional activities, higher spending toward online portal and lower traffic at stores are some other issues, denting retailers’ margins. While retailers are resorting to strict cost-cutting measures to lift margins, a turnaround on this front may take time.Q1 Earnings ScorecardLooking at the earnings scorecard of the overall S&P 500 Index so far, about 267 S&P 500 members released first-quarter earnings results. Total earnings for these companies are up 25.1%, on 10% revenue growth. Further, about 76.8% delivered positive earnings surprises and 73.8% beat revenue estimates.

1152,JWN,"We are at the tail end of the Q1 earnings season as all sectors save retail have reported. The retail sector has seen about half of its total releases. Total earnings for the sector reported so far are up 26.1% on 14.9% revenue growth with 68.4% companies beating EPS estimates and 63.2% beating revenue estimates.While the proportion of positive earnings and revenue surprises are on the lower side, the pace of growth is tracking above the historical periods. As a result, retail ETFs SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Retail Fund (PMR  -  Free Report) gained 2.4%, 4.4% and 3.1%, respectively, in the past month (read: US Retail Rise: ETFs in Focus).The focus has now shifted to traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) that are expected to report this week. Given that earnings are the most important drivers of stock performance, it is necessary to look at the expected surprise of these retailers. These have the potential to push the abovementioned ETFs upward or downward.According to our surprise prediction methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases chances of an earnings beat. A Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) is best avoided going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.A Peek into the Earnings Lined UpHome Depot is slated to report earnings before the bell on May 15. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -0.36%. The company saw negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter but delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 2.88%. The stock has a VGM Score of B.Macy’s has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +4.50%, indicating a reasonable chance of beating estimates this quarter. The stock witnessed positive earnings estimate revision of four cents for the to-be-reported quarter in the past seven days. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends for Macy’s. Additionally, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.28% in the last four quarters and has a VGM Score of A. The company is expected to report before the opening bell on May 16 (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).Nordstrom, which will likely report earnings on May 17 after the closing bell, has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +10.32%. Though the stock is expected to post year-over-year earnings decline of 2.33%, it delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 16.81%. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days and has a VGM Score of A. Wal-Mart is scheduled to report on May 17 before market open.

The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1.50% in the last four quarters and has seen positive earnings estimate revision by a penny over the past month for the to-be-reported quarter.

Most retailers witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions. So, the space will continue to see smooth trading in the days ahead (read: Q1 GDP Growth Beats Estimates: ETFs to Buy).In particular, retail ETFs could stand out well as the funds can easily counter shocks from some of the industry’s biggest components, given their exposure to a number of firms in various types of industries like specialty retail, hypermarkets, drug stores, food retail, Internet retail and many others.

1153,JWN,"Shares of Macy's (M  -  Free Report) are up 11% over the last 12 weeks as the department store giant continues to impress investors after an extended downturn had many worried that its better days were long gone. With that said, things can change quickly, so investors need to know how Macy’s is expected to perform in the first quarter.Macy’s reported relatively solid fourth quarter sales, up 1.8% from the year-ago period. The company’s earnings surged 39.6% to $2.82 per share. Macy’s also once again proved its commitment to improving online sales, reporting its 34th consecutive quarter of double-digit digital sales growth. “We head into 2018 with an improved base business, healthy inventories, a focused and engaged organization and a clear path to return Macy’s to growth,” CEO Jeff Gennette said in a statement last quarter.But that was last quarter, meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other online sellers have only gotten bigger. So let’s take a look at Macy’s current first quarter outlook and some other key metrics ahead of the retail bellwether’s Q1 earnings report on Wednesday, May 16.Latest Outlook & ValuationOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Macy’s to report Q1 revenues of $5.43 billion, which would mark a 1.7% climb from the year-ago period. At the other end of the income statement, Macy’s is expected to see its quarterly earnings skyrocket by 50% to hit $0.36 per share.Of course, top and bottom line growth estimates are just two of the many things investors will be concerned with when Macy’s reports. We can also turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file to help prepare.The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.According to these consensus estimates, Macy’s comparable store sales are expected to dip marginally, or 0.01%. This is something investors need to take into consideration as comp sales are hugely important for retail businesses and often help encapsulate the overall health of the company.Another important factor to consider is Macy’s current valuation and how it stacks up not just against its peers, but itself. Heading into Friday, Macy’s was trading with a Forward P/E of 8.4, which marked a discount compared to the “Retail - Regional Department Stores” industry’s average of 10.1. The company also presents far better value than it did at the start of March when it traded at 10.6x forward earnings. This is also impressive considering that Macy’s has seen its stock price climb over that period.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to understand what chance Macy’s has to surprise investors with better-than-expected earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.The company’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $0.34 per share, which is 2 cents worse than our current consensus estimate. Macy’s is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of -5.01%. Therefore, M is a stock that could fall short of our quarterly earnings estimate.Surprise HistoryThe department store’s earnings surprise history and the effect that these surprises have had on its share prices are two other important factors to consider ahead of Macy’s earnings report.Macy's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Macy's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Macy's, Inc. QuoteWe can see that Macy’s has posted strong earnings results recently, topping quarterly estimates in six of the trailing eight periods. Furthermore, these beats have also led to positive momentum immediately following Macy’s quarterly earnings release. We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report. Macy’s stock has turned positive in five out of these last eight windows.Macy’s is scheduled to report its first quarter financial results before the market opens on Wednesday.

The stock, which has a long-term expected growth rate of 12%, scaled to a 52-week high of $40.23 on Apr 18, eventually closing a tad lower at $39.68.The company’s strategies have resulted in better-than-expected earnings and revenues for the third straight quarter, with the latest release being that of fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.Let’s Delve DeeperThis Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has adopted various strategic initiatives to attract customers. The latest one is the partnership with Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), whereby more than 200 items from Anthropologie Home are now available at select Nordstrom full-line stores and on Nordstrom.com, effective Mar 19. Earlier, the company had made an unprecedented move by acquiring Philadelphia’s The Vetri Family group of restaurants, including the Pizzeria Vetri chain.

1156,JWN,"As competition is intensifying in the retail space, Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to drive revenues. The company, which has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 11.2%, is banking on several strategic initiatives to enhance customer base. The company's strategic endeavors have helped the stock to gain 8.5% compared with the industry’s decline of 1.2% in the past six months.Tiffany is gradually coming up with new jewelry designs, range of watches and fragrance. It has also introduced “build-your-own program” on its website under which customers are allowed to personalize their charm bracelets. Also, Tiffany is allowing customers to customize rings.Apart from this, the company renewed its licensing agreement with Luxottica Group — slated to expire on Dec 31, 2027 — for the development, production and global distribution of sunglasses and prescription frames. These initiatives reflect the company’s customer-centric focus which is likely to help strengthen its customer base.The company is focusing on opening smaller stores that offer select collections of low priced and high margin products. Tiffany also focuses on improving sales per square foot by driving customer traffic and converting visitors into buyers through targeted advertising, sales training and customer-oriented initiatives.Management also intends to expand its distribution network by adding stores in new and existing markets. On the international front, the company is now focusing on expanding business in the Middle East, Russia, Canada, Mexico and Brazil.However, despite the company’s efforts to boost the top line, rising SG&A expenses are likely to dent the operating margin. In this regard, we note that management expects fiscal 2018 SG&A expenses to increase at a rate higher than sales on account of increased spending on technology, marketing communications, visual merchandising, digital and store presentations. We noted that in the first, second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, SG&A expenses had increased 0.2%, 3.7%, 3.3% and 2.2%, respectively.Given the pros and cons embedded the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).3 Retail Stocks to Steal the ShowMacy's, Inc.

This designer and manufacturer of accessories has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters, the average beat being 36%. Let’s see what awaits this quarterly release.Factors Influencing the Quarterly ResultsTop & Bottom-Line Story DrearyFossil has been witnessing soft traditional watch sales for long due to increased competition and rising demand for more advanced versions.Sales of leather and jewelry have also persistently declined over the past few quarters on account of sluggish demand.

Also, watch sales dropped 3% mainly due to sluggishness in the traditional category.Well, these concerns have been leading to dismal results for more than two years, with both the top and the bottom line declining year over year. For first-quarter 2018, the company expects net sales decline of 6-12%. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $539.4 million, down 7.3% from a year ago.Fossil Group, Inc.

Notably, the estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days.Will the Margin Debacle Continue?Fossil has been witnessing lower gross margin for a year now, primarily due to a weak retail margin stemming from increased promotions to drive sales (in stores and e-commerce) as well as higher mix of connected products. In the fourth quarter, gross margin contracted 230 basis points to 48.7% due to lower margins from connected products and increased product valuation reserves.Lower retail margins from greater promotional activity, unfavorable currency impact and increased off-price sales dented the gross margin. Prior to this, gross margin had contracted 580 bps, 140 bps and 300 bps in the third, second and first quarter of 2017, respectively.However, for first-quarter 2018,management anticipates gross margin in the range of 50-52%, reflecting a marginal improvement from the year-ago quarter’s 49.8%.It seems that the company is well on track with its New World Fossil plan which helped cut costs by $95 million in 2017, positioning it well to achieve the profit improvement target of $200 million by the end of 2019.Key CatalystsFossil has been taking significant efforts to keep pace with the rising demand for technologically advanced watches. Notably, wearables represented more than 20% of the company’s sales in the fourth quarter, marking a steady improvement on a year-on-year and sequential basis.As the wearable business is expected to grow $36 billion by 2020, Fossil is poised to improve its wearables portfolio by adding new brands to its smartwatch line-up in 2018. Powered by Android Wear, these brands will add premium brands to Fossil’s portfolio like Diesel, Emporio Armani, Fossil, Michael Kors and Misfit.Given the favorable consumer response and impressive performance by some of the key brands, management believes that wearables can play a key role in turning Fossil’s performance around. Thus, it plans to carry out incremental marketing investments in this category.Fossil is keen on expanding its digital platform and meet consumers’ growing demand for online purchasing. Toward this end, the company has been making several investments to improve digital marketing and drive online sales, both for the company’s website as well as other online wholesale partners.In fact, such dedicated endeavors in the e-commerce space bore favorable results in the fourth quarter of 2017. E-commerce sales during the period rose as much as 31%. The e-commerce platform has also served as an important sales channel for wearables. Further, management is optimistic regarding the company’s expansion plans in the smartwatch and other digital offerings category and expects such moves to bolster online sales.What the Zacks Model UnveilsNevertheless, our proven model shows that Fossil is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Notably, Fossil has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +4.58%.

The stock has been gaining from a positive earnings trend, with a beat recorded in the last five quarters. Further, strength in the Adidas brand, particularly in North America, alongside robust sales for the Reebok brand has been aiding the top line. Moreover, the company has been gaining from solid e-commerce growth, which is contributing significantly to top-line growth.Together, these growth drivers, along with Adidas’ constant product launches and strong marketing initiatives, make us hopeful about the company’s prospects.

It anticipates currency-neutral sales to advance nearly 10% in 2018, with double-digit growth expected in North America and Asia/Pacific regions.

1160,JWN,"After the sales uptick in March, retailers now have another reason to cheer. Consumer confidence rebounded in the month of April after a decline in the last month and the index even inched close to its 18-year high level. Courtesy of a strengthening labor market, tax reform and rising income, Americans are way more confident now, brushing aside recent hiccups like the U.S.-China face-off, apprehensions of a tighter monetary policy and rising bond yields.Per the Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index surged to 128.7 this month from March’s revised reading of 127.0. Analysts pointed that sales pickup and rising consumer confidence underscore the underlying strength in the economy. Certainly, this positive sentiment is likely to translate into higher consumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy. An uptick in this metric is welcome news for retailers.More confident consumers also bode well as the fortunes of retailers depend on their willingness to spend. Consumers nowadays have clearly taken a liking to online shopping over visiting brick-and-mortar stores. With the evolving shopping patterns, retailers are getting smarter embracing the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether in stores or online or through smartphones via apps.Given the favorable backdrop, the Retail-Wholesale sector is likely to catch investors’ attention. The sector has gained roughly 11% in the past six months, outpacing the S&P 500’s growth of 3%. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the sector is likely to witness bottom-line growth of 11.7% in the current reporting cycle, faring better than the last reported quarter’s rise of 3%. The top line is also projected to climb 7.6% compared with 9.7% increase registered in the last reported quarter.With the earnings season picking up pace, it seems prudent to snap up some retail stocks that are likely to beat estimates.

1161,JWN,"Wall Street is juggling with various macro and micro issues at the moment, including U.S.-China trade dispute, Facebook data breach, apprehensions about three or more rate hikes by the Fed this year and the rising bond yields. These events have kept the market on tenterhooks with investors scurrying for safe havens, even overlooking the solid start to the earnings season.Given strong economic fundamentals and lower corporate tax rate, the reporting cycle is likely to be a favorable one and may help override recent market gyrations. Notably, per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the S&P 500 index is expected to rise 18.3% in the first quarter of 2018 — compared with 13.4% in the preceding quarter — on the back of 7.7% year-over-year growth in revenues. Among the 16 Zacks categorized sectors, we are focusing on Retail-Wholesale.A Glimpse at the SectorThe retail-wholesale sector has advanced roughly 13% in the past six months, comfortably outpacing the S&P 500’s growth of 5%. Markedly, the sector is anticipated to witness bottom-line growth of 11.7% in the current reporting cycle, faring better than the prior-quarter rise of 3%. The top line is also projected to climb 7.6% compared with 9.7% increase registered in the preceding quarter.Industry experts cited that the sector, which typically performs well in a maturing economic cycle, is likely to benefit from a robust job market, massive tax cuts and gradual wage acceleration. These are likely to boost consumer confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending, one of the pivotal factors driving the economy. A clear reflection of the same was visible in the March retail sales that advanced 0.6%.Pick up in retail sales is welcome news for retailers, whose fortunes depend upon consumers’ willingness to spend. Consumers now days prefer to shop online from the comfort of their homes rather than hopping from one store to another. With evolving shopping patterns, retailers are also getting smarter embracing the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether in stores or online or through smartphones via apps.Given the favorable backdrop, the sector is likely to catch investors’ attention. So, picking stocks that are likely to trump estimates can fetch handsome returns. This is because a stock generally picks up steam on an earnings beat.Picking the Prospective Winners for the SeasonAll said, we used the Zacks methodology and identified retail stocks that not only boast solid fundamentals but are also poised to beat earnings estimates this reporting cycle.

1163,JWN,"The U.S. stock market mostly see-saws during the pre-midterm election period and rallies once the uncertainty fades, say analysts at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report). The scenario is not expected to be any different this time around. Investors should brace for increased turbulence as a divided government is highly expected this election.The last several months, in fact, have seen extreme levels of volatility as investors remained concerned about more protectionist trade policies and spike in bond yields after prices of essential commodities continued to move north. Given such uncertainty, investing in stocks that provide excellent risk-adjusted returns seems judicious.Brace for Months of UncertaintyInvestors should brace for neck-snapping volatility as midterm election approaches, per Goldman. The broader market has been on a roller-coaster ride for the past few months, thanks to trade and tax polic, along with geopolitical tensions. Controversies surrounding Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into whether Trump colluded with Russia’s initiative to impede the 2016 presidential election have aggravated concerns.Thus, corporate profits and economic reports might have been crucial factors for stocks but political developments have continued to determine the direction of the market.In the last 11 midterm election years since 1974, the S&P 500 managed to eke out gains in April, but, mostly traded flat through September only to rally once political uncertainty waned, per Goldman. In fact, in those years, stock market volatility averaged 15% compared with the median of 12% in all years.This year is likely to be the same. After all, Democrats are poised to regain control over the House of Representatives even though Republicans are expected to maintain an upper hand in the Senate, based on recent polls. Goldman forecasts that Democrats will have nearly a 70% chance of repossessing the House but there is less than 40% chance of regaining a majority in the Senate. Goldman added that such a divided government doesn’t bode well for investors.Volatility Makes a Dramatic ComebackVolatility has already seen several days with sharp moves so far this year. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the so-called Wall Street’s fear index, has seen a jump of no less than 20% in at least six trading sessions this year, according to the WSJ Market Data Group.The volatility index has experienced 19 sessions so far this year where it ended up at least 5%, the highest since 1994. In fact, volatility doubled on Feb 5 as inflation concerns dragged the broader market down.Such earth-shattering volatility followed a relatively calm 2017.  Last year, the stock market shrugged off political and economic uncertainty, and demonstrated almost nothing in the way of market pullbacks.Bond Yields Spike, Equities WobbleSpike in U.S. bond yields, by the way, have triggered market gyrations. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note hit its highest level since January 2014 at 2.97% in early European trade. The 10-year yield increased as treasuries came under pressure. Treasuries sold off as higher commodity prices diminish the value of a bond’s fixed interest payments. Rise in oil prices and business houses saying that the cost of steel and several other raw materials are increasing in the United States have induced inflation fears.Rise in bond yields affected the buying appetite for stocks. Uptick in bond yields increased the opportunity cost of investing in equities and therefore equities became less alluring. Selling pressure on U.S. equity benchmarks intensified on Apr 20, with all three major bourses retracing into the negative territory.5 Top Stocks to Counter Market GyrationsGiven the aforesaid factors, it seems like Wall Street is poised to face months of volatility with midterms just around the corner. Taking this into consideration, investors should build a strategy on low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1.These stocks are also dividend payers which boast immense financial strength and are immune to market vagaries.

Hence, it forecasts comps for the first half at or above 2-3% for 2018 while the second half comps are likely to be below this range.Further, the company revealed that the first quarter will include one extra comp day as its stores were open on New Year’s Day for the first time. This extra day is likely to add about 60-70 bps to comps for the first quarter and 10-15 bps to full-year comps. Additionally, the company projects highest comps growth and lowest operating-margin compression in the first quarter.However, the company expects continued cost pressures from rising freight rates, due to a shortage of drivers and higher diesel prices as well as inflationary wage pressures across retail locations and the supply chain. These headwinds, along with the company’s investments to grow business, are likely to keep operating margin for 2018 under pressure. Consequently, operating margin is anticipated to be nearly 8.8%, the mid-point of the company’s guidance range. Additionally, gross margin is anticipated to be flat to marginally down in 2018, with significant impact on SG&A expense.Further, the shares of Tractor Supply have declined 26.9% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 12.4%. However, the company’s focus on growth initiatives helped it to outperform the industry in the past year.Given the above iterations, let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic efforts can offset the margin-related constraints.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Tractor Supply is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.While Tractor Supply has a Zacks Rank #3, an Earnings ESP of -5.50% lowers the chances of a beat in the ensuing release.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:KAR Auction Services Inc.

1165,JWN,"As the U.K. is dolling up for the royal wedding tomorrow, we may well regale in stocks of luxury goods that are being well-liked by investors. The luxury goods market is continuing its joy ride this year and expected to reach $182 billion Understandably, after a robust 2017 and a splendid first quarter, U.S. luxury goods’ stocks seem poised for a great year thanks to optimism surrounding steady economic growth, lower tax rates, strong wage growth and a robust earnings season.Strong revenues registered by a number of luxury brands along with an increasing number of millennials spending more on luxury goods bode well too.  This willingness to spend more can be traced back to high U.S. consumer confidence and consumer spending. Given this scenario, it makes good sense to indulge in luxury goods stocks. Luxury Goods Market on Steady Growth TrackThe U.S. luxury goods market witnessed a great 2017, with luxury spending growing 5% globally, according to management consulting firm Bain & Co. The S&P Global Luxury Index rose 27.9% last year. Interestingly, the personal luxury goods market grew globally in 2017, driven by robust local consumption and tourist purchases. Local consumption of personal luxury goods rose 4%, while tourist consumption grew 6%.The strength in U.S. luxury goods stocks continued through the first quarter of 2018, corroborated by a robust earnings season. Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share and revenues of $3.56 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents and $3.47 billion, respectively. Revenues also increased almost 6% from $3.35 billion in the year-ago period. Other luxury companies expected to report earnings also seem confident of putting up a stellar show. In fiscal fourth-quarter 2017, PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) had projected its revenues to rise 7% in fiscal 2018, while constant-currency revenues were projected to grow 4% from fiscal 2017. Shares of PVH Corp have surged 55.6% in the past year, while Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report), Nordstorm, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) and Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report) have rallied 83.2%, 25.2% and 59.2%.Moreover, according to Bain & Co, the global luxury goods market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 4-5% over the next three years, while the personal luxury goods market is expected to reach €295-€305 billion by 2020. Favorable Economic ScenarioThe U.S. economy is stepping up, giving the luxury goods market a solid boost. Higher wages, a low jobless rate and upbeat consumer confidence, all indicate a bullish economy.Moreover, U.S. consumer confidence touched 128.7 in April, surpassing expectations of 126 and recovering from its fall in March. Also, U.S. consumer spending is once again increasing as evident from a retail sales rise in April. According to JP Morgan, consumer spending is running at an annualized rate of 2.4% in the second quarter, double the pace in the first. This positive sentiment is definitely going to reflect on increased purchase of personal luxury goods. Our Choices Luxury goods stocks have been doing well for some time now. Moreover, with positives such as a recovering economy, lower tax rates and business-friendly policies, high consumer confidence, and robust consumer spending, luxury brands are poised for growth in 2018.While binging on luxury goods stocks looks like a smart option now, picking winning stocks may be difficult.

1166,JWN,"U.S. stock markets ended lower on Thursday after President Donald Trump expressed doubts about the possibility of successful trade negotiations with China. All three major indexes closed in the negative territory. Moreover, rising yields on the U.S. government bonds and geopolitical tensions weighed on investors to such an extent that a strong showing by the energy sector failed to stop a slide in stock prices.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,713.98, decreased 0.2%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.1% to close at 2,720.13. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,382.47, decreased 0.2%. A total of 6.37 billion shares were traded on Thursday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.65 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1.15-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, advancers had an edge over decliners by 1.52-to-1 ratio. The CBOE VIX increased 0.8% and closed at 13.43.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow lost 0.2%. Notably, 10 of the 30-stocks in the blue-chip index closing in the green while 19 traded in the red and 1 stock remained unchanged.The S&P 500 decreased 0.1% led by 0.8% decrease of the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) and 0.5% decrease of both the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) partially curtailed by 1.5% gain of Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE). Notably, 5 out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory.The Nasdaq Composite also decreased 0.2% led by fall in large tech stock’s prices after President Trump expressed his doubt about the possibility of a successful trade negotiation with China.Trump Doubts on Successful China Trade NegotiationOn May 17, President Donald Trump casts doubts on the possibility of a successful outcome from ongoing trade related negotiations with China. Currently, a high level Chinese government delegation is in Washington to meet for a second round of talks to chalk out an amicable solution.Trump commented during an appearance with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg that Beijing had become too “spoiled” and that his expectations for the negotiations were low.In the first week of May, a high-level U.S. delegation led by the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited China to sort out differences of opinion between the two countries. The delegation took a hard line approach to bargaining with China. Munchin handed over a letter demanding a list of steps that the United States wants China to take immediately.China has refrained from committing to any U.S. demands so far. The two countries will again sit for a second round of trade negotiation talks this week. However, as things stands, it is highly unlikely that any concrete solution is likely to emerge from this round of meetings as well.Oil Price Boost Fails to Uplift MarketOn May 17, the July Brent Crude (LCON8) edged up 2 cents to settle at $79.30 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, after hitting $80.50, its highest level since November 2014. Concerns that imposition of sanctions on Iran by the United States will limit the former’s oil production boosted oil prices. The U.S. government also warned about the possibility of secondary sanctions imposed on European companies who continue to deal with Iran.Russell 2000 and U.S. Government Bond Yields Continue to Rise The small-cap heavy Russell 2000 index gained 0.6% to 1,625.29 after touching a new high of 1,627 in Thursday’s trading. This was the index’s second straight record closing.On Thursday, yield on 10-year Treasury note extended its gain further to 3.11%, after hitting a seven year high of 3.07% on Tuesday. A yield of 3% on 10-year Treasury note is generally regarded as a psychological barrier at which stage flight of capital takes place from risky equities to safe haven bonds.Cisco and Walmart Plummet Despite Strong Earnings ResultsOn Thursday, share price of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) declined 3.8% and 1.9%, respectively, despite reporting strong earnings results.

The company registered double-digit growth in digital business.Moreover, as part of the store rationalization program, the company plans to shut down underperforming stores.

1170,JWN,"Shares of Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) gained more than 11% on Wednesday after the company posted its latest quarterly financial report, surpassing estimates on the top and bottom line and raising its full-year earnings guidance. Now, with these impressive results fresh on the minds of investors, the attention will turn to industry rival Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report).Nordstrom’s latest results are due out after the closing bell on Thursday. Retail bulls will hope the company can match the remarkable results of Macy’s, which saw comps growth of 4.2% and improved its digital sales by double-digit percentages.So what should we expect to see from Nordstrom when it reports on Thursday? Let’s take a closer look.Latest OutlookAccording to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, analysts are calling for Nordstrom to report adjusted earnings of $0.42 per share and total revenue of $3.47 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of -2.3% and +5.8%, respectively.It is worth noting that Nordstrom’s consensus earnings projection has moved a penny higher over the duration of the quarter, indicating a slightly improved outlook from a few months ago.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Nordstrom surprises investors with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Nordstrom is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of +5.8%. This means that the most recent estimates have been higher than the consensus. In other words, our model is suggesting that a beat is likely.Most Recent Valuation Nordstrom added about 2% on Wednesday, but before the day’s gains, it was trading at about 14.4x forward 12-month earnings. This is a slight premium to its industry’s average of 13.9x, but well within the range investors have come to expect over the past year—and actually cheaper than where the stock has been in recent months.Surprise HistoryAnother important thing to consider ahead of Nordstrom’s report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices. The retailer actually missed estimates in the previous quarter, but it had a solid streak of positive earnings surprises going before that.But we like to judge the price effect of earnings announcements by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report. Nordstrom has moved higher in four out of the previous six of these windows.Bottom LineNordstrom is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock that looks even more attractive after the solid report of its top industry rival. Shares are trading at a decent valuation, and recent analyst sentiment has been strong. This should add to the anticipation for the company’s report tomorrow.Want more market analysis from this author?

1171,JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) has been struggling lately, but the selling pressure may be coming to an end soon. That is because JWN recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom.What is a Hammer Chart Pattern? A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting. The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day, but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price. This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer, and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock, and that better days are ahead.Other FactorsPlus, earnings estimates have been rising for this company, even despite the sluggish trading lately.

1172,JWN,"Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc.’s (OLLI  -  Free Report) business model of “buying cheap and selling cheap”, cost-containment efforts, focus on store productivity, sturdy comparable-store sales (comps) performance and expansion of customer reward program, Ollie's Army, fortify its position in the Consumer Staples space. These initiatives positioned the stock to augment both its top and bottom-line performance in the long run.A glimpse of Ollie's Bargain share price movement reveals that it has surged roughly 17.6% so far this year. The stock has not only outperformed the industry that witnessed a decline of 7.1% but also the overall sector that fell 5.4%. Notably, shares of this Harrisburg, PA-based company are hovering in proximity to its 52-week high of $63.75, and there is no doubt why Ollie's Bargain could not breach that mark in the near term.A Brief IntrospectionOllie's Bargain has an impressive streak of beating quarterly earnings and revenue estimates. The stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues in the trailing seven quarters and sustained a decent year-over-year improvement.In the trailing four quarters, the company has outperformed the consensus mark by an average of 7.7%. In the last reported quarter, the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 4.1%. We noted that net sales grew 25.9% to $356.7 million, while adjusted earnings per share surged 30.8% to 51 cents during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Comps increased 4.4% during the quarter under review.Management now projects net sales growth of 13.2% to 14.1% during fiscal 2018 and envisions adjusted earnings in the band of $1.65-$1.69 per share compared with $1.25 reported in fiscal 2017. Ollie's Bargain now anticipates comps growth of 1-2%. However, we notice that the projected rate of sales growth for fiscal 2018 is down from 21%, what the company attained in fiscal 2017.Meanwhile, since the announcement of its fourth-quarter results on Apr 4, Ollie's Bargain shares have increased approximately 3.6%.Certainly, the company’s growth initiatives that involve increasing store count to more than 950 in the long run from its current base of 268 are well on track. Also, the company has been making concerted efforts to lower its debt burden and expects to be debt free by the end of fiscal 2018 with a cash balance of about $70-$80 million.Valuation PerspectiveA glance at some valuation metrics indicates that the stock is trading at a high premium. A Value Score of D also indicates the same. The stock looks expensive with respect to a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 37.9x versus industry’s 14.0x. Its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 4.8 and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.8 are higher than the industry average of 3.1 and 1.6, respectively. A similar picture emerges when comparing EV/EBITDA ratios. The company’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 36.4 is higher than 16.7 for the industry.Wrapping UpOllie's Bargain strategic endeavors and long-term prospects place the stock favorably on a growth path. However, an expensive valuation along with a possible fall in rate of fiscal 2018 sales growth may make investors rethink before picking this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.3 Key PicksMacy's, Inc.

1173,JWN,"Whirlpool Corp. (WHR  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 23, after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 2.2%.However, Whirlpool missed estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 3.2%. Though the company delivered earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017, it recorded negative surprises in the preceding five quarters. Moreover, the company delivered negative sales surprise in the last three quarters. The primary concerns for the company in recent quarters are raw material cost inflation and unfavorable price/mix. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Whirlpool will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $3.02, reflecting year-over-year growth of 20.8%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate declined in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.02 billion, up nearly 5% from the year-ago quarter.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock has declined 2.8% in the past month. However, this compares better than the industry’s 5.7% downside.Factors at PlayWhirlpool is gaining significantly from its commitment toward long-term goals, supported by robust product pipeline, solid innovations and cost-productivity initiatives. Also, the company outlined significant long-term targets through 2020, driven by brand strength and product portfolio.Through 2020, Whirlpool aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3-5% annually. Moreover, it targets EBIT margin to exceed 10% by 2020 and envisions earnings per share to grow by 10-15% each year. By 2018, it anticipates free cash flow generation of 5-6% of revenues.Additionally, the company is striving to improve margin through several measures, including cost-based price increments and cost-reduction initiatives, which should also boost business efficiency. The company recently introduced global cost-based pricing for trade customers to mitigate raw-material inflation. Furthermore, it is on track to cut down fixed overhead expenses by $150 million, which will add to the company’s ongoing cost-productivity program.Also, Whirlpool’s focus on boosting consumer demand has increased global price/mix by 50 basis points (bps) in fourth-quarter 2017. This marked the company’s first quarter of positive global price/mix since fourth-quarter 2015. Moreover, its renewed focus on inventory management is expected to boost earnings and free cash flow in the future.However, Whirlpool has been witnessing soft top-line performance as is clear from the negative sales surprise in the last three quarters. The top-line lag can be attributed to weaker demand in the United States and certain countries in Europe. Further, its operating margins continue to be hurt by unit-volume declines and raw-material inflation.Though management expects improved global price/mix and cost savings to benefit margins in 2018, this is likely to be offset by continued raw material inflation. In 2018, the company expects the combined 125 bps margin improvement from favorable price/mix, fixed cost reduction and improved cost productivity, to be more than offset by nearly $200-$250 million increase in raw-material inflation from the prior-year.Let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic efforts can turnaround the top line and margin-related constraints.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Whirlpool is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Whirlpool has an Earnings ESP of +0.33%. However, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) lowers the chances of a beat in the ensuing release. We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Strong Sell).Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:KAR Auction Services Inc. (KAR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.35% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Macy’s Inc.

1174,JWN,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY  -  Free Report) is among the stocks that delivered solid top- and bottom-line performances in the near past. Notably, the company reported the second straight quarter of earnings and sales beat in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Results were driven by solid sales growth, owing to the progress on its transformation efforts and other customer-centric initiatives. (Read More: Bed Bath & Beyond Down Despite Earnings Beat in Q4).However, this was not enough to woo investors as is clear from the significant drop in the company’s stock price since reporting the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Apr 11, 2018. The Bed Bath & Beyond stock fell as much as 19.7% since Apr 11, wider than the industry’s decline of 2.3%. The stock was mainly punished due to a weak fiscal 2018 outlook as the company expects the soft margin and comps trend to continue in the future.The company’s comps declined in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 due to the lower number of store transactions, somewhat mitigated by higher average transaction amounts. While comps from customer-facing digital networks improved, comps at stores fell at a mid-single-digit rate. Further, the company has a seven-quarter long trend of reporting strained margins due to higher shipping and coupon expenses, which continued in the fiscal fourth quarter.Consequently, the company provided a bleak outlook for fiscal 2018, which is likely to bear a 5 cents negative impact due to the absence of the 53rd week compared with the previous year. It expects a clear shift of sales and expenses from the fiscal fourth quarter to the third quarter due to the calendar shift. The company anticipates an earnings shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as well.For fiscal 2018, the company expects consolidated net sales to remain relatively flat to marginally up year over year. Driven by persistent growth in the customer-facing digital channel, it envisions comps to increase in the low-single-digit percentage range.Furthermore, Bed Bath & Beyond projects gross margin deleverage in fiscal 2018, mainly owing to continued investment in the customer value proposition and the constant shift to the digital channels. SG&A is estimated to increase on account of investments toward transformation. However, the company expects to witness operating margin to decline lower than that in fiscal 2017. Depreciation expenses are anticipated to be $315-$325 million while net interest expenses are projected to be $75 million. It also expects the tax rate to be 26-27% for the fiscal.Considering all these factors, the company envisions fiscal 2018 earnings per share to be in the low-to-mid-$2 range compared with adjusted earnings per share of $3.12 in fiscal 2017.Driven by the soft earnings view, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed a downtrend in the last seven days. Estimates for the first quarter and fiscal 2018 declined 13 cents and 40 cents, respectively, to 33 cents per share and $2.36 per share. Moreover, estimates for fiscal 2019 dropped 57 cents to $2.02 per share.Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.

1177,JWN,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) delivered better-than-expected bottom-line results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, marking a considerable improvement from its recent trend. However, the top line continued to disappoint, lagging the estimates and declining year over year.The company’s improved bottom-line results can be attributed to the stabilization of reimbursement rates, a decline in drug purchasing costs and a record number of immunizations that enhanced pharmacy margins for the quarter.Other key highlights of the quarter were solid results at the Retail Pharmacy Segment with higher adjusted EBITDA, strong start to Pharmacy Services segment in the new commercial selling season just after the fourth quarter, completion of the sale of 1,932 stores to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) and a merger agreement with Albertsons Companies.As of Mar 27, 2018, Rite Aid completed the transfer of 1,932 stores and related assets to Walgreens for $4.157 billion. It now plans to transfer the three distribution centers and related inventory, starting Sep 1, 2018. With the cash proceeds, management has been lowering debt. As a result, its debt, net of cash, was $2.9 billion as of Mar 3, 2018.Additionally, the company agreed to merge with Albertsons on Feb 20, 2018. So far, the boards of directors of both the companies have approved the transaction and the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 has expired. The companies expect to close the merger in the second half of calendar year 2018.Though the transfer of stores to Walgreens and the merger with Albertsons are positives for the stock, it has declined 31.8% in the last three months, probably because of the lack of robust operating results. Moreover, the decline in share price reflects an underperformance from the industry’s fall of 16.6%.Q4 in DetailRite Aid reported adjusted loss per share of 1 cent in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 against earnings per share of 2 cents in the year-ago quarter. However, results beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss per share of 2 cents. While the bottom line was hurt by a decline in adjusted EBITDA, higher costs relating to the Walgreens deal, and increased lease termination and impairment charges, it was negated higher LIFO credit and improved reimbursement rates.Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteRevenues dropped 8.6% to $5,394.3 million, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,540 million. During the quarter, Retail Pharmacy segment revenues declined 10.1% on account of soft same-store sales and an extra week in the prior year’s fourth quarter. Moreover, revenues from the Pharmacy Services segment declined 4.3% due to changes in the composition of Medicare Part D membership and a fall in commercial business.Retail Pharmacy same-store sales dipped 1.7%, owing to 2.3% fall in pharmacy sales and 0.6% decrease in front-end sales. Pharmacy sales included a negative impact of nearly 138 basis points (bps) from the introduction of new generic drugs. Further, prescription count at comparable stores slipped 1.8% due to the omission of some pharmacy networks from the prior-year quarter. Prescription sales constituted 64.9% of total drugstore sales.Rite Aid’s adjusted EBITDA dropped about 6.1% year over year to $157.4 million while adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 10 bps to 2.9%. This was due to lower adjusted EBITDA at the Pharmacy Services segment; offset by favorable results for the Retail Pharmacy segment, primarily driven by improved reimbursement rates and enhanced generic purchasing. Pro-forma adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for fees related to the Walgreens transaction and the extra week in fiscal 2017, was $173.2 million, down 4.2% year over year.Store UpdateRite Aid continues to renovate stores with 38 remodeled and six relocated outlets in the fourth quarter. This brings the company’s total wellness-stores count to 1,805. Further, it sold 1,554 stores to Walgreens and shut 19 stores during the quarter, consequently taking the total store count to 2,831 as of Mar 3, 2018. Additionally, store count related to continuing operations were 1,651 and 2,550, respectively, for wellness stores and total stores.Financial StatusRite Aid ended fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $447.3 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $3,340.1 million and total shareholders’ equity of $1,601 million.Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s cash from operating activities was $87 million as of the end of fiscal 2018.OutlookFollowing the strong closure of fiscal 2018, Rite Aid outlined its initial view for fiscal 2019. Going forward, the company anticipates benefiting from generic drug purchasing efficiencies, a stable reimbursement-rate environment than witnessed in fiscal 2018, TSA fees related to the Walgreens deal as well as other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies. However, the company’s guidance does not include any impact of the pending transaction with Albertsons.Rite Aid estimates sales of $21.7-$22.1 billion in fiscal 2019 with comps anticipated in the range of flat-to-up 1%. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be $615-$675 million. Further, the company expects net loss of $40-$95 million in fiscal 2019. Adjusted net income per share is expected to be in the range of 2-6 cents compared with a loss per share of 2 cents reported in fiscal 2018.

1178,JWN,"Zumiez Inc.  has been riding high on a favorable comparable-store sales (comps) trend. The company continued this trend by reporting robust sales and comps numbers for March as well, marking the 13th straight month of comps growth. Consequently, shares of the company were up nearly 2% in after-hours trading on Apr 11.This mall-based specialty retailer recorded 12.6% comps growth for the five-week period ended Apr 7, 2018, compared with 1.1% increase witnessed in the five weeks ended Apr 1, 2017. Further, total net sales for March advanced 14.7% to $82.3 million from $71.7 million in the year-ago period.Looking at fiscal 2018, Zumiez remains confident of delivering accelerated earnings growth, backed by solid top-line and positive comps trends, margin enhancement programs, improved expense leverage and lower taxes. Moreover, the company believes that infrastructure investments, made to provide seamless customer experience as well as a unique approach to merchandising, will aid both top- and bottom-line growth in 2018 and beyond. Consequently, the company projects comps to grow in the low-single-digit range in fiscal 2018.However, the company earlier provided a soft guidance for first-quarter fiscal 2018. While it outlined robust comps growth and sales in the quarter, earnings projections were discouraging.The company expects net sales for the first quarter in the $198-$202 million range, while comps growth is anticipated to be 4-6%. It stated that monthly sales in the quarter will be impacted by the shift in Easter holiday. The shift is likely to bear a positive impact on sales for March and hurt sales in April.Overall, Zumiez is gaining from robust merchandise strategies, solid store-expansion endeavors and e-commerce platform.

1179,JWN,"DICK’S Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report) has been a good investment choice for quite a while now, with shares showing solid momentum. This stock’s momentum can be mostly attributed to the company’s progress on strategic initiatives which aided bottom-line beat in recent quarters.Notably, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock surged 6.7% in the past month, against the industry’s decline of 2.3%. Moreover, the stock has returned a solid 41.1% in the last six months, indicative of the positive sentiment.However, we cannot ignore the near-term headwinds that may bother the stock’s growth. These mainly include the softness in hunting and electronic categories as well as the continued decline of margins. That said, let’s analyze why we should retain the stock at this time.Strategic Initiatives Drive Stock’s MomentumDICK’S Sporting has been the prime beneficiary of its strategic actions which continually focus on generating greater sales. Apart from strengthening store network, the company remains on track to expand the e-commerce business. Notably, e-commerce penetration improved 19% of net sales from 17.9% in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, e-commerce sales grew 9% year over year, driven by its first successful holiday season on the new web platform.As part of the long-term plan, the company plans to make significant investments in e-commerce, technology, store payroll, Team Sports HQ and private brands. This reinforces its confidence in driving market share growth in fiscal 2018. Further, these endeavors are likely to enrich customers’ experience and augment the top line.Focus on MerchandisingDICK’S Sporting is progressing well with its merchandising strategy (announced in fourth-quarter fiscal 2016), which is all about optimizing inventory to make shelves available for popular- and private-label brands. Further, it plans to invest in the supply chain to improve in-stock levels and speed-up delivery. These investments will not only improve customer satisfaction and inventory turnover but also boost merchandise margin rates.Robust Earnings Trend & OutlookDICK’S Sporting’s aforementioned initiatives significantly aided earnings performance as is evident from the robust surprise history. It delivered second straight positive earnings surprise in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Moreover, it topped estimates for the sixth time in the last eight quarters. Results gained from strengthening of Team Sports, footwear, outdoor equipment and private-brands businesses alongside solid e-commerce growth.DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. QuoteGoing into 2018, the company expects greater product innovation from its key partners and expansion of the private brands business to ease margin pressures. Further, it plans to make significant investments in the business as it remains confident about the long-term potential and tremendous opportunities in the evolving industry. For fiscal 2018, management projects earnings of nearly $2.83 per share.Estimates Trend UpThe aforementioned positivity on the stock is further justified by the positive estimate revisions witnessed in a month’s span. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter and fiscal 2018 climbed 6 cents and 14 cents, respectively, to 43 cents per share and $2.91 per share. Moreover, estimates for fiscal 2019 reflect a gain of 5 cents to $3.10 per share.Near-Term HurdlesThough the company’s bottom-line performance has been impressive, top line lagged estimates in the last reported quarter due to soft comparable store sales (comps). Additionally, continued softness in the hunting and electronic categories has been perils for top-line growth. Further, the company expects the hunting and firearm, as well as electronics businesses, to experience headwinds throughout 2018, which will hurt the top line. The hunting and firearm business will continue to be impacted by the recent changes to the company’s firearm policies while the electronics business will be hurt by reduced exposure.Moreover, the company’s margins continue to be strained due to shrinking sales and increased promotions among others. Going forward, the company expects greater product innovation from its key partners and further expansion of its private brands business to lower margin pressures than previously anticipated. However, the company still expects margins to remain negative.Looking for More Promising Picks?

1182,JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), which consistently adapts to the evolving retail industry, is not far behind in the retailers’ race to aggressively expand presence in the online and digital arena to offer a seamless shopping experience. The company’s efforts to expand digitally are essential to thwart the increasing dominance of the online giant Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report).In addition to making investments in the digital technology, the company is embracing omni-channel functionalities to retain the importance of physical stores in an era where brick-and-mortar retailing is losing ground. For this, the company stays focused on expanding and renovating outlets to provide better customer engagement. Steps Taken to Boost Digital GrowthNordstrom has long been making investments to boost the shopping experience of customers. Of late, it purchased two major retail technology entities — BevyUp and MessageYes — to cater to customers preferring online shopping. While BevyUp is a leading digital selling device, MessageYes is an iconic platform for conversational trading.  These investments will be integrated into Nordstrom’s portfolio to expedite consumer’s personalized needs and accelerate business growth.The BevyUp digital tool will be consolidated into Nordstrom’s latest and integrated mobile employee app, in the coming year. In addition, the company will supply its salespersons a mobile suite of facilities that will allow them to stay informative and easily available to customers.Notably, Nordstrom has been persistently focusing on personalized shopping. The devices will help augment this further and enable the company to efficiently cater to customers in a digitally-connected world.Additionally, Nordstrom is on track to integrate its digital and physical assets to create innovative and multiple ways for customers to shop. The company is focused on advancing in the technology space by boosting e-commerce and digital networks as well as improving its supply-chain channels and marketing efforts.The company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results reflected significant progress on its digital strategy, which drove the company’s top line.Store Expansion PlansApart from enhancing its presence in the digital world, Nordstrom stays committed to opening new stores and driving the top line growth. Notably, the company has successfully completed its planned full-line store expansion in Canada by opening six outlets in the country. In 2018, the company is keen on introducing Nordstrom Racks in Canada with plans to open six Rack stores. Overall, the company envisions a $1-billion sales opportunity from its expansion in Canada by 2020. It is also on track with domestic store expansion, as it is scheduled to open six Rack stores in the United States.In fact, the company launched Nordstrom Local in 2017, which is a modern retailing concept store that does not stock merchandise. This latest concept is quite different from the traditional retail approach and is a neighborhood store, where the company’s services are easily available in a centralized location.All said, we believe Nordstrom is aggressively making headway to safeguard its position in the evolving retail space, particularly in digital growth.Other retailers that are fortifying their presence are Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) and Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceShares of Nordstrom reflect 8.7% upside in the past year, against the industry’s gain of 3.4%.

1183,JWN,"Taking a break from the hot U.S.-China friction headlines, here we bring for you an interesting observation on how apparel retailing has been adapting well to e-commerce and omni-channel techniques.Looking almost a year back and before, the apparel retail segment witnessed a setback due to the evolving trends in the retail industry as smart phones started becoming the primary avenue to make purchases. From then, there has been a revolutionary change in the business models of most apparel and accessories retailers as these strive to provide the best customer experience and keep pace with industry trends.Transformation Takes ChargeTo put it simply, there has been a sea change in consumer preferences as to when, where, how and why to shop. To catch up with this new consumer behavior, the retail industry has undergone a huge transformation where online and brick-and-mortar goes hand in hand to deliver upon customers demands.Well, this transformation is true for the Retail – Apparel and Shoes industry as well, which forms a key segment of the retail sector. Today, apparel retailing is not confined to stores. In fact, a major part of the total apparel sale in the United States comes from online. This is the reason apparel retailers have been rolling out new omni-channel and digital capabilities to attract customers.Some traits prevalent across the apparel industry are increased investments in the multi-channel growth strategy, where players are keen on improving merchandise offerings, developing IT infrastructure to enhance web and mobile experiences, renovating and expanding physical stores, as well as enabling speedy delivery to customers.Further, companies are focused on inventory management initiatives to provide the right merchandise at the right time and place. Another area that these companies are working on is customer loyalty programs that can aid in boosting the loyalty score.Digital Investments – The Key to GrowthThe efforts and investments in digital growth have been well reflected in the top and bottom-line performances of the players in the specialty apparel segment. Digital sales have been the prime contributing factor in the top-line growth of most retailers in the space. Additionally, this has led to a revival in the comparable store sales (comps) trend for these retailers. Looking ahead, the use of artificial intelligence and providing customized products is likely to be the winning strategy for retailers vying for the top spot.Given these efforts, the graph of the Retail – Apparel and Shoes industry has witnessed 4.4% growth in the past year.As per National Retail Federation (NRF), total retail sales increased 4.4% year over year in February and 0.3% from January. This included a 10.5% increase in online and other non-store retail sales. Moreover, sales for the clothing and clothing accessories segment alone increased 5.2% year over year in February.That said, let’s take a look at some individual stocks from the industry, throwing light on their growth endeavors and the resulting benefits.Apparel Stocks Focused on Digital GrowthStarting with The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), we note that it has been making constant efforts to boost digital and mobile offerings, alongside improving product acceptance. Notably, the company has increased online presence across all of its brands, and its online division is one of its most profitable, posting double-digit sales growth.

Overall, the DTC business accounted for nearly 34% of net sales in the fourth quarter, recording an 18% increase in comparable sales. In fiscal 2018, the company plans to continue investing in DTC capabilities, alongside bringing innovations in this channel, using customer insights and data analytics.Driven by these efforts, the company has delivered positive earnings surprise in three straight and a sales beat in the trailing four quarters. Further, the company’s comps improved sequentially throughout fiscal 2017. Consequently, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has witnessed whopping 152.4% growth in the past year.Pittsburgh, PA-based American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report) has witnessed grave recovery in its comps driven by strong growth in online sales that stems from the efficient use of omni-channel capabilities to enhance customer experience. Notably, the company’s comps have improved in the last 12 quarters and for three consecutive years now.

Consequently, digital sales improved more than 20% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 and trends improved in brick-and-mortar stores as both AE and Aerie stores reported positive in-store comps.

1185,JWN,"Zumiez Inc.  delivered lower-than-expected earnings in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, despite solid top-line trends. Notably, sales topped estimates for the seventh straight quarter. Additionally, the company’s earnings and sales improved year over year.However, shares of Zumiez declined 2% in the after-market trading session yesterday, mainly due to the earnings lag and a soft earnings view for first-quarter fiscal 2018. Nonetheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has advanced 11.4% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 1.3%. This can primarily be attributed to its solid comps trend.Q4 HighlightsZumiez delivered earnings of 82 cents per share, which improved 10.8% year over year but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents.Zumiez Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Zumiez Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Zumiez Inc. QuoteNet sales advanced 16.9% year over year to $308.2 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $302 million. The improvement in the top line came on the back of favorable comps, the contribution from the 53rd week, positive currency impact and 13 net new store additions since last year. Additionally, the company benefited from an adjustment to deferred revenues related to the STASH loyalty program.Quarterly comps grew 7.5%, substantially surpassing the company’s projection of 7% growth. Comps benefited from higher transaction volume, somewhat offset by a drop in dollars per transaction. This marked its sixth straight quarter of positive comps and transaction gains. Moreover, strength in the men’s, women's and footwear categories aided comps growth, partly negated by lower comps in accessories and hardgoods.The company’s robust comps performance in the quarter stemmed from the success in the holiday season. Further, top-line growth reflects significant gains from its differentiated merchandising strategies, integrated sales channels and excellent customer service.Further, the company’s positive comps trend continued in February. Comps for the four-week period ended Mar 3, 2018, escalated 9.2% against a 3.1% decline recorded a year-ago quarter. Moreover, Zumiez reported sales growth of 23.2% to $63.4 million in February.In the reported quarter, gross profit jumped 22% to about $114.7 million, while gross margin expanded 150 basis points (bps) to 37.2%. The increase can be attributed to 120 bps occupancy expense leverage, 70 bps gains from product margin and 80 bps related to the aforementioned adjustment to deferred revenues associated with the STASH loyalty program. This was partly negated by 70 bps rise in inventory shrinkage and 20 bps increase in incentive compensation.Zumiez’s selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 17.5% to nearly $77.7 million, while as a percentage of sales, SG&A expense expanded 20 bps to 25.2%. The higher expenses related to increased annual incentive compensation were partly offset by leverage in store operating and corporate costs.Operating income grew 32.4% year over year to $18.8 million. Moreover, operating margin expanded 130 bps to 12%.Financial UpdateAs of Feb 3, Zumiez’s cash and marketable securities were $121.9 million, up 54.7% year over year. The upside was driven by cash flow from operations, partly offset by capital expenditures. Total shareholders’ equity at the end of the quarter was $355.9 million.Further, the company generated $65.5 million as cash flow from operations in fiscal 2017. Capital expenditures for the year totaled $24.1 million.For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates capital expenditures in a range of $21-$23 million, which will be primarily used for new store openings and planned remodels.Store UpdateIn fiscal 2017, the company opened 19 new stores, including 12 in North America, five in Europe and two in Australia. Additionally, the company closed six stores as a part of its strategy of optimizing store fleet. This brings the net store openings for fiscal 2017 to 13.As of Feb 3, 2018, the company operated a total of 698 stores, including 657 in North America, 34 in Europe and seven in Australia.In fiscal 2018, the company plans to open about 13 new stores including six in the United States, five in Europe and two in Australia. It anticipates nearly half of these openings to occur ahead of the back-to-school season.GuidanceGoing into 2018, Zumiez remains confident of delivering accelerated earnings growth for the year, backed by solid top-line and positive comps trends, margin enhancement programs, improved expense leverage and lower taxes. Additionally, the company believes that infrastructure investments, made to provide a seamless customer experience and a unique approach to merchandising, will aid both top- and bottom-line growth in 2018 and beyond.Consequently, the company projects comps to grow in the low single-digit range in fiscal 2018. However, it expects sales and earnings for the year to be impacted by the absence of the additional 53rd week compared with fiscal 2017.Further, the company expects product margins to be flat to slightly accretive in fiscal 2018. Operating profit is estimated to increase in the high single-digit range. SG&A expenses are expected to grow at a significantly slower rate than fiscal 2017, due to strong expense management and absence of increase in incentive compensation that occurred in fiscal 2017. Apart from the aforementioned gains, the company expects earnings for fiscal 2018 to benefit from the new tax reform with an effective tax rate of roughly 27%.However, the company’s guidance for first-quarter fiscal 2018 was slightly disappointing. While the company robust comps growth and sales guidance, earnings projections were discouraging.The company expects net sales for the first quarter in the $198-$202 million range, while comps growth is anticipated to be 4-6%. The company stated that monthly sales in the quarter will be impacted by the shift in Easter holiday. The shift is likely to bear a positive impact on sales for March and hurt sales in April.Consolidated operating margins are projected between negative 2.6% and negative 1.7%. At the high-end of the guidance, this reflects nearly 46% decline from first-quarter fiscal 2017. Consequently, the company projects loss per share of 13-18 cents compared with a loss of 18 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. This is likely to stem from 3 cents per share negative impact, related to the company’s inability to recognize the tax benefit on losses in certain jurisdictions within Europe.Moreover, this is estimated to negatively impact earnings per share for the second and third quarters as well. However, this should turn to be beneficial in the fourth quarter as the company generates earnings in Europe.Looking for More?

1187,JWN,"Abercrombie & Fitch Company (ANF  -  Free Report) is progressing well on its growth path, driven by strategic capital investments, cost-saving efforts along with loyalty and marketing programs. Further, its robust surprise trend, strength in Hollister, return to positive comps trend and strong direct-to-consumer (DTC) business are aiding performance. The positive effects of these elements are clearly visible in its solid stock movement and estimate revisions trend. Additionally, a VGM Score of B makes this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company a safe haven.Stock SurgesShares of Abercrombie climbed 33.7% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 8.9%. Additionally, the stock witnessed solid growth of 14.1% after reporting better-than-expected results on Mar 7.The company delivered earnings and sales beat in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, marking the third straight positive earnings surprise and fourth consecutive sales beat. Further, it remains encouraged by comps performance that gained from the rise in traffic and conversion. (Read More: Abercrombie Jumps on Q4 Earnings Beat, Guides for FY18)Favorable Estimate RevisionsFollowing the upbeat quarter, the company provided an encouraging view for fiscal 2018 which led to an uptrend in estimates. For fiscal 2018, both comps and sales are projected to be up in low-single digit. Top line gains from the favorable currency rates will be offset by the absence of the additional week sales in 2017.Favorable foreign currency rate is expected to contribute nearly $50 million to sales and $15 million to operating income in fiscal 2018. Furthermore, it expects core tax rate to be in the mid-to-high 20s range, driven by the recently enacted tax reform.Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Abercrombie & Fitch Company QuoteConsequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed an uptrend in the last 30 days. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 and 2019 climbed substantially to 68 cents and 71 cents per share, respectively, from previous estimates of 47 cents and 60 cents.Going forward, the company remains keen on further improving customer experience by investing in loyalty programs, stores, direct-to-consumer and omni-channel capabilities. Further, it expects to maintain the disciplined approach to expense management for driving top- and bottom-line growth. So, here is a sneak peek into the company’s initiatives which are fueling growth.Other CatalystsAbercrombie is making significant progress in expanding digital presence with the growth of direct-to-consumer and omni-channel capabilities. Its investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment have significantly aided the growth of the direct-to-consumer business, which delivered double-digit increase in both the United States and international markets in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.Notably, digital engagement with consumers has been the company’s core strength. This is clear from the fact that more than 70% of the DTC traffic came from mobiles in the fourth quarter. Additionally, its investments in DTC are paying off with conversions improving 14% in the fourth quarter.Overall, the DTC business accounted for nearly 34% of net sales in the fourth quarter, recording 18% increase in comparable sales. In fiscal 2018, the company plans to continue investing in DTC capabilities alongside bringing innovations in this channel, using customer insights and data analytics.Additionally, Abercrombie is aggressively expanding Hollister stores in new markets. The idea is that the smaller size of operation makes it cheaper and less capital intensive compared with the namesake brand. Growth of the Hollister brand internationally could enhance its overall performance. The Hollister brand reflects persistent positive momentum from previous quarters, reaching the $2 billion mark in sales in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.Further, comparable store sales (comps) for the Hollister brand improved 11% in the fourth quarter as it continued to capitalize on the momentum, delivering positive comps in both the United States and international markets. Hollister is gaining from the positive customer response to product innovations, emerging categories and overall customer experience.Not only this, the company remains focused on streamlining its store-fleet by closing underperforming stores and expanding in markets with growth potential. Store closure gives Abercrombie more flexibility in terms of cost savings, amid a tough environment. Since 2010, it closed more than 400 stores while nearly 60% of its U.S. leases are set to expire in the next two years. This provides significant flexibility to strike the right channel balance and drive efficiency with options to remodel or resize stores, renegotiate leases or close stores.Looking for More Solid Picks, Check TheseInvestors can count upon some better-ranked stocks in the same industry like The Finish Line Inc. , The Gap, Inc.

1194,JWN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Nordstrom has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.1x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Nordstrom’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Nordstrom has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.8, which is tad higher than the current level. So it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Nordstrom has a P/S ratio of about 0.6. This is sugnificantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years. If anything, JWN is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Nordstrom currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Nordstrom a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Nordstrom might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of A. This gives JWN a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been favorable. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen nine up in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 5% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has increased 11.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Nordstrom, Inc. Price and Consensus  Nordstrom, Inc. Price and Consensus | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteThis positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Bottom LineNordstrom is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a solid industry rank (among Top 41% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #2 instill investor confidence. However, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:We believe, despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance, a good industry and Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Nordstrom.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Additionally, initiatives like strategic capital investments, cost-saving efforts, loyalty and marketing programs aided Abercrombie to outperform the industry in the past month. The stock gained 18.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 5.3%.Q4 SynopsisThe company posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.38 per share, significantly outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13. Moreover, the bottom line increased a whopping 84% from 75 cents earned in the year-ago quarter. Earnings benefited from more-than-double operating income in the quarter, as well as positive currency impact. Notably, currency tailwinds, net of hedging, were roughly 14 cents per share in the quarter.Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Abercrombie & Fitch Company QuoteNet sales of $1,193.2 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,169 million and grew 15% year over year. The upside was driven by comparable sales (comps) growth of 9%, benefits of 4% from the additional week and a positive currency impact of 3%.Brand-wise, net sales improved 19% to $709.2 million at Hollister, while sales for the Abercrombie brand rose 9% to $484 million.  From a geographical viewpoint, net sales grew 13% and 20%, in the United States and international markets, respectively. Moreover, the company’s direct-to-consumer business continued to perform well, accounting for nearly 34% of the net sales and recording 18% increase in comparable sales.The company remains encouraged by comps performance that benefited from the rise in traffic and conversion. Notably, positive traffic trends improved sequentially from the third quarter. Further, we note that the company’s comps improved sequentially throughout fiscal 2017, with positive comps across brands and geographies in the fourth quarter.On a segmental basis, comps for Hollister increased 11%, while Abercrombie reported 5% growth. Moreover, comps improved 11% in the United States and 5% internationally.While the Hollister brand reflected persistent positive momentum from the previous quarters, Abercrombie showed further signs of improvement, returning to positive comps trend in the fourth quarter.Gross profit margin contracted 90 basis points (bps) to 58.4%, owing to increased average unit cost and lower average unit retail.Abercrombie reported adjusted operating income of $148 million for the quarter, substantially up from adjusted operating income of $61 million recorded in the prior-year period. This marks more than double operating income growth for the quarter. Despite the lower gross margins, the increase in operating income is attributed to significant expense leverage during the quarter.FinancialsAbercrombie ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $675.6 million and gross borrowings under its term loan agreement of $253.3 million. As of Feb 3, 2018, inventories were $424.4 million, up 6% from the prior-year period.On Feb 23, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share on the Class A Common Stock. This is payable Mar 19, to shareholders of record as of Mar 9.Store UpdateIn fiscal 2017, the company inaugurated nine new stores, comprising six stores in the United States and one international full-price store as well as two outlet stores. Additionally, the company shut down 39 stores in the fiscal, mainly comprising of stores in the United States.Management expects to introduce 21 full-price stores in fiscal 2018, including 11 stores in the United States and 10 in international locations. Moreover, it plans to shut down up to 60 stores in the United States in fiscal 2018, through natural lease expirations.OutlookWe note that the company made significant progress on its initiatives in fiscal 2017. This helped it reach significant milestones, including $2 billion sales generated at Hollister, Abercrombie’s return to positive comps trend in the fourth quarter and record digital-sales growth across all brands. Going forward, the company remains keen on further improving customer experience by investing in loyalty programs, stores, direct-to-consumer and omni-channel capabilities. Further, the company expects to maintain its disciplined approach to expense management to drive top- and bottom-line growth.For fiscal 2018, both comps and sales are projected to be up low-single digits. Top line gains from the favorable currency rates will be offset by the absence of the additional week sales in 2017. Favorable foreign currency rate is expected to contribute nearly $50 million to sales and $15 million to operating income in fiscal 2018.Gross margin is projected to be slightly above 59.7% recorded in fiscal 2017, while it will remain pressured in first-quarter 2018. Operating expense, including other operating income, is expected to increase nearly 1% from $2 billion recorded in fiscal 2017. This will continue to reflect expense leverage while supporting ongoing investments in strategic initiatives. Abercrombie also expects average shares outstanding of about 71 million.Furthermore, the company expects core tax rate to be in the mid-to-high 20s range, driven by the recently enacted tax reform. However, including nearly $10 million of discrete non-cash income tax charges related to share-based compensation accounting standards, it expects the effective tax rate in the mid-to-high 30s range.For the first quarter, the company estimates effective tax rate of low-double digits to low teens, including $9 million from the aforementioned non-cash income tax charges.Additionally, the company envisions capital expenditures to be roughly $130 million for fiscal 2018.

1200,JWN,"Several industry headwinds, many of which were sparked by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and the rise of e-commerce, forced brick-and-mortar retailers like Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) to adapt their businesses in order to survive.These moves have caused some investors to stay away from retailers in recent years. However, like any industry or stock, there are no guarantees in retail. Investors must always focus on the stock’s current fundamentals in order to gauge its possible performance.For example, Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) is expected to see its sales climb by 5.45% to $4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, which includes the crucial holiday shopping period. But top-line growth for an established company such as Gap is not enough to excite investors on its own.The retailer is also projected to see its quarterly earnings hit $0.59 per share, up more than 15% year over year. Yet, investors will need to see more in order to know if they should expect Gap to actually top this solid EPS estimate.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Gap is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. Coupled with its Earnings ESP of 0.15%, which means earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead of Gap’s Q4 results, investors should consider the stock as one that could beat earnings estimates.Investors should also note that Gap has topped or matched earnings estimates in the trailing 12 quarters, including beats of 5.45%, 11.54%, and 24.14% over the last three periods, respectivelyGap is set to report its Q4 and fiscal 2017 earnings results after market close on Thursday, March 1.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1201,JWN,"Shares of several major department store retailers gained on Tuesday morning following positive earnings from Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report). With several more players in the industry set to report this week, the focus will now shift to the likes of Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) to continue the trend of strong results.Macy’s shares climbed more than 11% in early trading following the release of its latest report. The industry bellwether posted adjusted earnings of $2.82 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.69.The company saw revenue figures of $8.67 billion, missing our consensus estimate of $8.72 billion but improving 1.8% from the year-ago period. Same-store sales increased 1.3% during the holiday quarter (also read: Macy's Soars on Earnings Beat & Strong Guidance).Macy’s expects fiscal 2018 earnings to fall in the range of $3.55 to $3.75 per share—well ahead of our current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.89. Management also said that it expects comps to be flat to up 1% on the year.Meanwhile, department store chain Dillard’s also topped earnings expectations. The company reported adjusted profits of $2.82 per share, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.82 and soaring more than 50% on a year-over-year basis. Dillard’s shares popped more than 15% in the wake of the report.Upbeat results from Macy’s and Dillard’s helped lift fellow retailers, including Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) and JCPenney (JCP  -  Free Report) on Tuesday morning. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) was up nearly 1% in early trading hours.But now the attention will turn to those yet to report this week, including Macy’s rival Nordstrom. The Nordstrom family is expected to finalize a go-private deal soon, and that premium is likely factored into the stock already. However, the company’s results will still be a great indicator of the health of the retail industry right now, so investors will want to pay close attention.So what does Nordstrom have in store? Let’s take a closer look.Latest OutlookBased on our latest consensus estimates, we expect Nordstrom to report adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share and total revenues of $4.61 billion. This bottom line result would represent a year-over-year slump of 9.5%, but the company’s top line is expected to improve by more than 6.8%.Nordstrom already posted its November and December sales figures, reporting revenue growth of 2.5% and comps growth of 1.2% for that period.Earnings ESPInvestors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Nordstrom surprises investors with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Just a few days before its report, JWN is sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of -0.72. This is because the company’s Most Accurate Estimate for earnings sits at $1.23 per share, meaning that the most recent analyst estimates have been lower than the consensus.Despite the stock’s strong Zacks Rank, our model does not conclusively indicate that we are in store for a beat.Want more market analysis from this author?

1202,JWN,"Shares of upscale departmental store retailer, Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) lost 5.3% on Oct 16 on the news that Nordstrom family’s plans to take the company private are on hold for the time being. The Nordstrom family, which has been exploring options to fund the privatization for a while now, informed the “Special Committee” that it has deferred the search process for the rest of the year.While the Nordstrom family alias the Group notified that it plans to resume exploration initiatives after the holiday season, it remains to be seen if any deal can actually surface amid the tough retail landscape. Though the possibility of finding a lender may depend on Nordstrom’s performance in this crucial selling season, some reports suggest that it depends on the overall holiday season scenario.Nevertheless, let’s delve deeper and analyze what just happened.Privatization on Hold – Why?It was in June when Nordstrom first announced that the family (which currently owns about 31% stake in the company) was seeking viable options of taking the company private, by buying all the outstanding shares of Nordstrom. Then, Nordstrom formed a “Special Committee” including its board of directors. This “Special Committee” that consists of Nordstrom’s independent directors, will act on the company’s behalf on anything related to the aforementioned privatization.Since then, the Group has been looking for potential sponsors. In fact, there were rounds that the Nordstrom family was nearing a deal with Leonard Green & Partners, apart from being in talks with Apollo Global Management LLC and KKR & Co LLP to help the deal pass through. However, it looks like the family and the private equity firms are facing a hard time securing funds for the transaction. This can be largely blamed upon the troubles looming over the retail sector, which has weighed upon lenders’ confidence.Little About the Retail Hurdles: Where’s Nordstrom Headed?Retailers, including big-wigs like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) have long been battling evolving consumer trends and the mounting competition from e-commerce giant, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). With consumers’ accelerated transition to the dot.com world, retailers are suffering soft sales as store traffic has been hit hard. Moreover, costs associated with efforts to boost omni-channel initiatives are straining the companies’ margins. Owing to these challenges, the retail space has also witnessed various bankruptcies, mergers and acquisitions.Given such circumstances, going private was considered a prudent move for Nordstrom, as it will help the Nordstrom family reshape the organization and overcome the hurdles faster, which is not that easy as a public entity. As a private firm, it will be easier for Nordstrom to make the required investments per the changing consumer trends, without caring much about stockholders’ short-term responses.  However, it looks like the lenders are waiting to see retailers’ holiday season performance amid these challenges, as this season generates a considerable chunk of revenues for most retailers. Undoubtedly, this is likely to create a pressure on Nordstrom, which has tumbled 13.6% this year, though it performed better than the industry that plunged 25.8% in the said time frame.   Notably, Nordstrom has been gaining from its off-price Rack store business. Also, the company’s e-commerce initiatives are bearing significant results, as evident from its online sales growth of 20% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. So for now, we remain hopeful about the company’s holiday season performance, which might just switch on the Nordstrom family’s search mode on again.The Nordstrom family comprises the company’s three Co-Presidents — Blake W. Nordstrom, Peter E. Nordstrom and Erik B. Nordstrom; President of Stores — James F. Nordstrom; Chairman — Emeritus Bruce A. Nordstrom, and Anne E. Gittinger, together. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1203,JWN,"Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) is in investors’ good books, driven by robust comparable store sales (comps) and improved margins. Also, it is benefiting from the integration of Family Dollar. While its top and bottom lines lagged estimates in the most recent quarter, it has delivered positive earnings and sales surprise in the preceding two quarters. However, volatile consumer environment, intense competition and significant global exposure remain impediments.Notably, shares of Dollar Tree have gained 24.3% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 12.6%. Let’s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Solid Q4 & OutlookDespite posting lower-than-expected results, Dollar Tree’s earnings and sales improved year over year in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Earnings gained from higher sales, rise in comparable store sales (comps) and higher margins. Meanwhile, sales benefited from a solid performance at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores. Additionally, it witnessed the expansion of both gross and operating margins. While gross margin growth was backed by reduced merchandise costs, lower markdowns and occupancy expenses; operating margin benefited from SG&A leverage.Going forward, the company provided a robust outlook for first-quarter and fiscal 2018. It forecasts consolidated net sales for the first quarter to be $5.53-$5.63 billion while earnings are envisioned to be $1.18-$1.25 per share. For fiscal 2018, it expects net sales of $22.70-$23.12 billion and earnings of $5.25-$5.60 per share.Remarkable Comps GrowthDollar Tree displayed remarkable comps growth for the last several quarters, mainly due to competitive pricing and strategic store expansion plans, including remodeling and relocations. Dollar Tree continues the positive trend with consolidated constant-currency comps growth of 2.4% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, which marked the 40th straight quarter of comps growth. The fourth-quarter comps growth can be attributed to improved customer count and average ticket.While Dollar Tree banner posted comps growth of 3.8% (in constant-currency), comps at the Family Dollar banner climbed 1%. This also marked the third straight quarter of positive comps at Family Dollar, driven by a continued rebuilding of the business. Moreover, the company anticipates comps growth in a low-single-digit range for both the first-quarter and fiscal 2018.Store-Fleet Growth to Drive Top LineCurrently, Dollar Tree is concentrating on expanding its store base and incorporating technological advancements. This, in turn, enables it to generate healthy sales and gain market share. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, it opened 137 new stores and expanded or relocated eight. Moreover, the company opened total 603 stores in fiscal 2017.For fiscal 2018, the company expects to open nearly 650 new stores, including 350 Dollar Tree and 300 Family Dollar. Further, it plans to undertake renovations of at least 450 Family Dollar stores, relocate or expand nearly 100 stores and re-banner 50 from Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree. Notably, it remains on track to operate over 10,000 Dollar Tree and over 15,000 Family Dollar outlets across the United States in the long term.Family Dollar Integration on TrackDollar Tree is befitting from the ongoing integration of Family Dollar that was acquired in July 2015. The company is undertaking significant store renovation initiatives for Family Dollar to attract more customers. Through the integration, it expects to generate annual run rate synergies worth at least $300 million by the end of the third year of this acquisition.ConclusionWhile all seems well, Dollar Tree has been facing problems regarding highly competitive market and volatile consumer behavior. Also, significant global exposure poses a serious threat to its performance. However, we believe, its strategies will be able to offset these headwinds.Do Retail-Wholesale Stocks Grab Your Attention?

1204,JWN,"Shares of Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) sunk on Monday after the department store chain announced that its plan to go private has been put on hold until after the holiday season, at the earliest.The Nordstrom family told a special committee of Nordstrom’s board—which was appointed to oversee any possible sale—that they have paused their search for a private equity partner to take the business private. The family, who own roughly 31% of the company, said they will resume their efforts to take the company private after the holiday season.“The Special Committee, which is committed to protecting the interests of the Company [Nordstrom] and all its shareholders, is prepared to thoroughly evaluate such a proposal from the Group at that time, if one is made… No assurances can be given regarding the terms and details of any transaction,” a Nordstrom company release stated.The Nordstrom family announced during the summer that they were in the process of trying to take the company private amid a quickly changing retail environment. Over the last several months, talk surrounding Nordstrom’s possible buyout has included KKR (KKR  -  Free Report), Apollo (APO  -  Free Report), and Leonard Green & Partners.In the potential deal, Leonard Green or other firms would supply roughly $1 billion to the Nordstrom family to help fund a deal to go private. However, the news has always been relatively speculative, causing the company’s stock price to fluctuate wildly.The possibility of a deal being reached has been hampered because the family and potential private equity partners have found it hard to raise enough debt at reasonable rates in order to completely fund a buyout of the $6.67 billion company.Banks are worried that they would have trouble selling Nordstrom’s debt before the holiday shopping season ends and would then be forced to wait until next year. This could leave banks vulnerable if Nordstrom’s sales falter during its holiday quarter, which would make offloading its debt much harder.Banks, along with many investors, are concerned that shifting retail trends, including a slump in mall foot traffic and the rise of e-commerce powers such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), will hurt the high-end retailer even further.Nordstrom shares fell over 6% Monday morning. Shares of the historic U.S. department store now sit just above its 52-week low heading into the most important season of the retail year.Other Department Stores Shares of Nordstrom’s biggest retail peers dipped on Monday after the news.

Its portfolio includes 122 full-line stores across the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada, two Jeffrey boutiques, 227 Nordstrom Racks and two clearance stores.Though Nordstrom’s growth strategy bodes well, investments toward occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing are likely to weigh upon its near-term cost and margin performance.

1206,JWN,"Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) has reached its store expansion target for fiscal 2017 with the inauguration of 40 new stores in September and so far in October. These include 30 Ross Dress For Less and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS stores.For fiscal 2017, management announced plans to open a total of 90 stores comprising 70 Ross and 20 dd’s DISCOUNTS outlets. However, these numbers exclude its plans to relocate or close 10 existing stores during the fiscal year. Markedly, so far in fiscal 2017, the company introduced a total of 96 outlets, including 74 Ross and 22 dd's DISCOUNTS stores.These store openings mark Ross Stores’ expansion in 22 different states, in both new and existing markets. Notably, the fall openings strengthened the company’s footprint in its newest market — the Midwest, with roughly 50% of the new stores located in this region.We note that Ross Stores remains committed to its store-expansion efforts. Evidently, the company is well on track to achieve the target of reaching 2,500 stores, comprising 2,000 Ross and 500 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores, over the long term. Currently, it operates roughly 1,412 off-price home fashion and apparel stores across 37 states, the District of Columbia and Guam.Apart from Ross Stores, there are retailers like Nordstrom, Inc.

The company has a proven business model as the competitive bargains it offers continue to make its stores attractive destinations for customers in all economic scenarios.  Moreover, Ross Stores’ off-price model offers strong value proposition and micro-merchandising that drive better product allocation and margins.

1208,JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 1, after the closing bell.The company has been gaining from the smooth execution of customer strategy along with disciplined inventory management. Also, it is enhancing market share through persistent store expansion and strengthening capabilities via further investments. Notably, these initiatives helped the company to deliver sixth straight positive earnings surprise in third-quarter fiscal 2017, wherein sales marked its second successive beat. However, higher expenses continue to remain a headwind, which are likely to weigh upon the company’s near-term margin performance.Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 for the fourth quarter reflects a year-over-year decline of 9.5%, though it remained stable in the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues to come in at $4,611 million, up 6.8% from the prior-year quarter. Furthermore, the consensus mark for sales at Nordstrom full-line stores and Nordstrom Rack are pegged at $2,060 million and $1,097 million, respectively, showing year-over-year increases of 38.4% and 13.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Factors at PlayNordstrom is making significant progress with respect to its customer-based strategy and is on track to reach its long-term growth target of $20 billion by 2020. With regard to cost savings, the company plans to strike a balance between its sales and expense growth. Also, it is focused on advancing in the technology space by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, and improving its supply-chain channels and marketing efforts. Management anticipates online penetration to exceed 25% by the end of the year.Recently, the company also released sales and comparable store sales (comps) for the combined months of November and December, which primarily comprises the holiday season. Nordstrom recorded a 2.5% increase in net sales for the nine weeks (ended Dec 30, 2017) while comps for the period rose 1.2%. The solid holiday show was primarily driven by growth in Nordstrom’s full-line and Rack stores compared with the year-to-date sales performance and persistent strength in e-commerce at Nordstrom.com and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook.Driven by the robust holiday sales, management raised its previously stated guidance for fiscal 2017. The company now expects sales growth of nearly 4.2%, including the 53rd week, with comps expected to gain 0.5%. Additionally, Nordstrom anticipates earnings in the range of $2.90-$2.95 per share, marking an increase from the prior guidance range of $2.85-$2.95 per share. The revised guidance assumes strong sales growth, persistent stability in merchandise margins and higher supply chain, technology, and occupancy costs related to the company’s growth initiatives.These factors have boosted the company’s share price performance in the last three months. The stock has gained 22.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 11.7%.Though Nordstrom’s growth strategy bodes well, higher investments related to occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing are likely to hurt the company’s performance. Apparently, the company’s merchandise margin was hurt by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores in the fiscal third quarter. This led contraction in gross margins and increase in SG&A expenses.

1209,JWN,"U.S. stocks not only suffered their worst week in more than two years but are also on the brink of logging the worst March. Trump-China trade war rhetoric is threatening global economic growth, while a tighter monetary policy is about to hinder the bull run that began almost a decade ago.A third party firm improperly keeping Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) users’ data also raised fears of restrictive regulations in the technology sector. This in turn disrupted tech’s growth trajectory, which for long helped the broader market scale north.With the markets going through a rough patch, investing in stocks that provide excellent risk-adjusted returns seems judicious.Stocks to Face Worst MarchIt has been a rough month for the broader market. The Dow Jones is on the verge to see its worst March after it had tanked 8.97% almost 40 years back, per the WSJ Market Data Group. In fact, the blue-chip gauge lost more than 1,400 points over the last five trading sessions, marking the index’s steepest weekly percentage loss since 2016.The broader S&P 500 is also on the brink of its ugliest March in 17 years, when it had slumped 6.4%. The benchmark index turned negative for the year and is around 10% below its all-time high hit earlier this year. In addition, the tech-laden Nasdaq will witness an excruciating March decline since 2001. Meanwhile, Wall Street’s so-called fear-gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, soared 57% last week, well above its long-term average of 20. This invariably shows that bearish bets continue to outdo their bullish counterparts in the indices so far this month.But, what has triggered such a selloff leading to U.S. stocks ending in their worst week in years?Restrictive Trade Policy, Rising Interest RatesSelling in stocks intensified after the Trump administration announced that it will levy tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports on top of imposing duties on foreign steel and aluminum. In response to Trump’s tariffs, Beijing said that it will target 128 U.S. products with an import value of $3 billion. These products mostly include U.S pork, fresh fruit, dried fruits, steel pipes, modified ethanol, ginseng and wine.Such heated trade rhetoric doesn’t bode well for the American economy. If a full-fledged trade war takes place, the United States might slip into a recession in the near future and the jobless rate might more than double from current levels. Tariffs on the U.S. will lead to rise in inflation along with an uptick in import prices, provoking the Fed to hike rates. And we all know that easy monetary policy so far has helped the U.S. stock market celebrate its nine-year bull run. Investors had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China.Fed, by the way, has tightened its monetary policy. At the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Mar 21, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020. The vote to lift the benchmark lending rate was a unanimous 8-0. Thus, the broader market might keep falling as long as the Fed continues to remain hawkish.The Facebook FiascoAdding to the downbeat tone is a sharp selloff in the technology sector. Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies. Lest we forget, tech shares have gained the most so far this year.However, the sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook’s handling of user data. Everyone raised questions as to how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump’s election campaign, had gained access to personal data on roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge. Facebook shares saw a weekly decline of 14%, the biggest since 2012. Other tech behemoths, including Apple and Google-parent Alphabet, lost more than 7% in the week.Time to Buy 5 Ultra-Safe StocksAs March is plagued by fears of a trade war, rising rates and data mining scandal, investing in low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns seems judicious.The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1. These stocks are also dividend payers which boast immense financial strength and are immune to market vagaries.

1210,JWN,"Retail is no more constrained to its brick-&-mortar existence. Instead it is rapidly accepting the concepts of an increasingly digitized world as advancing technology and digital transformation are playing key roles in evolving consumer shopping patterns. Retailers are now focusing more on enhancing omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities. Although Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) is not fully immune to retail headwinds, this department store retailer is leaving no stone unturned to be on growth trajectory.This is well reflected by this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock’s bullish run in the past three months in a market that fell victim to escalating trade war between the United States and China. In the said period, shares of this seller of apparel and accessories, cosmetics, home furnishings and other consumer goods surged 23.1% compared with the industry’s growth of 18.1%.Macy’s Get its Act TogetherMacy’s has announced a slew of measures revolving around store closures, cost containment, real estate strategy and investment in omni-channel capabilities to enhance sales, profitability and cash flows. Additionally, management is developing e-commerce business, Macy’s Backstage off-price business along with expanding Bluemercury and online order fulfillment centers.Moreover, the company had introduced various innovative services including Apple Pay, Same Day Delivery, Enhanced Shopping Apps, Innovation in Stores Selling Technology, Macy’s Image Search and Macy’s Wallet/Bloomingdale’s Wallet. The company’s “Buy Online Pickup in Store” initiative is also gaining traction. The company has added a new feature to its mobile app called Mobile Checkout, which allows customers to scan bar codes of items and pay via smartphones.Management is realigning operations and focusing on curtailing costs. The company has closed 81 Macy’s stores, as part of its planned closure of about 100 stores announced in August 2016, and plans to shutter about 19 more stores. Further, the company will streamline some of the non-functional stores.These efforts will result in annual cost saving of $300 million beginning 2018 and would allow the company to invest the same in enhancing digital business and store-related growth initiatives. Macy’s had earlier announced the restructuring of its merchandising operations that includes combining of merchandising, planning and private brands divisions into one segment.Wrapping UpAmid a competitive retail scenario, Macy’s has taken several strategic initiatives to adapt to the ongoing changes in the industry. These initiatives have aided the company to post earnings beat for the third straight quarter, when it reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. The big take away from the quarter was rise in comparable sales after witnessing a decline the past few quarters. Further, management hinted that strategic investments across stores, technology and merchandising are likely to increase comparable sales in fiscal 2018.Interested in the Retail Space, Check TheseUrban Outfitters, Inc.

1211,JWN,"Fastenal Company (FAST  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 11, before the opening bell.In the last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company surpassed expectations in only one of the trailing four quarters, the average being 1%.Let’s look at the factors which might affect the company’s results in the first quarter.Vending Machines to Drive Growth: Fastenal’s sales in the last few quarters have been driven by an increased installation of industrial vending machines. Sales through vending machines grew at or near a double-digit pace in each of the four quarters of 2017. The company signed 19,355 vending machines in 2017, up 7.2% from the prior-year quarter and the highest since 2013.Onsite Locations to Boost Sales: A consistent increase in the number of on-site locations is likely to strengthen Fastenal’s market share and boost the quarterly numbers. Sales growth through Onsite was 22% in 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the first quarter of 2018. Fastenal aims to achieve 360-385 onsite signings in 2018, reflecting an increase of 270 signings in 2017.Mansco Acquisition: We are encouraged by Fastenal’s acquisition of certain assets of industrial and fastener supply distributor — Manufacturer's Supply Company (Mansco) — in March 2017. This fortifies Fastenal’s presence in markets where it has not significantly contributed in the past. Mansco contributed 140 basis points (bps) to total sales growth of 14.8% in the last reported quarter and is expected to maintain the same in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Backed by sustained strength in most of its end markets as well as strong momentum in vending machines installations and onsite locations, the company is expected to report solid top- and bottom-line growth in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.18 billion, implying 12.9% year over year growth. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 61 cents, reflecting an improvement of 32.6% on a year-over-year basis.However, we are apprehensive about Fastenal’s changes in product and customer mix that have been hurting the gross margin for quite some time. Gross margin of 49.3% in 2017 dropped 30 bps from the prior-year period. Also, storms in the eastern and southern regions of United States care likely to mar prospects, as it had a significant impact on business activity in the first half of January 2018.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Fastenal has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Fastenal is +0.21%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Fastenal Company Price and EPS Surprise  Fastenal Company Price and EPS Surprise | Fastenal Company QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector that, according to our model, which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.

1212,JWN,"Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), and countless others retailers have been forced to revamp their business models on the fly to help fend off a wave of online sellers over the past few years. However, at least one retail industry—discount retail—actually seems to be better off these days.There are an array of reasons that off-priced sellers are bucking sector-wide trends, most of which relate directly to the socioeconomic background of their customers and physical retail locations.The discount retail uptick occurred even before the new Republican tax law was passed, but now analysts seem more confident in the sector based on these GOP-related headwinds. J.P. Morgan (JMP  -  Free Report) analysts recently reiterated their “Overweight” rating for Dollar Tree, noting that low-to-middle income households are set to earn substantial monetary benefits this year.Along with more money in the pockets of their consumer base, the retailers themselves are set to see lower effective tax rates going forward.With all of this said, let’s take a look at three discount retail stocks that growth-minded investors might want to consider.1.       Dollar Tree, Inc (DLTR  -  Free Report) Dollar Tree is one of the last true remaining dollar stores and iscurrently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). On top of reiterating the stock’s rating, J.P.

The company also sports an Earnings ESP of 1.95%, which means earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead ofits Q4 report—set for early March.The company has also witnessed nine earnings estimate revisions with 100% agreement to the upside for the coming fiscal year. Looking even further ahead, Dollar Tree is projectedto grow its earnings per share figures at an annualized rate of 14.55% over the next three to five years.2.       Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report)Burlington is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. This off-priced clothing retailer expects to open a total of 37 new stores in fiscal 2017. Burlington is also projected to see its Q4 and full-year revenues climb 16.85% and 32.10%, respectively, when it reports its results on March 1.Furthermore, the retailerhas earned six earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2018 with 100% agreement to the upside. Investors should also be happy to note that Burlington has met or topped earnings estimates for four straight years, with an average surprise of 15% in the trailing four quarters. Burlington is expected to see its bottom line surge at an annualized rate of 18.65% over the next three to five years.3.       Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report)The discount retailer is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an overall “A” VGM score.

1214,JWN,"Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) stock has been cheering since the start of 2018 backed by its sturdy customer-oriented strategies, persistent store expansion initiatives leading to increased market share and investments to strengthen capabilities, particularly in digital growth. Moreover, the company’s raised guidance for fiscal 2017 followed by its encouraging holiday season sales, raises expectations for a spectacular 2018.Optimistic view for 2018 along with robust initiatives led the Nordstrom stock to increase 1.2% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s decline of 3.2%. Let’s delve deeper into the factors driving this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock up.Robust Holiday Sales & Upbeat OutlookNordstrom posted modest improvement in sales and comparable store sales (comps) for the combined months of November and December, which primarily comprises the holiday season. The upside was primarily driven by growth in Nordstrom’s full-line and Rack stores compared with the year-to-date sales performance as well as persistent strength in e-commerce at Nordstrom.com and Nordstromrack.com/ HauteLook. While sales increased 2.5%, comps rose 1.2% for the nine weeks (ended Dec 30, 2017).Driven by this robust holiday sales, Nordstrom raised its previous guidance for fiscal 2017. The company now expects sales growth of nearly 4.2%, including the 53rd week, higher than the previously expectation of 4% sales growth. Also, comps are likely to increase 0.5% compared with the prior expectation of flat comps. Additionally, the company anticipates earnings in the range of $2.90-$2.95 per share, marking an increase from the $2.85-$2.95 per share guided earlier.Robust Surprise TrendNordstrom portrays a solid positive earnings surprise trend with six straight quarters of earnings beat. Further, the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the last two quarters. This solid trend was driven by the smooth execution of the company’s customer strategy along with disciplined inventory and expense management. Also, sales growth in Nordstrom Rack and solid e-commerce performance are aiding results.Long-Term Growth Initiatives Augur WellNordstrom has been making remarkable progress with respect to its customer-based strategy. Additionally, it is well on track to reach long-term growth target of $20 billion by 2020.

Third-quarter fiscal 2017 results reflected significant progress on its digital strategy. Notably, it delivered online sales growth of 14% at Nordstrom.com and a 26% increase at Nordstromrack.com/ HauteLook. Nordstrom anticipates online penetration to exceed 25% by the end of the year, backed by the ongoing efforts to elevate digital experience.With regard to cost savings, Nordstrom is making plans to strike a balance between its sales and expense growth. Meanwhile, the company remains focused on its advancement in the technology space by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, and improving its supply-chain channels and marketing efforts. These endeavors are likely to pave the way for sustainable growth over the long term.Store Expansion Improve Market ShareNordstrom remains focused on its store expansion strategy in order to boost market share. In fact, the company prioritizes its investments in the top North American markets. Markedly, the opening of new stores is not only expected to attract customers but also boost the company’s top line via synergies across other channels. Nordstrom has also successfully completed its planned full-line store expansion in Canada with the opening of its sixth outlet at Sherway Gardens in Toronto.Bottom LineWhile all is well with Nordstrom, higher expenses remain a concern in the near term. Moreover, higher investments toward occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing are likely to weigh upon near term costs and marginsHowever, the company is likely to overcome these hurdles through its solid multichannel growth strategies to keep up with the retail industry trends.

1215,JWN,"The holiday season breathed a new life into retailers, raising hopes for a spectacular 2018. Improved economic scenario with a low unemployment rate resulted in sturdy holiday sales growth since the end of the Great Recession. Per National Retail Federation, retail sales during the November/December period increased 5.5% to $691.9 billion. Moreover, online shopping sales this holiday season increased 14.7% to $108.2 billion, per Adobe Analytics.Our today’s article revolves around four apparel store stocks — Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report), Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report) and American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report) — as to how the holiday season has unfolded for them. Promising holiday sales numbers have not only helped the industry to rally 24.7% in the past three months but also outperform the S&P 500’s growth of 9.6%. We noted that the industry occupies a space in the top 18% of the Zacks Classified industries (49 out of the 265). Further, the broader Retail And Wholesale sector of which they are part of, is also placed at top 13% of the Zacks Classified sectors (2 out of 16). Let’s take a closer look at the performances of the four apparel retailers.Nordstrom Witnesses Rise in Holiday SalesNordstrom has concluded 2017 on a strong note, reporting improvement in sales and comparable store sales (comps) for the combined months of November and December.  The company recorded 2.5% increase in net sales for the nine weeks ended Dec 30, 2017, while comps for the period rose 1.2%. The solid holiday show was primarily driven by growth in Nordstrom’s full-line and Rack stores, compared with the year-to-date sales performance, as well as persistent strength in e-commerce at Nordstrom.com and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook.The strength of the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s full-line and Rack was evident from sales growth of 0.7% and 8.2%, respectively, at these formats. Additionally, comps were up 1% for Nordstrom full-line and increased 2.9% for Nordstrom Rack. Results at Nordstrom full-line stores mainly include the United States and Canada full-line stores, and Nordstrom.com as well as Trunk Club.Lululemon Lifts Guidance Post Impressive Holiday SeasonLululemon Athletica was also among the retailers that emerged strong this holiday season driven by accelerating trends witnessed across its businesses. This prompted management to raise fiscal 2017 guidance. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company now expects adjusted earnings per share in the band of $1.25-$1.27, up from the earlier guided range of $1.19-$1.22.Urban Outfitters Holiday Sales Fail to Impress InvestorsUrban Outfitters revealed holiday sales numbers, wherein comparable retail segment net sales, including the comparable direct-to-consumer channel, gained 2%. For the month of November and December comparable retail segment net sales rose 1% at Urban Outfitters, 5% at Free People and 2% at the Anthropologie Group. Gain in comparable retail sales were driven by double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel. Despite reporting year-over-year increase in holiday sales, the stock came under pressure primarily due to lower-than-expected comps. In early December, the company in a filing stated that “Thus far during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, comparable Retail segment net sales are mid-single-digit positive”. However, comps for the November and December increased by low-single digit, which is an indication that the company failed to sustain its initial momentum in the latter part of holiday season.However, we believe new store openings, increase in direct penetration, growing wholesale operations and merchandising improvements bode well for the long term. Management is also making all possible efforts to enhance the performance of brands through store refurbishment and by bringing in more compelling assortments. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.American Eagle Outfitters Posts Robust Holiday SalesAmerican Eagle Outfitters delivered comps growth of 8% for the holiday period and reiterated outlook for the fourth quarter. The company continues to expect earnings per share of 42-44 cents compared with 39 cents earned in the prior-year quarter. Comps for the period gained from solid online and in-store traffic as customers responded positively to the company’s merchandising offerings. Also, record sales and strong momentum at its AE and Aerie brands aided comps growth. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

SG&A expenses have increased 18.6%, 2.2% and 3.2% in the fourth, third and second quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively.Management hinted that higher investments in the supply chain and increased transportation costs are likely to weigh on gross profit of the Domestic business by approximately 25 basis points in each quarter. The national roll-out of Total Tech Support offering in the second quarter is also expected to weigh on gross margin of the Domestic business.For the full year, Best Buy expects the rollout to hurt domestic gross margin by approximately 15-20 basis points.

1217,JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) recently announced the relocation of one of its full-line store from Westside Pavilion to the Westfield Century City in Los Angeles, CA.Additionally, the company launched Nordstrom Local in the city, which is a modern retailing concept store that does not stock merchandise. This latest concept is quite different from the traditional retail approach and is a neighborhood store, where the company’s services are easily available in a centralized location.The opening celebrations of the new full-line store at the Westfield Century City will continue all through the month, with ‘Nordstrom x Who What Wear Style in The City’ and ‘Nordstrom Beauty x L.A.’ Also, guests including various celebrity makeup artists and beauty experts are invited to make in-store appearances.Sprawling over 154,000 square-foot area, the Westfield Century City store is likely to offer unique and exclusive brands’ merchandise. This includes two shops organized by the company’s vice president of creative projects – the fifth Nordstrom x NIKE (NKE  -  Free Report) sneaker boutique, a women's-only lifestyle model, and SPACE, a boutique housing latest designers such as Roksanda, Acne and Marques'Almeida.Apart from these, this three-level store is likely to accommodate the first West Coast MAC Makeup Studio with licensed professionals, Bar Verde — a seasonally-focused restaurant and bar; along with ‘Style Bar’ — a drop-in place to meet the Personal Stylists. Additionally, the store will feature ‘Nordstrom to You’ — a mobile personal stylist service — coupled with ‘Buy Online & Pick-Up In-Store’ and ‘Reserve & Try In-Store’ capabilities, among others.The latest store offers a great collection of popular brands like J. Crew, Topshop, Madewell, Good American, Alice + Olivia, Alexander Wang and many others. Notably, the store houses three designer handbag boutiques including Loewe, Christian Louboutin and Givenchy, along with accessories and handbags from Pop & Suki, Rebecca Minkoff, Gentle Monster and Gucci. It also features a Beauty department and a Beauty Concierge.Simultaneously, management unveiled plans to introduce the tenth Nordstrom Rack in Los Angeles at the FIGat7th shopping mall on Oct 26. Being the off-price retail segment of the company, Nordstrom Rack offers fashion-savvy customers a wide range of on-trend apparel, footwear and other accessories at discounted prices. These Racks usually keep items from the main Nordstrom stores as well as its online store, Nordstrom.com.Meanwhile, Nordstrom remains well on track with store-expansion efforts amid a challenging retail landscape. The opening of new stores is not only expected to attract customers but also boost the company’s top line via synergies across other channels. In fact, management envisions a $1 billion sales opportunity from its expansion in Canada by 2020, including six planned full-line stores and 15 Rack stores. Also, it is scheduled to inaugurate full-line store relocation in October, at University Towne Center in La Jolla.Currently, the company operates 357 outlets across 40 states. Its portfolio includes 122 full-line stores across the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada, two Jeffrey boutiques, 224 Nordstrom Racks and two clearance stores.Therefore, we believe Nordstrom is likely to offer seamless shopping experience to its customers with diverse brands and products.

1218,JWN,"Shares of Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) tanked on Monday after a report surfaced that suggested the department store chain’s attempt to finance a private equity buyout could fall through.Nordstrom sank over 6.50% after the New York Post reported on Sunday that talks to take the retailer private have started to fade. The Seattle-based chain has been in buyout talks with private equity firms for months, in an effort to reach a deal that is estimated to be worth as much as $10 billion.The Nordstrom family and private equity firms—including KKR (KKR  -  Free Report), Apollo (APO  -  Free Report), and Leonard Green—have reportedly found it hard to lock in solid interest rates from lenders in order to completely finance the deal. Banks have begun to seek high interest rates, pointing to negative downward trends in the retail industry as a whole.The New York Post report cited declining foot traffic in malls and Toys ‘R’ Us’ recent bankruptcy filing as massive, potentially detrimental signs that the retail world is in serious long-term trouble.“The financing has not worked out. I hear that the Nordstrom financing is not done and no one knows if it can be done,” a retail industry expert with knowledge of the situation told the New York Post. “Toys R Us isn’t good for anyone.”Nordstrom first announced it would consider taking the company private in June. Nordstrom’s initial statement noted that the family was looking into the possibility of acquiring 100% of JWN’s outstanding shares of common stock.The retail giant has seen its stock price fluctuate since the beginning of the year as it tries to navigate the changing retail waters. The family seemingly wanted to go private in order to make changes and investments that help the company adapt without having to worry about shareholder reactions.Last month, renewed energy to go private came just two days after the company announced it would debut a new concept store in California. Branded “Nordstrom Local,” the company won’t stock clothes at the new store, opting instead to focus on personal styling and consultations.Other Department Stores The news that Nordstrom might not be able to find financing for a buyout based on alarming retail trends has sent shares of fellow U.S. retailers tumbling on Monday as well.Shares of Nordstrom’s biggest retail peers, including Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report) sank 6.28% and 5.80%, respectively. Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) stock price dipped by nearly 3.50%, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) saw its price fall 0.45%. Shares of the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 2x Shares ETF (RETL  -  Free Report) dropped by over 2.10%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1219,JWN,"Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) has picked the momentum following the encouraging sales and comparable store sales (comps) numbers for the combined months of November and December, which mainly comprises the holiday season. As a result, investors grew optimistic about this leading fashion specialty retailer pertaining to the positive sentiment building around retail stocks on the robust holiday show.Nordstrom has gained 9.4% in the past month against the industry’s decline of 1.1%. Looking back, the company had considerably underperformed the broader industry in the last six months due to a bumpy top-line graph.Notably, the company delivered a negative sales surprise in six of the trailing nine quarters. While it is appropriate to note that Nordstrom’s overall sales was ahead of estimates in the last two quarters, the outperformance was not significant. Meanwhile, its top line remains challenged due to decelerating rate of sales growth at Nordstrom Rack in recent quarters and soft sales at full-line stores. Additionally, the company has witnessed soft comps of late.Precisely, Nordstrom Rack’s rate of sales growth slowed down considerably from 10.7% in the final quarter of fiscal 2016 to 5.5% in third quarter of fiscal 2017. Also, sales at full-line stores have declined in three of the last four quarters.How Top-Line Trends Changed in Holiday Period?Nordstrom’s holiday period sales reflected a modest improvement from the aforementioned trend, which raises optimism for the fourth quarter. While sales improved 2.5% in the holiday period (nine weeks ended Dec 30, 2017), comps rose 1.2%. Top line gains can mainly be attributed to growth in Nordstrom’s full-line and Rack stores compared with the year-to-date sales performance. Further, persistent strength in e-commerce at Nordstrom.com and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook aided results.The company’s full-line and Rack businesses reported sales growth of 0.7% and 8.2%, respectively. Additionally, comps were up 1% for Nordstrom full-line and increased 2.9% for Nordstrom Rack.Clearly, the performance of both Nordstrom full-line and Rack stores reflect an improvement from the strained trends in recent quarters.Revival of Sales Trend Lifts OutlookEncouraged by the robust holiday show, Nordstrom expects sales growth of nearly 4.2% in fiscal 2017 including the 53rd week. Comps are likely to gain 0.5%. This compares with the company’s previous expectation of 4% sales growth and flat comps.Moreover, the company anticipates earnings in the range of $2.90-$2.95 per share, marking an increase from the prior guidance of $2.85-$2.95 per share. The revised guidance assumes strong sales growth, persistent stability in merchandise margins and higher supply chain, technology, and occupancy costs related to the company’s growth initiatives.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 as well as for fiscal 2018 moved north in the last 30 days. Estimates for both the current quarter and fiscal 2017 moved up by 3 cents each to $1.23 and $2.93 per share, respectively. Meanwhile, it climbed 23 cents to $3.08 per share for fiscal 2018.Bottom LineClearly, Nordstrom’s revenue graph witnessed an improvement in the holiday season. This is likely to aid growth in the fourth quarter and ahead as evident from the optimistic guidance for fiscal 2017 and the resulting uptrend in estimates. This makes us hopeful about the company’s future potential. Rightly, the stock carries a Rank #2 (Buy).Looking for More?

1220,JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc's (JWN  -  Free Report) board of directors (Special Committee) has terminated all talks with the Nordstrom family regarding taking the company private, as it could not reach an acceptable price for the transaction. Further, the special committee believes that the company’s customer strategy positions it to capitalize on opportunities and gain market shares.The company’s customer strategy is based on three strategic pillars that focus on providing a differentiated product offering; delivering exceptional services and experiences; and leveraging the strength of its brand. Further, Nordstrom is on track to integrate its digital and physical assets to provide the best customer experience. The company remains focused on advancing in the technology space by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, and improving its supply-chain channels and marketing efforts. Additionally, it remains keen on the store-expansion strategy as part of its efforts to grow market share.The committee believes, these efforts will aid growth across the company’s full-price and off-price business models.However, shares of Nordstrom declined nearly 2.2% yesterday in after-hours trading. However, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 3.8% in the last three months against the industry’s decline of 6.5%. Brief History of “Going Private”Earlier this month, the special committee turned down the Nordstrom family’s buyout proposal of $50 per share, stating it was inadequate. Notably, the bid price was lower than the company’s closing price of $51.90 on Mar 5.The Nordstrom family comprises the company’s three co-presidents — Blake W. Nordstrom, Peter E. Nordstrom and Erik B. Nordstrom; president of stores — James F. Nordstrom; Chairman — Emeritus Bruce A. Nordstrom and Anne E. Gittinger, together. Currently, the Nordstrom family owns roughly 21% stake in the company.The Nordstrom family first approached the company with the going-private offer in June 2017. At this time, the family was seeking viable options to buy all the outstanding shares of Nordstrom. In fact, this move was made so that Nordstrom can easily overcome the hurdles of a challenging retail landscape, characterized by consumers shifting online, soft stores’ traffic, waning margins among others. As a private firm, it will be convenient for Nordstrom to make the required investments per the changing consumer trends, without caring much about stockholders’ short-term responses. Later, the plan was temporarily put on hold before the holiday season.Looking for Solid Retail Picks?

1221,JWN,"The apparel and footwear industry are the latest to voice their concerns over President Donald Trump’s plans to impose tariffs on goods imported from China, as these will result in higher consumer prices. The U.S. government is apparently preparing to impose tariffs on Chinese information technology, telecommunications and consumer goods in order to force changes in China’s intellectual property and investment prices.Tariffs mean higher prices of products and this invariably has sparked fear among retailers, apparel manufacturers and shoemakers, as many of these companies rely on imports. Apart from a number of U.S. retail giants, the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA) and as many as 82 footwear companies wrote a letter to the White House objecting to the tariff.However, the apparel and footwear industry, particularly men's and boys' apparel wholesaling, has been witnessing steady growth over the past five years and is expected to continue performing well in the days to come. Moreover, a recovering economy, increasing consumer confidence, wage growth and higher purchasing power have stimulated consumer expenditure on discretionary industry products, resulting in higher revenues for the companies.  Given this scenario, it makes for a good time to invest in apparel and footwear stock.Apparel Manufacturers, Shoemakers Oppose TariffsThe heavily China-reliant U.S. shoemakers and apparel manufactures have joined retailers in lobbying against Trump’s proposed tariffs on goods imported from that country for fear of an inordinate flare-up in prices of these consumer discretionary goods.In fact, Washington could impose more than $60 billion in tariffs on goods ranging from apparels to footwear, electronics and toys. Analysts are of the opinion that any additional broad-based tariff means burdening the American working families as they will have to pay higher prices for household basics like clothing, shoes and electronics.Not only apparel and shoemakers but also the entire U.S. fashion industry is worried about the proposed tariffs. In fact, the recent imposition of 25% and 10% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum too is going to hit the apparel and footwear industry.Steve Lamar, executive vice president of the AAFA remarked that imposing tariffs on imported items ultimately passes on the tax on to consumers. “There is a direct cost that rolls into our industry. It is not like the can industry or the auto industry, but it is there,” he said, adding that manufacturers, retailers and importers purchase trucks to haul merchandise and manufacturers package their goods in aluminum cans.Moreover, most shoemakers feel that footwear is already subject to hefty tariffs and more tariffs on top of this burden would only result in higher prices and fewer U.S. jobs.That said, the footwear and apparel industry has been performing well for a while now and tariff fears might be a bit overblown, more so because a strong lobby is showing aggressive opposition. Moreover, a recovering economy and higher wages are always an indication of increasing disposable income. So it might bit a too early to press the panic buttons.Steady Growth of Apparel and Footwear IndustryThe U.S. apparel and footwear industry has witnessed steady growth over the past few years. Especially, the men’s and boy’s apparel wholesaling industry has seen remarkable growth in the last five years and the trend is expect to continue in the future.The primary driver of this steady growth has been a recovering economy, which has seen an increase in consumer confidence and rising disposable income, resulting in higher consumer spending on consumer discretionary products from the apparel and footwear shelves. Moreover, an appreciating dollar and a continuing decline in cotton input prices for upstream manufacturers have combined to lower industry purchase costs, resulting in higher gains for the industry.Moreover, increasing wages and strong gains in per capita disposable income are expected to encourage more consumer expenditure on consumer discretionary products. Our ChoicesDespite tariff-induced concerns and the ensuing agitation, it is a bit too early to be apprehensive, especially since apparel manufacturers and shoemakers have been performing well for the last few years. Plus, a recovering economy, robust confidence, increasing wages and higher disposable income hint at the industry’s steady growth over the next five years.Adding apparel and footwear stocks to your portfolio looks like a smart option at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

1224,JWN,"A big day for retail earnings reports today kicks off with department store major Macy’s ((M  -  Free Report)) ahead of the bell, as well as economic metrics hitting the tape at the Fed will be looking closely, specifically Initial Jobless Claims and July’s Producer Price Index (PPI). Let us begin.On the headline, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated Macy’s beat earnings estimates by 2 cents to 48 cents per share. However, strip away debt repurchases, non-cash settlements and stock-based compensation and this result reduces to 38 cents per share. Revenues clearly came in ahead of expectations to $5.55 billion from $5.50 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate.Macy’s shares are up 2.5% following the earnings report, as the company has also reaffirmed full-year 2017 guidance for both sales and earnings, and plan no additional enhancements before the end of the year. Remember the retailing giant is in the processing of shuttering some stores nationwide, which is helping keep down costs as online retail continues its seep into brick-and-mortar institutions.Another department-store retailer, Kohl’s ((KSS  -  Free Report)), beat estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning: $1.24 per share beat the $1.19 we were looking for, and revenues of $4.144 billion topped the $4.138 billion expected. Year-over-year comps were down in the quarter 0.4%, though compare this to the -2.7% in Q1, and Kohl’s business looks to be picking up a bit sequentially.And Zacks Rank #3-rated Dillard’s ((DDS  -  Free Report)) posted a surprise loss in the quarter, swinging to -58 cents per share as opposed to the +19 cents expected. Sales came in slightly under expectations to $1.427 billion from the Zacks consensus estimate of $1.435 billion. Shares are tumbling more than 13% following the earnings release.Continuing the retail earnings narrative after today's close, we await results from Zacks Rank #2-rated Nordstrom ((JWN  -  Free Report)).Thursday Econ DataAs we see every Thursday morning, Initial Jobless Claims hit the tape ahead of the opening bell. Again we see sub-250K new claims: 244K last week is up from the slightly upwardly revised 241K the previous week. Continuing claims continued to dwindle further south of 2 million to 1.951 million; the prior week posted 1.967 million.And July PPI showed much weaker-than-expected results, swinging to a loss in the month to -0.1% — analysts had been looking for +0.2%. Ex-food & energy is still -0.1%. Year over year, PPI is 1.9% (1.8% ex-food & energy). These figures are all well off expectations; we had been looking for year-over-year PPI growth definitely over 2%. Trade was down 0.5%, Transportation -0.8%, Energy -0.3. All of this amounts to lower-than-expected inflation building on the enterprise side. Tomorrow brings the Consumer Price Index (CPI) results, so we’ll see how these numbers line up.These numbers, of course, help prognosticators understand when the next Fed rate hike will take place. Currently, chances of a September hike are extremely low compared to earlier this year, and numbers like today’s PPI will not change this. Even December — considered by many economists to be the most likely time for a rate hike in the medium-term, has also slipped to just under a 34% chance. Meaning we may see interest rates stay pat for the remainder of 2017; as long as inflation metrics continue to look weak, this is what we most likely will see.

1227,JWN,"Markets finished at record levels on Tuesday after banks and healthcare stocks rallied. Further, reports that Boeing had delivered a record number of airplanes in 2017 pushed the Dow into record territory. Both, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increased for the sixth consecutive sessions. Meanwhile, a report from the National Federation of Independent Businesses showed that small-business optimism declined in December.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.4% to close at 25,385.80. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to close at 2,751.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,163.58, gaining 0.1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased almost 6.3% to close at 10.12. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.23-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Gains for Boeing Push the Dow HigherShares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) surged on Tuesday following reports that the aero-giant delivered a record 763 commercial airplanes in 2017. This marks a fresh record for the airplane maker as it surpassed its earlier record in 2015 by one unit.The company also announced that it had booked orders for 912 commercial airplanes, which is its seventh highest annual total. This led to its highest ever order backlog, which rose to 5,864 airplanes by the end of 2017. Such a backlog is worth around seven years of production. Such events led to shares of Boeing gaining 2.7%, which contributed as much as 57 points to the Dow.The blue-chip index amassed 120.8 points on Tuesday to finish at a record 25,385.80.

Such a decline comes right after the Republican Tax Bill was implemented.The decline can be owed to sluggishness and imbalance in the labor market which has impacted hiring in the United States. Moreover, the capex for December increased only marginally, which further dampened the small-business sentiment.Stocks That Made HeadlinesUnited Continental December Traffic Up, Q4 Guidance AlteredUnited Continental Holdings, Inc.’s (UAL  -  Free Report) wholly owned subsidiary, United Airlines, reported dismal traffic numbers for December.

1228,JWN,"Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) has concluded a dull 2017 on a strong note, reporting modest improvement in sales and comparable store sales (comps) for the combined months of November and December, which primarily comprises the holiday season. This year’s holiday season has brought gifts for most retailers, remedying the jolts witnessed in 2017 and raising hopes for a spectacular 2018.However, the solid holiday season feat and the resulting raising of guidance didn’t impress investors’ much. Consequently, Nordstrom’s shares fell 1.1% in the after-hours session on Jan 9. Looking back, the company has gained 11.5% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 21.6%.Coming to the numbers, Nordstrom recorded 2.5% increase in net sales for the nine weeks ended Dec 30, 2017, while comps for the period rose 1.2%. The solid holiday show was primarily driven by growth in Nordstrom’s full-line and Rack stores, compared with the year-to-date sales performance, as well as persistent strength in e-commerce at Nordstrom.com and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook.The strength of the company’s full-line and Rack was evident from sales growth of 0.7% and 8.2%, respectively, at these formats. Additionally, comps were up 1% for Nordstrom full-line and increased 2.9% for Nordstrom Rack. Results at Nordstrom full-line stores mainly include the United States and Canada full-line stores and Nordstrom.com as well as Trunk Club. Meanwhile, Nordstrom Rack comprises the Rack stores and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook.Driven by the robust holiday sales, Nordstrom raised its previously stated guidance for fiscal 2017. The company now expects sales growth of nearly 4.2%, including the 53rd week. Comps are likely to gain 0.5%. This compares with the company’s previous expectation of 4% sales growth and flat comps.Additionally, the company anticipates earnings in the range of $2.90-$2.95 per share, marking an increase from the prior guidance range of $2.85-$2.95 per share. The revised guidance assumes strong sales growth, persistent stability in merchandise margins and higher supply chain, technology, and occupancy costs related to the company’s growth initiatives.Currently, this fashion specialty retailer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The holiday season this year was overwhelming for retailers backed by an increase in consumer spending. This has lifted the overall outlook for the Retail-Wholesale sector, which is currently placed at top 19% (3 of 16) of the Zacks Classified sectors. According to MasterCard SpendingPulse, sales (excluding automobiles) during Nov 1 to Dec 24, 2017 jumped 4.9% compared with 3.7% rise in the prior-year period. This marked the biggest year-over-year increase in holiday spending since 2011. Further, this data has also beat the National Retail Federation’s (“NRF”) projection of 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) and eMarketer’s forecast of 3.1% jump in holiday sales.Some other gainers during the period were American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report), J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) and Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), which reported comps growth of 8%, 3.4% and 1.1%, respectively.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1229,JWN,"2017 has undoubtedly been a tough year for the retailers, who struggled to maintain good business due to changing preferences and habits of consumers. The year saw an outbreak of online shopping fervor, which almost put the existence of traditional and department store retailers in question. Increased promotions, price wars, lower store and mall traffic, brick-and-mortar store closures, strengthening of online and omni-channel portals were some of the common trends witnessed through the year.Additionally, the retail sector saw some renowned retailers file bankruptcy, including small mom-and-pop stores as well as major retailers. Some names on the list were Toys R Us, Payless Shoes, Gymboree and Rue21. A major reason behind the demise of these stores was the absence of online presence as consumers today prefer to use smartphones and tablets to shop, instead of spending time in a brick-and-mortar outlet.Hence, the winners in today’s market are those taking strides to boost online presence through investments in enhancement of digital and mobile offerings, alongside improving product acceptance. Further, retailers are adopting various initiatives to improve omni-channel capabilities. Through these initiatives retailers are not only enhancing online business but also reviving the importance of physical stores. Some omni-channel capabilities that were successful in 2017 include “Buy Online, Pick-Up In Store”, “Ship from Store”, “Find-in-Store”, “Reserve-in-Store”, “Order in Store”, “Reserve Online and Try In-Store”, “Buy Online, Return In Store”, “Click and Collect” and same-day delivery services.Further, retailers have been taking steps to enhance the capacities of distribution centers to improve deliveries of goods purchased online. Retailers gaining from the roll out if these capabilities and improved distribution centers include The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Decker’s Outdoor Corporation (DECK  -  Free Report), among others.Retailers’ omni-channel strategies were more prominent this holiday season, when retailers came up with interesting offers to lure customers. Apart from early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, free shipping on online purchases, price match guarantee and enticing gift ideas were some offers shoppers could not resist this holiday season. This, along with a strengthening economy and a stable labor market, led to a successful holiday season for retailers in long time.Looking ahead, we anticipate the optimism from the holiday fest to continue in 2018, as retailers’ omni-channel efforts will continue to lure shoppers. That said, we are here to analyze some of the retailers and their enticing strategies, which have the ability to hook up customers through the New Year.Retailers Poised to Steer the Sector’s Growth in 2018On top of the list is e-retailing giant, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). The popularity that the company has garnered in recent years is unprecedented. The company’s technological expertise is the mantra for its ability to provide a seamless shopping experience. Its user-friendly app and website, impressive product assortment, constant innovations, along with seamless payment and checkout system have helped it to become consumers’ favorite shopping destination.Amazon’s retail business is nearly unbeatable on grounds of price, choice, and convenience with the help of a solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy. The company continues to push advantages exclusively to Prime members, consequently encouraging them to spend more on Amazon. Further, the company’s strategy of gradually merging online and offline retail looks promising. The company’s online and offline feature, added to its bookstores has gained significant popularity in recent times. Moreover, the company is taking this forward with innovations such as drive-in-grocery delivery service (AmazonFresh Pickup - order groceries online and collect them from a store nearby) and “cashier-less” stores (Amazon Go – the company’s first brick-and mortar grocery store).These strategies are likely to fend off competition arising from traditional retailers building their e-commerce businesses as well as other e-retailing counterparts. Further, the company is continually expanding offerings through acquisitions and pacts with leading brands. The company’s recent takeover of grocery retailer, Whole Foods Market Inc.; and agreement with Nike Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) to directly sell products on Amazon.com, are examples of its expansion strategy.Driven by these efforts, the company recorded 25% growth in net sales, which came in at roughly $38 billion in the second quarter of 2017. When most retailers are struggling to boost their top lines, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth is a clear indication of how well it poised to capture the lion’s share.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)Next comes the supermarket chain, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), which is putting in due efforts to neutralize the dominance of Amazon in the retail space. The company’s latest strategy of keeping online prices almost at par with Amazon during the holiday season has left an indelible impression on the minds of industry gurus. Sources revealed that Walmart’s prices were just 0.3% higher than Amazon’s, clearly reflecting the company’s efforts to gain a good share this holiday season.While this was a strategy to counter competition, particularly this holiday season, Wal-Mart has been continually taking steps to boost e-commerce sales through acquisitions, alliances and enhanced delivery and payment systems. Walmart’s buyouts of Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com, along with its Walmart Pay mobile payment system and Mobile Express Returns program underscore its quest to accelerate online business.Further, Walmart’s efforts to enhance delivery services resonate well with its strategy of growing online grocery sales. For this, the company’s recent acquisition of a delivery startup Parcel, Inc., and previous agreements with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries, have been notable. Additionally, the Walmart Pickup program enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free. Further, the company continues to test same-day and next-day delivery to enhance services further.Consequently, Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales soared 50% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily owing to Walmart.com’s performance, including significant contributions from Walmart’s online grocery service. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Last, but not the least, we have Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), a department store chain that is leaving no stone unturned to stay in business in the current competitive retail landscape. The company has been deploying resources to significantly develop online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers. In a recent move, the company announced price-cuts for various products, following Amazon’s decision to slash prices at the recent acquired Whole Foods business.Further, the company has been emphasizing on growth of e-commerce business, through the launch of an international version of its website, expanding merchandise assortments through introduction of new brands, aggressive cost reduction strategy, rationalization of supply chain with same-day delivery of in-store purchases, as well as technology and process improvements. Further, it waged war against other retail big-wigs by aggressively cutting prices on a range of items and launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores.Additionally, to leave a mark in the booming online grocery delivery market, the company has teamed with online grocery delivery service Instacart and made significant headway in the same-day delivery race by acquiring grocery delivery company Shipt. Further, the company’s Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Moreover, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, Target acquired Grand Junction.

1230,JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), once an investors’ favorite, has been losing its sheen. Though the company’s growth strategy bodes well for the long term, higher expenses and a tough retail landscape have been hurting the company’s performance.What’s Bothering the Stock?Nordstrom has a robust growth strategy that is focused on enhancement of digital experience and supply chain. However, investments related to occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing expenses are hurting the company’s margins. The company’s merchandise margin was hurt by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This, in turn, led gross margins to contract 12 basis points (bps).Also, higher investments resulted in 7.5% increase in SG&A expenses in the third quarter. Management now anticipates Retail gross profit to be impacted by higher new store occupancy expenses and mix impact of off-price growth in fiscal 2017. The higher end of earnings forecast was trimmed as well and is currently envisioned in the range of $2.85-$2.95 per share for fiscal 2017 versus $2.85-$3.00, projected earlier. Furthermore, the hurricanes that occurred in the third quarter are expected to hurt sales by $26 million, operating income by $17 million and earnings by 6 cents per share.Additionally, a challenging retail landscape where consumers are shifting from offline to online has been denting Nordstrom’s performance.Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have lost 2.9% in a year, wider than the industry’s decline of 1.2%. Also, the stock has underperformed the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s growth of 26.3%. Further, a Growth Score of F raises concerns for the stock.Will Nordstrom’s Growth Strategy Spark a Turnaround?We expect Nordstrom, which shares space with The Buckle, Inc. (BKE  -  Free Report), has potential for a turnaround backed by its long-term growth strategy. The company plans to strike a balance between its sales and expense growth. Also, it is making amendments to operating model in response to the constant slowdown in mall traffic owing to customers’ shift to online shopping. Meanwhile, Nordstrom remains focused on advancing in the technology space by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, and improving its supply-chain channels and marketing efforts.Bottom LineWell, these initiatives are yet to reap results. Nonetheless, we hope that these endeavors might prove to be helpful in pulling Nordstrom back on the growth trajectory in 2018. However, for the time being you can focus on two retail stocks mentioned below that have outpaced the industry and gained over 20% in a year.American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report) and Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report) have gained 22.8% and 22.1% in a year, respectively, as against the industry’s decline of 1.2%. Both these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1231,JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) was a big mover last session, as the company saw its shares rise more than 7% on the day. The move came on solid volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session.

So make sure to keep an eye on this stock going forward, to see if this recent move higher can last.Nordstrom, Inc. Price Nordstrom, Inc. Price | Nordstrom, Inc.

1232,JWN,"With the Thanksgiving holiday weekend over, Black Friday shoppers might have finally been able to get back to their regular duties if it weren’t for Cyber Monday. But today, the online shopping extravaganza is bigger and more profitable than ever.Retailers from Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) to Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) count on Black Friday sales to help both fuel and kick off their holiday season sales. Yet, in the changing retail environment, the rise of “Cyber Monday” might merit more attention (also read: A Complete History of 'Black Friday').A Brief History The National Retail Federation, which is one of the world's largest retail trade associations and tracks retail consumer spending, began to notice a massive uptick in online consumer spending the Monday following Thanksgiving. Back then, many consumers did not have the best high-speed internet access at home, and therefore often waited until they got to work on Monday to start searching for holiday gifts and deals online.The NRF officially coined the phrase in November 2005, via a Shop.org press release entitled “‘Cyber Monday’ Quickly Becoming One of the Biggest Online Shopping Days of the Year.”In fact, according to a Fast Company article, the origin of the phrase can be attributed to Ellen Davis, who is now the SVP of Research and Strategic Initiatives at the NRF. “It’s surreal to think that I’m associated with a term that has taken off like this,” Davis told the publication in 2015.The release noted, “77 percent of online retailers said that their sales increased substantially on the Monday after Thanksgiving, a trend that is driving serious online discounts and promotions on Cyber Monday this year [2005].”Cyber Monday caught on relatively quickly, as The New York Times and Wall Street Journal referenced the catchphrase in association with the online shopping sales day as early as December 2005.Soon after, retail giants, online shopping powers, and media outlets co-opted the phrase that is now one of the biggest online shopping days of the year.2017 Iteration This year’s Cyber Monday is reportedly shaping up to be the biggest and most successful day of online deals in the decade-plus of its existence. Total online spending on Cyber Monday is set to topple $6.5 billion in 2017, according to Adobe Insights—which tracks online spending at America's 100 largest retail websites.#CyberMonday is well on track to become the biggest online shopping day ever. Growth is at 16.9% and revenue by 10AM EST is at .84 billion. Follow the latest online shopping data here: https://t.co/Hx1kTnvKLg pic.twitter.com/aGdveMNmXR— Adobe Insights (@AdobeInsights) November 27, 2017If that $6.5 billion figure is reached—which would mark a 16% year-over-year increase—Cyber Monday 2017 would become the biggest digital shopping day in U.S. history.Preliminary Thanksgiving and Black Friday SalesOnline Black Friday sales reportedly jumped almost 17% this year to hit $5 billion. Paired with online sales from Thanksgiving Day, which now features a plethora of deals as well, the first two major days of the U.S. holiday shopping season brought in $7.9 billion in digital sales alone.This should help retailers reach the total of roughly $678.75 billion to $682 billion that the NRF projects consumers will spend both in stores and online this year, which would mark a roughly 4% increase from 2016’s November through December holiday shopping season (also read: A Guide to 2017's Black Friday and Holiday Shopping Trends).Stocks Shares of Macy’s, Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) all rose on Monday. Shares of fellow retailer players Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report) and JC Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) surged 4.70% and 3.40%, respectively.Retail sector ETFs also experienced gains. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) and the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3x Shares ETF (RETL  -  Free Report) both experienced gains. Online selling powerhouse Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) saw its stock price climb nearly 1%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.

1234,JWN,"(0:15) - Apple Keynote Event(1:10) - Apple Retail Stores: Creating Town Squares(3:00) - Retailers Transforming Brick and Mortar  (4:15) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comOn this week’s episode of Shopping for Stocks, host and Zacks Editor Maddy Johnson discussed the retail plan tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) laid out at its much-hyped Keynote event held last week at the brand-new Steve Jobs Theater.Before the company unveiled the slew of new devices we’ll all likely be putting on out holiday wish lists, senior vice president of retail and online stores, Angela Ahrendts, came out to discuss Apple’s vision for a new kind of retail store.And boy, is it different. Because Apple views its retail stores as its “largest product,” the company’s redesigned locations are now town squares, a public space were customers can get tech support for their Apple device but also hang out with friends afterwards.While it is a risky concept, Apple town squares aren’t all that different from what traditional retailers are trying to implement. Companies like Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) are creating and experimenting with different kinds of store concepts that focus on an experience rather than just buying a product.Apple’s notion of what retail can be is definitely different and certainly risky, but it’s also a reflection of where the broader retail industry is headed.As a reminder, if you feel that something was missed, or if you want a different topic covered, send an email to podcast@zacks.com.

1235,JWN,"Value investing is always a very popular strategy, and for good reason. After all, who doesn’t want to find stocks that have low PEs, solid outlooks, and decent dividends?Fortunately for investors looking for this combination, we have identified a strong candidate which may be an impressive value; Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report).Nordstrom in FocusJWN may be an interesting play thanks to its forward PE of 14.2, its P/S ratio of 0.5, and its decent dividend yield of 3.1%. These factors suggest that Nordstrom is a pretty good value pick, as investors have to pay a relatively low level for each dollar of earnings, and that JWN has decent revenue metrics to back up its earnings.Nordstrom, Inc. PS Ratio (TTM) Nordstrom, Inc. PS Ratio (TTM) | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteBut before you think that Nordstrom is just a pure value play, it is important to note that it has been seeing solid activity on the earnings estimate front as well. For current year earnings, the consensus has gone up by 8.2% in the past 30 days, thanks to nine upward revisions in the past one month compared to none lower.This estimate strength is actually enough to push JWN to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting it is poised to outperform. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So really, Nordstrom is looking great from a number of angles thanks to its PE below 20, a P/S ratio below one, and a strong Zacks Rank, meaning that this company could be a great choice for value investors at this time.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1236,JWN,"Dillard’s Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report) has been moving up the charts mainly due to a robust surprise trend backed by various strategic actions. Notably, the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results marked its third-earnings beat in the last four quarters. Moreover, the company delivered positive sales surprise for three consecutive quarters.This robust performance has driven shares of Dillard’s up 35.3% in the last three months, significantly outperforming the industry’s 17% growth. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock witnessed a rise of 13.3% following fourth-quarter results on Mar 27. This also marks a notable improvement from the industry’s 1.5% upside.Growth CatalystsDillard’s has created a niche position in the industry by its stringent focus on offering fashionable products to its customers and adding value through exceptional customer care service. We believe that the company’s strategy of offering fashion-forward and trendy products acts as a catalyst for attracting more customers.The company is well positioned to benefit from growth opportunities in both its brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce business, which is likely to aid in retaining existing customers and attracting new ones. On one hand, the company will gain by enhancing brand relations, focusing on in-trend categories, store remodels and rewarding store personnel. On the other hand, some of the strategies to boost growth across its e-commerce business include enhancing merchandise assortments and effective inventory management.We expect the company’s top and bottom lines to gain from its focus on increasing productivity at existing stores, developing a leading omni-channel platform and enhancing domestic operations in the long term.Further, Dillard’s boasts a healthy cash position which provides it the financial flexibility to take up shareholder-friendly moves as well as engage in store and online business expansion. In fiscal 2017, the company generated net cash flow from operations of $274.2 million and incurred $9.4 million in dividends. Moreover, it repurchased 4.1 million shares for about $219 million in fiscal 2017. As of Feb 3, 2018, Dillard’s had an authorization worth $34.8 million remaining under its $500 million buyback program.All these efforts led the company to deliver another strong quarter in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Notably, both top and bottom lines surpassed estimates and improved year over year in the quarter, driven by the persistence of the positive trends witnessed in the third quarter into the fourth quarter. Earnings growth came on the back of solid comparable store sales (comps) increase, along with higher gross margins and relative expense management. Sales gained from strength across its ladies’ apparel, juniors' and children's apparel, and men's apparel and accessories categories.Dillard's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Dillard's, Inc.

1237,JWN,"April has time and again proved to be favorable for stocks. But this time around, April has arrived during midterm election, which usually spells a rough phase for stocks.Earnings related volatility could spike further in April. Unabated trade tensions, possibilities of two or more rate hikes by the Fed this year, high profile departures in the Trump administration and the real impact of the tax overhaul policy are laying the base for a tumultuous earnings season. Long-dormant volatility, by the way, made a comeback last month.With the month expected to be rough, investing in sound dividend paying stocks seems judicious. Such stocks provide steady income and cushion one’s portfolio against market risks.Midterm Election Years Spell TroubleThe Stock Trader’s Almanac noted that April has traditionally been a strong month for stocks, going back to World War II. The Dow Jones, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite gained an average of 1.9%, 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively.But, such a rise wouldn’t be enough to drive the indices back to record territory. The Dow is already 9.4% below its all-time record high, the S&P 500 is off 8.1% and the Nasdaq is down 7.5%. Lest we forget, all the major bourses have already seen the second straight monthly drop and the second steepest monthly fall for the tech-laden Nasdaq since January 2016.A bigger concern, in fact, is that April comes during a mid-term election year. In such years, historically, the second quarter is weak for the broader market, as is the third quarter. In the second quarter, the market typically gains 1.8% since World War II but loses 2.2% during such years. The third quarter also isn’t much better than the second in election years.Volatility Likely to Stay Another concern for market pundits is earnings related volatility. Markets are gearing up for first-quarter earnings results this month. Investors seek clarity on the impact of protectionist trade policies and higher interest rates. After all, these factors will play a pivotal role in determining first-quarter earnings results.According to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc (GS  -  Free Report), “the options market is pricing in earnings volatility mostly in April week 4.” The technology sector, in particular, will be more susceptible to erratic movements. Goldman noted that almost 33% of April preannouncements are done by tech companies. Techs have already taken a beating following the backlash over Facebook, Inc’s (FB  -  Free Report) handling of user data (read more: Facebook Is a Screaming Buy Despite Data Scandal).Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is already up 81% in the first quarter, its biggest quarterly gain since 2011, according to the WSJ Market Data Group. The index last traded at 22.68, above its long-term average of 20. The VIX reflects traders’ collective anticipation for volatility in the upcoming 30-day period.Factors Intensifying InstabilityTrade-related fears increased after Trump imposed duties on foreign aluminum and steel, and levied tariffs on China products. Beijing retaliated by targeting 128 U.S. products with an import value of $3 billion. A full-blown trade should unnerve investors as it might deal a heavy blow to economies and hurt corporate profits.Amid all these, the Fed has hiked rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020. This hasn’t gone down well with investors as we all know that they had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies. After all, rate hikes will raise borrowing costs, eventually denting corporate profits and affecting the U.S. economy.April Could be Cruel: Buy 5 Top Dividend Stocks NowWith so many concerns plaguing investors’ minds, dividend paying stocks are tempting options at the moment. The best dividend stocks pay out a healthy yield and have strong prospects, and are less susceptible to market gyrations. Their large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity allow them to offer sizable yields on a regular basis, regardless of market direction.While finding companies that offer these traits isn’t easy, they certainly do exist. To help you find these businesses, we have selected five dividend payers who have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) develops, manufactures, and sells healthcare products. The company has a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of B. Pfizer has a dividend yield of 3.8%, while its five-year average dividend yield is pegged at 3.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 6.5% in the last 60 days. The stock is expected to return 11.7% this year, higher than the industry’s projected return of 9.8%.Unique Fabricating, Inc. (UFAB  -  Free Report) engineers and manufactures multi-material foam, rubber, and plastic components. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. Unique Fabricating has a dividend yield of 7.1%, while its five-year average dividend yield is pegged at 5.3%.

1238,JWN,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is JWN due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Nordstrom Misses on Q4 Earnings, Issues FY18 View    Nordstrom posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results and also provided guidance for fiscal 2018.In the reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings of $1.20 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24. On a GAAP basis, the bottom line came in at 89 cents per share compared with $1.15 in the year-ago quarter.RevenuesTotal revenues advanced 8.9% to $4,702 million. While the company’s net Retail sales increased 8.4% to $4,600 million, Credit Card revenues surged 39.7% to $102 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues was pegged at $4,621 million.Furthermore, total comparable-store sales (comps) rose 2.6%. Moreover, the company’s results reflected significant progress on its digital strategy.Net sales at Nordstrom full-line stores (including the U.S. and Canada full-line stores, and Nordstrom.com and Trunk Club) were up 6.4%, with comps rising 2.4%. Notably, the best-performing merchandising categories were Men's and Kids' Apparel.Coming to Nordstrom Rack (that includes Nordstrom Rack stores and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook) net sales advanced 15% while comps increased 3.7%.Operational UpdateNordstrom's Retail gross profit margin contracted 42 bps to 35.6% mainly on account of increased occupancy expenses related to new store expansion for Nordstrom Rack, and in Canada and the New York City Men’s flagship. Further, inventory rose 6.9% while merchandise margin met the company's expectations reflecting persistent momentum in regular price selling trends.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, improved 243 bps to 30.1% mainly driven by increased marketing, technology and supply chain costs related to the company's growth efforts.Store UpdateAs of Feb 3, 2018, Nordstrom operated 366 stores in 40 states. These include 122 full-line stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, 232 Rack outlets, two Jeffrey boutiques, two clearance stores, seven Trunk Club clubhouses as well as Nordstrom Local service concept.In fiscal 2018, management intends to inaugurate 12 Nordstrom Racks and one full-line store, with plans to relocate one Rack store.  FinancialsNordstrom ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,181 million, long-term debt net of current liabilities of $2,681 million and total shareholders’ equity of $977 million.In fiscal 2017, management bought back 4.6 million shares worth $206 million. Following this, nearly $414 million remained under the current buyback authorization. Further, it does not intend to buy back any shares owing to the possibility of going private deal.Nordstrom generated $1400 million in cash from operating activities and free cash flow of $383 million in fiscal 2017. Capital expenditures in the year were $670 million. For fiscal 2018, the same is projected to be roughly $740 million.GuidanceManagement issued guidance for fiscal 2018. Net sales are projected in the band of $15.2-$15.4 billion, with comps growth in the 0.5-1.5% range.Further, the company expects EBIT to lie between $885 million and $940 million, which is likely to be reduced by roughly $30 million due to the revenue recognition accounting changes.Based on the above iterations, the company now envisions fiscal 2018 earnings per share in the range of $3.30-$3.55, excluding the impact of share repurchases.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month.

1239,JWN,"It is almost time to bid adieu to the third-quarter earnings season. As we near the end, we have results on the board from a large chunk of S&P 500 members with only about 15% (or 94) of Index members left to their quarterly numbers. While most sectors are nearly through with the quarter’s reporting cycle, the Retail-Wholesale still has a considerable chunk of reports to come. Incidentally, our focus in the article will also be upon Retail stocks that are slated to report earnings on Nov 9.Q3 Earnings ScorecardPer the Earnings Preview dated Nov 3, about 406 of the S&P 500 members have reported results so far, representing 85.4% of the Index’s total market capitalization. Of the 406 S&P 500 members that reported their quarterly numbers, approximately 73.9% delivered positive earnings surprises, while 66.7% beat top-line expectations. Total earnings for these companies were up 7.5%, on 6.3% revenue growth.Key takeaways from the results so far point to clear revenue momentum as top-line growth has been accelerating compared with other recent periods. Further, the quarter has seen an above-average proportion of positive surprises, reflecting the carry forward of momentum from the preceding quarter. Thirdly, we have seen a favorable trend of estimate revisions for the December quarter, which is different from the pattern witnessed in the last few periods where estimates for the following quarter generally start to decline as the current quarter progresses.Coming to expectations, S&P 500 companies are expected to report earnings growth of 6.5% year over year, with a 5.6% jump in revenues. Thus, the overall picture looks favorable for this reporting cycle.A Look at Retail SectorThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors. While results for the Finance sector have been below average, this earnings season is turning out to be a good one for the Industrial Products, Technology, Construction and Medical sectors.As stated earlier, we are yet to see a sizable chunk of earnings to be released from retailers. Per the latest report, earnings for the Retail-Wholesale sector on the whole are expected to improve 0.1%, with revenue growth of 6.2%. The Retail-Wholesale Staples sector is currently ranked among the bottom of the 16 Zacks sectors. A close look at the sector reveals that retailers continue to bear the brunt of the current challenging retail environment. This can be accountable to sluggish mall traffic, volatile consumer spending and increased competition from online players. Further, these retailers are heavily investing in e-commerce and omni-channel functionalities, which are likely to weigh on margins at least in the near term.However, we note that the Retail-Wholesale sector has grown 22.9% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500 market’s jump of 16.1%.What Awaits JWN, M, KSS in Q3?Well our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.So, let’s see what awaits the following Retail stocks that are queued up for earnings releases on Nov 9.We are not confident of an earnings beat for the Seattle, WA-based Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) in the third quarter fiscal 2017. This is because the company currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.00% with both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at 63 cents per share, alongside a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nordstrom’s shares have lost 18.3% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 2.2%. The downturn was owing to the temporary call off of the Nordstrom family's plans to take the company private.However, we laud Nordstrom’s positive earnings surprise trend and remain optimistic on the company’s cost saving initiatives, store expansion efforts and progress on 2020 strategy. Though the company’s growth strategy bodes well, investments related to occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing are likely to weigh upon its near-term cost and margins performance. Evidently, its merchandise performance was hurt by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores in the previous quarter. Moreover, for fiscal 2017, management anticipates Retail gross profit to be impacted by higher new store occupancy expenses and mix impact from off-price growth.Further, the company’s projections for SG&A expenses incorporates higher technology and supply chain expenses related to its growth initiatives, offset by progress in productivity improvements. Given the margin pressures, it is unlikely to predict the outcome of the upcoming quarter results. (Read more: Will Higher Expenses Mar Nordstrom's Q3 Earnings?)Moving to Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), we are not very optimistic about this department store chain retailer that has delivered an average trailing four-quarter negative surprise of 19.9%. Macy's has an Earnings ESP of -32.09% as the Most Accurate Estimate of 13 cents is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. Moreover, it currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Additionally, Macy’s shares have declined 23.9% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s 15.9% downside.Macy’s has announced a slew of measures revolving around stores closures, cost containment, real estate strategy as well as investment in omni-channel capabilities to enhance sales, profitability and cash flows. Additionally, the company is developing e-commerce business and has recently announced the restructuring of merchandising operations. These seem inevitable given the challenging retail landscape, aggressive pricing strategy, waning mall traffic and increased online competition that have been weighing on Macy’s performance. The company’s dwindling top and bottom-line results is the reflection of the same. Further, the company expects comps on an owned plus licensed basis to decline approximately 2.5% in the third quarter. Given this background, we remain skeptical of Macy’s performance in the third quarter. (Read more: Will Macy's Succeed in Reporting Higher Q3 Earnings?)Finally, let’s assess the earnings beat criteria for Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report), a U.S. based department store chain that operates specialty department stores and an e-commerce site (www.Kohls.com) in the United States. While the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, our earnings beat criteria was let down by its Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2017 are currently pegged at 71 cents per share.We note that the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 18%. However, Kohl’s has been struggling with weak comps and a difficult retail sales scenario for the last few quarters. This indicates that the company’s “Greatness Agenda”, which was designed to increase transactions per store, has been failing to deliver adequate results. The consensus mark for the third quarter projects flat comps compared with the prior-year quarter.Nevertheless, Kohl's has been undertaking initiatives to boost store performance. Since October, the company has started offering more outside famous brands, while cutting down sales of in-house clothing brands. Kohl's stores have begun accepting returns from Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) customers on select products in 82 of its U.S. store locations. Additionally, we expect Kohl's third-quarter performance to benefit from surging e-commerce business.Notably, these endeavors have helped Kohl’s shares gain 2.2% in the past six months, as against the industry’s decline of 21.7%. Let’s see if such efforts will enable Kohl’s to overcome these hurdles in the third quarter. (Read more: Will Soft Comps Weigh on Kohl's This Earnings Season?)Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1240,JWN,"Only days before Black Friday, shares of some of the biggest U.S. retailers, including Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report), sunk on Tuesday after DSW (DSW  -  Free Report) reported lower than expected third-quarter results and weakened fourth quarter guidance.DSW failed to meet third-quarter earnings estimates, citing negative impact from the wave of early fall tropical storms and hurricanes, along with warmer than usual weather. Although the discount shoe retailer’s third-quarter revenues rose 1.7%, they missed expectations, and comparable store sales fell 0.4%.On top of that, DSW updated its full-year outlook and now expects earnings to fall between $1.40 and $1.45 per share, which reflects the retailer’s newly lowered expectations. Furthermore, the company noted that one of its newest acquisitions, Ebuys—bought in the hopes of boosting its online presence—is not performing up to expectations.""At Ebuys, we've moderated the long-term financial expectations and have reduced its carrying value on our balance sheet,” CEO Roger Rawlins said in a statement. Shares of DSW tumbled over 11% in morning trading after it released its third-quarter earnings report. Before Tuesday’s descent, DSW stock had dipped roughly 0.50% since the start of the year.DSW’s rough Q3 also has some investors dumping other notable retailer players far beyond the scope of the shoe industry.Other Retailers Macy’s shares dipped over 1.50%, while Nordstrom saw its stock price sink by as much as 1.70%. Dillard’s stock dropped by more than 2.33%, and Kohl’s (KSS) experienced a marginal decline. DSW’s poor performance and lowered guidance also negatively impacted shares of American Eagle (AEO  -  Free Report) and The Gap (GPS  -  Free Report). Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) also dipped, while sports footwear retailer, Finish Line  stock sank by over 1.80%.Retail sector ETFs also fell on Tuesday. Shares of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) dropped over 1%, while the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3x Shares ETF (RETL  -  Free Report) dipped over 2.60%.This downturn, directly ahead of what has become retail’s most important week, does not bode well for the industry. It’s also worth noting that DSW is not known to be a bellwether for the retail industry, which could mean retail investors are simply skittish overall.What might make investors even more nervous is that, over the last decade, this two-week period has proven to be one of the industry’s strongest. In fact, since 2007, retail is the top U.S. equities sector during the week before and after Black Friday, according to CNBC analysis.Now, only three days away from Black Friday and the start of the holiday shopping season, retailers and investors will hope customers eager for deals come out in droves.Luckily, this year—despite pushback against the now decades-long practice and an overall retail shift—the National Retail Federation estimates 164 million people plan to shop on Black Friday, which is up from 87 million in 2014 (also read: A Complete History of 'Black Friday').Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

1241,JWN,"Remember Nordstrom Inc.’s (JWN  -  Free Report) family was planning to take the company private? Well, it might just happen soon. Evidently, on Sep 12 there were news that Nordstrom’s family is in talks with Leonard Green & Partners to help fund the transaction. Though the deal wasn’t confirmed but the news sent shares of this fashion specialty retailer up by nearly 10% in the after-market trading session.This was clearly a respite for investors who have long been worried about Nordstrom’s ability to cope up with the evolving consumer trends and the mounting competition from e-commerce giant, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). Owing to these concerns, the stock has lost 3.7% so far this year, though it performed better than the industry’s slump of 27.2%. If yesterday’s news could drive such positive sentiments among investors, it is to be seen how the stock will actually react if the plans are put to action.The Plan in DetailsSources revealed that Leonard Green, which is a private equity firm, is likely to provide equity worth nearly $1 billion to Nordstrom’s family, to fund the buyout. Apart from this, the family is also trying to raise debt of roughly $7-$8 billion from banks. In fact, per the sources, the family, which currently owns about 31% stake in the company, might come up with a formal proposal in the next two weeks.  The Nordstrom family comprises the company’s three Co-Presidents — Blake W. Nordstrom, Peter E. Nordstrom and Erik B. Nordstrom; President of Stores — James F. Nordstrom; Chairman — Emeritus Bruce A. Nordstrom, and Anne E. Gittinger, together. It was in June when the Seattle-based company first announced that the family (“Group”) is seeking viable options of taking the company private, by buying all the outstanding shares of Nordstrom.Ever since then, the Group has been looking for potential sponsors. Apparently, the family also had talks with Apollo Global Management LLC and KKR & Co LLP to help the deal pass through. However, the final terms with Leonard Green are not confirmed yet, and it is quite likely for Nordstrom’s family to face interruptions from other parties in the process.Can Going Private Help Nordstrom Battle the Hurdles?Nordstrom is no different from other retailers who are trying all means to stay afloat in the challenging retail landscape. With consumers’ accelerated transition to the dot.com world, store traffic has been hit hard. Consequently, retailers are quickly resorting to e-commerce development, alongside closing underperforming stores. Apart from Nordstrom, big-wigs like Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) are few among the many retailers who are firing on all cylinders to catch up with the online rage, thanks to Amazon’s rising dominance.That said, going private could be a prudent move for Nordstrom’s family, as it will help them reshape the organization and overcome the retail hurdles faster, which is not that easy as a public entity. As a private firm, it will be easier for Nordstrom to make the required investments as per the changing consumer trends, without caring much about stockholders’ short-term responses.  Concurrent to its first announcement of plans to go private, Nordstrom stated that its board of directors have organized a special committee. This “Special Committee” that consists of Nordstrom’s independent directors, will act on the company’s behalf on anything related to the aforementioned privatization. While any formal proposal is still pending, sources revealed that this Special Committee will evaluate the deal terms in case of any offer.Nordstrom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1242,JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of Nordstrom Local, its first modern retailing concept store that does not stock merchandise. Notably, it is quite different from the traditional retail concept, a neighborhood store, where the company’s services are easily available in a centralized location.Slated to open doors on Oct 3 at Melrose Place in West Hollywood, CA, this 3,000 square-foot store is likely to focus on personal styling, consultations, appointments along with buy online, pick-up in-store and same-day delivery services. Notably, the merchandise will enter this store after having consultations with personal stylists.

This Los Angeles-based store will also cater to on-site tailoring as well as alterations, coupled with Trunk Club stylists, curbside pickup, digital boards with tailored fashion recommendations. Additionally, various modes of refreshment with gift cards and easy return processes from stores as well as online will be present there.We note that Nordstrom has brought this modern retailing concept to suit the needs of the challenging retail landscape.

1245,JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc.’s (JWN  -  Free Report) growth strategy is on track. However, higher investments toward occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing expenses are weighing upon its cost and margin performance for quite a while now.Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) declined 12.2% in the past three months, as against the industry’s growth of 5%. Also, it exhibits a Growth Score of F, which further raise concerns.  Why the Decline?Nordstrom’s higher expenses have been hurting margins for quite some time. In third-quarter fiscal 2017, the company’s merchandise performance was hurt by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores. This led gross margin contraction of 12 basis points (bps). Further, its accelerated investments toward technology, supply chain and marketing led to 7.5% (or 161 bps) increase in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in the quarter.In the fiscal second quarter, retail gross profit margin contracted 25 bps with SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, increasing 46 bps.Going forward, management anticipates retail gross profit to be impacted by higher new store occupancy expenses and mix impact from off-price growth in fiscal 2017. Furthermore, the company’s projections for SG&A expenses including higher technology and supply chain expenses related to its growth initiatives, offset by progress in productivity improvements are likely to hurt the upcoming results.Though Nordstrom’s fiscal third-quarter results outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, it was somewhat hurt by adverse impact of hurricanes, along with the aforementioned headwinds.Also, the total comparable-store sales (comps) fell 0.9% due to declining comps at full-line stores, which were more than offset comps growth at Nordstrom Rack stores. Net sales at Nordstrom full-line stores (including the United States and Canada full-line stores, Nordstrom.com and Trunk Club) decreased 1.2% in the quarter as well.Consequently, management lowered the higher end of its previously stated earnings guidance for fiscal 2017 while reiterating sales and comps view. The company now envisions earnings per share in the range of $2.85-$2.95 compared with $2.85-$3.00, projected earlier.Nordstrom also lowered its previously stated Retail EBIT guidance and now expects Retail EBIT in the range of $755-$785 million compared with $790-$840 million, anticipated earlier.The hurricanes that occurred in the third quarter are expected to impact sales by $26 million, EBIT by $17 million and earnings by 6 cents per share. Also, intense competition along with the challenging trends in the retail industry might dent the company’s future performance.Estimates TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 moved down by 3 cents to $2.90 in the last seven days. For 2018, it has declined by 11 cents to $2.85.Nordstrom Vs IndustryGrowth Strategy Raises HopeNordstrom’s growth strategy is boding well for the long term. Additionally, the company is making significant progress with respect to its customer-based strategy and is on track to reach its long-term growth target of $20 billion by 2020.Management is executing its strategy of enhancing market share through persistent store expansion and strengthening capabilities backed by further investments, particularly in digital growth. With regard to cost savings, the company plans to strike a balance between its sales and expense growth. Evidently, Nordstrom delivered online sales growth of 14% at Nordstrom.com and a 26% increase at Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook in the fiscal third quarter.Bottom LineThough the company is facing several difficulties in the near term, we believe Nordstrom will offset these headwinds by its solid strategies and store-expansion endeavors.Meanwhile, you can count upon some better-ranked stocks in the same industry such as Zumiez Inc. , Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (BOOT  -  Free Report) and Canada Goose Holdings Inc. (GOOS  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zumiez, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 18% has pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 27.1% in the last four quarters.Boot Barn Holdings, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 15.7% has delivered positive earnings surprise of 100% in the last quarter.Canada Goose Holdings, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 34.6% has come up with positive earnings surprise of 43.8% in the last quarter.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1249,JWN,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this food processing behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company delivered a negative earnings surprise in the last reported quarter and has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the past four trailing quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price and EPS Surprise   Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price and EPS Surprise | Archer-Daniels-Midland Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 54 cents, reflecting year-over-year increase of about 32%. However, we note that our earnings estimate has declined by 4 cents over the last seven days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $15.8 billion, up a little over 1% from the year-ago quarter.Archer Daniels forms part of the Consumer Staples sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the sector’s earnings are expected to rise 3.1%, while revenues are expected to climb 1.2%.Factors at PlayArcher Daniels has tumbled 9.3% so far this year, as against the sector’s growth of 10%. Well, this could be largely accountable to the company’s dismal sales surprise history. Evidently, Archer Daniels has been missing sales estimates for over three years now. In fact, the company's bottom line has not been impressive too, as the last reported quarter marked its second straight earnings miss. The murky performance can be mainly attributed to fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.Further, management expects the global landscape in the second half of 2017 to be competitive for the Agricultural Services segment. Also, results at the Oilseeds segment are anticipated to be in a range of flat to down year over year. The company expects soybean crush margins to remain pressurized on account of excess supply and competition. While export volumes in Brazil are expected to improve, margins are likely to be dented by sluggish commercialization. On the other hand, results at the Corn Processing and Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segments are expected to show better results in the second quarter, as compared with the last year. However, the aforementioned obstacles make us anxious about Archer Daniels’ upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last reported quarter and has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.3% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise   Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Leggett & Platt, Incorporated QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 65 cents, reflecting year-over-year dip of 1.5%. We note that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $1 billion, up over 4% from the year-ago quarter.Leggett forms part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the Consumer Discretionary sector’s earnings are expected to fall 1.5%, while revenues are expected to grow 7.8%.Factors at PlayBeing in the third phase of its long-term strategic plan, Leggett is working toward achieving top-line growth of 4–5% annually. In 2017, management expects strength in Automotive, Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture, and Geo Components businesses to boost volume growth, which remains a driving factor for sales. Further, management expects sales growth to fuel earnings in 2017, which makes us hopeful of the quarter to be reported.With steel being one of the company’s key raw materials, Leggett remains exposed to volatility in raw material prices. Evidently, Leggett’s bottom line was hurt by steel price inflation in the first quarter. Also, its performance was impacted by fluctuating steel prices throughout 2016. We believe that persistence of inflationary pressure remains a threat to Leggett’s earnings in 2017.While shares of Leggett have gained 7.7% so far this year, it has underperformed its industry’s 12.1% growth. All said, let’s wait and see if Leggett can put up a good show this quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Leggettis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

Management is also enhancing eCommerce capabilities and transitioning to a direct subsidiary model from a distributor model outside the U.S. The company’s focus on expanding brand assortments, bringing more innovative line of products, targeting consumers through marketing and optimizing omni-channel distribution bode well.Moreover, in an effort to drive long-term growth the company has taken strategic initiatives.

1254,JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 9, after the closing bell. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading fashion specialty retailer will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the soon-to-be reported quarter.The company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the five consecutive quarters now. It has also pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 36.7% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?In order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release, let’s have a look at the earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third quarter has been stable at 63 cents in the past 30 days but reflects nearly 25% decline from 84 cents earned in the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.6 billion, up 1.7% from the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for revenues at Nordstrom full-line stores and Nordstrom Rack are currently pegged at $1,495 million and $997 million, respectively. These estimates show a year-over-year decline of 4.7% for Nordstrom full-line stores but 4.1% increase for Nordstrom Rack.Factors at PlayNordstrom’s shares have lost 18.9% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 3.8%. The downturn was owing to the temporary call off of the Nordstrom family's plans to take the company private.Though Nordstrom’s growth strategy bodes well, investments related to occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing are expected to increase near-term cost and weigh upon margins. Evidently, the company’s merchandise performance was hurt by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores in the previous quarter. Also, for fiscal 2017, management anticipates Retail gross profit to be impacted by higher new store occupancy expenses and mix impact from off-price growth.Further, the company’s projections for SG&A expenses incorporates higher technology and supply chain expenses related to its growth initiatives, offset by progress in productivity improvements.While Nordstrom’s business is in line with the evolving retail industry that focuses on offering maximum choices to customers to enhance their shopping experience, the company cannot be fully immune to the ill-effects of the industry. However, sales growth at Nordstrom Racks and solid e-commerce performance remains encouraging. Also, the company’s cost saving initiatives, store expansion efforts and progress on 2020 strategy remains on track and is likely to drive growth.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that Nordstrom is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1255,JWN,"Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets. Most recently, the company announced the premier mixed-use development at Atlanta's Phipps Plaza. The transformative redevelopment is marked by the arrival of a new Nobu Hotel and Nobu Atlanta Restaurant. Notably, Nobu Hotels is a notable name among global luxury brands.Other features of this portfolio revamp plan include a 90,000-square-foot Life Time Athletic healthy living and entertainment destination, as well as a 12-story Class A office building with a three-story lower level parking garage. These will be added to Phipps Plaza’s current footprint. The construction work is slated to commence in 2018, while the opening will take place in phases, starting in spring 2020.Positioned at the center of the Buckhead district and conveniently connected to the Midtown and Downtown Atlanta regions, Phipps Plaza will continue to be anchored by Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) and Saks Fifth Avenue stores.At a time when mall traffic has been dwindling amid a rapid change in shopping patterns, with online shopping taking precedence over in-store purchase, these transformative efforts of Simon at Phipps Plaza are likely to boost the overall footfall.In fact, in recent years Simon Property has already made efforts to transform Phipps Plaza by adding residential units, hospitality components, as well as food and dining options. This included adding The AC Hotel Atlanta Buckhead, with 166 guest rooms and suites, as well as The Domain comprising 319 mid-rise, urban-style luxury residences.Amid the ongoing changes in consumer behavior, retail REITs are avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories, and transforming their boring shopping hubs into swanky entertainment zones. These companies are expanding dining options, opening up movie theaters and offering recreational facilities. Eventually, such measures are likely to push up traffic.Moreover, the shift toward mixed-use development by Simon Property for Phipps Plaza is a strategic fit. In fact, mixed-use developments too have gained popularity for solid neighborhood character, greater housing variety and density.Such developments lower the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, these developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area — a trend that drove development in several other cities in the United States. In recent years, retail REITs like Regency Centers Corp. (REG  -  Free Report) and Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) also directed their investments toward such projects.Simon Property currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.However, the stock has declined 3.0% in a month’s time, underperforming 0.3% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1256,JWN,"The Q3 earnings season has reached the tail end for all sectors save retail, which has seen about half of its total releases. Total earnings for the sector reported so far are up 2.3% from the same period last year on 10.1% revenue growth with 81.8% beating EPS estimates and 63.6% beating revenue estimates.While earnings growth is well below the last reporting cycle and the four-quarter average, revenue growth has been accelerating compared with the other recent periods. Additionally, the quarter so far has witnessed an above-average proportion of positive surprises, implying that the momentum has been carried forward. Further, the estimates revision trend for the fourth quarter has been favorable, with earnings estimates holding up a lot better relative to other comparable periods (read: Amazon ETFs to Buy on Q3 Blowout Results).This is especially true given the impressive stock market performance of department store operators like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and others following their quarterly releases. Nordstrom and J.C. Penney posted better-than-expected results. Meanwhile, Kohl's beat on revenues but missed on earnings, while Macy's beat on earnings and missed on revenues.The strength in these stocks led to smooth trading in the broad retail sector. In fact, retail ETFs — SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Retail Fund (PMR  -  Free Report) — added 0.7%, 1.5% and 0.6%, respectively, over the past five trading days.Given that earnings are the most important drivers of stock performance, it is necessary to look at the expected surprise of big-box retailers that are likely to report this week. These also have the potential to push related ETFs upward or downward (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).A Peek into Earnings SurprisesReports from Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) will be crucial for the sector this week.According to our surprise prediction methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases chances of an earnings beat. A Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) is best avoided going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Home Depot is slated to report earnings before the bell on Nov 14. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%, indicating higher chances of beating estimates. The company saw positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter and delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.77%. The stock has a VGM Style Score of A.Target has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of -1.60%, indicating less chances of beating estimates. The stock has seen solid earnings estimate revision of seven cents for the to-be-reported quarter over the past three months and delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.11% in the last four quarters. It has a top VGM Style Score of A. The company is expected to report before the opening bell on Nov 15 (read: Profit from Retailers' Defaults With These ETFs).Wal-Mart is scheduled to report on Nov 16 before market open. It has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.96%, indicating a reasonable chance of beat. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1.99% in the last four quarters but witnessed negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past three months for the to-be-reported quarter. It has a VGM Style Score of B.Foot Locker, which will likely report earnings on Nov 17 before the opening bell, has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.48%, indicating lower chances of beating estimates. The stock has seen negative earnings estimate revision of 41 cents over the past 90 days for the yet-to-be-reported quarter and delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 6.55% in the last four quarters. Additionally, the stock has a VGM Style Score of B.  ConclusionWith notable earnings surprises in the cards and a favorable stock rank for big-box retailers, the ETF space will continue to see good trading in the days ahead even though the sector has an ugly Zacks Rank in the bottom 0%. Further, the ETFs mentioned above have favorable ranks. Notably, RTH and ZRT have a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 while PMR has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1257,JWN,"Benchmarks finished in the red on Thursday following concerns over a likely delay in the Trump administration’s tax cut plans. The Senate Finance Committee released a tax plan which aims to reduce corporate tax rate to 20% but not before 2019, in contrast to the 2018 deadline proposed by the House Republicans. Although, investors turned jittery following concerns that tax cut may be delayed, markets curtailed some of the day’s declines after the House Ways and Committee passed a bill to reframe the tax reforms.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) decreased 0.4%, to close at 23,461.94. The S&P 500 Index (INX) fell 0.4% to close at 2,584.62. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,750.05, losing 0.6%. A total of 7.4 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.6 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.67-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored declining issues. The CBOE VIX decreased 1.1% to close at 9.78.What Dragged Benchmarks Downward?On Thursday, a version of the tax plan was released by the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate version differed from that of the House panel's in several ways. Unlike the House Republicans’ tax proposals which focus on reducing corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, the Senate version supports a similar tax cut only by2019. Also, per House Republicans, the top individual tax rate would be 39.6%, whereas the Senate version puts the ceiling rate at 38.5%.Worries over a possible delay in tax cut plans weighed on investor sentiment. Although, some of the day’s losses were curtailed after the House Ways and Committee approved a Bill to recast the tax reforms, all the three key U.S. indexes registered their worst trading day in two weeks. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 posted their largest one-day percentage falls since Oct 25, while the Nasdaq registered its worst one-day performance since Oct 23.The day’s performance could have been much worse if the the tax plan Bill approved by the House Ways and Committee did not offer some positives for the investors. Among the Bill’s key highlights were proposals to reduce corporate taxes by 2018, reducing the number of tax brackets from seven to four and a gradual repeal of the estate tax.Key Earnings For the DayOn the earnings front, shares of TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) fell 6.8% after the reporting fiscal fourth quarter net sales of $923.9 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $967 million. TransDigm was the biggest decliner of the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI), which fell 1.3%. Industrial sector was the biggest decliner among the S&P 500 sectors.

1258,JWN,"Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) reported robust third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both its earnings and sales outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While the company delivered positive earnings surprise for the sixth straight quarter, revenues surpassed estimates for the second consecutive quarter. However, management lowered the higher end of its previously stated earnings guidance.Consequently, shares of this leading fashion specialty retailer were down nearly 1.6% in the after-hours trading session. Overall, the stock is down 16.5% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 18.4%.Nordstrom’s quarterly adjusted earnings of 67 cents per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. However, the earnings included nearly 4 cents of adverse impact from hurricanes. Adjusting the hurricanes impact, earnings were in line with the company’s guidance.RevenuesTotal revenues advanced 2.5% to $3,629 million and also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,602 million.While the company’s net Retail sales increased 2% to $3,541 million, Credit Card revenues surged 25.7% to $88 million. However, total company comparable-store sales (comps) fell 0.9% due to declining comps at full-line stores, which were more than offset comps growth at Nordstrom Rack stores. Further, the anticipated impact of the hurricanes on sales decline was about $20 million, or 60 basis points (bps).Nevertheless, retail sales gained from smooth execution of the company’s customer strategy along with disciplined inventory aided results in the quarter under review.Moreover, the company’s fiscal third-quarter results reflected significant progress on its digital strategy. Nordstrom delivered online sales growth of 14% at Nordstrom.com and a 26% increase at Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook.Net sales at Nordstrom full-line stores (including the U.S. and Canada full-line stores, Nordstrom.com and Trunk Club) decreased 1.2%, with comps declining 1.9%. The top-performing region during the quarter was the West while the best-performing categories were Men's Apparel and Kids' Apparel.Coming to Nordstrom Rack (that includes Nordstrom Rack stores and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook) net sales advanced 5.5% while comps inched up 0.8% on the back of growth in the Western region. Management stated that Nordstrom Rack business is approaching $5 billion in sales for fiscal 2017.Operational UpdateNordstrom's Retail gross profit margin contracted 12 bps to 34.7% mainly on account of increased occupancy expenses linked to new store expansion for Nordstrom Rack and in Canada. Further, net sales increased 2% and inventory rose 1%.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, improved 161 bps to 31.2% mainly driven by increased technology and supply chain costs related to the company's growth efforts.Store UpdateIn the fiscal third quarter, the company opened 11 new and relocated one Nordstrom Rack stores. Also, it introduced one full-line store each in both the United States and Canada. It relocated two full-line stores in the United States as well. So far this year, the company inaugurated a total of 19 new stores, relocated three outlets and closed two stores.As of Nov 9, 2017, Nordstrom operated 366 stores in 40 states including 122 full-line stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, 232 Rack outlets, two Jeffrey boutiques, two clearance stores, seven Trunk Club clubhouses as well as Nordstrom Local service concept.FinancialsNordstrom ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $672 million, long-term debt net of current liabilities of $2,681 million and total shareholders’ equity of $854 million.During the nine months of fiscal 2017, Nordstrom generated $597 million in cash from operating activities and negative free cash flow of $127 million. Capital expenditures during the same period were $536 million.GuidanceFollowing third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, the company updated its previously stated earnings guidance for the fiscal year. Nordstrom continues to anticipate net sales growth of nearly 4% for fiscal 2017, with flat comps view.Furthermore, the company lowered its previously stated Retail EBIT guidance. It now expects Retail EBIT in the range of $755-$785 million compared with $790-$840 million, anticipated earlier. This reflects higher occupancy costs linked to new stores (Nordstrom Rack, Canada and Manhattan flagship men's store) alongside increased supply chain and technology expenses. Meanwhile, Credit EBIT is estimated to be about $165 million versus the earlier forecast of about $145 million. This guidance includes greater credit card revenues with a decline in amortization expenses of $18 million associated with the credit card portfolio sale.Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteBased on the above iterations, the company now envisions fiscal 2017 earnings per share in the range of $2.85-$2.95 compared with $2.85-$3.00, projected earlier. Nordstrom’s guidance includes the impact of the additional 53rd week in fiscal 2017, which is likely to add about $200 million to net sales and 2-3 cents to earnings per share.Furthermore, the hurricanes that occurred in the third quarter are expected to impact sales by $26 million, EBIT by $17 million and earnings by 6 cents per share.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksNordstrom carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the same industry include Zumiez Inc. , Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (BOOT  -  Free Report) and American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report), each holding a Zacks Rank #2.

1259,JWN,"Shares of women’s fashion boutique Francesca's FRAN plummeted to a new 52-week low on Monday after the struggling company announced the departure of a top executive.The boutique chain announced that its chief merchandising officer and executive vice president, Laurie Hummel, who previously held leadership positions at Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report) and Macy's (M  -  Free Report), is set to leave the company after less than two years at Francesca's.It is unclear at this point if Hummel was relieved of her duties or if she stepped away, but Francesca's now finds itself in flux during a tumultuous time for retail.“We have a lot of talent in our merchandising team and are confident in their ability to execute our strategy as we search for a new Chief Merchant,” Francesca's President and CEO Steve Lawrence said in a statement. “During this period, the team will report directly to me. We wish Laurie well in her future endeavors.” Francesca's also released some preliminary results for the company’s upcoming second-quarter earnings report. The Houston-based retailer expects its quarterly comparable store sales to fall by 3% from the year-ago period. Francesca's also projects to report second-quarter earnings of $0.20 per share, which surpassed the company’s previous expectations.“That said, we note that back-to-school has been off to a very challenging start and our comparable sales have further decelerated from July,” Lawrence continued. “We will provide additional detail on our second quarter performance, as well as discuss our third quarter and full year outlook, on our upcoming earnings call.”Shares of Francesca's plummeted by over 10% on Monday morning to touch a new 52-week low of $6.71 a share. The stock now hovers down around 7% through mid-afternoon trading.Francesca's is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but scored an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system, giving it an overall VGM grade of an “A.” The fashion retail company is set to report its second-quarter results on September 6.Retail Sector Francesca's is a small company with a market cap of roughly $275 million, so even though its shares have traded hands over four times above its average volume on Monday, it isn’t likely to drag the whole retail sector down with it. But the fact that the company cited poor back to school sales as a reason for its projected revenue decline might frighten some retail investors.Shares of fellow fashion-focused retailers, such as American Eagle (AEO  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), and The Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) all fell on Monday. American Eagle took the biggest hit, as its shares dipped by 3.83%, also touching a new 52-week low.Shares of retail sector ETFs also fell on Monday. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), the Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report), and the PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF (PMR  -  Free Report) all dropped marginally. The Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3x Shares ETF (RETL  -  Free Report) dipped by 2.17% and touched a new 52-week low at $21.22 a share.However, shares of some of retail’s biggest names, including Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report) Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report), and Macy's (M  -  Free Report) all saw marginal gains.

1260,JWN,"With store expansion efforts on track, Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to inaugurate a Nordstrom Rack store at the Orchard Town Center in Westminster, CO, in spring 2019. Spanning across 25,000 square feet, the new store marks the seventh Rack store in the state.This new outlet will share space with various restaurants and specialty shops as well as renowned retailers, including Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), AMC Theatres, H&M, REI and Gap Inc.’s (GPS  -  Free Report) Old Navy.Situated off I-25 in the northern Denver metro area, The Orchard Town Center is an open-air retail and entertainment platform, which is owned and supervised by Phoenix-based Vestar. Nordstrom is likely to gain from this convenient location and better cater to its customers by its top-tier merchandise offerings.Being the off-price retail segment of the company, Nordstrom Rack offers fashion-savvy customers a wide range of on-trend apparel, footwear and other accessories at discounted prices. These Racks usually keep items from the main Nordstrom stores as well as online store, Nordstrom.com. Also, these stores stack products from other major brands sold by the company.Notably, the company has three full-line stores in the state of Colorado, alongside six Rack outlets. In fiscal 2017, management intends to introduce 11 Rack stores, and will relocate one store. In addition, the company is on track with domestic store expansion. It is scheduled to inaugurate two full-line store relocations in California in October, at Westfield Century City in Los Angeles and at University Towne Center in La Jolla.As of Aug 18, 2017, the company operates 354 outlets across 40 states. Its portfolio also includes 122 full-line stores across the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada, two Jeffrey boutiques, 221 Nordstrom Racks and two clearance stores.Prior to this Westminster store, the company announced plans to introduce a Rack store at The Promenade at Town Center in Santa Clarita, CA, which is slated to open doors in spring 2018.Interestingly, with digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers, including the big-box ones, are struggling to compete with eCommerce bigwigs and are being forced to curb their store count to focus more on an online model.On the contrary, Nordstrom is a resilient company that continues with its store expansion plans despite a challenging retail backdrop.Furthermore, we laud the company’s cost-saving initiatives and progress on 2020 strategy. Though its growth strategy bodes well, investments toward occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing are likely to weigh upon its near-term cost and margin performance.However, its strategic efforts are well reflected in the stock performance.

1263,JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) is consistently focusing on the store-expansion strategy as part of its efforts to grow market share. Also, the company has been aggressively working on the expansion of sizing options across different brands at its stores and online to maximize customers’ shopping experience. In this regard, management recently announced the expansion of extended sizing for 100 brands across 30 stores. This will include various merchandising categories such as dresses, denim, swimwear, activewear and lingerie, producing sizes of more zeros, 2's, 14's, 16's and 18's.In October 2017, the company launched this sizing initiative at Nordstrom Century City in Los Angeles for denim brands including Topshop, Rag & Bone and Madewell. Further, it launched this initiative online with 40 brands having extended sizes in the 2017 holiday period. Nordstrom intends to expand this strategy across 15 more outlets for 60 brands by spring 2018.This latest initiative include brands like NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report), adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report), Beyond Yoga, MOTHER, Rebecca Taylor and more, alongside Nordstrom private-label brands such as Halogen, Zella and Nordstrom Signature. In fact, the company is persistently working on fulfilling the gaps in sizes to integrate all sizes together, which will comprise the range of sizes from the European brand partners as well. Management also plans to extend this sizing initiative to the Anniversary Sale, beginning Jul 20.Notably, Nordstrom is a retailer that always comes up with innovative ideas to offer a seamless shopping experience. Last year, the company launched Nordstrom Local — its first modern retailing concept store — that does not stock merchandise. This is a neighborhood store where the company’s services are easily available in a centralized location and is different from the traditional retail concept.Furthermore, the company is keeping up with the evolving retail industry by aggressively expanding its footprint in the digital arena. Nordstrom purchased two major retail technology entities — BevyUp and MessageYes — to cater to customers who prefer online shopping. While BevyUp is a leading digital selling device, MessageYes is an iconic platform for conversational trading. These investments are expected to address consumers’ personalized needs in a digitally-connected world and accelerate business growth.Nordstrom is also on track to integrate its digital and physical assets to create innovative and multiple ways for customers to shop. Additionally, it is focused on advancing in the technology space by boosting e-commerce and digital networks apart from improving the company’s supply chain and marketing efforts.These endeavors have aided this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company to outperform the industry and the broader sector in the past six months. While the stock has rallied 22%, the industry and the Retail-Wholesale sector gained 6.9% and 11.4%, respectively.Investors may also consider The Buckle, Inc.

1264,JWN,"On this week’s episode of Shopping for Stocks, host and Zacks Editor Maddy Johnson dives into one of the scariest aspects of the retail industry: department stores.Yesterday, Citi Research downgraded Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and JCPenney (JCP  -  Free Report) to “Sell” from “Neutral,” alluding to a less-than-positive holiday season for retailers in the struggling department store space.Analyst Paul Lejuez said that Macy’s in particular “no longer makes much money as a retailer,” and “has [not] found the right tools” to evade a steady decline. JCPenney’s rating was cut on the heels of weak updated guidance, while the company blamed heavy discounting ahead of the holiday shopping period.As a result, a domino effect occurred, sending shares of Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), and Dillard’s  downwards. Even retail sector ETFs like the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) and the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) were down.But this impact is nothing new, and it’s time these department stores break this vicious cycle.How can companies like Macy’s stand out from its peers? What can it do differently? And most importantly, how can it make shopping an event again?With Nordstrom and even Sears implementing innovative strategies, stores like Macy’s and JCPenney must try something to stay in the game.As a reminder, if you feel that something was missed, or if you want a different topic covered, send an email to podcast@zacks.com.

1265,JWN,"CA-based restaurant operator, DineEquity, Inc. (DIN  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 numbers on Aug 10, before the market opens.Notably, the company operates under the Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar and International House of Pancakes (IHOP) brands.Last quarter, DineEquity came up with a positive earnings surprise of 1.67%. In fact, its earnings met/surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 1.68%.DineEquity, Inc Price and EPS Surprise  DineEquity, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | DineEquity, Inc QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Affect Q2 ResultsComps at the IHOP brand have not been encouraging over the last three reported quarters. Nevertheless, DineEquity’s focus on brand innovation as well as its menu improvement strategy and breakfast inspired food offered throughout the day is expected to bring back the trend of positive comps in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, remodeling efforts, increased focus on to-go sales, technological innovation and initiatives to improve guest satisfaction is likely to drive incremental traffic.Meanwhile, Applebee’s casual dining restaurants are facing stiff competition from fast-food and quick service restaurants. Resultantly, comps have been weak therein in the last few quarters, despite various efforts to reinvigorate the brand.Nonetheless, we believe, renewed steps taken to revitalize the brand via increased focus on food and culinary innovation, guest satisfaction and marketing are likely to somewhat improve comps. In addition, the company has begun stabilization work for its Applebee’s business and is working with close franchisee collaboration to improve the brand’s performance.Meanwhile, an increase in expenses related to sales initiatives may dent the quarter’s profits. Incremental investments in marketing programs and promotional activity to combat competition are also expected to weigh on margins. Also, the continuing choppy sales environment in the overall restaurant space might limit revenue growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for DineEquity this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: DineEquity has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.20. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: DineEquity has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies to consider in the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.

However, the initial positivity based on earnings and revenue beats has been countered with extreme pessimism in the once-powerful retail giant. Shares of Macy’s fell 9.18% in morning trading to reach a new 52-week intraday trading low of $20.85 per share.Kohl’sKohl’s (KSS) reported earnings of $1.24 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 and up 49% from the year-ago period.

1268,JWN,"Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 10, before the opening bell.In the previous quarter, this department store retailer reported negative earnings surprise of 31.4%. Also, the company’s bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters by an average of 12.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is, whether Macy's will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second quarter has declined by a penny to 44 cents in the last 30 days. This reflects a year-over-year decline of 18%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5,490 million, down 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.Coming to Macy's share price performance, we note that the stock plunged over 19% in the last three months, wider than its industry’s decline of 4.8%. On the contrary, the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, of which they are part of, gained 3%. Currently, the sector is placed at bottom 13% of the Zacks classified sectors (14 out of 16).Zacks Model Shows Unlikely Earnings BeatOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Macy's this quarter.

In addition, the company warned investors that its margins may continue to feel the pinch and expects gross margin to shrivel by 100 basis points in the second quarter.Furthermore, Macy’s dwindling top-line and bottom-line results remain the primary threat for investors. In fact, a look at the company’s performance in fiscal 2016 unveils that net sales decreased 7.4%, 3.9%, 4.2% and 4% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, while earnings per share declined 28.6%, 15.6%, 69.6% and 3.3% during the respective quarters.Notably, during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the scenario was no different, as net sales and earnings per share declined 7.5% and 40%, respectively.Nevertheless, Macy’s has announced slew of measures revolving around stores closures, cost containment, real estate strategy and investment in omnichannel capabilities to improve its performance. Also, in an attempt to improve sales, profitability and cash flows, the company has been taking steps such as integration of operations as well as developing eCommerce business and online order fulfillment centers.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1269,JWN,"Shares of several major U.S. department store chains plummeted on Monday after a Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) analyst downgraded Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), and JC Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) lowered its third-quarter earnings guidance.Macy’sCitigroup downgraded Macy’s stock from “Neutral” to “Sell” on Monday morning, citing poor performance from the company’s retail business as the primary reason. Citi analyst Paul Lejuez noted that Macy's ""as seen significant pressure on sales/margins for several years, they no longer make much money as a retailer.""The analyst went on to say that Macy's ""core business is weak and (we believe) is getting weaker."" The analyst pointed to an overall decrease in foot traffic and a decline in brick-and-mortar overall as other reasons for the downgrade.On top of that, Citi cited JC Penney’s recent poor performance as yet another factor for downgrading Macy’s to sell.On the back of the Citi downgrade, shares of Macy’s slumped over 3% to touch a new 52-week low of $18.94 per share.JC Penney Guidance Retail industry investors are also spooked the day before Halloween because JC Penney provided new, weaker updated third-quarter and full-year 2017 guidance on Friday.The department store chain now expects comparable store sales will fall as much as 1% for the full year, with flat growth presented as the best-case-scenario in this vital retail category. JC Penney also projects the cost of goods sold will jump as much as 120 basis points. What’s more,JC Penney now expects to post an adjusted third-quarter EPS loss in the range of $0.40 to $0.65.JC Penney noted that its inventory liquidation “favorably impacted sales during the months of September and October.” However, the company has been forced to make other larger strategic changes to its business that has some investors nervous.“Although these actions will create a short-term negative impact to cost of goods sold and earnings, long term, we firmly believe it was the right decision for the Company as we transition into the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018,” CEO Marvin R. Ellison said in a statement.“In addition, based on the way our business is growing, including continued comp sales growth penetration in major appliances and omnichannel in the third quarter, we are taking a renewed approach to aligning our expense structure to match the mix of our growth initiatives.”Shares of JC Penney sunk over 8.3% on Monday to hover just above their 52-week low in response to the company’s poor full-year and quarterly projections.Other Department Stores As is often the case, big movement from Macy’s and JC Penney—based on negative industry trends—has helped push much of the rest of the retail industry down.Shares of Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and Dillard's (DDS  -  Free Report) dipped around 2%, while Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report) saw its stock price fall marginally.Retail sector ETFs also fell on Monday. Shares of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) fell 1.15%, while the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3x Shares ETF (RETL  -  Free Report) dropped 2.93%. The VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) experienced a marginal decline.What’s Next?The second week of November is one that retail investors will want to pay close attention to as a ton of department store heavyweights are set to report third-quarter earnings.Macy’s, Nordstrom, and Kohl’s are all set to report Q3 earnings on Thursday, Nov. 9. JC Penney is ready to announce its results Friday, Nov. 10.Department store chains’ third-quarter earnings are important, but investors will also try to hone in on their fourth-quarter and full-year guidance ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season. Luckily, there are some signs that things could pick up for department stores as the country’s biggest retail trade group, National Retail Federation, projects retail sales for November and December (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) will jump as much as 4% to $682 billion, and account for up to 30% of annual sales for some retailers (also read: Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights: Macy's, J.

1270,JWN,"Holiday season and retail are synonymous, and with the festive season approaching, the sector is back in spotlight. Just like every year, retailers are busy with preparations to make the most of this solid selling period. In keeping with this trend, Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) will hire nearly 13,650 workers to handle the rush, higher than the previous year’s hiring of approximately 11,400 seasonal employees.Notably, Nordstrom’s seasonal employees will cater to customers across all its stores including the Rack stores along with its distribution and fulfillment centers. Further, some of the employees will look after its online operations, Hautelook and Trunk Club customers.Incidentally, roughly 8,200 seasonal employees will be recruited for 122 Nordstrom stores across the United States and Canada, and 3,200 for 1127 Nordstrom Rack stores. Additionally, the company plans to hire about 2,200 workers for its stores and e-commerce operations at its fulfillment and distribution centers across various states.These seasonal roles will include both part-time and full-time positions, with the opportunity for some workers to become regular employees. This fashion specialty retailer believes that the improved staffing will help it to better serve customers during the busiest time of the year.Notably, during the holiday season retailers stay on their toes, flooding the market with offers and promotions. They sweep buyers off their feet with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, and free shipping on online purchases. Since the season accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits, retailers grab every opportunity to drive footfall.Apart from Nordstrom, other retail bellwethers like Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) and The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), among others have adopted the same strategy to tap maximum holiday sales.Stocks PerformanceIn the past one month, the company’s shares have declined 12.4%, wider than the industry’s fall of 5.1%. The recent decline in share price was primarily due to Nordstrom family’s plans to take the company private are on hold for the time being. The Nordstrom family, which has been exploring options to fund the privatization for a while now, informed the “Special Committee” that it has deferred the search process for the rest of the year.While the Nordstrom family alias the Group notified that it plans to resume exploration initiatives after the holiday season. However, it remains to be seen if any deal can actually surface amid the tough retail landscape. Though the possibility of finding a lender may depend on Nordstrom’s performance in this crucial selling season, some reports suggest that it depends on the overall holiday season scenario.Nordstrom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1271,JWN,"According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, retail giant Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) is nearing a deal that will see department store Lord & Taylor begin selling its goods and products on Walmart.com.Citing people familiar with the matter, the WSJ said that this partnership would create a type of “online mall that shoppers could access from Walmart’s website.” Competitors like Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) and even Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) offer retailers dedicated spaces like this to brands on their sites, which allow for both an increase in traffic to e-commerce platforms and boost retailers’ online inventory.Lord & Taylor, part of Canada’s Hudson Bay portfolio, which also owns high-end department store Saks Fifth Avenue, attracts a similar customer as Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) or Macy’s-owned (M  -  Free Report) Bloomingdale’s. While one might not necessarily think of Walmart and Lord & Taylor fitting together, Walmart’s e-commerce head Marc Lore has been working tirelessly to build a more upper-end reputation for Walmart.com.Just look at the company’s most recent digital acquisitions, and you’ll notice a major shift in Walmart’s e-commerce direction. From Bonobos and ModCloth to Moosejaw, Shoebuy, and Jet.com, Walmart’s online division is undoubtedly moving more upscale.There will no doubt be some major hurdles to overcome if the deal goes through. For instance, Lord & Taylor’s core customer skews much older and more suburban than Walmart’s recent acquisitions, which targeted a more urban, millennial consumer.But Lord & Taylor could also welcome this partnership as a way to compete against Amazon, especially as a way to stay afloat in the crowded e-commerce space. If getting helped by America’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer and Amazon’s biggest rival is the catch, then so be it.The WSJ noted that Lord & Taylor will continue to operate online, but shoppers of lordandtaylor.com will now be able to pick up and return items and Walmart’s 4,700 U.S. retail stores.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1272,JWN,"Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report), or FEMSA is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this major beverage company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company witnessed a negative earnings surprise of roughly 21% in the last reported quarter, and has been missing our estimates for three straight quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. Price and EPS Surprise   Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. Price and EPS Surprise | Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 83 cents, reflecting year-over-year improvement of over 12%. Also, we note that our earnings estimate has trended upward in the last 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $6.4 billion, representing growth of more than 22% from the year-ago quarter.FEMSA forms part of the Consumer Staples sector. As of Jul 15 Earnings Trends, the Consumer Staples sector’s earnings are expected to rise 4%, with 1.5% revenues growth.Factors at PlayFEMSA’s dismal earnings surprise history reflects that the company continues to struggle with adverse currency fluctuations, which have been weighing on Coca-Cola FEMSA's results for a while now. Additionally, it has been witnessing pressurized margins owing to growth and incorporation of lower-margin businesses in FEMSA Comercio’s Health and Fuel divisions.While these factors pose concern about the company’s upcoming performance, we remain impressed with FEMSA’s focus on strategic measures such as increasing store count, diversifying business portfolio and focusing on core business activities. FEMSA’S concentration on portfolio diversification is well-evident from its series of acquisitions. Additionally, the company is well positioned to gain from its venture in the drugstore business, which displays significant potential.Notably, FEMSA’s shares have gained 6.5% in the last seven days. This impressive momentum ahead of earnings clearly reflects investors’ positive sentiments about the upcoming release. Also, this has helped this Mexican company to surge 35.4% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the Zacks categorized Beverages – Soft Drinks industry’s growth of 12.8%. So, let’s see if FEMSA’s quarterly performance can help it break the murky surprise trend, and help it sustain the robust momentum.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that FEMSA is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.FEMSA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of -8.43% as the Most Accurate estimate of 76 cents is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. The combination of FEMSA’s Zacks Rank #2 and a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #2.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Amazon.com, Inc.

1273,JWN,"Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (SKX  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, 2017. In the trailing four quarters, it had underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 17.3%. However, the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 9.1% in the preceding quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Skechers will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the second quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 45 cents compared with 48 cents reported in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $965.7 million, up about 10% from the year-ago quarter.Skechers forms part of the Consumer Discretionary sector, which occupies a space in the bottom 38% of the Zacks classified sectors (10 out of 16). As per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the sector are expected to decline 1.6%, while revenues are projected to improve 7.8%.Factors at PlayWith greater emphasis on new line of products, cost containment efforts, inventory management and global distribution platform, Skechers remains well positioned to sustain momentum. The company is also enhancing eCommerce platform. However, investors remained apprehensive about Skechers’ bottom-line performance that continued to decline for the fourth successive quarter, when it reported first-quarter results. Moreover, due to high exposure to international markets it remains prone to currency fluctuations.Management had earlier highlighted that it expects to deliver flat to slightly positive sales for domestic wholesale business, growth in international business and increase in company-owned retail stores. Further, management had forecast second-quarter net sales in the band of $950–$975 million and earnings per share in the range of 42–47 cents.Skechers U.S.A., Inc.

1274,JWN,"The largest increase in retail sales in seven months failed to lift consumer sentiment substantially on Tuesday. Moreover, a selloff in traditional retail stocks followed, raising concerns over the sector’s long-term prospects. Industry watchers may hold differing views on this issue, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to profit from the country's rising purchasing power using traditional retail stocks.At the same time, it is difficult to ignore that a resilient labor market, accompanied by a slow and steady rise in wages, has made U.S. consumers increasingly confident. Traditional retail stocks may have lost their luster, but there are still several other avenues to profit from rising discretionary spending. Investing in consumer discretionary stocks from domains other than retail makes for a smart move at this point.“Amazonification” EffectThe lion’s share of the spurt in July retail sales was attributable to a pickup in demand for autos and to what is now a national event, Amazon Prime Day. The annual event, during which consumers flock to Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) for the year’s best shopping deals, contributed to gains for every product category. The Department of Commerce’s report reflects this as a 1.3% monthly increase in what is categorized as non-store retail spending. But for the sudden spurt in auto sales, other notable movements in the consumer spending report also have crucial linkages with Amazon. For instance, the decline in sales at electronics stores is likely a result of most consumers opting to buy this category of products from online alternatives, possibly Amazon.Home Depot Leads Retail SlideWhile Amazon did end the day around 0.1% lower, investor attention was largely fixed on the fall in traditional retail stocks. Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) declined 2.6%, 1.5%, 1.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) ended the day unscathed, notching up a minor increase of 0.1%.But of particular concern was a 2.7% decline in shares of The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report), even after it reported stellar second-quarter results and raised its guidance for the second time for the year. Such a turn of events makes it amply clear that the company is not immune to “Amazonification” despite its status as a leading specialty retailer. This is particularly surprising since Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and professional customers form Home Depot’s core audience. But the move to sell Kenmore devices via Amazon indicates that even the building products behemoth is now susceptible to the rising power of the Kindle and Fire Stick maker.Our ChoicesConsumer’s growing tendency to switch from offline to online alternatives has been apparent even in the recent past. But this is possible the first spurt in retail trade which is being partially attributed to sales derived only from Amazon.com. Clearly, the days of retail are increasingly numbered.However, this doesn’t mean that you should ignore the higher discretionary spending power of the American consumer. Several profitable alternatives from domains other than retail continue to exist. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score.Nutrisystem, Inc. (NTRI  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of weight management products and services.Nutrisystem has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of A.

1275,JWN,"As another earnings season passes us by, concern about the state of the retail industry is once again rising. Changing consumer habits and competition from e-commerce sites have devastated several traditional retail giants, and very few encouraging retail reports emerged this earnings season.Of course, “very few” does not mean “none at all.” Indeed, some retailers—be it those who have been deemed Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)-proof, or those who have successfully adapted to the times—were able to produce quality results in the most recent quarter.So who sticks out from the pack? Which retail companies actually did report solid earnings? Check out these three stocks below:1.       Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report)While several of its department store peers disappointed investors, Nordstrom was able to post earnings and revenue figures that topped estimates this quarter. Adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents and extended the company’s surprise streak to five. Total revenue of $3.8 billion surpassed our consensus estimate of $3.73 billion.Net retail sales increased 3.5%, while credit card revenues rose 28.8%. Total company comps rose 1.7%, driven by comps growth at both full-line and Rack stores. Nordstrom Rack total revenues, which include Rack stores and nordstromrack.com) gained 9.8%. So far this year, the company has opened a total of six new Rack stores and closed one full-line store—not bad in the face of shuttering department stores around the country.Nordstrom now anticipates net sales growth of nearly 4% for fiscal 2017, which is at the high-end of its previous guidance of nearly 3–4% growth. Also, the company now envisions fiscal 2017 earnings per share in the range of $2.85–$3.00, compared with $2.75–$3.00 projected earlier.JWN is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but the stock does carry “A” grades in each of our Style Score categories, including the overall weighted average VGM category. 2.       The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report)Home Depot reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue results before the bell on Tuesday, adding more support to the idea that it is one of the few retailers safe from the dangers of Amazon and providing more evidence that the housing market is relatively sound right now.The company posted fiscal second-quarter earnings of $2.25 per share, which was up more than 14.2% from the year-ago quarter and comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21. Net sales grew 6.2% to $28.1 billion, while comparable-store sales were up about 6.3% year-over-year.Thanks to its impressive performance in the first half of the year, Home Depot now expects sales growth of 5.3% and comps growth of 5.5% for the full fiscal year. The company also raised its full-year earnings outlook to $7.29 per share from $7.15 per share.Interestingly, Home Depot’s beat and raise was not met with immediate excitement from investors, and shares were actually down more than 3% through early afternoon trading Tuesday. However, Home Depot’s report contained plenty of strength, so it will be interesting to see if the stock rebounds soon. Currently, HD is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). 3.       Aaron’s, Inc. (AAN  -  Free Report)Despite a tough retail environment, Aaron’s was able to post its fifth-straight earnings beat in the most recent quarter. Indeed, earnings of 68 cents per share surpassed our Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents by a cool 17%.Revenues of $815.6 million were up about 3.3% year-over-year and above our consensus estimate of $790 million, perhaps adding to the theory that the company’s rent-to-own model could be helping it stick out right now. However, comparable store sales are continuing to slump, which is a familiar story in the retail industry.Nevertheless, share of Aaron’s received a nice lift from the report. The company released its earnings details before the market opened on July 28, and the stock closed more than 17% higher that day. Aaron’s also recently announced that it was purchasing its largest franchisee, a move that investors clearly feel is coming from a position of strength.In fact, Aaron’s shares are up over 41% year-to-date, making it one of the best performing stocks in the retail sector this year. AAN currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an overall VGM grade of “B.” Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1277,JWN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Nordstrom has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.3. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Nordstrom’s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint (which is 16.6) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 27.8. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Nordstrom has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.1, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Nordstrom’s P/CF ratio of 7.2 is higher than the industry average of 5.8, which indicates that the stock is somewhat overvalued in this respect.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Nordstrom currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes JWN a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Nordstrom might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A. This gives JWN a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days and three lower, while the full year estimate has seen five upward and one downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 1.6% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up 0.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Nordstrom, Inc. Price and Consensus  Nordstrom, Inc. Price and Consensus | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteEven though Nordstrom has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineNordstrom is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 42% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

Trump chose not to certify Iran’s compliance with a nuclear deal struck in 2015. He reasoned that the country continued to ‘sponsor terrorism’ and in effect disrupted international peace. He also described the deal as ‘one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.’He announced a new strategy for Iran which places fresh sanctions on the country that requires it to cut off its funding toward ‘terrorism.’ He also threatened to terminate the agreement sometime in the future if Iran does not ‘comply’ with the terms of deal.Stocks That Made HeadlinesBP Midstream Partners to Raise $893M From IPO OfferingA unit of British oil giant BP plc (BP  -  Free Report), BP Midstream Partners, is planning to raise funds from its initial public offering of about $893 million.

The S&P 500 also ended in the red after a broad based sell off ensued due to rising tensions between Pyongyang and Washington. Decline in shares of technology stocks weighed on the Nasdaq and dragged it lower as well.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,844.01, declining by 0.9% or 204.69 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 1.5%, decreasing 35.81 points to close at 2,438.21. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,216.87, slipping 135.46 points or 2.1%. A total of around 6.48 billion shares were traded on Thursday, above the last 20-session average of 7.5 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 6-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 3.60-to-1 ratio.Benchmarks Slip to Worst Levels since mid-MayDow lost grip of the psychological 22,000 milestone on Thursday to finish near the session lows. This was triggered by plunging shares of tech behemoth Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), which lost 3.2% and 2.4% respectively. Only three of the 30 components which make up the blue-chip index finished in the positive territory. Losses were primarily attributable to a broad-based sell-off as tension between Washington and Pyongyang escalated. Investors are now looking to take profits off the table after what has been a good earnings season. This decline comes a week after the Dow crossed the 22,000 landmark for the first time.The S&P 500 exhibited a steep decline after ten of its eleven primary sectors finished in the red on Thursday. Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) nosedived about 2.0% followed by Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) which declined 1.8%. The index has also fallen below its 50-day moving average for the first time in a month. This is also the S&P 500’s worst performance after it fell 1.8% in the middle of May. This dip came as a shock given the fact that the index was down just 0.1% for the entire week entering into the session.The Nasdaq finished in negative territory due to falling tech shares. Shares of Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) all declined due during the selloff which ensued because of the ongoing geopolitical tussle.North Korea Dismisses Trump’s WarningsEarlier in the week President Trump commented that North Korea would face “fire and fury” if the renegade country continues threatening the US. On Thursday, North Korea dismissed these claims as “load of nonsense” and continued threatening the U.S. by laying out plans to attack the Guam Naval base and announcing it to the media.Investors were worried by such developments and all three benchmarks closed lower for the third day in a row. The Dow is trading 1.2% off its closing record, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are 1.7% and 3.2% respectively off their all-time highs. Thursday also marked the worst one-day percentage drop of the benchmarks.Stocks That Made HeadlinesNordstrom Q2 Earnings & Sales Top, Stock Jumps 2.8%Nordstrom Inc.

1282,JWN,"J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 11. In the preceding quarter, the company reported earnings beat of 127.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether J. C. Penney will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 50.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is currently pegged at a loss of 7 cents. In second-quarter fiscal 2016, it had reported loss per share 5 cents. We noted that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2,857 million, down about 2% from the year-ago quarter.Factors Influencing this QuarterJ. C. Penney has taken up several strategic initiatives to drive traffic and is likely to impress investors with its second-quarter results. Notably in the previous month, the company stated that the sales performance has improved in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The company expects to post substantial improvement in the top line in the second quarter in comparison with the first quarter.Moreover, in an effort to lure more customers and ramp up sales performance, it has enhanced the loyalty program which was introduced for the first time in 2008. Per the new reward program, every customer will get $10 reward for every 200 points earned. The company, in order to enhance customer shopping experience, has been focusing on remodeling, renovating and refurbishing stores with special focus on enhancing high-margin center core department that houses handbags, fashion accessories, sunglasses and fashion jewelry.In a bid to better align stores with its omni channel network and utilize capital resources in locations where it has ample opportunity, J. C. Penney had earlier announced strategic initiatives, wherein it will shut down two distribution facilities as well as nearly 130–140 stores. The closure of stores, which represents nearly 13–14% of store portfolio, is likely to hurt total annual sales by less than 5%. Weaknesses in apparel sales are also affecting the company’s overall sales.J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Holding Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  J.C. Penney Company, Inc.

1283,JWN,"Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 9, after the market closes.Last quarter, Jack in the Box pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 8.89%. In fact, its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with average beat of 11.02%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Jack In The Box Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Jack In The Box Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Jack In The Box Inc. QuoteFactors Likely to Influence Q3 ResultsThe company expects regular menu innovations, increased focus on delivery channel and provision of limited period offers (LPO) at both its flagship restaurants to boost sales in the fiscal third quarter.On one hand, Jack in the Box’s premium and value offerings along with increased focus on breakfast menu are expected to drive its comps in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, continual expansion of the Brunchfast platform is further likely to boost sales.On the other hand, apart from menu innovation and remodeling efforts, the company anticipates catering and marketing initiatives to boost comps at the Qdoba brand. Moreover, Qdoba’s launch of its mobile app and re-designed affinity program is expected to result in incremental sales in the quarter.However, costs associated with new restaurant openings, higher promotional activity and elevated labor expenses might continue to weigh on margins. Additionally, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might hurt traffic and in turn comps in the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, poor restaurant level execution at the Qdoba brand along with a choppy sales environment might hamper the quarter’s results.Notably, in the fiscal third quarter, the company projects comps to be up 1% to down 1%  compared with the year-ago comps growth of 1.1% at the Jack in the Box restaurants. For the Qdoba restaurants, same-store sales are projected to be up 1% to down 1% compared with the year-ago quarter comps growth of 1%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Jack in the Box this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Jack in the Box has an Earnings ESP of -0.94%.

1284,JWN,"V.F. Corporation (VFC  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 24. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this designer, manufacturer and marketer of branded apparel and related products will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company posted in-line earnings in the last two quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. V.F. Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   V.F. Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | V.F. Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 28 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of over 20%. We noted that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.3 billion, down about 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.V.F. Corp. forms part of the Retail – Wholesale sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends as of Jul 15, the Retail – Wholesale sector’s earnings are expected to inch up 0.1%, with 3.8% revenues growth.Factors at PlayV.F. Corp.’s shares have gained 10.1% in the last six months, outperforming the Zacks categorized Textile – Apparel industry’s decline of 2.2%. This could be largely attributable to its five-year strategic growth plan (2021 growth strategy) that was announced this March. The plan focuses on rapidly responding to the changing marketplace as well as targeting shareholder returns. Further, the company’s four-point strategy focuses on redesigning portfolio and empowering its key brands, adopting a consumer and retail-centric model, enriching direct-to-consumer and digital businesses, and directing investment to Asia, particularly China. Well, these plans underscore the company’s growth prospects. In fact, we believe that the company is progressing well on these lines, as revenues in the first quarter mainly gained strength from international and direct-to-customer platforms, along with the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition.However, both earnings and sales declined year over year, as a challenging retail environment and currency headwinds played foul. Currency has long been a hurdle for the company’s top line which has suffered four consecutive quarters of year-over-year decline. Also, adverse currency fluctuations are expected to persist and hurt results. Evidently, management expects foreign currency woes to hurt 2017 revenues by about two percentage points. Also, the gross and operating margins are likely to bear respective 70 and 60 bps negative impacts from currency, in 2017. Finally, the company expects earnings per share to decline at a low-single digit percentage rate on a year-over-year basis, whereas the same is likely to rise in the mid-single digit rate on a currency neutral basis.Considering the pros and cons, we prefer to wait and see if V.F. Corp.’s growth strategies can help it sail through these headwinds this earnings season.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that V.F. Corp. is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1285,JWN,"Shares of Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) climbed on Wednesday after reports surfaced that the department store chain would once again consider taking on a private equity client in order to fund a buyout.CNBC first reported that Nordstrom family members are close to picking an investment firm to help the family facilitate a buyout of the publicly traded company, of which they own roughly 31%. In the potential deal, Leonard Green & Partners would supply roughly $1 billion to the Nordstrom family to help fund a deal to take the company private.Nordstrom’s shares popped 6.1% premarket and have since surged over 6.02% in morning trading Wednesday. Still, the historic U.S. department store sits almost $15 below its 52-week high of $62.83 per share.The company first announced it would consider taking the company private in June. Nordstrom’s statement noted that the family was looking into the possibility of acquiring 100% of JWN’s outstanding shares of common stock.Talk surrounding Nordstrom’s possible private buyout continued in early August, when it was reported that the family was in talks with KKR (KKR  -  Free Report), Apollo (APO  -  Free Report), and Leonard Green.  Renewed buyout speculation seems to have piqued investors’ interests on Wednesday, but the privet equity deal has not been finalized.The department store giant with a market cap of roughly $7.9 billion is also reportedly in talks with banks to raise around $8 billion in debt in order to completely finance the deal to go private.Nordstrom has seen its stock price fluctuate since the beginning of the year as it tries to navigate the changing retail waters. Now, it seems that the Nordstrom family thinks that it would be able to make changes and investments that help the chain adapt without having to worry about negative, short-term shareholder reactions.The renewed energy to go private comes only two days after the company announced it will debut a new concept store in California in early October. Branded “Nordstrom Local,” the company won’t even sell clothes at the new store, opting instead to focus on personal styling and consultations (also read: Nordstrom's New Inventory-Free Concept is Risky--But Just May Work).Nordstrom wants to experiment and evolve in the dynamic retail landscape, where these new age retail ideas have started to catch on. Yet, shares of Nordstrom tanked around 5% on Monday after the company made the Nordstrom Local announcement.Other Department Stores Shares of Nordstrom’s biggest retail peers, including Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report), experienced marginal gains on Wednesday. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) saw its stock price climb over 1%, while shares of the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 2x Shares ETF (RETL  -  Free Report) popped 3.05%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

However, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a negative 10.12%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Noodles & Company Price and EPS Surprise Noodles & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Noodles & Company QuoteFactors Likely to Influence Q2 ResultsVarious sales building initiatives undertaken by the company such as streamlining of menu and its innovation, introduction of new cooking procedures, effective marketing strategy, increased focus on the off-premise business along with investments in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering are expected to boost the quarter’s results. Moreover, efforts to simplify operations are likely to improve execution and result in increased guest satisfaction and labor productivity.In fact, the return of its popular item – Pasta Fresca – in May 2017 might also boost the quarter’s sales.Last quarter, Noodles & Company completed the closure of all of its underperforming restaurants that had been consistently hampering its human and financial capital. Thus, second quarter margins are likely to gain from this closure.However, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurants space might continue to hurt traffic and thereby comps in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, per its first-quarter conference call, management anticipates low-to-mid single-digit negative company-owned comparable restaurant sales for the second quarter.Meanwhile, this fast-casual restaurateur’s margins are further expected to be under pressure due to higher costs as well as expenses related to the implementation of strategic initiatives.Notably, the company recently implemented a revised pricing structure, which incorporates about 2% of price increase, and aids in better understanding of the menu. Therefore, it now remains to be seen what impact this step has on traffic and sales in the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Noodles & Company this quarter.

1287,JWN,"The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 15. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this home improvement retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company has a spectacular positive earnings surprise record of over four years now. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise   Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Home Depot, Inc. (The) QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $2.21, reflecting year-over-year growth of over 12%. We noted that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $27.8 billion, up about 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayHome Depot’s splendid past performance reflects its focus on solid strategic initiatives. The company remains keen on building its interconnected capabilities, in response to the evolving retail environment – where digital and physical stores go hand in hand. In this direction, the company has made great strides in the past, by redesigning its website with enhanced features. Further, Home Depot’s interconnected strategy goes beyond the dot.com as it continues to invest in fulfillment options to meet customers demand through launches like customer order management system (COM) and the Buy Online Deliver From Store (BODFS) capability. Well, Home Depot continues to reap benefits from these initiatives, as evident from online sales growth of nearly 23% in first-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, we believe that these efforts are likely to drive the company’s top and bottom lines in future. Apart from this, Home Depot is also gaining from housing market recovery and favorable customer demand.All these factors, which had encouraged management to raise its earnings view for fiscal 2017, also usher in confidence about the company’s upcoming release. However, intense competition remains a threat. Also, significant exposure to international markets makes Home Depot vulnerable to currency headwinds. Nonetheless, we note that shares of Home Depot have gained about 2.5% over the last six trading sessions, which clearly underscores investors’ positive sentiment in the company. Moreover, Home Depot’s shares have jumped 14.3% so far this year outperforming the industry’s 11.3% growth. Well, it looks like Home Depot is most likely to maintain its robust trend this time too.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Home Depot is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1288,JWN,"The earnings season is in full swing with results from 350 S&P 500 members already out. But Retail-Wholesale sector earnings are yet to gain steam and will take center stage as the reporting cycle nears its last leg. The sector has gained 16.6% so far in the year and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 index that advanced 10.7%.Per the most recent Earnings Outlook, about 39% of the total S&P 500 companies in the sector have reported results, wherein 62.5% beat earnings estimates and 68.8% surpassed revenue expectations. The report also suggests that the sector is expected to record top-line growth of 4% but is likely to witness earnings decline of 1.6% this season.Thus, though investors are cautious, they are still looking to replenish their portfolio in a favorable economic scenario, with the GDP breezing past the $19 trillion mark. We believe that the encouraging economic data and friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current regime bode well for the sector.Sector’s Correlation with the EconomyThe U.S. economy rebounded in the second quarter and more than doubled from the first quarter. A pick-up in consumer spending and an uptick in business investment in software, research and equipment boosted economic growth. Consumer outlays in particular improved on a steady job market and healthier household finances.Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the real gross domestic product (GDP) “advance” estimate for the second quarter of 2017 improved at an annual rate of 2.6% compared with a 1.2% rise witnessed in the preceding quarter. This indicated that the sluggish start to the year was primarily due to seasonal factors such as adverse weather conditions and delay in tax refunds.Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the U.S. economic activity, increased 2.8% in in the second quarter buoyed by the strongest labor market in years. As per reports, the U.S. economy has created over 16 million new jobs since 2010 that has helped lower unemployment rate to 4.4%. In fact, the U.S. job market roared back to life in June, with a better-than-expected 222,000 job additions in the month.The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving labor market and gradual recovery in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. These factors are favorable for retailers and definitely play a crucial role in improving consumer confidence, which rose to 121.1 in July from June’s reading of 117.3.Changing Retail DynamicsThe retail landscape has been witnessing a sea change with the focus gradually shifting to online shopping. This transition in consumer shopping pattern is compelling retailers to fast adapt to the changes in the ecosystem. Retailers now have no option left but to keep pace with the changing retail scenario or get eliminated. They are now focusing more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities. We note that U.S. retail sales fell for the second straight month in June (down 0.2%). But sales at non-store retailers inched up 0.4% sequentially and increased 9.2% from the prior-year period.Likely Winners this SeasonThe Retail-Wholesale sector has not been an outstanding performer and identifying the winners is definitely a herculean task. Given the numerous stocks in the sector that almost always muddle one’s stock-picking prowess, the Zacks methodology could offer some relief.

1289,JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 10. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this fashion specialty retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Nordstrom, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Nordstrom, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteThe company has delivered positive earnings surprises consistently in the last four quarters, with an average beat of about 41%. The robust earnings history has also helped shares of the company to jump 10.7% in the last one year, outperforming the industry’s slump of 25.2%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 61 cents compared with 67 cents delivered in the year-ago quarter. However, we noted that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.7 billion, up almost 2% from the year-ago quarter.Nordstrom forms part of the Retail – Wholesale sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the sector’s earnings are expected to dip 1.6% year over year while revenues are projected to grow 4%.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Nordstrom may beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key components.Zacks ESP: Nordstrom currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.28%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 63 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 61 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Nordstrom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Nordstrom’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected EarningsNordstrom’s solid past performance reflects the company’s robust brand image, cost-savings initiatives and impressive omnichannel efforts. The company is undertaking several initiatives to keep pace with customers’ shift to online shopping. Evidently, Nordstrom has been focused on technological advancement, through development of e-commerce and digital networks, and improvement of supply-chain channels and marketing efforts. Backed by these endeavors, the company’s online business crossed $3 billion in fiscal 2016, thus resulting in annualized growth of nearly 30% since 2010. Further, Nordstrom’s online sales formed nearly 24% of the company’s business in first-quarter fiscal 2017.Clearly, Nordstrom is making significant progress with respect to its customer-based strategy and it seems to be well on track with its long-term sales target of $20 billion by 2020.  With regard to cost savings, the company plans to strike a balance between its sales and expense growth. We believe that these factors are likely to drive Nordstrom’s growth. Thus, it seems like the company is set to maintain its splendid earnings surprise trend this time as well. Let’s wait and see.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1290,JWN,"Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this sporting goods behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the preceding quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Adidas AG Price and EPS Surprise   Adidas AG Price and EPS Surprise | Adidas AG QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 67 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of roughly 18%. We noted that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.6 billion, up about 11.1% from the year-ago quarter.Adidasforms part of the Consumer Discretionarysector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the Consumer Discretionary sector’s earnings are expected to remain flat year over year, while revenues are projected to grow 8.1%.Factors at PlayAdidas’ shares have gained 37.8% in the last one year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 4.8%. The company has been buoyed by continued revenues growth at its Adidas brand, particularly in North America. In the last quarter, revenues at Adidas grew 36%, driven by strength noted across the training and running categories. Also, the company has been gaining from its impressive women’s business. Together, these growth drivers along with the company’s constant product launches and strong marketing initiatives make us hopeful about the company’s prospects. However, management remained dissatisfied with its performance in Russia in the last quarter, which was hurt by unfavorable pricing. Apart from this, the company continues to fight a tough macroeconomic landscape in Brazil and Argentina.Nevertheless, Adidas recently posted its preliminary results for the second quarter, wherein revenues from continuing operations surged 19% on a currency neutral basis. Moreover, net income from continuing operations rose 16%, driven by solid revenues, enhanced gross margin and operating expense leverage. Encouraged by a strong first-half 2017, management raised its outlook for the full year. The company now anticipates currency neutral revenues to grow 17–19%, compared with the old guidance of 12–14%. Net income from continuing operations is now envisioned to increase 26–28% to roughly €1.36–€1.39 billion. Earlier, the company had forecasted the same to grow 13–15% to approximately €1.2–€1.23 billion. All said, let’s wait and see if Adidas can manage to put up another impressive show this time.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Adidas is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Adidas currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both, the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 67 cents.

1291,JWN,"Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) posted solid second-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both earnings and sales topped estimates. While the company delivered positive earnings surprise for the fifth straight quarter, sales beat estimates after three consecutive misses.This led to shares of this leading fashion specialty retailer jump nearly 2.8% in the after-hours trading session. Further, we note that Nordstrom has gained 8.9% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s fall of 13.1%.Nordstrom’s quarterly adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share came substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents. Further, bottom-line results also matched the company’s expectations.Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteRevenueTotal revenue advanced 3.9% to $3,793 million and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,732.1 million.The company’s net Retail sales increased 3.5% to $3,717 million, while Credit Card revenues rose 28.8% to $76 million. Total company comps rose 1.7% driven by comps growth at both full-line and Rack stores.Retail sales gained from relatively stronger performance at Nordstrom’s Anniversary sale, which happens to be its largest event for the year. Further, smooth execution of the company’s customer strategy, along with disciplined inventory and expense management, aided results.Moreover, the company’s fiscal second-quarter results reflected significant progress on its digital strategy. Notably, it delivered online sales growth of 20% at Nordstrom.com and a 27% increase at Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook.Net sales at Nordstrom full-line stores (including the U.S. and Canada full-line stores, Nordstrom.com and Trunk Club) rose 2.4%, with comps growth of 1.4%. The top-performing region during the quarter was East, while the best-performing categories were Women's Apparel and Beauty.Coming to Nordstrom Rack (that includes Nordstrom Rack stores and nordstromrack.com/HauteLook) net sales advanced 9.8%, while comps grew 3.1% on the back of growth in the Eastern region.Operational UpdateNordstrom's Retail gross profit margin contracted 25 basis points (bps) to 34.1%, mainly on account of increased occupancy expenses linked to new store expansion for Nordstrom Rack and in Canada, as well as higher loyalty expenses during the Anniversary Sale. This was partly mitigated by superior merchandise margins driven by more full-price selling.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, rose 46 bps to 30.3%, driven by planned technology and supply chain expenses related to the company's growth efforts.Store UpdateIn the fiscal second-quarter, the company opened one new Nordstrom Rack store at Vintage Oaks Shopping Center in Novato, CA. Year to date, the company inaugurated a total of six new Rack stores while it closed one full-line store.As of Aug 11, 2017, Nordstrom operated 354 stores in 40 states, including 122 full-line stores in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico; 221 Rack outlets, two Jeffrey boutiques and two clearance stores.FinancialsNordstrom ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $919 million, long-term debt net of current liabilities of $2,729 million and total shareholders’ equity of $785 million.In first-half fiscal 2017, Nordstrom generated $574 million in cash from operating activities and free cash flow of $115 million. Capital expenditures during the first six months of fiscal 2017 were $341 million.GuidanceFollowing second-quarter fiscal 2017 results, the company updated its previously stated guidance for fiscal 2017. It now anticipates net sales growth of nearly 4% for fiscal 2017, which is at the high-end of its previous guidance of nearly 3–4% growth. However, it reiterated its view of nearly flat comps for the fiscal.Further, the company raised the lower-end of its previously stated Retail EBIT guidance. It now expects Retail EBIT in the range of $790–$840 million, compared with $780–$840 million anticipated earlier. This reflects higher increased occupancy expenses linked to new stores (Nordstrom Rack, Canada and Manhattan flagship men's store), alongside increased supply chain and technology costs. Meanwhile, Credit EBIT is now estimated to be about $145 million, versus the earlier forecast of about $140 million.Based on the above iterations, the company now envisions fiscal 2017 earnings per share in the range of $2.85–$3.00, compared with $2.75–$3.00 projected earlier. The company’s guidance includes the impact of the additional 53rd week in fiscal 2017, which is likely to add about $200 million to net sales and 2–3 cents to earnings per share.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksNordstrom currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the retail sector include Canada Goose Holdings Inc. (GOOS  -  Free Report), The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) and Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc.

1292,JWN,"Investors do not seem to be enthusiastic ahead of Central Garden & Pet Company’s (CENT  -  Free Report) third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release, which is slated to be announced on Aug 2. We observe that the stock has declined roughly 3.5% in the past five days.Shares of this marketer and producer of quality branded products for the lawn & garden and pet supplies markets have decreased approximately 15% in the past three months, while the industry has declined 8.1%. The broader Consumer Discretionary sector has advanced 2.7% in the same time frame.As per the latest Earnings Preview, total revenue for the sector are anticipated to increase 8.1%, while earnings are expected to remain flat. Let’s take a closer look as to how Central Garden & Pet is expected to contribute to the sector’s performance.What to Expect from Central Garden & Pet?Well the obvious question that comes to mind, will Central Garden & Pet be able to continue with its positive earnings surprise streak in the quarter to be reported. The company has a remarkable history, at least in terms of the bottom line. The company continued with positive earnings surprise streak for the eleventh straight quarter, when it reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.In the trailing four quarters, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 119.1%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is 50 cents, which is a couple of cents above the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $541.3 million, up over 5% year over year.Central Garden & Pet Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Central Garden & Pet Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Central Garden & Pet Company QuoteFactors Influencing this QuarterStiff competition, seasonality of garden business and cautious approach by customers toward discretionary spending remains a concern, as the same may hurt performance. In an effort to deliver sustainable growth, the company is increasing investment. However, costs related to initiatives may hurt net income. Meanwhile, organic growth, value accretive acquisitions such as that of the pet bedding business and Segrest, and divestment of non-strategic assets has been aiding its performance. Moreover, management is revamping both Pet and Garden segments, and intends to possess a balanced approach that encompasses improvement in revenues and profits through operational efficiency as well as cost reduction.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Central Garden & Pet is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1293,JWN,"We expect beauty and cosmetic goods company, Avon Products Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3. In the last quarter, the company delivered a loss per share of 7 cents against our expectations of break-even results.The company has recorded negative earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters. However, it has an average positive surprise of 3.7% in the last four quarters.Avon Products, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Avon Products, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Avon Products, Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Avon will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 5 cents per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 21.4%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been going down ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.44 billion, up 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.We note that the stock has underperformed the industry in the last one month. The company’s shares have declined 4%, while the industry grew 3.7%.Factors at PlayThough Avon’s surprise trend is yet to recover, we remain encouraged by the company’s Transformation Plan that was announced in Jan 2016.With its Transformation Plan, the company targets bringing down costs over the long term and investing the savings back into growth initiatives like media, IT systems and social selling. It is on track to generate targeted savings of $230 million in 2017. Additionally, Avon is confident of achieving long-term goals of low-double digit operating margin growth, Active Representatives growth of 1–2% and constant-dollar revenue growth in the mid-single digits.Moreover, the company is undertaking strategic endeavors to boost top-line growth, trimming costs and improving working capital. Further, Avon has made significant progress in improving balance sheet through refinancing activities, along with cutting costs by slashing jobs and exiting operations in the underperforming markets. We believe these actions will help Avon to streamline operations by focusing more on high-priority markets and activities as well as enhancing efficiency.However, the company’s persistent dismal performances due to soft Active Representatives growth and currency headwinds cannot be ignored. The beauty products retailer’s recent records reveal that it has lagged both earnings and sales estimates for three straight quarters now. Despite its efforts to revive Active Representatives, the same declined 3% in first-quarter 2017 compared with the prior-year quarter. Furthermore, Ending Representatives dipped 1%.Further, it anticipates the increase in bad debts (in Brazil) to linger in the second quarter, which is expected to remain challenging. That said, let’s wait and see if Avon’s transformation efforts can aid in reviving near-term performance.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Avon Products is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The Most Accurate estimate is 6 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 5 cents. So the ensuing +20.00% ESP and the company’s Zacks Rank #3 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

A bottom-line loss of 36 cents per share (accounting for stock-based compensation and other BNRI) on sales of $181.7 million missed the -29 cents per share and $186.9 million, respectively, in the Zacks consensus estimate.

1295,JWN,"On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that upscale department store chain Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) is readying a new concept that is much different than its other retail ventures: a store that doesn’t even sell clothes.Called Nordstrom Local, which opens October 3 in West Hollywood, California, this new store concept will focus on personal styling and consultations, and prospective customers will be able to make appointments ""online, over the phone or in-person,"" said Nordstrom in a statement.When customers enter Nordstrom Local, they’ll likely notice it’s much smaller than a typical Nordstrom location. The concept is only 3,000 square feet, measuring just a fraction of the size of the company’s mall-anchored flagships. But that’s the point: Local was designed in mind to be convenient, a time-saving option for shoppers on the go.“As the retail landscape continues to transform at an unprecedented pace, the one thing we know that remains constant is that customers continue to value great service, speed and convenience,” said Shea Jensen, Nordstrom senior vice president of customer experience.“We know there are more and more demands on a customer's time and we wanted to offer our best services in a convenient location to meet their shopping needs. Finding new ways to engage with customers on their terms is more important to us now than ever,” Jensen continued.Another deviation from a typical Nordstrom department store, and your regular retailer, is that Nordstrom Local won’t have any clothes in stock. Instead, there will be eight dressing rooms where customers can try on certain items of clothing, and if you find something that works, the personal stylists will then “retrieve goods from nine Nordstrom locations in Los Angeles, or through its website,” writes the WSJ.Additionally, any orders placed on Nordstrom.com by 2 p.m. can be picked up at Nordstrom Local, and the store will also be able to accept returns of items bought online of from other Nordstrom locations.More than anything, Nordstrom Local is service-oriented, and in addition to styling services, customers have access to the retailer’s other amenities like Trunk Club styling, Buy Online, Pick-Up In-Store, onsite alterations and tailoring, same-day delivery, and curbside delivery. Local will also offer manicures and a bar that offers coffee, pressed juices, and wine or beer.Nordstrom isn’t the only retailer experimenting with smaller format stores. Target (TGT  -  Free Report), in particular, has been notably expanding this kind of concept in urban areas, while fellow department stores Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) and Sears  have been shrinking a good number of its existing locations.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1296,JWN,"Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, after the market closes.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading nutrition company will be able to maintain its positive earnings streak in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, its earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 10 straight quarters now, with a trailing four-quarter average of 18.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Herbalife this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Herbalife LTD. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Herbalife LTD. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Herbalife LTD. QuoteHerbalife has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.10. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP but we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise.Estimate RevisionsLet’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 and $4.50 for the second quarter and 2017 has remained stable in the last 30 days and this reflects a year-over-year decline of 14.7% and 7.2%, respectively.Furthermore, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.14 billion for the second quarter, down 5% from the year-ago period. However, revenues of $4.59 billion are anticipated for the full year, which is up 2.2% from 2016.Factors at PlayHerbalife has recently come under the scanner after some law firms like Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP and Lundin Law PC declared investigation related to possible violations of federal securities laws against the company. It should also be noted that on Jun 4, this California-based company, slashed its sales guidance, which was raised during first-quarter 2017 conference call. This was due to the new tougher Federal Trade Commission rules in the U.S. that are expected to hurt company’s business more than anticipated. Also, softness in its Mexico operations and distributors adopting the latest protocols are expected to dent sales in the to-be-reported quarter.The company now expects sales to decline in the range of 2–6% from 0.5–4.5%, guided earlier. Also, volumes are anticipated to decrease 4–8% compared with previous range of 1–5% for the second quarter. Management too expects the quarter to be a challenging one in 2017 compared with the year-ago quarter. Currency is also likely to hurt its results.Notably, Herbalife has been battling with billionaire investor Bill Ackman since Dec 2012, when Ackman made a $1 billion bet against the nutrition company, accusing it of being a pyramid scheme i.e. it employs deceptive marketing practices for improving business. Also, it received a civil investigative demand in 2014 from the FTC related to its marketing practices.Though the company resolved the probe with the FTC and paid $200 million through fines and settlements without being named a pyramid scheme, it was forced to prove that 80% of its annual sales come from documented consumer purchases. Interestingly, the company outpaced the key threshold of 80% under its agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. It announced that 90% of the U.S. sales in May were documented purchases, which consisted of over three million receipted retail transactions.In fact, Herbalife has remained upbeat about its prospects, which is evitable in its impressive earnings history and stock price performance. Shares of Herbalife have surged 41.3% on a year-to-date basis against its industry’s decline of 5.9%. Also, the stock has outperformed the broader Retail-Wholesale sector that has gained 17.1%.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1297,JWN,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) is one of the nation’s leading fashion specialty retailers, with stores located in a number of states, including full-line stores, Nordstrom Racks, and free-standing shoe stores. Nordstrom serves customers through its online presence and through its direct mail catalogs as well. More importantly, the company will release its quarterly earnings report after the closing bell on August 10.Nordstrom currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and has defeated its earnings projections in each of its past four operational fiscal quarters by an average of a whopping 40.97%, including an impressive beat of 59.26% last quarter. Also, Nordstom operates in the Retail-Apparel and Shoes industry, which sits in the top 44% of the Zacks Industry Rank.There have been a handful of disappointing retail earnings recently, but Nordstrom sticks out from the pack for a variety of reasons. Nordstrom features an adequate Zacks Rank, strong earnings history, as well as an Earnings ESP of 4.84%. All of these factors should allow investors to possess optimism as we approach its quarterly earnings release.Here are 3 additional reasons to be bullish on Nordstrom as we near its report:1.       Store Expansion to Boost SalesNordstrom has continued to focus on its store-expansion strategy. Apart from expanding its footprint within the United States, the company has been actively expanding its presence and customer base in Canada. Nordstrom’s newly opened Canadian stores have led to increased online sales in those regions. Also, the company envisions a $1 billion sales opportunity from its expansion in Canada by 2020, including six planned full-line stores and 15 Rack stores.Additionally, the company will inaugurate two full-line store relocations in California at Westfield Century City in Los Angeles and at University Towne Center in La Jolla. Furthermore, the company stated that it has opened six Rack stores so far in 2017, with another 11 planned for the fall. Finally, Nordstrom is on track with the opening of its flagship store in Manhattan in 2019 and its first Men’s store in spring 2018.2.       Strong Style ScoresNordstrom features impressive “A” grades for the Growth and Value Style Scores categories, while Momentum holds a “B” grade. The company’s “A” grade for Value is partially driven by its strong Cash Flow per Share of $7.75, which towers over the industry average of $1.49. Further, Nordstrom currently holds a respectable 6.33 EV/EBITDA ratio.Additionally, the company’s “A” grade for Growth is underscored by its 17.15% current cash flow growth and 61.36% RoE, both of which defeat the industry averages of -4.69% and 9.27%, respectively. Also, Nordstrom possesses projected sales growth of 3.19%, in comparison with the meager industry average of 0.04%. Finally, the company holds a “B” grade for Momentum, largely due to its recent share price increase of 16.66% in the past twelve weeks.3.       Projected Growth in Key DivisionsSales from specific divisions within the company are expected to continue growing. For example, revenues from all retail stores are projected to total close to $2.62 billion, which would represent a year-over-year increase of around 32%. Also, sales from its nordstromrack.com/Hautelook website are projected to grow 19.5% year-over-year to around $187.55 million.Overall, our Zacks Consensus Estimate projects Nordstrom to report $3.73 billion in sales, which would constitute year-over-year growth of 2.22%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimates expects the company to post earnings of $0.62 per share.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.This proven stock-picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing.

1298,JWN,"Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (BGFV  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this sporting goods company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company boasts a spectacular earnings surprise history, as it has outperformed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 94.5%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 19 cents, reflecting year-over-year increase of a whopping 72.7%. We note that our earnings estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $251.8 billion, up over 4% from the year-ago quarter.Big 5 Sportingforms part of the Retail–Wholesale sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the sector’s earnings are expected to dip 0.2%, while revenues are expected to climb 3.9%.Factors at PlayBig 5 Sporting marked its fourth straight earnings beat in the last reported quarter, wherein the company gained from competitive rationalization in the industry due to the liquidation of rivals Sports Authority and Sport Chalet. This aided comparable store sales (comps) performance and merchandise margins in the first quarter and is also expected to continue driving results. For second-quarter 2017, the company projected comps to increase in the mid-single digit range, while earnings per share is envisioned in the range of 14 – 20 cents, as compared with 10 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.However, management had earlier informed that calendar shift of Easter and July 4 holidays into the second quarter are likely to hurt results. It looks like this has hurt investors’ sentiment, as shares of this California-based retailer have tumbled 7.6% over the last five trading sessions. Moreover, this has caused the company to plunge 35.9% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 12.1%. Given this bearish stance, we prefer to wait and see if Big 5 Sporting can manage to maintain its solid earnings trend this time.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Big 5 Sporting is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as, both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 19 cents. The combination of Big 5 Sporting’s Zacks Rank #3 and ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #2.

The company has an average positive earnings surprise of 10.6% in the trailing four quarters.Aaron's, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Aaron's, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Aaron's, Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2017 has been stable in the last 30 days. However, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents per share for the quarter reflects a year-over-year decline of 1.7%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $790.4 million, up 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.Aaron’s forms part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Retail-Wholesale sector’s earnings are expected to fall 0.2%, while revenues are expected to grow 3.9%.Factors at PlayWhile Aaron’s has a solid earnings history, the top line continues to struggle. Though the company managed to beat sales estimate in the first quarter, after four consecutive misses, its top line declined year over year mainly due to soft performance at its core – Aaron’s Business. Additionally, sales were impacted by lower franchised revenues, a drop in comparable store sales (comps) and lower customer count on a same-store basis.However, management remains impressed with the performance of Progressive division, which continues to have strong prospects. Going forward, the company remains optimistic of growing Progressive business further, and continues to focus on transforming Aaron’s direct-to-consumer operations.Further, we note that Aaron’s has outperformed the broader industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have increased 24%, while the industry grew only 5%.That said, let’s wait and see if the strength in the Progressive division and the company’s transformation efforts can aid in sustaining the stock momentum.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Aaron’s is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1300,JWN,"The investing world may go gaga over the rapid emergence and acceptance of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and be enamored by its 94% share price gains in two years against 10.5% decline in SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report),butthere is a section that still doubts this monumental success. Moody’s Investors Service falls in this category. Let’s delve a little deeper”:Still Low Online Penetration in the United StatesAs per Moody’s, Amazon.com Inc. is far from ruling the U.S. retail market: “Online sales still account for only about 10% of overall U.S. retail sales, with a much lower percentage in the grocery segment, leaving the big brick and mortar retailers, led by Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), still really formidable competitors in the industry,"" as noted by Moody’s. This makes the e-commerce behemoth’s foray into the grocery segment with the Whole Foods acquisition appear not as profitable as many thought it will be (read: Tough Time Ahead for Grocery Stocks and ETFs?).Amazon’s Top Line Promising, Bottom Line a Drag Moody’s went on to explain that Amazon is doing great on sales growth but not on profitability. The company reported earnings per share of 40 cents, way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40 and down 77% year over year. Revenues climbed 25% year over year to $37.95 billion and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.21 billion.In comparison, Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart beat our earnings and revenue estimates on both lines. Nordstrom raised the lower end of its earnings guidance for fiscal 2017 too. Investors’ unloved bet Kohl's Corporation KSS also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the bottom line by a nickel while revenues came in slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $6 million (read: Solid Q2 Revenue Beat Fails to Boost Retail ETFs).Amazon's Prime Membership Exaggerated by Analysts?Some market watchers estimate Amazon's Prime membership base as high as 85 million. But Moody's calculations show Prime membership somewhere around 50 million against Costco's paid membership of 47.6 million and total membership of 86.7 million as of the fiscal year ended August 2016, as per the source.Wal-Mart Not Amazon Has Upper Hand in Food Market Last but not the least, Moody’s noted that U.S. food sales total about $800 billion a year, of which Walmart takes about 25%. Kroger is responsible for about $130 billion while Albertson's accounts for about $60 billion and Costco about $50 billion. Moody’s agreed that Whole Foods provided Amazon with an important crucial brick-and-mortar presence, which should prove beneficial for the latter.  Moody’s sees that “even with Whole Foods in its basket, [Amazon’s] food sales still amount to less than $20 billion annually.""However, Moddy’s is bullish on Amazon Web Services or AWS, which constitutes a significant portion of the company's operating income. Amazon's cash cushion and excellent liquidity profile are also well liked by Moody’s.Traditional Retailers Cashing on Amazon Success Investors should note that traditional retailers are capitalizing on Amazon’s popularity lately. For example,Kohl’shas formed a partnership with Amazon under which the former will start selling Amazon devices, like Echo and Fire tablets, at 10 stores in Los Angeles and Chicago from October. Prior to this, in July, Sears SHLD entered into a deal to sell its Kenmore home appliances on Amazon.Inside the Stock’s Unimpressive ScoresAmazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with a Value and Momentum Score of F. Only a Growth Score of A looks promising. The company’s Zacks Industry Rank is in the bottom 41%, at the time of writing.ETF Strategies Investors may be cautious on ETFs heavy on Amazon given the above-mentioned analysis. VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report), Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY  -  Free Report) and Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF (FDIS  -  Free Report). AMZN holds the top spot in these funds with a double-digit exposure each.On the other hand, ETFs like First Trust Nasdaq Retail ETF (FTXD  -  Free Report), XRT, PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF (PMR  -  Free Report) and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report) can be considered for gains. FTXD is low on Amazon while PMR, XLP and XRT do not have it in their top-10 holdings.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1301,JWN,"The Q2 earnings picture for the retail sector is among the weakest this reporting cycle with results tracking below past quarters and leading to 0.5% negative price performance for the broad sector.Total earnings from 90.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization reported so far are down 0.8% on 4.8% higher revenues with 77.4% of the companies beating on earnings and 80.6% exceeding top-line estimates. While earnings growth rate is unimpressive, the proportion of retailers beating revenue estimates is the third highest of all 16 Zacks sectors, behind only the conglomerates (83.3%) and technology (85.2%).Positive earnings reports from Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) offset some negativity of weak results from department stores like J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), and Kohl’s KSS.Let’s dig into the details of the earnings releases:Earnings Sending Stocks HigherBig-box retailer, Target, emerged as the real champion in the Q2 earnings season as the stock surged as much as 4.9% following robust second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on August 18. The company topped our estimates by three cents for earnings and by $147 million for revenues. It expects earnings per share in the range of 75-95 for the ongoing quarter and raised its outlook to $4.34-$4.54 from $3.80-$4.20 for the fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was 78 cents for the third quarter and $4.42 for fiscal 2017 (read: Will Big-Box Retailers Push Up Retail ETFs in Q2 Earnings?).Specialty retailer, Nordstrom, rose as much as 2.5% following second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by three cents and for revenues by $61 million. The company raised its lower end of its earnings per share guidance to $2.52-$3.00 from $2.75-$3.00 for fiscal 2017.The DampenersOne of the leading department store retailers, J.C. Penney, dampened investors’ mood as its share price plunged 19.9% following the earnings announcement on August 11. The company posted loss per share of 9 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents. However, revenue came in higher than our estimate by $92 million. For fiscal 2017, the company continued to expect earnings per share in the range of 40-65 cents (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).The second-largest department store retailer, Macy’s tanked 10.8% following the earnings announcement on August 10, marking the biggest daily loss since January 5. Though the retailer beat our estimates for earnings by three cents and for revenues by $51 million, it reported drop in same-store sales, sparking concerns on the prospect of its turnaround before the crucial holiday season. For fiscal 2017, it continues to project sales decline of 3.2-4.3% and earnings per share in the range of $2.90-$3.15.One of the leading departmental stores Kohl’s also had its worst day since January 8, falling 5.8% posting a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly sales on August 10. Earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel and revenues came in slightly higher than our estimate by $6 million.Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement retailer, beat on second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings by three cents and on revenues by $267 million. For fiscal 2017, Home Depot raised the earnings per share guidance to $7.29 from $7.15, which represents 13% increase year over year. However, the stock dropped as much as 3.9% on the day of its earnings announcement on August 15.The world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart, lost as much as 3.2% on August 17 on bleak guidance. It topped our earnings and revenue estimates by a penny and $646 million, respectively. The company raised the lower end of its fiscal 2018 earnings per share guidance to $4.30-$4.40 from $4.20-$4.40. The midpoint of the guidance was much below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.37 at the time of earnings release (read: Consumer ETFs in Focus on Wal-Mart Earnings Beat).ETFs in FocusA slew of negative price reactions led to terrible trading in retail ETFs over the past 10 trading sessions.

1302,JWN,"On Tuesday, shares of department store Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) are gaining, up over 4% in late-morning trading after the company announced a major restructuring plan that could be exactly what the struggling retailer needs.Macy’s said it will be cutting 100 jobs as part of a consolidation plan to unite its merchandising, planning, and private brands operations into one department. The company also said the plan will save Macy’s an estimated $30 million a year, including roughly $5 million, or a penny per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. But, the change will also mean one-time costs of approximately $20 million to $25 million, taking effect mostly in the third quarter, according to Macy’s.The company has also named a new president, bringing in former eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) executive Hal Lawton. Lawton has previously worked for The Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and McKinsey & Co., a management consulting firm; he will begin his tenure on September 8.Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette commended Lawton's ""deep expertise at the intersection of retail and technology, a diverse set of business experiences that give him a unique perspective, and a track record of successfully driving a change agenda at scale.""This is a key step,"" Gennette added, ""as we look to further transform the business and work through the volatility of today’s retail landscape.""At eBay, Lawton was in charge of marketing, merchandising, and consumer selling, and has a strong background in technology and digital expertise, all things that will be vital to Macy’s has the department store giant makes big moves to revitalize its business.Additionally, Macy’s is getting ready to roll out its off-price division, Macy’s Backstage, in more of its store locations, as well as strengthen its beauty business, leveraging its recent acquisition of Bluemercury, notes CNBC. The company launching a new loyalty program that will officially hit the market in October.Macy’s In-DepthMacy’s is currently a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘A.’ Though its industry, Retail-Regional Department Stores, has lost almost 36% year-to-date, it sits in the top 43% of all 265 industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank.This past quarter, Macy’s surpassed analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines, though the company still expects comparable sales for the full year to decline by 2.2% to 3.3%. Looking ahead, earnings are expected to grow about 7% for the current year, while sales are projected to decline nearly 4% in the same time frame.From a value perspective, Macy’s is very cheap, with a P/E of only 5.85. The stock has depreciated over time too, losing about have its value over the last 12 months—its P/E a year ago was around 10.5—and demonstrating the brutal environment of traditional brick-and-mortar retail.Macy’s value story also reflects the so-called “perceived value” among retailers. Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), for instance, has a P/E right now of 14.9. Macy’s and Nordstrom are in the same industry and arguably have suffered many of the same problems. The only difference is that investors have always been willing to pay more for JWN because of the company’s perceived high-status among retailers, a factor that has worked in their favor with shareholders and customers.Right now, people don’t equate “high-end” with Macy’s. But bringing in executives like Mr. Lawton, and working to utilize acquisitions like Bluemercury, and rethinking what it means to do retail in the twenty-first century may help Macy’s reach that icon status once again.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1303,JWN,"Its time again for the second-quarter reporting cycle to gain momentum. In fact, now that we are done with the earnings results from the early reporters and the late comers from the previous quarter, we will witness second-quarter earnings acquiring full impetus. So, let’s brace ourselves for the next round of earnings.Among all the sectors, our focus in the discussion here will be the Retail-Wholesale sector.  A close look at the sector reveals that retailers continue to bear the brunt of the current challenging retail environment due to sluggish mall traffic, volatile consumer spending and increased competition from online players. We believe the impact of the slowdown in traffic trends will clearly be reflected in the diminished sales and comparable store sales (comps) numbers in second-quarter 2017.Further, these retailers are heavily investing in eCommerce and omni-channel functionalities, which are likely to weigh on margins at least in the near term.The data released by the Commerce Department on Jul 14 revealed that retail sales declined for the second month in a row. U.S. retail and food services sales for Jun 2017 declined 0.2% sequentially, compared with a 0.1% decline in May. The decline can be attributed to soft sales at gasoline stations, clothing retailers and department stores. Further, consumers continued to spend lower at restaurants as well as on hobbies.Additionally, the data revealed that retail trade sales for June dipped 0.1% from May but increased about 3% from last year. While non-store retailers registered growth of 9.2% from last year, sales for the Sporting Goods, Hobby, Book, & Music Stores declined 8.9% year over year.However, U.S. retail and food services sales improved 2.8% form Jun 2016. Moreover, total sales for second-quarter 2017 (Apr 2017 through Jun 2017) reflected a 3.8% growth from the prior-year period. The overall increase in the estimate for the second quarter could be attributed to the growing online sales, which now forms a part of core sales of most retailers.Q2 Earnings ScorecardLooking at the earnings scorecard of the overall S&P 500 Index so far, 30 S&P 500 members that together represent 9.3% of the Index’s total market capitalization have released second-quarter earnings results. Total earnings for these companies were up 13.8%, on 6% revenue growth. Further, about 83.3% delivered both positive earnings and revenue surprises.While this represents only a small sample, we can ascertain that the second-quarter earnings season is surely off to a good start. More clarity on the results will be evident from the S&P members reporting earnings in the next few weeks. A look at the earnings calendar shows that we are only few days away from the reporting cycle fully taking off.Coming to expectations, total earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 6.6% year over year, with a 4.5% jump in revenues. For the retail sector, in particular, earnings in the second quarter are expected to inch up 0.1%, with 3.7% revenue growth.The real picture of the trend so far is visible from our latest Earnings Preview report published on Jul 15.That said, we bring to you five retail stocks that may show promise based on their favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP.

1304,JWN,"Meredith Corporation (MDP  -  Free Report), one of leading media and marketing companies in the U.S. is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, in the trailing four quarters, it has posted an average earnings beat of 3.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Meredith will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 96 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of over 11%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 60 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $440.6 million compared with $435.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Factors Influencing this QuarterStrategic endeavors such as increase in digital offerings, the launch of new magazine, The Magnolia Journal, and addition of newscasts across television stations, along with its focus on non-advertising revenue generating avenues such as retransmission fees, brand licensing and e-commerce are likely to drive the top line higher.To strengthen position, Meredith has launched additional newscasts in the Atlanta, Phoenix, Portland, Nashville, Greenville and Flint/Saginaw markets. The company also renewed licensing program with Wal-Mart Stores, which allows it to showcase 3,000 SKUs of Better Homes & Gardens branded products at 5,000 outlets and on Walmart.com. For the fourth-quarter earnings are anticipated to be in the range of 93–98 cents per share. Local Media Group’s revenue is expected to be up mid-single digits, while that of National Media Group is likely to be down marginally in the final quarter.  However, with advancing technology, the print media is on a decline. Shift to online is likely to put enormous pressure on Meredith’s magazine portfolio. Though the company is expanding digital presence, it will take time to complete the metamorphosis.Meredith Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Meredith Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Meredith Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Meredith is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Meredith has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 96 cents.

1305,JWN,"Shares of Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) jumped 10.67% in trading on Friday, closing at $59.02 per share, after reporting better-than-expected second quarter fiscal 2017 results.Ross reported earnings of $0.82 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.76. Earnings grew 15.49% year-over-year. The company also reported revenue of $3.431 billion, surpassing our estimate of $3.370 billion and growing 7.88% year-over-year.The company also stated that comparable store sales rose 4%. Ross Stores expects to earn between $0.64 and $0.67 per share during the third quarter.This positive earnings report comes in sharp contrast to falling retail stocks resulting from poor earnings and sales this week. Today, Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) fell 28% after missing analyst expectations, dragging other athletic retailers along with it. L Brands (LB  -  Free Report), the owner of Victoria’s Secret, also tumbled on Wednesday after reporting disappointing sales and a weak outlook for the third quarter.Ross owes its success partially to its strategy of being an off-price retailer. The company offers designer and brand name products at deeply discounted rates. This has attracted consumers to its 1,340 U.S. stores, allowing Ross to succeed despite e-commerce retailer threats, like from Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report).TJX Companies Inc (TJX  -  Free Report), which owns T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and the popular HomeGoods, also reported second quarter earnings this week that beat our estimates. The success of both these off-price companies demonstrates that department stores like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) aren't doing well just because of online competition, but because consumers want quality products at low prices.ROST remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), with a VGM score of ‘A.’Want to learn more about retail?

1306,JWN,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8, after market close.Last quarter, Red Robin came up with a positive earnings surprise of 53.45%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed/met the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 17.27%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely to Influence Q2 ResultsRed Robin’s brand revitalization initiatives such as menu innovation, operational improvement and the introduction of a better customer service platform to enhance guest experience continue to drive revenues. Also, the company’s local marketing initiatives and media campaign are expected to attract customers.Notably, the company has rolled out Kitchen Display System, which is linked to table management software. This is expected to result in major sales growth as kitchens can handle higher peak volumes. Moreover, Red Robin’s increased focus on its remodeling initiative is likely to boost its potential as a brand and improve client experience, thereby driving traffic.Meanwhile, the company is moving smartly on new revenue streams such as its off-premise, online-ordering business via carry-out, delivery and catering. Although these are expected to meaningfully support the top line in the second half of 2017, they might provide marginal additional yields in the to-be-reported as well.However, as the operating environment has become increasingly challenging, the decline in sales volumes have begun to impact the returns on new restaurant openings. As a result, Red Robin is slowing down its development plan significantly for 2017. This, in turn, may hurt the top line in the quarter.Moreover, the company has been witnessing rising labor costs, food costs, expenses related to initiatives as well as pre-opening and remodeling costs, which might continue to put pressure on margins in the second quarter. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen if the Red Robin’s new supply chain management software could provide some relief to this end.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Red Robin is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1307,JWN,"Fast-food chain, The Wendy’s Company (WEN  -  Free Report), is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 9, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12.50%. In fact, Wendy’s has surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.63%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Wendy's Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Wendy's Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Wendy's Company (The) QuoteFactors to ConsiderThe first quarter of 2017 marked the 17th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth for Wendy’s, indicating long-term strength and relevance of the brand. We expect the company to maintain the trend in the second quarter, through its solid menu pipeline, limited time offers (LTO), marketing initiatives and increased emphasis on core and price value offerings.Additionally, increased investments in technology like mobile payment, mobile ordering and customer self-order kiosks are expected to quicken service, resulting in increased customer count. Meanwhile, re-imaging of restaurants is anticipated to increase traffic and drive higher sales.We note that Wendy’s has been witnessing year-over-year revenue decline over the last few quarters due to reduced number of company-operated restaurants, resulting from the company’s system optimization initiative. Although the initiative was completed in fourth-quarter 2016, the company experienced a slump in revenues in first-quarter 2017 too. It remains to be seen if the company could realize the benefits of optimization in the to-be-reported quarter or if the trend of declining revenues would continue.Meanwhile, increased costs related to other sales-boosting initiatives and persistent higher wages, could weigh on margins. Furthermore, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurants space might further hurt traffic and thereby comps in the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Wendy’s this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Wendy’s has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 13 cents.

1308,JWN,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 8. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?Michael Kors has a remarkable history, at least in terms of the bottom line. The company continued with its positive earnings surprise streak for the seventh straight quarter, as it reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8.1%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is 62 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of over 29%. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $918 million, down over 4% from the year-ago quarter.Well the obvious question that comes to mind, will Michael Kors be able to sustain its positive earnings surprise streak in the fourth quarter. Well past trends do indicate toward that direction but it will not be wise to jump to a conclusion without analyzing the factors at play.Factors at PlayWe remained concerned about Michael Kors’ wholesale segment performance, which has witnessed a sharp decline in the previous few quarters. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 22.8% to $456.1 million primarily due to dismal performance of Americas and European regions, while on a constant currency basis, it fell 22.3%. In the third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, wholesale segment sales declined 17.8%, 18.4% and 7%, respectively. In fiscal 2018, the company expects wholesale segment to decrease in the low-teens range.Stiff competition, waning comps, aggressive promotional environment and sluggish mall traffic are making things tough for Michael Kors. We noted that comparable sales had fallen 14.1% in the final quarter of fiscal 2017, following declines of 6.9%, 5.4% and 7.4% in the third, second and first quarters, respectively. The company is also struggling with its top-line performance. After registering a meager growth of 0.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, it had declined 3.7%, 3.2% and 11.2% in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017.For the first quarter, Michael Kors forecasts total revenue between $910 million and $930 million, and expects comparable sales to decline in the high-single digit range. Operating margin is anticipated to be approximately 13%. Management projects earnings in the range of 60–64 cents per share for the first quarter.However, the company has been constantly deploying resources to expand product offerings, open new stores, and build shop-in-shops along with upgrading information system and distribution infrastructure. Management intends to upgrade eCommerce platform and expects the channel to be a significant contributor in the long run. We note that despite the possibility of heavy investments weighing upon the margins in the short term, management continues to take up strategic endeavors.Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Michael Kors Holdings Limited QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils? Well our proven model does not conclusively show that Michael Kors is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1309,JWN,"World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 financial numbers, before the opening bell on Jul 27. In the previous quarter, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 27.3%.Notably, the company’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of trailing four quarters by an average of 34.3%. Here’s a discussion on the determinants of the second-quarter results.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether World Wrestling Entertainment will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 6 cents, in comparison with year-ago quarter earnings of 1 cent. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 60 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $204.5 million compared with $199 million reported in the year-ago quarter.We noted that the stock has outperformed both the Zacks categorized Movie/TV Production/Distribution industry and the S&P 500 Index on a year-to-date basis. The company’s shares have advanced 15.7%, while the Zacks categorized industry and the S&P 500 have witnessed a gain of 1.5% and 10.1%, respectively.Factors Influencing This QuarterIn three out of the preceding four quarters, WWE has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and consequently analysts are skeptical about the company’s performance in second-quarter 2017. WWE operates in the highly competitive market of entertainment video. Further, decline in home entertainment and pay-per view revenues has been a major concern for the investors. In 2016, home entertainment net revenues came in at $13.1 million in comparison with $13.4 million and $27.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Further, the trend continued in the first quarter, with home entertainment revenues declining 27%.For second-quarter 2017, WWE anticipates average paid subscribers of 1.63 million. Adjusted OBIDA is projected in the range of $13–$17 million. Further, WWE expects contractual rise in television right fees from important distribution agreements and believes that the company will continue to add more WWE Network subscribers.In order to boost WWE Network’s revenues, the company has been implementing certain strategies including the development of fresh content, execution of customer acquisition and retention programs, increase in distribution platform, introduction of new features along with foraying into new locations.Zacks Model Shows Unlikely BeatOur proven model does not conclusively show that WWE is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1310,JWN,"Fogo de Chao, Inc.  is set to report its second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8, after the market closes. In fact, this will mark the leading Brazilian steakhouse’s ninth quarterly earnings release since it began trading on NASDAQ in Jun 2015.Last quarter, the company posted in-line earnings. However, its trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a negative 0.41%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fogo de Chao, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Fogo de Chao, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Fogo de Chao, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderFogo de Chao specializes in fire-roasting high-quality meats, using the centuries old Southern Brazilian cooking technique of churrasco. It also offers several varieties of meat − beef, lamb, chicken, pork and seafood − to suit the palate of diners. In fact, the company’s unique South American style of cooking on an open flame has helped it gain enormous popularity.Notably, the top line in the to-be-reported quarter is likely benefit from initiatives like menu innovation, introduction of value platforms, daypart expansion, marketing through various channels, re-imaging of restaurants and unit development efforts. In fact, the company expects its Brazil remodel program to provide a lift to revenue of approximately 2-3% on average.Meanwhile, the use of social media to increase brand awareness and thereby drive traffic, might also prove incremental to sales. Furthermore, the company’s roll out of its most significant bar menu enhancements in the U.S. is expected to bolster revenue growth.Although the company has been experiencing increased labor costs in relation to specialized training for the various initiatives, labor cost pressure is expected to ease in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, higher preopening costs and expenses related to sales initiatives are likely to weigh on second-quarter profits. In addition, a challenging sales environment in the U.S. restaurant space is likely to hurt comps while  sales in Brazil are expected to continue reflecting the impact of the sustained economic recession. Also, foreign currency fluctuations may further mar top-line growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Fogo de Chao this quarter.

1311,JWN,"Rent-A-Center, Inc. (RCII  -  Free Report), which recently turned down the buyout offer by private equity firm, Vintage Capital, is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26. The question lingering in the minds of investors is whether this leading rent-to-own store operator will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 8 cents, substantially down from 41 cents reported in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $665.9 million, down about 11% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayWe remained concerned about the company’s top-line and bottom-line performance which has been declining year over year. Moreover, total revenue has also missed the consensus mark for the seventh straight quarter. Total revenue fell 11.2% year over year during the first quarter, exhibiting decline witnessed across the Core U.S., Mexico and Franchising segments, partially mitigated by growth registered at Acceptance Now segment.Nevertheless, Rent-A-Center is concentrating on a new labor model, supply chain initiative and productivity enhancements. Management hinted that these endeavors are directed toward improving the performance of Core U.S. segment, optimizing the AcceptanceNOW business, and enhancing distribution channels as well as integrating retail and online offerings. These may have a favorable impact on the quarter to be reported.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Rent-A-Center is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1312,JWN,"Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 61%.In fact, Hertz has missed our estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 24.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Hertz Global Holdings, Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Hertz Global Holdings, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Hertz Global Holdings, Inc QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Hertz will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a loss of 10 cents per share, compared with earnings of 41 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.21 billion, down 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, we note that the stock has underperformed the broader industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have declined 15.6%, while the industry grew 3.1%.Factors at PlayHertz’ bearish run can mainly be attributable to its disappointing past performance, as the company has lagged bottom-line estimates for three consecutive quarters now.In first-quarter 2017, Hertz suffered a loss and also recorded soft revenues. Earnings were hurt by weak sales, increased fleet investments along with higher spending on tech and brand development, while fall in revenues was due to soft domestic and international sales.Though performance remained disappointing, the company remains focused on turnaround plan, which keeps customers at centre stage. Further, the company remains keen on solving issues related to fleet and services, which were the main deterrents. In this regard, management remains on track to make investments in fleet, services, brand development and technology in 2017, which should help it regain solid market position.Nonetheless, the aforementioned negative factors and unfavorable currency movements make us cautious about the upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hertz is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Hertz has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 10 cents per share. While the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

1313,JWN,"Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 8. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this designer, marketer and distributor of premium lifestyle products will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company has delivered positive earnings surprises consistently in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 14.2%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 97 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of 8.5%. Further, we noted that our earnings estimate has dipped by a notch over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.4 billion, down about 13.1% from the year-ago quarter.Ralph Laurenforms part of the Consumer Discretionarysector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the Consumer Discretionary sector’s earnings are expected to climb 2.3% year over year while revenues are projected to grow 8.1%.Factors at PlayDespite a solid earnings surprise history, Ralph Lauren’s shares have lost 15.8% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 0.5% growth. The company continues to battle foreign currency headwinds, which is expected to hurt margins and sales in the first quarter and fiscal 2018. Moreover, Ralph Lauren is reeling under soft traffic trends, which weighed upon its top line in the last reported quarter and remains a deterrent for the upcoming quarter as well. All these factors have caused management to issue a drab sales view for the first quarter and fiscal 2018, when it reported its last quarterly outcome.Evidently, the company expects fiscal first-quarter reported revenues to be down low-double digits, excluding currency impact. Operating margin for the fiscal first quarter is expected to be 9.5–10%. The company expects currency headwinds to reduce revenues growth by nearly 225 bps and operating margin rate by about 75 bps. For fiscal 2018, the company expects revenue to decline 8–9%, excluding currency. Operating margin is estimated to be 9–10.5% on a currency-neutral basis. Foreign currency is anticipated to pull down revenues by 150 bps and operating margins by 50–75 bps in fiscal 2018.Moreover, the company announced plans to adopt the Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-09 for the accounting of employee share-based payments (in fiscal 2018), which was recently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). This is likely to impact effective tax rate, with the first and the second quarter bearing the maximum brunt. Consequently, effective tax rate for fiscal first-quarter is anticipated to be 33%. All these factors make us apprehensive about Ralph Lauren’s upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Ralph Laurenis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1314,JWN,"Leading fashion specialty retailer, Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) remains in investors’ good books given its solid stock performance, robust earnings surprise history, and long-term strategies like cost saving initiatives, store expansion efforts and progress on 2020 strategy. These factors have aided it to retain the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and carry a VGM Score of A.Stock PerformanceShares of Nordstrom have shown solid momentum in the last three months driven by its earnings surprise trend as well as progress on long-term strategies. The stock witnessed 9.6% growth, outperforming the industry’s 14.8% decline.Earnings Trend & OutlookNordstrom posted solid second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings, wherein both earnings and sales topped estimates. While the company delivered positive earnings surprise for the fifth straight quarter, sales beat estimates after three consecutive misses. Results gained from a strong Anniversary sale event, smooth execution of customer strategy along with disciplined inventory and expense management. Sales growth in Nordstrom Rack and solid eCommerce sales also aided results. Moreover, the company’s revised fiscal 2017 guidance remains encouraging.Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteThe company now anticipates net sales growth of nearly 4% for fiscal 2017, which is at the high-end of its previous guidance of 3-4% growth. Further, the company raised the lower-end of its Retail EBIT and earnings per share guidance, while it upped forecast for Credit EBIT. It now expects Retail EBIT in the range of $790-$840 million, compared with $780-$840 million anticipated earlier. Credit EBIT is estimated to be about $145 million, compared with the earlier forecast of $140 million. The company now envisions fiscal 2017 earnings per share in the range of $2.85-$3.00, compared with $2.75-$3.00 projected earlier.Long-Term Growth StrategyNordstrom is making significant progress with respect to its customer-based strategy and is on track to reach its long-term growth target of $20 billion by 2020. In doing so, the company is executing its strategy of enhancing market share through persistent store expansion and strengthening capabilities via further investments, particularly in digital growth. With regard to cost savings, the company plans to strike a balance between sales and expense growth. Notably, Nordstrom is making amendments to its operating model in response to the constant slowdown in mall traffic resulting from customers’ shift to online shopping.Store ExpansionNordstrom has been persistently focusing on store-expansion strategy as part of efforts to grow market share. In doing so, the company remains keen on prioritizing investments in the top North American markets. In September, the company will successfully complete its planned full-line store expansion in Canada with the opening of its sixth outlet at Sherway Gardens in Toronto. Overall, the company envisions a $1 billion sales opportunity from expansion in Canada by 2020, including six planned full-line stores and 15 Rack stores. Furthermore, the company is on track with domestic store expansion. It is scheduled to inaugurate two full-line store relocations in California in October, at Westfield Century City in Los Angeles and at University Towne Center in La Jolla. Year to date, the company has opened a total of six new Rack stores while it closed one full-line store.Higher Expenses to Remain a HurdleWe note that Nordstrom’s growth strategy focused on enhancement of digital experience and increased investments in supply chain bode well for the long term. However, investments related to occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing expenses are likely to weigh upon the company’s near-term cost and margins performance. Consequently, the company’s merchandise performance was hurt by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores in the fiscal second quarter. Further, the company’s accelerated investments towards technology, supply chain and marketing, resulted in higher SG&A expenses in the quarter.For fiscal 2017 also, the company anticipates Retail gross profit to be impacted by higher new store occupancy expenses and mix impact from off-price growth. Further, the company’s projections for SG&A expenses incorporates higher technology and supply chain expenses related to growth initiatives, offset by progress in productivity improvements.ConclusionWe believe the company’s long-term growth efforts and its surprise history speaks loads of the company’s potential to grow. While higher near-term costs are surely a concern for the company, we believe this is temporary and will gradually subside once its strategic efforts are fully implemented.Meanwhile, investors interested in the retail space can count on Canada Goose Holdings Inc. (GOOS  -  Free Report), The Children’s Place Inc. (PLCE  -  Free Report) and Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. (BBW  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1315,JWN,"Apparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report), holding company of Anthropologie, Free People, BHLDN, Terrain, and Urban Outfitters brands, delivered a massive second quarter earnings beat, reporting earnings of 44 cents per share on revenues of $873 million. Shares of Urban have been soaring ever since, and are up over 18% in late afternoon trading on Wednesday.Despite these top and bottom line accomplishments, Urban’s overall comparable sales did fall year-over-year, declining nearly 5%, though not as much as Wall Street was expecting. Breaking it down by its main brands, comps fell 4% at Anthropologie and almost 8% at Urban Outfitters, while at Free People, same-store sales increased 2.9%.Free People, a brand known specifically for its hippie style, has been a major growth factor for Urban Outfitters these past few years. Making up about 20% of Urban’s total revenue, Free People could help the retailer stay on this profitable path. But what is it about the brand that resonates with consumers?What is Free People?Most importantly, Free People is one of the few apparel retailers today that understands its customer. Like TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) and Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) know that their core customer is always hunting for deals, Free People knows how much their customer identifies with its central bohemian aesthetic.Free People’s key customer is very specific too: a “26-year-old girl, smart, creative, confident, and comfortable in all aspects of her being, free and adventurous, sweet to tough to tomboy to romantic. A girl who likes to keep busy and push life to its limits, with traveling and hanging out and everything in between,” the company writes on its website.And because the brand understands “her,” Free People’s seasonal collections continually reflect that vibe, a factor that makes it stand out from fast-fashion giants Zara, H&M, and Forever 21, three companies that have severely impacted traditional apparel retailers, and even its sister brand, Urban Outfitters.This intuition, however, has gotten Free People in trouble. Earlier this year, the Coachella music and arts festival announced that it is suing Urban for using the event’s name at Free People in order to sell merchandise. The brand’s retail items in question included things like the “Coachella Boot,” “Coachella Mini Dress,” and “Coachella Valley Tunic.”Coachella Is Suing Urban Outfitters for Using The Festival's Name To Sell Tunics And Boots https://t.co/8f4WDgacMP pic.twitter.com/Mq4X0IuiEr— LAist (@LAist) March 16, 2017In addition to its 120 store boutiques across the country, Free People product is sold in upper-end department stores like Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and Bloomingdales, which is owned by Macy's (M  -  Free Report), both of which have created in-store concept shops to attract shoppers to the brand.How Urban Can CapitalizeWhile it did suffer through a tough fiscal 2017, Free People is on the rebound, and in the last three quarters, the brand has posted positive comparable store sales. The same cannot be said for either the Anthropologie or Urban Outfitters brands. If Urban wants to continue surprising Wall Street like it did yesterday, it should absolutely take advantage of everything Free People offers.In addition to its loyal customers, Free People has mastered the art of social media, where the brand has been able to connect with its customers in a meaningful way. Its Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) account has 3.2 million followers, its Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) account has 255,000 followers, and most notably, its Pinterest account has nearly 570,000 followers.With this type of following, Free People, has been able to cultivate the type of targeted engagement with customers, both old and new, that many retailers strive for. By posting catalog-quality pictures on Instagram, for instance, the company is able to see what products work and which ones don’t.  ???? on the mind. #mooncyclehatA post shared by freepeople (@freepeople) on Aug 14, 2017 at 4:35pm PDTAll of Urban’s core brands are popular on Instagram, with Anthropologie boasting 3 million followers and Urban Outfitters sitting at 7.3 million. What makes Free People stand out is its ability to stay consistent in aesthetic and in product. Urban should take what Free People has learned from its own social media success—targeted knowledge about its customers—and apply it to its other brands.Urban should also consider expanding Free People. Since its stores are much smaller in size compared to the average Urban Outfitters or Anthropologie, one could assume the company would not have to shell out a large amount of cash. This move, however, would be risky, as brick-and-mortar retail sales are in crisis. Over-saturation of the market would also be a concern, since Free People is still considered a covetable brand.But Urban Outfitters needs to do something, and Free People is right there for the taking. It’s one of the most desired brands among young women, with a bustling social media presence that gives its management key information about what designs and merchandise to introduce next. Free People is Urban’s bohemian dream, and has the potential to help boost the company’s bottom line moving forward.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1316,JWN,"Benchmarks ended mixed on Tuesday despite better than expected retail data and a de-escalation in tensions with North Korea. Weaker than expected earnings from Home Depot weighed on the Dow and pared gains for the blue-chip index. However, the Dow ended in the green following gains from American Express and Apple. The S&P 500 ended in the red overall losses in the market because of the slump in the retail sector. The Nasdaq also ended in the negative territory due to broad based losses for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,998.99, advancing 5.28 points or less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 1.23 points to close at 2,464.61. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,333.01, increasing 7.22 points or 0.1%. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,799 to 946. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1,671 to 1,016.Retail Sales Notch Up a Seven Month HighSales at U.S. retailers recorded their biggest increase in seven months in July. Retail sales advanced 0.6% last month, the best performance since a gain of 0.9% last December, according to the Commerce Department. Retail sales jumped 4.2% in the past twelve months, which is near the five-year average. Excluding auto and gasoline, retail sales rose 0.5% in July. In fact, excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales went up 0.6% last month. June’s retails sales were also revised to show a 0.3% gain, in contrast to the previously reported 0.2% decline. May’s retail sales were revised up to show no change instead of the earlier report of a 0.1% dip.The lion’s share of the spurt in July retail sales was attributable to a pickup in demand for autos and to what is now a national event, Amazon Prime Day. The annual event, during which consumers flock to Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) for the year’s best shopping deals, contributed to gains for every product category. The Department of Commerce’s report reflects this as a 1.3% monthly increase in what is categorized as non-store retail spending. But for the sudden spurt in auto sales, other notable movements in the consumer spending report also have crucial linkages with Amazon. For instance, the decline in sales at electronics stores is likely a result of most consumers opting to buy this category of products from online alternatives, possibly Amazon.Amazon Fells the Traditional Retail SectorWhile Amazon did end the day around 0.1% lower, investor attention was largely fixed on the fall in traditional retail stocks. Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corporation KSS and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) declined 2.6%, 1.5%, 1.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) ended the day unscathed, notching up a minor increase of 0.1%.The Dow closed higher for the third day on Tuesday. The blue-chip index notched 45 points earlier in the day. These gains were offset by weak earnings from the retail sector. The biggest drag on the Dow was falling shares of Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report). The home-improvement company cut about 30 points from the Dow. Such a turn of events makes it amply clear that the company is not immune to “Amazonification” despite its status as a leading specialty retailer. This is particularly surprising since Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and professional customers form Home Depot’s core audience. But the move to sell Kenmore devices via Amazon indicates that even the building products behemoth is now susceptible to the rising power of the Kindle and Fire Stick maker. (Read More: Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) Beats on Q2 Earnings & Sales Estimates August 15, 2017)Telecom, Consumer Discretionary Stocks Drag S&P 500 LowerThe S&P 500 declined on Tuesday as the telecom and consumer-discretionary sectors disappointed. Five of the eleven primary sectors ended in the red, led by consumer discretionary. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) was down 0.9%.

1317,JWN,"Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 23.5%.In fact, Dean Foods has missed our estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 8.4%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Dean Foods Company Price and EPS Surprise  Dean Foods Company Price and EPS Surprise | Dean Foods Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Dean Foods will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 30 cents per share, reflecting a 20% year-over-year decline. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.96 billion, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, we note that the stock has underperformed the broader sector in the last one month. The company’s shares have declined 12.5%, while the Consumer Staples sector grew 2.3%.Factors at PlayDean Foods’ performance remains challenged by rising competition and escalated raw milk costs. The company’s business is heavily dependent on commodities such as raw milk, soybeans, diesel fuel and others, the prices of which often fluctuate. Hence, any rise in their prices will hurt margins.Though raw milk prices started declining from Dec 2014, the company witnessed escalated raw milk costs again in first-quarter 2017, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. During the quarter, raw milk costs rose about 6% from fourth-quarter 2016 and jumped 18% from first-quarter 2016.Moreover, the company is facing severe competition from other dairy products suppliers due consolidations in the retail grocery industry.However, contributions from Friendly’s acquisition have been providing a boost to ice cream sales volumes. This is in turn aiding top-line growth. We also applaud the company’s efforts to grow in the organic space, which is evident from its recent deals with Good Karma and Organic Valley as well as the acquisition of Uncle Matt's juices. Further, its focus on cost productivity and growth plans bode well.Additionally, the company remains on schedule with growth and productivity plans, and expects it to ramp up throughout 2017. Management remains committed toward taking strategic steps to optimize capital allocation and concentrate on core business activities. With such strategic initiatives in place, we can hope that Dean Foods would be able to lift its performance.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Dean Foods is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Dean Foods has an Earnings ESP of -13.33% as the Most Accurate estimate of 26 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents per share. While the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corp. (DG  -  Free Report) currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Clorox Co. (CLX  -  Free Report) currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #3.Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.28% and a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1318,JWN,"We expect consumer products company, The Clorox Co. (CLX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 3. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.8%.However, the company has missed our estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 0.6%.Clorox Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Clorox Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Clorox Company (The) QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Clorox will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.49 per share, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 18.3%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.64 billion, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.However, we note that the stock has underperformed the industry in the last one month. The company’s shares have declined 0.7%, while the industry grew 2.9%.Factors at PlayClorox’s potential is visible in its robust outlook, progress on 2020 Strategy, diversified brand portfolio and disciplined capital strategy. The company’s solid brand portfolio places it well in the challenging environment. Further, it remains keen on the execution of 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth and overall market share.While Clorox expects the macroeconomic headwinds to persist going forward, it is all set to counter the hurdles with prudent strategies. The company plans to offset stiff competition with increased brand investments. Further, it is on track with the Go Lean strategy to fight slowing global economies. Moreover, the company aims to keep cost-savings and pricing in place, to battle the expected inflation and increasing commodity pricing.Further, the company anticipates boosting sales and volumes in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 backed by the intense advertising and promotion investments to enhance brand value that were incurred in the fiscal third quarter.  It also envisions EBIT margin to improve in the fourth quarter on the back of lower selling and administrative costs. That said, management remains confident of delivering another year of top-line and bottom-line growth.However, management expects trade promotional investments, along with inflationary pressure and foreign currency headwinds to lead to gross margin deceleration in fiscal 2017.Nonetheless, we believe that Clorox’s growth drivers far outweigh the obstacles and will help the company sustain its impressive momentum.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Clorox is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The Most Accurate estimate is $1.50 per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $1.49.

1319,JWN,"Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc. (HVT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Jul 31. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this retailer of full-service home furnishings will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. It should be noted that the company has posted positive earnings surprises in eight out the last 10 quarters, with a trailing four-quarter average of 17.4%.A look into Haverty Furniture’s stock performance, reveals that its shares have been underperforming the industry for the last six months. In the said time frame, the stock has increased 3.9%, compared with the industry’s growth of 23.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors at Play On Jul 10, the company reported second-quarter sales figures, wherein it recorded improved sales of 1.1% year over year. Though growth was backed by higher average ticket and custom upholstery and accessories sales along with increased internet traffic, it was offset by the sluggish consumer traffic. However, second-quarter sales growth was also much weaker than the preceding quarter’s recorded figure of 3%.Comparable store sales were down 0.2% for the second quarter, weaker than the comparable store sales growth of 1.6% in the first quarter. The company believes that the quarter’s sales were hurt due to a delay in Easter. Haverty Furniture stores remained closed for Easter, which was in April this year versus March last year.Post the adjustment in Easter shift, written comparable store sales for the second quarter were down 0.7%, lower than the 4.5% growth reported last year for full second-quarter 2016. Written sales for the second quarter were up 0.6%, compared with preceding quarter’s written sales growth of 1.0%.Despite sluggish written comparable sales, the company remains encouraged by new merchandises that are expected to flourish stores over the coming weeks through summer. The company believes that business will benefit as housing strengthens in the region and the general economy improves. We also remain encouraged by the solid fundamentals of the company and its solid store expansion plans to strengthen its presence in key markets with additional or repositioned stores. Moreover, the company is making innovations with respect to its technology developments. Also, its shareholder-friendly moves are noteworthy.Which Way Are Estimates Trending?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and 2017 has been declining for the last 30 days. However, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents per share and $1.23 for the second quarter and full-year 2017 reflect a year-over-year decline of 20.8% and 5.8%, respectively.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $191.8 million for the said quarter, down 1.5% from the year-ago period. For 2017, Zacks consensus revenue is pegged at $843.2 million, reflecting a 2.6% year-over-year increase.Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc.

1320,JWN,"On Wednesday, shares of upscale department store Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) are falling, down nearly 5% in afternoon trading after Women’s Wear Daily reported that time is running out for the retailer to secure a formal sale or continue with buyout negotiations.It was just a few months ago that Nordstrom announced exploration plans to go private, sending its stock up 20% as a result. The company explained in a news release that its Co-Presidents Blake Nordstrom, Peter Nordstrom, and Erik Nordstrom, in addition to President of Stores James Nordstrom, Chairman Emeritus Bruce Nordstrom, and Anne Gittinger formed a group, along with a number of independent directors to “explore the possibility of pursing a ‘going-private-transaction.’”The private transaction that was previously being considered would see the group formed by the Nordstrom family acquiring 100% of JWN’s outstanding shares of common stock. At the time, the group had not yet made any formal proposal regarding a potential private transaction.And just last week, Reuters reported that the Nordstrom family was offering preferred equity to potential private-equity partners, naming firms like KKR (KKR  -  Free Report), Apollo Global Management (APO  -  Free Report), and Leonard Green & Partners, in order to fund a buyout.Now, it seems that plans have changed. WWD spoke with various bankers, and while they were originally “hoping to funnel billions of debt into the deal [they are now] getting anxious because the window to do a deal this year is narrowing.”According to one banker, Nordstrom would need to be out of the market by early November for a transaction like this to occur, which “means you have to basically have a deal announced by the beginning of October.""Citing sources, WWD said that Nordstrom is still having conversations with potential buyers, but these discussions are being described as “informal” and “just talks.”Nordstrom has not been able to escape the woes affecting the entire retail industry, especially those afflicting its department store peer Macy’s (M  -  Free Report). Even upper-end retail rival Neiman Marcus, which is private equity-owned, has struggled with debt due to the dominance of online shopping.Nordstrom reportedly hopes to focus and invest more in its e-commerce division and Nordstrom Rack discount chain as a private company, in addition to closing underperforming stores. The retailer also hopes to worry less about quarter-to-quarter trends.Should You Buy?Currently, JWN is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM composite score of ‘A.’ Nordstrom is set to report its next quarterly earnings on August 10 after the bell, and Zacks expects the retailer to post earnings of 61 cents per share on revenues of $3.72 billion. This represents a year-over-year loss of 8.41% and year-over-year growth of 1.94%, respectively.Last quarter, Nordstrom’s earnings were weaker-than-expected. While the company has a solid average earnings surprise of nearly 41%, the company doesn’t expect to grow its earnings on a full-year basis. Weak traffic in its full-line stores has no-doubt hurt contributed to its lack of short-term earnings growth.Looking at its valuation metrics, Nordstrom has a forward P/E of 16.49. While the stock has cheapened over the past year, the company is still more expensive than its overall industry’s P/E of 12.60. Investors, however, have always been willing to pay a little bit more for JWN because of their perceived stature throughout the department store space, and this high-end status will likely continue to work in Nordstrom’s favor.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.
