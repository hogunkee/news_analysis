1,NCLH,"The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite retreated in a volatile market as Trump trade war fears waxed and waned, with Nike (NKE) and bank stocks fueling a Friday rebound. Crude oil prices hit multiyear highs. General Electric (GE), kicked out of the Dow Jones, announced a partial breakup. Amazon.com (AMZN) moves disrupted the pharmacy and shipping industries. Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran. The Trump Administration warned allies that they needed to stop importing Iranian crude by November, according to reports. Meanwhile, a key oil-sands facility in Canada will be shut down until August. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 9.9 million barrels, more than expected, while gasoline supplies rose by 1.2 million barrels, according to weekly Energy Information Administration data. Domestic production was flat last week at 10.9 million barrels per day.General Electric (GE) ended a century-plus run on the Dow Jones industrial average and said it plans to shrink even further. The industrial giant, seeking to pare debt and simplify, will spin off GE Healthcare and divest its majority stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE). After prior, smaller divestitures, GE will now focus on aviation, power and renewable energy. The decisions followed a year-long ""deep dive"" by new CEO John Flannery, a period over which GE stock crumbled in half. Analysts warned of another dividend cut, the second since both the payout and earnings outlook were sliced last year. GE stock rebounded after falling to multiyear lows.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

North America sales rose 3%, bucking three straight quarters of year-over-year declines. The world's largest athletic apparel brand also announced a $15 billion share buyback program. Shares of Nike leapt 11% Friday, hitting a new high.Harley-Davidson faced a double-whammy in the past week, first getting hit with a 25% tariff from the European Union, then getting slammed by President Trump for waving the ""white flag."" The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles.

Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion.

Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue.

Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) shares also dropped as Carnival warned on fuel costs and exchange rates.Paychex (PAYX) retreated from a potential 73.20 buy point after quarterly earnings met and revenue edged past estimates. The payroll and HR services provider expects revenue to grow 6% to 7% in fiscal 2019 and EPS to rise 11%, as it fends off existing and new rivals, such as cloud-based Paycom Software (PAYC).Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a $10 billion buyback and quarterly dividend hike to 44 cents.

14,NCLH,"Cruise ship operator stocks gapped higher Wednesday after Carnival (CCL) reported fiscal-first-quarter earnings that nearly doubled as fuel prices remained low and pricing held steady.""All three (major) cruise operators have been doing pretty well,"" said Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz. ""(There's been a) pretty consistent voice across the industry: Nobody wants to bow to discounting right now. All three want to hold firm on pricing.""Carnival shares rose 5.5% to 52.37 on the stock market today, moving past a 50.01 buy point from a cup-with-handle base to a nine-month high. The stock also notched up above its 200-day moving average.Norwegian Cruise Line Holding (NCLH) jumped 5.7% and remains deep inside an area of consolidation that began in October. Royal Caribbean (RCL) leapt 5.65%, giving shares a more definitive boost above the stock's 50-day line. Royal Caribbean plunged over 15% in early February after offering disappointing guidance.Carnival's Q1 per-share profit jumped 95% to 39 cents a share, topping expectations by 7 cents. Revenue grew over 3% to $3.65 billion, slightly above forecasts for $3.63 billion, marking the second straight quarter of earnings and sales acceleration for the cruise ship operator.Gross cruise costs, including fuel, fell 6% during the quarter on changes in fuel costs and currency exchange rates.Carnival said advance bookings for the rest of 2016 are “well ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices,"" and that since January, booking volumes for the year are ""running ahead of last year's historically high levels at higher prices.""""The risk of having really aggressive discounting come into the picture for them for that big quarter would be much lower than prior to today,"" said Katz, referring to the Q3 peak season, which ends in August. ""We feel like there are a lot of opportunities for the business to grow.""Carnival raised the bottom end of its full-year EPS guidance to $3.20-$3.40, up from a prior outlook for $3.10-$3.40. But the midpoint of the newly updated range still comes in below current expectations for $3.37 a share for the year.It sees Q2 EPS of 34-38 cents vs. views for 38 cents.Certain trends, such as a shift to millennials -- a group that greatly values experiences -- ""bodes very well for travel and leisure companies,"" said Katz, who also highlighted the retiring baby boomer set and an emerging market in China.On March 21, Carnival announced that it had gotten the green light from Cuba to start sailing there, beginning May 1, through its ""impact travel"" brand Fathom. Launched last year, Fathom is part of the new wave of ""voluntourism,"" which allows travelers to sight-see and volunteer at the same time. Its seven-day journeys to Cuba will include a cultural exchange program.Norwegian and Royal Caribbean are said to be expecting to receive approvals in the near future as well.""So far in calendar 2016, pricing trends appear to have remained relatively steady, despite Zika virus headlines and terrorist events in Turkey and Belgium, although the latter may be so recent as to have not yet had any impact on pricing,"" William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia wrote about Carnival on March 23.

Delta shares dropped 1.5%.Savanthi Syth, a vice president of equity research at Raymond James, said in a note that it was too early to tell the impact the attacks will have on air travel but that the attacks came during peak Easter travel and ahead of summer travel.Syth said Ryanair has the greatest exposure to the Brussels market while United has the largest exposure of U.S. carriers followed by Delta.“While domestic U.S. airlines are not directly exposed, there may be knock-on impacts via code-share partners and potential pressure on domestic pricing from any fall off in connecting demand.”Starwood Hotel (HOT) said all of its hotels in the city were on lockdown. Starwood shares dipped 0.4%.Travel stocks had a similar reaction after the Paris attacks last year. But analysts didn’t expect overall travel demand to take a long-term hit.Airlines were busy again within a few weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, the 2002 nightclub bombing in Bali, Indonesia, as well as the transit bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005.Still, the current refugee crisis and ramp-up in the fight against the Islamic State could weigh on travelers’ decisions.

The increase reflects improved pricing in the quarter which was driven by strength in the Caribbean, Bermuda and Alaska itineraries, and partially offset by some softness in Eastern Mediterranean business, the company said in a press release.The company narrowed its guidance range for full-year 2015 adjusted earnings per share to $2.85 to $2.90 from $2.80 to $2.90.

59,NCLH,"Hurricane Irma left millions without power in Florida as it headed toward Georgia as a tropical storm Monday, but wind and rain damage in Miami, Tampa Bay and other major cities wasn't as bad as feared.Insurance stocks saw a boost as the flooding from Irma won't be as bad as the flooding in Houston from Hurricane Harvey two weeks ago, according to Verisk Analytics AIR Worldwide.The analytics modeling company said insured losses from Irma will total $20 billion-$40 billion vs. the more than $65 billion expected from Harvey.Travelers Companies (TRV) shares jumped 2.3% on the stock market today.

60,NCLH,"Stocks held fast to their rebound gains Monday as Asian stock markets launched a global rally that sent broad array of U.S. industries to powerful gains.XA solemn session marked by remembrances of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that left Americans dead in New York, Washington, D.C., and Somerset County, Pa., saw the Dow Jones industrial average lead, rising 1.2%, vs. a 1.1% gains each for the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500.Preliminary data showed trade was below Friday's levels on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq exchanges.Before the U.S. open, markets in Tokyo and Hong Kong clocked substantial rallies, boosted by a shift in Chinese currency regulations and relief that North Korea had not tested either missiles or nuclear bombs over the weekend.  That strength carried over to European trade, which saw benchmarks in Paris and Frankfurt end well over 1% higher.IBD'S TAKE: Finding early stage, top-flight stocks is only part of the investing game. Knowing when to buy, and when to sell are just as import. IBD's CAN SLIM-based investment program tutors you through the start up stages, and provides an arsenal of powerful tools as you progress.In the U.S., insurers were among the early winners, with Dow issue Travelers (TRV) and Progressive (PRG) rising more than 2% as Hurricane Irma softened to tropical storm status. The storm pushed north into Georgia and the southern U.S. leaving more than 6 million Floridians without electricity and large portions of the state wind-strafed and waterlogged, but with much less damage than the severe scenarios for which the markets had braced on Friday.Airlines rebounded: American Airlines Group (AAL) jetted ahead 5%, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Continental Holdings (UAL) bobbed more than 3% each.Cruise line operators also felt some relief trade, with Carnival Cruise (CCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) — both based in Miami — up more than 3% at the end of the day.  Norwegian announced it was sending on of its cruise ships on a relief mission to St. Thomas, to pick up 2,000 tourists stranded the by the storm. It had another fully stocked ship standing by in the Gulf of Mexico, ready to deliver supplies to either Key West or Tampa after the storm passed, according to the Miami Herald.Automakers turned in the Monday's strongest move among industry groups, led by Tesla (TSLA) which snapped more than 5% higher to finish within 2% of a 370.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Tesla had reportedly release a software update to Florida Tesla owners on Saturday, extending slightly the battery charge range of vehicles as an assist to those evacuating ahead of the storm.Apple (AAPL) of course made its splash for the day, thundering ahead 1.7% in rising trade ahead of its annual product release event, scheduled for Tuesday. Apple shares remain in a buy range, above a 156.75 buy point.On the IBD 50 list, Laser maker Coherent (COHR) led, rising nearly 5% in light trade and retaking support at its 50-day moving average. A five-week advance has lifted the stock 18% from an early August low, and up the right side of a two-month cup base.Universal Display (OLED), maker of organic light emitting diodes purportedly used in the new iPhone Apple is expected to introduce on Tuesday, roared ahead more than 3% in strong trade. The move retook a double-bottom base buy point at 127.87, and left the stock in a buy range.RELATED:Insurers Rally As Irma Damage is Limited: 2 RV Makers Hit BuysGoldman: Three Reasons Why The Telecom Merger Party Is On HoldThese Three Leading Stocks May Be Ready To Reward Savvy InvestorsThe Big Picture: Daily, In Depth Market Analysis

Royal Caribbean raised its full-year EPS guidance, citing the Q2 results and ""favorable booking trends.""Carnival Corp. (CCL) rose a fraction in the premarket.The cruise market has benefited from better consumer sentiment, a better economy and lower gas prices, among other things, SunTrust analysts have said.During Norwegian's first-quarter earnings call, the company said that, while it was still early to forecast 2018 performance, ""strong booking and pricing momentum"" had ""extended well into next year."" That momentum was helped by the introduction of Norwegian Bliss, a ship that will serve Alaska starting next year.The company's new Norwegian Joy ship, its first to serve China, is decked out with extra casino and karaoke space. But caution remains about demand and the impact from China's decision to ban tour groups from visiting South Korea, a move that came in response to South Korea's deployment of a U.S. missile defense system.RELATED:Norwegian Cruise Line In Buy Range As Earnings ApproachNorwegian Cruise Line Shows Rising Price Performance With Jump To 87 RS RatingCarnival Beats Q2 Forecasts, Guides Q3 Earnings High

"
97,NCLH,"The $1.2 billion Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth Fund is looking to regain the top-notch form it displayed earlier this year, before the made-in-China sell-off dragged down the overall market.
"
98,NCLH,"The fund, run by Ken Turek for nearly 13 years, was topping 85% of its midcap growth peers over the past 12 months ended Oct. 31, with a 7.55% gain, according to Morningstar Inc.
"
99,NCLH,"That's after the mutual fund slid 7.88% in the past three months, which included the August-September broad market tumble.
"
100,NCLH,"Longer-term, Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth is a top performing mutual fund that has made a lot of money for its investors.
"
101,NCLH,"Over the past five years, the fund's 13.42% average annual gain beat 71% of its direct rivals.
"
102,NCLH,"And like many of his rivals, he got a boost by the October rally with IBD from his office in Chicago.
"
103,NCLH,"IBD: Like a lot of mutual funds, your portfolio endured a challenging third quarter. October's stock market rally brought relief to you. The Q3 culprits seemed to be the China correction, the Federal Reserve delaying its long-promised interest-rate hike and political bashing of drugmakers. Does that square with your account?
"
104,NCLH,"Turek: I think you hit it on the head. From a macro standpoint, the first two points are spot on. Issues in China, the devaluation, caused a lot of uncertainty in global growth and impact on emerging markets.
"
105,NCLH,"It put a lot of questions on the table, especially for U.S. exports.
"
106,NCLH,"And the Fed punting was not well taken by the marketplace.
"
107,NCLH,"From a secular standpoint, health care affected us quite a bit. It started with (Hillary) Clinton's (critical) chatter about drug pricing (being excessive). Then there was piling on by other pundits and politicians. But pricing (criticism) is not a new thing. It's been around, and it will be around. So this too shall pass.
"
108,NCLH,"IBD: You trimmed some health stocks due to the beating that segment was taking, right?
"
109,NCLH,"Turek: We weren't so concerned about the health care services area, like hospitals. Where we trimmed was in a couple of areas: therapeutics and biotech.
"
110,NCLH,"We had success in (those areas). So part of our trimming was profit-taking. Part was due to the uncertainty that the pricing risk to the industry created. We don't know how that will play out. So we more or less across the board trimmed a lot of positions.
"
111,NCLH,"IBD: And by ""therapeutics"" you mean which types of stocks?
"
112,NCLH,"Turek: Specialty pharmaceuticals and biotech. It does not include the Bristol-Myers Squibbs (BMY) of the world. They're too big. There aren't a lot of regular drugmakers in our midcap space. They're too big. We're interested in smaller versions of Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers.
"
113,NCLH,"The smaller companies we focus on are specialized in one or two areas of health care.
"
114,NCLH,"IBD: You like innovators, right?
"
115,NCLH,"Turek: Yes, we look for that whether they're in tech, health care or consumer discretionary.
"
116,NCLH,"We like companies that are doing something unique. If a company has a competitive advantage or a moat, so much the better. The advantage could be something like a new drug or software product. In consumer discretionary, it might be that the company is innovative, like Under Armour (UA), coming out with new products consistently, expanding rapidly as well. A couple of years ago, they only made apparel. Now they're coming out with footwear.
"
117,NCLH,"IBD: In what sectors are you increasing your weights?
"
118,NCLH,"Turek: In October, not much at all. We're watching. Where we're interested in doing that is in tech. And to be quite honest about it: In health care, prices have come down so much that maybe it's overdone. Prices have started to look pretty cheap in the past six to eight weeks.
"
119,NCLH,"So perhaps in the near future, we'll be at a point where interest in that area increases quite a bit.
"
120,NCLH,"We'll pass on some. But we'll get back to others based on fundamentals — companies that are doing something new and innovative, that deserve to be paid for.
"
121,NCLH,"IBD: Do you still like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) despite its recent pullback?
"
122,NCLH,"Turek: We still like it. These guys are best of breed as far as creating the next-generation firewall and security, as opposed to a single-point product provider.
"
123,NCLH,"We don't think anything has changed. And there's still a high degree of need for security spending from all kinds of enterprises and government units as well. That's not necessarily going to abate.
"
124,NCLH,"Competition is vigorous, but Palo Alto has done a good job of being innovative in designing and offering a suite of products to forestall hacking.
"
125,NCLH,"IBD: Describe the attractive innovations of Ultimate Software Group (ULTI).
"
126,NCLH,"Turek: Ultimate is a human-capital management company. Their niche is the marketplace below large companies, companies with 500 to 1,500 employees, which was their sweet spot for a long time.
"
127,NCLH,"They offer cloud-based solutions, so you get continuous updates and upgrades for a suite of products. It makes the cost of ownership affordable, especially for midsize companies that don't necessarily have IT expertise in-house.
"
128,NCLH,"What they've done in the past year is move down-market to companies with between 100 and 500 employees. They're starting at the high end of that. And they're having good success.
"
129,NCLH,"That's going to add to their top-line growth. They have a high retention rate, over 95% if I remember correctly.
"
130,NCLH,"IBD: What innovation by Avago Technologies (AVGO) interests you the most right now?
"
131,NCLH,"Turek: Avago is a fabless semiconductor (company). They outsource manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and others.
"
132,NCLH,"Their big thing is called FBAR, which stands for ""film bulk acoustic resonators."" FBARs are important, as the amount of data and signals from the expansion in the number of wireless phones causes noise. FBARs smooth out the noise and prevent dropped calls.
"
133,NCLH,"As the technology for wireless gets more complicated, more FBARs are needed in each phone.
"
134,NCLH,"But even that won't last forever, so they've bought companies to diversify their business stream.
"
135,NCLH,"IBD: What made IT hardware and software provider CDW's (CDW) earnings per share grow 9%, 19% and 21% the past three stanzas?

136,NCLH,"Turek: CDW is a leading distributor of all things information-related. The value they add is that customers — many of which are small or midsize and don't have a lot of in-house IT expertise — rely on CDW to solve problems. They (do that by partnering) customers with their general sales reps and with sales engineers who are experts in fields like Wi-Fi and routing.

137,NCLH,"IBD: If the U.S. economy is improving, and if car sales are rising, why do consumers need car parts for repairs of older cars? What's the appeal of O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY)?
"
138,NCLH,"Turek: The average age of the U.S. car fleet hasn't changed much in recent years, even as new-car sales have risen.
"
139,NCLH,"What's transforming the company is that they used to sell just to do-it-yourselfers. What the company did was start to sell parts to the professional or do-it-for-you channel. And they've had a lot of success in that. They're not necessarily selling to dealers, although they do. They're selling to mom-and-pop car-repair shops.
"
140,NCLH,"IBD: What is Signet Jewelers' (SIG) innovation?
"
141,NCLH,"Turek: We got interested when they bought a primary competitor, Zales. Signet was a better operator. So the opportunity was that Signet would overlay their management ability on Zales and improve the top and bottom lines of Zales over time.
"
142,NCLH,"They've owned it about a year and have started to have success in those areas. Unlocking the value in Zales was important (to our decision to invest).
"
143,NCLH,"Most recently, this quarter Signet plans their biggest new product introduction ever, a diamond ring called Ever Us, a high-quality diamond ring set that it will roll out across all of their stores. That's unusual. We hope it will be a big product for them in 2015 and into '16.
"
144,NCLH,"IBD: You've increased your stake in Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) in recent disclosures. Why do you like them more than other cruiselines?
"
145,NCLH,"Turek: They attract a slightly higher-end customer, who are less sensitive to price increases and economic shifts as well.
"
146,NCLH,"NCL has a high yield on their ships. They haven't added capacity at the same pace as their competitors, so they're easier to fill for cruises. And, knock on wood, they're accident free, which helps their reputation.
"
147,NCLH,"So recently we've liked their pricing power. It's a better offering than Royal Caribbean (RCL). And (low) oil prices have been a tailwind. Plus, they face new opportunities. They're eager to see what happens to Cuba. And now China is opening to cruisers. These should aid NCL and the industry.
"
148,NCLH,"IBD: Why have you boosted your stake in Alaska Air Group (ALK) rather than some other airline?
"
149,NCLH,"Turek: These guys are really good operators. They started as a West Coast airline. Now they're going transcontinental and midcontinental. They have really good financials, good return on equity, good free cash flow, good customer satisfaction levels. They're growing in the low double digits for the next couple of years. And it's a joy to listen to them talk about their business. They're having fun.
"
150,NCLH,"IBD: Why did you start a stake in Tyler Technologies (TYL) this year?
"
151,NCLH,"Turek: We started it in June or July, I think. It came from something my analyst had talked about. They're a leader in providing financial and ERP (enterprise resource planning) software to local and state governments.
"
152,NCLH,"A lot of those governments are behind in technology, compared with private enterprises, so there's a need for them to modernize a lot of their systems.
"
153,NCLH,"Tyler was a leader in the criminal justice area and has branched out into other areas like appraisal, taxes, public safety and vital records. Governments are getting that moving from legacy paper-based records to cloud-based records makes records easier to manage and makes things easier for us as consumers of public records.
"
154,NCLH,"You wouldn't think it's a great market, but it is, even with the headwind of a lack of financing.
"
155,NCLH,"IBD: Why have you been edging up your stake in Acuity Brands (AYI), a maker of lighting products?
"
156,NCLH,"Turek: This is a play on energy efficiency in nonresidential areas. It's not wholly dependent on new construction. A lot of it is retrofitting. They replace a lot of old fluorescent lights with LEDs, which save energy — money — for owners of those businesses.Best Mutual Funds 2015: October Performance ReportThe $1.2 billion Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth Fund is looking to regain the top-notch form it displayed earlier this year, before the made-in-China sell-off dragged down the overall market.The fund, run by Ken Turek for nearly 13 years, was topping 85% of its midcap growth peers over the past 12 months ended Oct. 31, with a 7.55% gain, according to Morningstar Inc.That's after the mutual fund slid 7.88% in the past three months, which included the August-September broad market tumble.Longer-term, Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth is a top performing mutual fund that has made a lot of money for its investors.Over the past five years, the fund's 13.42% average annual gain beat 71% of its direct rivals.And like many of his rivals, he got a boost by the October rally with IBD from his office in Chicago.IBD: Like a lot of mutual funds, your portfolio endured a challenging third quarter. October's stock market rally brought relief to you. The Q3 culprits seemed to be the China correction, the Federal Reserve delaying its long-promised interest-rate hike and political bashing of drugmakers. Does that square with your account?Turek: I think you hit it on the head. From a macro standpoint, the first two points are spot on. Issues in China, the devaluation, caused a lot of uncertainty in global growth and impact on emerging markets.It put a lot of questions on the table, especially for U.S. exports.And the Fed punting was not well taken by the marketplace.From a secular standpoint, health care affected us quite a bit. It started with (Hillary) Clinton's (critical) chatter about drug pricing (being excessive). Then there was piling on by other pundits and politicians. But pricing (criticism) is not a new thing. It's been around, and it will be around. So this too shall pass.IBD: You trimmed some health stocks due to the beating that segment was taking, right?Turek: We weren't so concerned about the health care services area, like hospitals. Where we trimmed was in a couple of areas: therapeutics and biotech.We had success in (those areas). So part of our trimming was profit-taking. Part was due to the uncertainty that the pricing risk to the industry created. We don't know how that will play out. So we more or less across the board trimmed a lot of positions.IBD: And by ""therapeutics"" you mean which types of stocks?Turek: Specialty pharmaceuticals and biotech. It does not include the Bristol-Myers Squibbs (BMY) of the world. They're too big. There aren't a lot of regular drugmakers in our midcap space. They're too big. We're interested in smaller versions of Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers.The smaller companies we focus on are specialized in one or two areas of health care.IBD: You like innovators, right?Turek: Yes, we look for that whether they're in tech, health care or consumer discretionary.We like companies that are doing something unique. If a company has a competitive advantage or a moat, so much the better. The advantage could be something like a new drug or software product. In consumer discretionary, it might be that the company is innovative, like Under Armour (UA), coming out with new products consistently, expanding rapidly as well. A couple of years ago, they only made apparel. Now they're coming out with footwear.IBD: In what sectors are you increasing your weights?Turek: In October, not much at all. We're watching. Where we're interested in doing that is in tech. And to be quite honest about it: In health care, prices have come down so much that maybe it's overdone. Prices have started to look pretty cheap in the past six to eight weeks.So perhaps in the near future, we'll be at a point where interest in that area increases quite a bit.We'll pass on some. But we'll get back to others based on fundamentals — companies that are doing something new and innovative, that deserve to be paid for.IBD: Do you still like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) despite its recent pullback?Turek: We still like it. These guys are best of breed as far as creating the next-generation firewall and security, as opposed to a single-point product provider.We don't think anything has changed. And there's still a high degree of need for security spending from all kinds of enterprises and government units as well. That's not necessarily going to abate.Competition is vigorous, but Palo Alto has done a good job of being innovative in designing and offering a suite of products to forestall hacking.IBD: Describe the attractive innovations of Ultimate Software Group (ULTI).Turek: Ultimate is a human-capital management company. Their niche is the marketplace below large companies, companies with 500 to 1,500 employees, which was their sweet spot for a long time.They offer cloud-based solutions, so you get continuous updates and upgrades for a suite of products. It makes the cost of ownership affordable, especially for midsize companies that don't necessarily have IT expertise in-house.What they've done in the past year is move down-market to companies with between 100 and 500 employees. They're starting at the high end of that. And they're having good success.That's going to add to their top-line growth. They have a high retention rate, over 95% if I remember correctly.IBD: What innovation by Avago Technologies (AVGO) interests you the most right now?Turek: Avago is a fabless semiconductor (company). They outsource manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and others.Their big thing is called FBAR, which stands for ""film bulk acoustic resonators."" FBARs are important, as the amount of data and signals from the expansion in the number of wireless phones causes noise. FBARs smooth out the noise and prevent dropped calls.As the technology for wireless gets more complicated, more FBARs are needed in each phone.But even that won't last forever, so they've bought companies to diversify their business stream.IBD: What made IT hardware and software provider CDW's (CDW) earnings per share grow 9%, 19% and 21% the past three stanzas?Turek: CDW is a leading distributor of all things information-related. The value they add is that customers — many of which are small or midsize and don't have a lot of in-house IT expertise — rely on CDW to solve problems. They (do that by partnering) customers with their general sales reps and with sales engineers who are experts in fields like Wi-Fi and routing.IBD: If the U.S. economy is improving, and if car sales are rising, why do consumers need car parts for repairs of older cars?

158,NCLH,"The major stock indexes reversed lower Tuesday, but damage was minimal, after a quote from President Trump about the North Korea situation rattled markets.Speaking to reporters at his New Jersey golf club, he said North Korea threats will be met with ""fire and fury like the world has never seen."" The latest development out of North Korea is that the country has created a small nuclear weapon that can fit in its missiles, according to published reports.XAt the close, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 lost 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.15%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in above Monday's levels in the stock market today.Apple (AAPL) outperformed in the Dow, rising 0.8% to 160.08. Nasdaq 100 leaders included Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) and Tesla (TSLA) with gains of 5% and 3% respectively. Apple recently gapped up out of a base last week with a 156.75 buy point after reporting solid earnings. It's still in buy range.During the regular session, Twilio (TWLO) gapped up over an aggressive entry of 32.33 after reporting strong earnings. Shares jumped 10% to 33.58. The enterprise software firm shows strong sales growth in recent quarters, but the company isn't profitable yet, partly due to heavy R&D spending.Inside the IBD 50, Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) gapped above its 50-day moving average after reporting earnings before the open.

162,NCLH,"Forecasts for an improving economy and low gas prices should result in a busy summer for the U.S. tourism industry and a bullish outlook for companies that make money on free-spending vacationers.One of the likely beneficiaries is Marriott Vacations Worldwide (VAC). It develops, markets, sells and manages vacation ownership and related products — aka timeshares — under the Marriott Vacation Club, Grand Residences by Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Destination Club brands.Although Marriott Vacations Worldwide isn't as tied to macro factors as other travel-related stocks such as airlines, hotel operators and cruise lines, it still gets a lift when times are good.""The numbers in terms of people driving, as well as the forecasts for air travel, are back to pre-2008-09 levels. That bodes well for us,"" Chief Financial Officer John Geller told IBD. ""Going into the summer, we are optimistic and the trends are good.""Reflecting that optimism, Marriott Vacations Worldwide stock hit a record high of 89.85 on May 28 and is up about 18% this year.It is one of a number of stocks in IBD's Leisure-Services group to hit new highs in recent weeks. The group ranks No. 35 of 197 industries tracked and has moved steadily higher over the past six months.Other leaders in the group are a diverse mix that includes cruise operator Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH), sports and entertainment company Madison Square Garden (MSG) and fellow timeshare company Interval Leisure Group (IILG).The Price Of ParadiseMarriott Vacations, which was spun off from Marriott International (MAR) in November 2011, has 59 resorts worldwide. In coming quarters, it will open new resorts in San Diego, Miami Beach and Hawaii.The company competes with the vacation ownership divisions of hotel rivals such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT), Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT), Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) and Hyatt Hotels (H).Marriott Vacations Worldwide plays in the high end of the market. The company's average first-time buyer spends $30,000 to $35,000 for the ability to stay a week each year — perpetually — at a two-bedroom, two-bath vacation home in locations such as Orlando, Fla., and Hilton Head, S.C.That compares with an average sales price of about $20,000 industrywide, according to data from the American Resort Development Association (ARDA), a timeshare trade association.It sounds like a lot of money until you start doing the math, says ARDA CEO Howard Nusbaum.""It's not like real estate in the sense that you don't make money flipping it,"" he told IBD. ""Your value comes from your use of the property. If you spend $3,000 a year for vacations, in 10 years you spent $30,000.""With a timeshare, you might spend that much and get a lifetime's worth of vacations, Nusbaum says.About half of Marriott Vacation Worldwide's revenue comes from contract sales to customers. It gets about 20% from resort management and other income, including what comes from some ancillary businesses like food and beverage, spas and golf courses, in addition to management fees.Another 20% comes from renting out unsold units. The remaining 10% comes from providing financing to customers, most of whom can't get timeshare loans from traditional lenders.For most of its three-plus years as a standalone company, Marriott Vacation Worldwide's revenue growth has hovered in the single digits. That's primarily because it spent its early years focusing on operating efficiently rather than growing rapidly.""Coming out of the spin-off, our focus was really about improving margins and looking at how to operate as a standalone company,"" CFO Geller said. ""We were less concerned about driving top-line growth.""From Crisis To CruisingMeanwhile, the timeshare industry itself was still emerging from the beating that it took in 2008-09, when the recession and financial crisis made it all but impossible for many Americans to get timeshare loans.Normally, the industry isn't that vulnerable to economic swings. That's because travelers who own timeshares don't have to worry about coming up with money for a place to stay. But the downturn of 2008-09 was different because ""the financing dried up overnight,"" Nusbaum said. Industry revenue fell by nearly half.""Timeshare companies couldn't get loans, so they couldn't offer loans to customers,"" he said. ""We had 20 years of double-digit growth, but the 2008-09 downturn was very humbling.""With those problems behind the industry, it is now back to double-digit growth, he says.As for Marriott Vacations Worldwide, it has moved into a new phase where it can put more focus on top-line growth. During the first quarter, it posted a 13% year-over-year revenue increase — its biggest gain since going public.""In the first quarter, we started to ramp up our marketing efforts,"" Geller said. ""We shifted our focus more to first-time buyers.""First-time buyers account for only about 40% of the company's contract sales, he says. The rest comes from sales to existing owners looking to upgrade or add to their portfolios.""We want to get that to more of a 50/50 ratio,"" Geller said.In the first quarter, Marriott Vacations Worldwide posted total revenue of $454.9 million, up from $401.9 million a year earlier. Total company contract sales climbed 23% to $198.4 million, while earnings rose 52% to 85 cents a share, as calculated on a diluted basis, topping the consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Renting 'Experiences' Pays OffMarriott Vacations Worldwide describes its points system, which members use to choose resorts and ""pay"" for stays, as a ""flexible 'vacation currency.'""And the company has added not only resorts but also things like cruises, guided tours and ""experiences"" that range from ski trips to golf excursions.""As we have been able to put our Destination Club in place — and it's really gotten a lot of traction — keep in mind that when our owners decide that they want to use their Vacation Club points for something other than staying in one of our resorts, whether they want to take a cruise or they want to take a tour or go to the Masters or whatever, they give us back those points for the year,"" CEO Steve Weisz said on the company's Q1 conference call in May. ""We turn around and take them into the open market, and we rent them. So that drives the revenue side of things.""If it all works right,"" Weisz said, ""we actually make a little bit in the arbitrage between what we rent it for and what we have to pay for the cost to fulfill the particular thing that they asked for, whether it be the cruise or the trip.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company's full-year EPS to rise 19% in 2015 and another 16% in 2016.""As the economy improves and wealth improves, demand for people going on vacation increases both in terms of the duration of their breaks, the number of breaks, and how much they're spending on different amenities like timeshares,"" MKM Partners analyst Christopher Agnew told IBD. ""That should be good for the industry.""

180,NCLH,"The Nasdaq composite led the major averages lower, undercutting its 50-day moving average amid President Trump's fiery rhetoric on North Korea and negative reactions to earnings and other corporate news.XWalt Disney (DIS) announced a split with Netflix (NFLX), while Priceline (PCLN) gave weak guidance while Macy's (M) and other department stores crashed. Snap (SNAP) missed on everything, sending shares lower. Nvidia (NVDA) had blowout numbers, but priced-for-perfection shares fell.

The Dow industrials dipped 1.1% after setting a record high Tuesday. A number of leading stocks undercut recent buy points or key support levels. The CBOE Volatility Index, the market's fear gauge, neared a nine-month high after sinking to an all-time low in late July. Trump's threat to wreck ""fire and fury"" on North Korea, which continues to make nuclear and missile advances, unnerved investors, but earnings and corporate news may have had a bigger effect.RELATED:S&P 500, Nasdaq Break Support: 4 Steps You Should Take NowBig Picture: Market Uptrend Is Under PressureWalt Disney (DIS) will end its movie distribution deal with Netflix (NFLX) in 2019, saying it'll create its own video-on-demand subscription service in the U.S. Disney won't pull TV shows from Netflix, and an ongoing Marvel-Netflix collaboration will continue. Still, the move could force Netflix to spend more on its own content, notably big-ticket films. Netflix fell 4.9%, nearly returning to its July breakout buy point before a Friday bounce. Meanwhile, Disney, which reported mixed Q2 results, said its planned ESPN streaming service will start in early 2018, not by the end of 2017. Disney sank 5.3%, hitting an eight-month low.RELATED:Netflix Fall Continues Over End Of Disney Movie Deal Key Facts: What Disney's Rogue Move Means For Netflix SubscribersNvidia (NVDA) earned 92 cents a share, up 124% year over year, on sales of $2.23 billion, up 56%, in the quarter ended July 30. Analysts expected 70 cents and $1.96 billion. For the current quarter, the graphics-chip maker expects sales to rise 18% to $2.35 billion, vs. the consensus of $2.13 billion. Nvidia cited strong chip sales for video game devices, data centers and artificial intelligence applications, though some analysts said data center revenue was a little light. Shares fell 5.3% on Friday after sinking 4.3% on Thursday ahead of results.RELATED:Nvidia Earnings Crush Views, Guidance Bullish, But Stock DivesThe Snapchat operator reported a wider-than-expected adjusted per-share loss, while revenue, user growth and average revenue per user all was weaker than forecast. Snap (SNAP) crashed 14.1% on Friday, hitting record lows. Snap added just 7 million users in Q2 as Facebook (FB) successfully clones Snapchat offerings, notably via Instagram Stories.Snap Fell Short On Just About Every Metric In Q2; Stock CrashesMacy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) reported stronger-than-expected Q2 earnings and sales, but all three tumbled during Thursday's regular session amid longer-term concerns about midtier, mall-based big-box retailers in the face of Amazon (AMZN) and discounters. Macy's crashed to its worst levels since September 2010. Dillard's (DDS) reported a surprise loss, sending its stock plunging. Nordstrom just edged higher Friday after its solid late Thursday results. JCPenney (JCP), which already fell sharply Thursday, crashed 16.8% on Friday to record lows after reporting a wider-than-expected loss and weaker-than-expected same-store sales.RELATED:Nordstrom Beats But Rival Chains Plunge As Sales Keep FallingJ.C. Penney Stock Sinks As Second-Quarter Loss MissesPriceline (PCLN) Q2 earnings beat views and its revenue matched. But the online travel booking site sees Q3 EPS of $31.70 to $33.40 vs. Wall Street estimates of $34.42. Its bookings growth estimate was also light. TripAdvisor (TRIP) Q2 earnings also beat analyst expectations and revenue was in line. Non-hotel revenue climbed 31% as airline traffic growth continues to outpace GDP, but hotel revenue fell 12% as room rental companies like Airbnb gain ground. Priceline fell 8.8, tumbling below a buy point and its 50-day line. TripAdvisor rose 6.8%.RELATED:Priceline Shares Drop As Earnings Outlook Falls ShortSina (SINA), Weibo (WB), NetEase (NTES), YY (YY) and Autohome (ATHM) reported better-than-expected earnings for the June quarter. NetEase crashed through its 50-day line. YY dipped Thursday in a wild session, but was up nicely so far this week. Auto info site Autohome soared on its results. But Sina, which owns a controlling stake in Weibo, reversed lower, undercutting Monday's breakout. Weibo also retreated, but held above its own entry. China cracked on social media hit the Twitter-like service as well as Sina, Tencent (TCEHY) and Baidu (BIDU).The Trade Desk (TTD) said second-quarter adjusted earnings were 52 cents a share, up 136% from a year ago, with revenue rising 54% to $72.8 million. Analysts expected The Trade Desk to report earnings of 19 cents on sales of $68 million. The provider of automated advertising technology, which competes against Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL), guided Q3 and full-year revenue estimates higher. Trade Desk IPO'd in September at 18, saw a first-day pop of 67% and peaked at 57.87 in late July.

The optical device maker reported in-line Q2 profit but revenue was light amid weakness in the company's North America business as well as China. Lumentum management said it has $200 million in orders for 3D devices in calendar 2017 and manufacturing yields have been solid. One question, though is how much Apple business Lumentum will potentially share with Germany's AMS, Finisar (FNSR) and II-VI (IIVI). Lumentum said China's inventory correction could last until the December quarter.Drug and biotech earnings were a mixed bag with Perrigo (PRGO), Horizon Pharma (HZNP), Kite Pharma (KITE) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) topping views while Mylan (MYL), Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) lagged second-quarter expectations. Valeant and Mylan cut their guidance, while Perrigo, Horizon and Ionis (IONS) boosted pieces of their full-year outlook. Meanwhile, Tesaro (TSRO) beat on the top line, but reported wider-than-expected losses. In other news, Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) hit a two-year high after bumping up its timeline to file applications for two cholesterol-lowering treatments.Wendy's (WEN) second-quarter results topped Street estimates, with Stephens analysts attributing the strong showing to its value 4 for $4 meals and marketing of fresh, never-frozen beef in its hamburgers. Jack in the Box (JACK) same-store sales came in better than expected, but some analysts hope the chain can reclaim customers with a bigger push on cheap combo offerings and other deals. The company also continued to weigh whether to sell, or do something else with, Qdoba, its Mexican chain. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) beat on the top and bottom line. McDonald's (MCD) set its sights on China, forming a partnership that will aim to expand the number of locations there to 4,500 from 2,500.Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) reported second-quarter EPS growth of 20% with revenue up 13% to $13.441 billion, both better than expected. The cruise line operator's stock popped to a record 61.48 intraday Tuesday, but fell 0.2% to 56.77 for the week amid plans for a stock offering on behalf of existing shareholders.Tesla (TSLA) said it's developing a self-driving semi-truck, with ""platooning"" abilities on long-haul trips. Tesla, which said in the prior week that might issue new debt to fund the Model 3 rollout, said it would sell $1.5 billion in debt. Tesla shares rose 0.2%.Blue Apron (APRN) lost 47 cents a share, worse than expected, in its first quarterly report since going public. Revenue rose 18% to $238.1 million, beating views, but showing slowing growth. The meal kit provider's customer base fell 9% quarter-over-quarter as competitors expand and Amazon (AMZN) looms. Blue Apron is cutting market spending, which is not a great sign for attracting customers. Shares crashed 12.2% for the week, hitting a record low.Planet Fitness (PLNT) reported Q2 EPS that rose 29% to 22 cents, beating by 3 cents, on a 17% revenue gain to $107.3 million, above views for $102 million. Systemwide same-store sales grew 9%. The gym operator also raised guidance for full-year earnings, revenue and comp sales. Planet Fitness broke out past a 24.68 buy point on Thursday, but pulled back modestly to 24.55 on Friday.Shares of Zillow Group (Z) fell 9.5% after the online real estate portal swung to a Q2 adjusted profit, but website traffic slowed and the company forecast September-quarter sales below expectations.

223,NCLH,"Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter: @IBD_DChung.Growth stocks rallied and the major indexes clawed back more of Friday's punishing decline. The S&P 500 rose 1% and was near session highs. The Dow industrials outperformed slightly, up nearly 1.2% as all but one of the 30 components rallied. The Nasdaq was up nearly 1%. Volume shrank sharply vs. day-ago levels following Friday's ""quadruple witching"" day of expiring options and futures, according to preliminary data.On Friday, the 500 dropped 1.6%, the Nasdaq 1.4%.In the stock market today, automaker, education software, basic chemicals, apparel manufacturing, wireless telecom services, super regional bank and apparel and shoe retail stocks advanced smartly as each group ran at least 1% higher. But biotech, metal ores and gold mining stocks struggled, each down nearly 1%. Gold futures scraped nearly half a percent lower.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) helped lead the security software group higher, rising more than 2% in fast trading to 188.90. That gain left the current member of IBD Leaderboard now less than 7% below a 200.55 high.Palo Alto is also now in Week 9 of a potential cup-shaped base. Its last major breakout took place in May last year, when it surged past a 72.60 buy point in a double-bottom base.

224,NCLH,"Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) is building a new base, the latest in a series that has generated stairstep progress over the past year.

The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced more than 0.8%.XVolume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges vs. the same time in Monday's session.Among small caps, the day's leaders included restaurant chain Wingstop (WING), up 2% as it broke out of a consolidation; veterinary-products developer Heska (HSKA), up 1.2%; manufactured-home maker Cavco Industries (CVCO), up more than 3%; and insulation provider Installed Building Products (IBP), up nearly 3%.Wingstop was discussed in an IBD online article Monday.In the large cap S&P 500, Michael Kors (KORS) gapped up 19% in huge volume.  The luxury apparel maker's fiscal Q1 earnings dropped 11% vs. the year-ago quarter but topped the Street's consensus estimate by 29%. The fiscal year ends in March.Kors delivered big earnings increases in 2010-15, but nudged up earnings only 9% in fiscal 2016 and saw earnings decline in fiscal 2017. Michael Kors' monthly chart shows two price waves down since February 2014. The first wave bottomed in January 2016. A rebound peaked in March 2016, and the second wave bottomed in May of this year.Blue chips were mostly up, though the gains were generally small. Apple (AAPL) led the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average with a 1.6% thrust. Apple recently cleared a consolidation. The buy point was 156.75. Apple's fiscal year ends in September. Analysts expect earnings growth to roll in at 8% this fiscal year and then increase 20% in fiscal 2018.In the Nasdaq 100, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) scored a 7% gain in torrid volume.

226,NCLH,"Cruise line operator Carnival (CCL) topped fiscal second-quarter forecasts on Thursday and gave upbeat Q3 guidance.Estimates: EPS down 4% to 47 cents, with revenue up 4.5% to $3.87 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS of 52 cents on revenue of $3.94 billion as gross revenue yields increased 2.7%. In constant currency, net revenue yields grew 5.1%, above the company's March guidance for % growth.Outlook: Q3 EPS of $2.16-2.20, above consensus views for $2.14, and full-year EPS is now seen at $3.60-3.70, up from a prior view of $3.50-3.70 though the new midpoint is still below the Wall Street view of $3.67. Net revenue yields in constant currency are seen up 4% in Q3 and 3.5% for the year.Stock: Shares fell 1.1% to 65.69 on the stock market today. The stock is above buy range after breaking out in March. Royal Caribbean (RCL) retreated 1.55% to 112.15, while Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) climbed 1% to 55.46. Norwegian's stock is making its way through a cup base.Prior to Carnival's earnings, SunTrust analyst Patrick Scholes said he expected demand for leisure travel to hold up in part due to low gas prices and higher consumer sentiment.Carnival would also still be able to send ships to Cuba, even as the President Trump turns away from Obama administration measures intended to thaw relations and trade with the nation.""As is so often the case, current events (South Korea travel ban, U.S./Cuba trade relations, UK terror) are weighing on the minds of cruise investors,"" Wedbush analyst James Hardiman said in a research note last week.""However, pricing data, travel agent commentary, and anecdotes from management would all seem to support a markedly healthy and improving supply/demand environment on a global basis.""RELATED:These Four Spotlight Stocks Are Cruising Close To Buy PointsRoyal Caribbean Sails Into Profit-Taking Zone On Strong Earnings
"
227,NCLH,"Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Broadcom (AVGO) are three stocks that show why $1.7 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) is smart for using two oars rather than just one.The fund's management is divvied up between two teams, one tilting toward value-oriented stock, the other toward growth stocks. Last year, when the postelection Trump Bump lifted value-oriented stocks like energy and financials, bets in those sectors boosted the fund's value-oriented sleeve. This year it's the growth sleeve's turn to shine brighter.And with year-to-date gains of 34% for both Amazon and Facebook and 39% for Broadcom going into Thursday, those stocks have added octane to the growth sleeve's fuel. So have consumer discretionary names like Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH). And likewise for health care names like Hologic (HOLX) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).The fund aims for a 60%-40% split in assets between its growth and value sleeves. ""That split makes sense in achieving a core fund experience for our shareholders,"" said USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the teams running the two sleeves. Subadvisors from Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss run the value sleeve. An in-house team from USAA mans the growth sleeve.Most of the fund's dividend comes from the Barrow Hanley sleeve.The tandem arrangement has resulted in a 23.46% return over the 12 months going into Thursday, topping 95% of its large-cap-blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 was up 19.06%.So far this year, the fund is up 9.74% vs. 8.82% for its peer group and 9.86% for the big-cap bogey.John Jares, who runs the growth sleeve along with John Toohey, likes Amazon's strength in retail and web services. ""It's referred to as Hurricane Amazon because it's so disruptive,"" he said. Amazon Web Services' operating margin soared to 24.3% as of the first quarter, up from 3.8% in 2014. It's expected to hit 29% by the end of 2017, he says. With AWS' profit growing much faster than the overall company's, the overall company's operating margin will be pulled up by AWS, Jares adds. And its rapidly growing free cash flow will give the company ""more ammunition to invest against any of its competitors,"" he said.He's less enthused about Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods Market (WFM), wondering what role it will play in Amazon's future.His team is crunching numbers to decide whether investors have oversold other grocery chains. The fund also owns Kroger (KR).Jares likes the way Facebook has become a magnet for advertising dollars, largely by providing advertisers with sharper targeting of consumers. ""They can see the effectiveness of ad campaigns,"" Jares said. And Facebook can post additional ads at minimal cost. ""That's what attracted us to the stock,"" he said.The stock is trading around 153. Jares says 200 is not out of the range of possibility.A third cruise ship line that the fund owns is Carnival (CCL). ""The cruise lines have been on a tear this year,"" he said, referring to all three of his cruise ship stocks. ""Because of improved demand, they've had better pricing. Last year, there were problems from terrorism in Europe, fears about the Zika virus. With the improvement in employment and the future economic outlook of the U.S., cruise lines have seen rising demand. Plus, they've enjoyed easy comps (earnings comparisons) from last year.""Royal Caribbean is up 39% so far this year. Earnings per share grew 13%, 31% and 74% the past three quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Royal Caribbean ranks No. 3 in the Leisure-Services industry group. It has four straight years of annual earnings per share growth. Norwegian ranks No. 6 in the group. You can compare the two stocks fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy to use Stock Checkup tool.Norwegian, trading around 55, is up 29% this year. The stock is within its buy range for investors looking for optimal entry points.In health care, Jares says his team likes Hologic because relatively new CEO Stephen MacMillan is shifting the company to a faster growth profile serving female health, diagnostics and aesthetics.The team's view of UnitedHealth is that investors have underappreciated its Optum division, which includes a number of fast-growing ancillary businesses that improve the effectiveness of their standard insurance business.Building materials maker Owens Corning (OC), in the Barrow Hanley sleeve, is up 30% this year. EPS grew 9% and 60% the past two quarters. The stock has been driven by the housing rebound and strength in the U.S. economy.Michael Nayfa, a manager of the Barrow Hanley sleeve, said, ""Underlying fundamentals remain strong in the roofing and composite businesses, and the insulation business looks set to recover in 2017 as housing starts remain below normal and pricing is picking up. OC remains an attractive value trading at 14 times normalized earnings with a 1.2% dividend yield.""RELATED: Microsoft would surpass Amazon Web ServicesUSAA Growth & Income Fund Shows Two Heads Are Better Than OneHow To Turn A Glass Of Wine Into A $173,000 Bump In Your IRA

The company also announced a stock buyback of $500 million.Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) rose nearly 2% as it breaks out past the 52.60 buy point of a flat base. It reports quarterly results May 10. Carnival (CCL) rose 1.1% to a new high in active trading.Grubhub (GRUB) initially jumped, but was little changed heading into the close. Grubhub surged 23% following strong quarterly results, pushing the meal-delivery app slightly above the 42.35 buy point of double-bottom base. Volume was tracking well above the average.Align Technology (ALGN) soared 12.5% to a record high after the maker of invisible dental braces beat Q1 earnings expectations and the company gave a sunny outlook.

330,NCLH,"XLate-session declines whittled Wednesday's moderate gains to a weak finish.Earnings disappointments were the leading culprit, gnawing away at the week's early momentum and grinding the Dow Jones industrial average's early 0.4% gain to a 0.1% decline. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also shredded their gains, the Nasdaq ending flat and the S&P 500 down less than 0.1%.All the indexes remained firmly positive for the week.Compared to busy sessions Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday's action was comparatively quiet, with preliminary data showing trade slightly higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq.At either end of the Dow industrials, United Technologies (UTX) rose nearly 2% and Procter & Gamble (PG) dropped 2%, both on quarterly results. United Tech remained in a buy range, 3% above a flat base buy point of 114.54. More than half of the Dow's stocks traded higher, with Verizon (VZ), Home Depot (HD) and Travelers (TRV) also posting gains of around 1%.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) easily led the S&P 500, pulsing more than 10% higher after reporting that strength in U.S. heart-valve replacements helped power a 32% first-quart earnings gain and a 27% rise in sales. Both numbers clobbered analyst expectations. The move hoisted shares back above the 40-week moving average as Edwards works on the right side of a six-month consolidation.Gains were more modest on the Nasdaq, led by a 3% advance by Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH). The gain put shares narrowly above a 52.60 buy point in two-month long a flat base.The low end of the Nasdaq was a different story, with Seagate Technologies (STX) gouging out a 16% loss. The maker of computer hard drives posted a 400% EPS gain, above analyst targets. But a 3% revenue advance stopped short of expectations. The loss sent shares below their 10-week moving average in heavy trade, triggering a sell signal.Hard-drive peer Western Digital (WDC) slipped 3% in strong trade. It reports earnings after the market closes on Thursday.The Leisure–Lodging group posted the strongest gain among industries as Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) spiked 9% to a record higher after turning in a powerful first-quarter performance and raising its full-year guidance. Shares ended the session 16% above a 86.82 buy point in a flat base.A heavy after hours reporting session Wednesday is scheduled to include reports from Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Xylinx (XLNX), Amgen (AMGN), Equinix (EQIX) and others.RELATED:Trump Unveils Sweeping Tax Cut Plan; JPMorgan Says It Is 'Impossible'Las Vegas Sands Reports Late With Casino Stocks On A Hot Streak

344,NCLH,"The cruise ship industry has had its share of negative headlines and public relations headaches in recent years. The Ebola scare triggered a four-week sell-off in cruise line operators in October.In December, a fire aboard Norwegian Cruise Line's (NCLH) ship Insignia while docked in St. Lucia canceled a 10-day trip and took the ship out of commission for nine weeks.In February 2013, an engine fire in a Carnival (CCL) ship disabled the vessel in the Gulf of Mexico, stranding passengers and resulting in unsanitary conditions.One month later, more than 100 passengers on Royal Caribbean's (RCL) Vision of the Seas ship came down with norovirus, a highly contagious stomach bug.But the industry is back on its feet amid improving fundamentals, partly due to lower oil prices. Fuel costs account for roughly 30% of operating expenses in the cruise industry.Norwegian, with a Composite Rating of 97, is much smaller than industry titans Carnival (70) and Royal Caribbean (78), but smaller can sometimes mean a more compelling growth story, and that's the case with Norwegian.Norwegian went public in January 2013 at 19.When the company reported fourth-quarter results last month, earnings per share just missed expectations but still soared 89% from a year ago. Sales jumped 31% to $788.9 million. In the earnings release, new CEO Frank Del Rio said that recent weeks of the January to March promotional ""wave"" season saw ""a significant acceleration in booking volume.""Del Rio came over from Prestige Cruise Holdings, which Norwegian acquired in November. It paid $3 billion for eight small luxury cruise ships as part of its strategy to pursue a higher-end demographic.Two 4,000-passenger vessels for Norwegian — the Getaway and Breakaway — have been big hits with customers. Meanwhile, the first of its four Breakaway Plus ships, with 4,200 passenger berths, is expected to start service out of Miami in late 2015.Norwegian recently cleared a second-stage base with a 48.26 buy point. It first broke out in the week ended Feb. 20 and followed through last week, rising 3%.As of Monday's close, it was 5% above the buy point, at the high end of a buy range.

346,NCLH,"Carnival Corp. (CCL) on Monday reported fiscal third-quarter profit of $1.42 billion.On a per-share basis, the Miami-based company said it had profit of $1.93. Earnings, adjusted for nonrecurring gains, were $1.92 per share.The results surpassed Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.89 per share.The cruise operator posted revenue of $5.1 billion in the period, which also beat Street forecasts. Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $5.04 billion.For the current quarter ending in November, Carnival expects its per-share earnings to range from 55-59 cents. The company expects full-year earnings in the range of $3.33-$3.37 per share.Analysts expect EPS of 58 cents in fiscal Q4, above the midpoint of Carnival's view, and $3.34 for the full year.Carnival shares reversed 1.7% lower but ended at 46.47, just above their 50-day average, after earlier climbing enough to retake their 200-day line. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) fell 1.9% and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) lost 0.75%.IBD'S TAKE: Higher fuel costs, fare cuts and travelers' uncertainty over their finances, health and safety could pose considerable headwinds to travel-related stocks. See how other travel names are doing at IBD's Stock Checkup.

"
348,NCLH,"Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) on Tuesday slashed its earnings forecast for this year and said it would miss its profit target for next year, partly due to ""continued weak demand"" for European travel among core North American consumers and Brexit's impact on the pound.Shares plunged 11.8% to close at 37.91 in the stock market today, a day after the stock had begun to find support at its key 50-day line. Rival cruise line Royal Caribbean (RCL) sank 6.8%, and Carnival (CCL) was underwater by 3%.Norwegian's announcement comes amid more intense global anxiety, with some U.S. consumers thinking twice about traveling following ISIS-inspired violence worldwide over the past year, as well as heightened economic uncertainty and an often unpredictable, vitriolic election season.The cruise service cut its 2016 earnings-per-share outlook to $3.35-$3.45 from an earlier projection of $3.65-$3.85. The new forecast was below analyst expectations for $3.72.The company also cut its full-year forecast for adjusted net yield -- an important metric that gauges sales compared to available ships and space on them -- to around 1% growth. In May, the company had forecast an increase of around 3.5%.""Overall, while investors have been bracing for an ugly guide, this was probably short of even lowered expectations, particularly on the yield front,"" Wedbush analyst James Hardiman said in a research note.IBD'S TAKE: Higher fuel costs, fare cuts and travelers' uncertainty over their finances, health and safety could pose considerable headwinds to travel-related stocks. See how other travel names are doing at IBD's Stock Checkup. The company's third-quarter earnings guidance of $1.57-$1.62 a share was also well below views for $1.78.The second quarter, however, wasn't as bad, despite weak travel demand.Earnings per share during the second quarter rose 13% to 85 cents, topping estimates by a penny. Revenue increased 9.3% to $1.186 billion, compared with Wall Street forecasts for $1.218 billion.Norwegian said it has tried to keep fare discounting at a minimum, something with which the airline industry has also grappled.""While successive geopolitical events dampened North American consumer demand primarily for our Mediterranean itineraries, our management team worked diligently to identify cost saving opportunities to partially mitigate these impacts and generate solid adjusted (earnings-per-share) growth of 13%,"" Chief Executive Frank Del Rio said in a prepared statement.
"
349,NCLH,"Shares of Carnival (CCL) reported second-quarter results that topped expectations and stuck to its guidance despite rising fuel costs and sinking currencies.The cruise operator's earnings per share during the quarter nearly doubled to 49 cents, beating views by a dime. Revenue rose 3.2% to $3.7 billion, narrowly passing views for $3.68 billion.The results came despite weaker currencies against the dollar and higher fuel prices. Chief Executive Arnold Donald praised the company's attempts to drive demand ""in excess of our measured capacity growth.""The company said that higher demand and growth discipline in a tough environment helped it hold the midpoint of its full-year earnings guidance of $3.25 to $3.35 a share, a narrower range than forecast in March but still $3.30 at its midpoint. Analysts expect $3.38.Carnival has tried to tap into an older U.S. population with more time to travel. It has also focused more on China, as the Caribbean becomes jam-packed with rivals.Shares closed up 0.2%, giving up steeper gains, on the stock market today. Royal Caribbean (RCL) dipped 0.5%.

350,NCLH,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), Carnival (CCL), Expedia (EXPE) and other travel-related stocks plunged early Friday after a suspected terror attack left more than 80 people dead in southern France, but many pared losses.Delta shares fell 2.4% to 39.98 in the stock market today. The airline has the most exposure to France of any U.S. airline. American Airlines (AAL) stock erased losses and turned up 1 cent. United Continental (UAL) was off just 0.9%. All three carriers are up sharply for the week.Hilton Worldwide (HLT) shares rose 0.3%. Marriott (MAR) dipped 0.35% and Hyatt Hotels (H) turned up 0.3%.Travel booking site Expedia shares edged down 0.4%. Priceline (PCLN) shares fell 1.2%.Among cruise lines, Carnival fell 2.2%, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) 3.7% and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Most industry groups in the travel and leisure sector are well off highs, but have mounted a rebound of late. Airlines are back up to early June levels after dipping for much of the last month. Hotels recovered to March levels after a four-month drought. The travel booking sector that includes Priceline and Expedia is back up after a brief, Brexit-inspired sell-off. And cruise lines recently broke out to reach prices not seen since December.The attack in Nice happened late Thursday night as revelers were at a parade celebrating France's Bastille Day. A truck, reportedly filled with weapons and explosives, slammed into the crowd killing at least 84 people and wounding 100 others.The suspected terror attack comes eight months after gunmen opened fire at a Paris nightclub and cafes frequented by tourists.But, like prior attacks, the incident in Nice is unlikely to have long term effects on travel.In an prior interview with IBD, Jack Plunkett, CEO of global market research firm Plunkett Research, said that airlines were busy again within a few weeks after the 9/11 terror attacks and the same was true after the 2002 nightclub bombing in Bali, Indonesia, and the transit bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005.

Revenue rose 5.6% to $1.918 billion, roughly in line with views of $1.916 billion, and net yields rose 7% on a constant currency basis.Full-year EPS guidance was raised by 25 cents to a range of $6.15 to $6.35, driven by a more favorable currency environment and strength in North American products and onboard revenue. Analysts expect EPS of $6.09.Shares closed up 1.8% on the stock market today, after rising as much as 4.5% early then turning negative midday.Meanwhile, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) is scheduled to report Q1 earnings on May 10.

381,NCLH,"Cruising waters are about to get a little more crowded as a new, high-profile cruise line plans to horn in on established Miami-based operators Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH).Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson announced Thursday that his company, with backer Bain Capital, plans to ""shake up the cruise industry"" with the start of Virgin Cruises, to be based out of the Miami/Fort Lauderdale area.Two new cruise ships are planned initially to serve cruise guests who ""deserve something better and different,"" stated Tom McAlpin, who will lead Virgin Cruises as its CEO. He formerly was president of Disney Cruise Line and most recently CEO of The World, Residences at Sea.Should Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian be worried? If they are, they have around three years to strategize over Virgin's move into their turf.That's about how long it would take for a new ship to be delivered, noted Robin Farley, an analyst with UBS.Despite obvious concerns about a new entrant's impact on the cruise market, especially in the crowded Caribbean, Farley says Virgin's entry might actually be a positive. It would attract more attention to the cruise market — and more passengers for everyone, she noted.She pointed out that Disney's entrance into the cruise market years ago was a concern but ended up as ""a big positive for the industry"" because it raised awareness of cruising as a vacation option. That was especially true for first-timers, who were likely to become repeat customers, often on other cruise lines.After first-timers try Virgin, they might want to try a different itinerary next time around — ""which means going to a different brand,"" Farley wrote in a research note Thursday.""While Virgin is not the powerhouse vacation brand that Disney is, we still believe it would attract more attention to the cruise market than the capacity it will represent,"" she said.Carnival, the biggest, is finally on smoother waters after three straight years of falling profit; earnings are expected to grow 19% this year. Norwegian and Royal Caribbean have been doing better. All three stocks have been steaming ahead since mid-October.IBD rates the stock of Norwegian, the smallest cruise operator of the three, the highest, with a Composite Rating of 97 out of 99, based on stock price, earnings and other metrics.

424,NCLH,"A scuba diver swims above a reef dotted with colorful fish. An elderly couple ballroom dances on a beach at sunset. A woman sits on the edge of a rock, meditating at twilight.Then ""Diamond Resorts International (DRII): simplicity, choice, comfort,"" a voice says as the six-minute commercial on YouTube ends.Calling itself a provider of ""affordable luxury and priceless memories,"" Diamond offers vacations in 34 countries at 93 managed resorts, 154 affiliated resorts, 52 affiliated hotels and four cruise itineraries.The vacation packages are low-priced — such as five days and four nights in Cabo San Lucas for $292 or four days and three nights in Las Vegas for $92 — and are a marketing tool.The catch is that customers must be creditworthy, age 25 and older, earning at least $50,000 annually and ready to watch a one-and-a-half to two-hour sales pitch for joining Diamond's club. In the club, members buy points to use toward vacation packages.One of the costliest getaways, a nine-day European cruise on Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' (NCLH) Norwegian Star, costs 20,000 points at peak season. Among the cheapest, a one-week stay in an Ormond Beach, Fla., studio, runs 1,200 points in low season.Funding The FunDiamond plans to increase its sales force 5%-10% annually over the next few years and boost sales to Asian customers, CEO David Palmer told IBD. About 70% of customers finance their purchase at a 15% average annual interest rate. The rate varies by the down payment, which is typically 10%.Diamond bundles customers' loans into securities and resells them to insurance companies and other institutional investors, eliminating its risk in customer defaults. About 6% of customers default on their loans; about 3.5% default on maintenance fees, said Palmer.As a ""Silver Elite"" member, Lee Huffman of Anaheim Hills, Calif., pays a $2,400 annual maintenance fee and gets 15,000 points every year in perpetuity. The finance manager of a midsize bank in Southern California and his family have used the points to stay at Diamond Resorts in California, Cabo San Lucas, Paris and Sydney.""We prefer the comfort, convenience and cost savings of timeshares over hotels even more now that we have a child,"" said Huffman. He views his timeshare as an asset in his estate that he can pass on to his 3-year-old son.As of Jan. 1, 2014, points start at $7.66 each with a minimum purchase of 2,500 points, for $19,150, according to DiamondResorts.com. Members must also pay annual maintenance fees, which vary based on their membership levels, and incidental assessment fees for renovations or large repairs.Huffman and 524,000 fellow Diamond members can be credited for fueling the company's rapid sales and earnings growth. In its third quarter as a public company, the Las Vegas-based firm exceeded analysts' expectations. It beat earnings and sales forecasts on top of lifting full-year guidance when it reported first-quarter results May 1.Revenue grew 18% year over year to $181 million, eclipsing the $177 million consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) vaulted 37% from a year ago to $67 million, topping JPMorgan's forecasts of $51 million by 31%.Diamond raised its full-year 2014 EBITDA guidance to $265 million to $280 million, from previous guidance of $255 million to $265 million, partly because it managed to refinance a 12% loan at a much lower interest rate. It expects to save it about $22 million a year in interest.Performance Since IPODiamond stock has risen 40% from its $14 IPO price in July 2013.In a conference call with analysts, CEO Palmer said the company uses a ""capital-light model with minimal development capex required,"" which means that instead of building its own properties, Diamond adds inventory by buying out existing resorts. Diamond also collects fees from managing properties in homeowners associations.""Unlike its peers, with no significant plans to invest capital in new timeshare development, it sources inventory from recapturing vacation ownership interests from members who default on payment of their homeowners association dues and its bank of unsold points,"" JPMorgan analyst Joseph Gregg and colleagues wrote in a note May 1.Inside The IndustryAbout 30% of Diamond's earnings come from managing resorts, a task that's very profitable, says Gregg.""Diamond is in a position to generate appealing earnings growth, driven by what we view as sustainable operating momentum in vacation ownership and steady uplift in management fees,"" Gregg and colleagues noted. ""We forecast improving free cash-flow performance, given growth in its higher-margin management business.""Diamond is the 12th largest company by market cap in IBD's Leisure-Lodging industry group, whose biggest components are Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT), Marriott International (MAR) and Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT). The group is ranked No. 79 in performance of 197 that IBD tracks.Vacation ownership can be a controversial line of business, however, and Diamond is no stranger to complaints.""In one year, fees rose by more than 40%. A similar figure the next year. Soon the maintenance fees exceeded the cost of staying in a Diamond Resorts apartment for a holiday through Expedia (EXPE), including airfares,"" a Gloucestershire, U.K.-based entrepreneur, who did not want his name published, said in an email. ""To add insult to injury, it became almost impossible to get a booking for any property except during off peak.""Diamond's management fees exceeded rental rates by 47% to 180% for various properties he saw online, he says, and when he refused to pay, he got calls every day — sometimes twice a day — and was told that he would be turned over to a collection agency. Diamond finally canceled his contract after he complained to every agency in the U.S. and U.K. that would listen, he says.""I just made a right royal nuisance of myself,"" he said in an email.Unwanted Diamond points can be had for pennies on the dollar on eBay (EBAY) and timeshare-resale websites. Only 3% of timeshares sell on the resale market, says Jeff Griffen, a senior executive at ResortBailout.com. The East Hartford, Conn.-based firm helps clients unload a timeshare for one to three years in annual maintenance fees plus closing costs.Walking away from a timeshare is like letting a house go into foreclosure, which could result in property liens, stained credit histories and even wage garnishment, according to Griffen. In addition, customers can finance their purchase only through Diamond, he says.Over the past three years, 525 complaints against Diamond were filed with the Better Business Bureau. Owners in Koloa, Hawaii, filed a class-action lawsuit over a $65,822,529 water-intrusion assessment, local media reported.Investing RisksSince owning a timeshare is a luxury that most people can do without, a global or U.S. economic slowdown could deplete demand for new purchases or hinder people's ability to repay their loans.""Currently, no effective secondary market exists to resell timeshare,"" Robert LaFleur and Whitney Stevenson, analysts at JMP Securities, wrote in a note May 2. ""If an effective and cost-efficient secondary market develops, Diamond's ability to sell vacation interests through its existing sales channels could be seriously impaired.""Among other risks, rising interest rates would increase borrowing costs for both Diamond and its customers, which could squeeze margins and dampen demand.Diamond will be increasingly more dependent on the securities market to get money and maintain growth in vacation-ownership sales, Gregg of JPMorgan says. Growth depends on its success in selling to new customers rather than existing customers.

435,NCLH,"Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) have long operated year-round cruises to the Caribbean from Florida. But Norwegian hasn't run year-round cruises from Miami in more than 10 years.
"
436,NCLH,"With its two new ships sailing from New York and Miami to cruise-popular Caribbean ports, Norwegian expects 2014 earnings to grow 60%, driven in part by an expected net yield of more than 4%, despite heavy promotions by rivals.
"
437,NCLH,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2014 earnings to grow higher than that. For this year, they see profit rising 43% to $1.39 a share. In the first quarter's busy ""wave"" season next year, they expect EPS to jump 283% to 23 cents.

438,NCLH,"New ships command double-digit premiums, CEO Kevin Sheehan said in a conference call after Norwegian's third quarter report.
"
439,NCLH,"""We want to continue to push on pricing and keep a careful eye, of course, on the load,"" he said.
"
440,NCLH,"Meanwhile, Norwegian has worked to bolster its balance sheet by lowering the cost of debt via redemptions and refinancing of high-rate notes. In the third quarter, interest expense fell 44% to $26.6 million from $47.2 million a year earlier. Its cost of debt at the end of the quarter was under 4% vs. 6.6% at the end of December 2012.
"
441,NCLH,"Norwegian is majority owned by Genting Hong Kong, Apollo Global Management (APO) and TPG Capital, so the public float is relatively small.
"
442,NCLH,"Late Monday Norwegian announced the majority shareholders will sell 22 million ordinary shares in a secondary offering. A 30-day option will be granted to underwriters to buy up to 3.3 million additional shares. Norwegian won't sell any shares in the offering nor receive any of the proceeds.
"
443,NCLH,"Beyond the Breakaway and Getaway two even larger ships, the Norwegian Escape and Norwegian Bliss, are set to be delivered in 2015 and 2017 respectively. New vessels, more fuel-efficient than older models, should continue to support growth in earnings and return on invested capital, analysts say.
"
444,NCLH,"Meanwhile, as Norwegian expands its fleet, global industry capacity growth is expected to slow to 3.6% for 2013 to 2016 vs. the more than 6% annual growth from 2003 to 2012, Wells Fargo analysts noted.

"
446,NCLH,"While Norwegian is steamrolling ahead on the heels of its January public offering, Carnival is trying to recover from a series of mishaps.
"
447,NCLH,"Analysts forecast that Carnival's earnings will fall for the third straight year this year. Carnival expects net yield to be down 3% to 4% in the first half of 2014.
"
448,NCLH,"""Carnival is clearly having a difficult year,"" Driscoll said.
"
449,NCLH,"Rather than cruise with Carnival's more upscale Holland or Princess brands, many would-be customers turned off by Carnival's headline-grabbing problems at sea have signed on with Norwegian or Royal Caribbean, UBS analyst Robin Farley noted in a recent report.
"
450,NCLH,"Norwegian, relying on just one ship brand, skews to a higher-end demographic than the mass-market Carnival brand, observers say.
"
451,NCLH,"Demand for cruises fell after Carnival-operated Costa Concordia tipped over after hitting rocks off the coast of Italy in early 2012. The industry was starting to recover when Carnival's Triumph lost power in the Gulf of Mexico early this year, a top-of-the-news event that left more than 3,000 passengers to cope with no power and overflowing toilets.
"
452,NCLH,"Driscoll says Norwegian and Royal Caribbean ""could have done better this year if it weren't for the negativity surrounding the Triumph.""
"
453,NCLH,"""Barring another Black Swan event, the industry really should do pretty well next year,"" he said. ""But it's hard to tell now because this is not a heavy booking period. You really won't know until January.""
"
454,NCLH,"That's when the cruise industry's three-month promotion-heavy ""wave"" season begins.
"
455,NCLH,"Even Europe's cruise business, which was especially impacted by the Concordia accident, is on the mend. Norwegian plans to deploy about 20% of its fleet in Europe in 2014, about the same as this year. Sheehan said in the last conference call that pricing ""has been a positive"" and that ""we're feeling pretty good about Europe right now.""
"
456,NCLH,"Other cruise lines are adding capacity in Europe. Royal Caribbean's Anthem of the Seas is expected to enter service in Southampton, England, in 2015.
"
457,NCLH,"Norwegian says that 55% of its capacity will be in the Caribbean in the fourth quarter, with cruises leaving from Tampa, Fla.; Miami; New Orleans and New York.Norwegian Cruise Line may be No. 3 in the cruise industry after Royal Caribbean Cruises and mishap-ridden Carnival, the largest.But it's making up for its smaller size with a splashy rollout of new ships in North America. This comes at a time when the industry hasn't been adding much new capacity in the region.In May, Norwegian's 4,000-passenger Breakaway launched cruises out of New York, which helped boost the company's third-quarter net revenue nearly 20% year over year to $596 million and adjusted earnings 19% to 86 cents a share.The new ship, brimming with perks such as Broadway shows, enjoyed premium pricing and relatively high levels of onboard spending by passengers.A sister ship, the Getaway, could provide even more rewards when it sets sail out of Miami for Caribbean locales early next year.It'll be the largest cruise vessel to use Miami as its home port year-round.""This is a big deal,"" said Mike Driscoll, editor of newsletter Cruise Week.

The outperformance came on the back of strong booking and pricing trends on China, Europe and North American itineraries. While passenger ticket revenues decreased 0.4% to $1.89 billion, onboard and other revenues increased 1.9% to $676.4 million. Net cruise costs (NCC), excluding fuel, increased 5.7% on a constant currency basis, more than management’s expectation of a 4% increase. Notably, the rise in the costs was mainly owing to reduced capacity due to hurricanes.Excluding the impact of the same, absolute costs for the quarter were lower than expected because of timing. Total cruise operating expenses decreased 1.6% year over year to nearly $1.32 billion, mainly due to a decline in onboard and other expenses, lower fuel, payroll and related as well as other operating costs. This was partly offset by increased food expenses as well as higher commissions, transportation and other costs. 4Q17 Guidance For the fourth quarter, Royal Caribbean expects adjusted earnings per share to come in the range of $1.15 to $1.20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher than the guidance at $1.25 per share. Constant-currency net yields are projected to increase in the range of 2-2.5%. NCC, excluding fuel, is likely to be up about 8.5% at constant currency. 2017 Guidance For 2017, the company now anticipates earnings in the band of $7.35 to $7.40 per share, compared with $7.35-$7.45, projected earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is pegged at $7.40. The company expects net yields to improve 6% on a constant currency basis compared with the prior guidance of 5.5-6% increase. NCC, excluding fuel, on a constant currency basis, is expected to be up roughly 2%. Previously, the company expected the same to be up 1%. Meanwhile, management noted that they are experiencing strong early booking trends for 2018. Other Cruise Operators Cruise and vacation company, Carnival Corp. (CCL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2017 results in June wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Another cruise-line operator, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report) is expected to report its third-quarter 2017 numbers on Nov 9, before market opens. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s bottom line is pegged at $1.82 per share. Zacks Rank & Stock to Consider Royal Caribbean carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

498,NCLH,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Norwegian Cruise has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.0. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Norwegian Cruise’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 21.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Norwegian Cruise has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Norwegian Cruise stock in the near term too .P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management, and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Norwegian Cruise’s P/CF ratio of 11.4 is higher than the broader industry average of 8.9, which indicates that the stock is somewhat overvalued in this respect.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Norwegian Cruise currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Norwegian Cruise a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Norwegian Cruise is just 0.6, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1.4. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate.What About the Stock Overall?Though Norwegian Cruise might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of C. This gives NCLH a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen five up in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate remained stable in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched upper by 2.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Price and Consensus   Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Price and Consensus | Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineNorwegian Cruise is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Miami-based, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report), one of the major players in the cruise segment, is one stock which is worth considering.What Makes Norwegian Cruise Line a Solid Pick?Stock Price Movement: Norwegian Cruise Line shares have rallied 17% in the last six months outperforming the Zacks categorized Leisure and Recreation Services industry’s gain of 15.8%.  Given increasing demand for business and leisure travel, along with the current strength in its bookings and capacity growth, the stock should keep performing well in the quarters ahead.Earnings & Revenue Growth: Arguably, nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company in question.While Norwegian Cruise Line has a historical earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 17.8%, investors should really focus on its projected growth. Here, the company is looking to grow at a rate of 22%, higher than the industry average of 14.3%.Propelling the earnings forward is the company’s solid revenue growth story. Evidently, its last five years revenue growth is 21.9% better than the industry’s average of 5.3%. Moreover, projected sales growth for the current year is 8.7%, which is higher than the broader industry’s estimate of 5%.Favorable ROE: Norwegian Cruise Line’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. Also, the company’s ROE of 16.76% has increased over the years. Further, it compares favorably with the Zacks categorized Leisure and Recreation Services industry’s ROE of 12.10%, reflecting the fact that it is efficient in using shareholders’ funds.Positive Estimate Revisions: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Norwegian Cruise Line’s current quarter earnings has moved up over 1%, reflecting one upward revision versus none downward, over the last 60 days.

Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value, growth, and momentum characteristics.

Besides, Norwegian Cruise Line also faces competition from other large cruise operators including Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) and Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report).Nonetheless, given the company’s strong fundamentals, strong bookings trend and burgeoning demand for cruise travel in 2017, the stock should keep performing well in the near term, thereby making it a top investment choice.Another top-ranked stock in the same sector is Cedar Fair, L.P.

Further, earnings jumped a significant 56.9% from the year-ago tally of $1.09, owing to higher revenues and lower expenses.Total revenue increased 4.3% year over year to $2.195 billion, driven by higher passenger ticket revenues as well as better onboard spending. However, revenues slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.191 billion.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. QuoteQuarter HighlightsOn a constant currency basis, net yields increased 11.5% year over year, better than the guided range of 10-10.5%. The outperformance came on the back of strong close-in demand, which in turn, drove higher pricing and occupancy.Both passenger ticket revenues as well as onboard and other revenues increased 4.3% to $1.58 billion and $613.9 million, respectively.Net cruise costs (NCC), excluding fuel, decreased 0.9% on a constant currency basis, lower than management’s guidance of a decline of about 2%.Also, total cruise operating expenses decreased 4.1% year over year to nearly $1.26 billion, mainly due to a decline in onboard and other expenses, lower food, fuel, payroll and related as well as other operating costs. The decrease was partly offset by higher commissions, transportation and other costs.3Q17 GuidanceFor the third quarter, Royal Caribbean expects adjusted earnings per share to come in at $3.45. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.29 per share is pegged below the guidance.Constant-currency net yields are projected to increase in the range of 4-4.5%.

502,NCLH,"Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp. (VAC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 numbers on Aug 3, before the opening bell.Last quarter, this Florida-based vacation ownership company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.39%. However, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a negative 1.95%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Marriot Vacations Worldwide Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Marriot Vacations Worldwide Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marriot Vacations Worldwide Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderMarriott Vacations, one of the major players in the timeshare industry, is poised to benefit from positive timeshare industry trends. The company has been able to maintain a steady flow of clients by offering tours to diverse locations and programs with greater outreach.Marriott Vacations expects to continue driving contract sales and rental revenues in the second quarter via its two major growth initiatives. The first being tours from marketing programs, namely call transfer and universal encore programs and secondly, by additional sales distributions at its new locations.In fact, the last quarter was the first full quarter when Marriott Vacations had all its new distribution points open and these drove roughly 7 percentage points of contract sales growth in the U.S. This promising performance is expected to continue into the second quarter as well.Nevertheless, as the timeshare industry is extensively marketing-oriented and relies heavily on sales initiatives to attract customers, the company’s increased marketing expenses might pressurize the second-quarter margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Marriott Vacations this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Marriott Vacations has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.26 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Marriott Vacations carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the Consumer Discretionary sector to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Time Warner Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #2.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

503,NCLH,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, before the opening bell.Last quarter, Hyatt pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 204.17%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 83.00%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Hyatt Hotels Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Hyatt Hotels Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Hyatt Hotels Corporation QuoteFactors Likely to Influence Q2Hyatt’s second-quarter results are expected to be positively impacted by the company’s efforts to continue gaining market share globally on its solid brand portfolio, continuous expansion, and innovative and exceptional personalized service to guests. Last quarter, the company launched its remodeled loyalty program that should aid in boosting occupancy.Additionally, Hyatt stands to gain from increased demand in the U.S. that is supported by stronger economic metrics and the increasingly positive employment scenario in the country.Moreover, improved leisure and business travel demand as well as greater pricing power have been driving Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) for the last few quarters. We expect the trend to have continued in the second quarter as well.However, lingering global uncertainty in certain economies, particularly the Middle East and China, is likely to limit revenue growth. Further, tough business conditions in and recent terror assaults in key European cities have also affected tourism. Challenging market dynamics and ongoing renovations in France are expected to continue hurting revenues of the company too.Additionally, negative currency translation is anticipated to reduce the value of overseas sales, given Hyatt’s significant international presence, thereby hurting revenues and profits in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Hyatt this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Hyatt has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

504,NCLH,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process.

The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Norwegian Cruise has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.7, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.2. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Norwegian Cruise’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Norwegian Cruise has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 10.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Norwegian Cruise stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Norwegian Cruise has a P/S ratio of about 2.1. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, NCLH is toward the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Norwegian Cruise currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Norwegian Cruise a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Norwegian Cruise is just 0.5, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.2. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 8.1, which is better than the industry average of 9.4. Clearly, NCLH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Norwegian Cruise might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A. This gives NCLH a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher. The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen eight upward and only one downward revision in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by nearly 1% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 1.3%.

508,NCLH,"The Q1 earnings season is in full swing and the trend so far appears impressive. Notably, the S&P 500 companies are likely to witness highest quarterly earnings growth rate in seven years.Per the latest Earnings Preview, out of the 267 S&P 500 companies that have come up with their financial numbers, 76.8% outpaced earnings estimates, 73.8% exceeded top-line expectations and 61.4% outpaced on both the counts. Also, total earnings of these companies increased 25.1% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues.According to the report, total earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 22.6% year over year, with revenues likely to increase 8.4%. This compares favorably with year-over-year earnings growth of 13.4% but unfavorably with 8.6% year-over-year improvement in revenues in the last report.Consumer Discretionary Sector on Growth TrajectoryLike some other high-flying sectors, the widely diversified Consumer Discretionary is likely to put up a stellar show in Q1. Currently, the domestic economy is favorable for this space owing to increased demand for goods and services. According to the Fed’s latest forecast, the economy will grow at a reasonable rate of 2.7% in 2018. Unemployment is predicted at 3.8% for the current year. Moreover, high real disposable income and low inflation are resulting in improved purchasing behavior. The fourth quarter of 2017 witnessed the highest consumer spending in three years.Total earnings for the sector are anticipated to increase 12.1% in Q1, up from 0.8% in the last reported quarter. Revenues are projected to grow 6.6%, higher than 4.6% in the fourth quarter 2017. Margins are expected to increase 0.6% compared to a 0.4% decline in the fourth quarter of 2017. Notably, leisure stocks form part of the Consumer Discretionary sector.Among the leisure stocks lined up to report on May 2, let’s take a look at five key picks from this sector.Wyndham Worldwide Corp.  is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, its earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.4%.The company believes that its efforts to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy will reflect in its first-quarter revenues. Also, it has been increasingly focusing on marketing campaigns, digital experiences, websites, on-property amenities, travel perks and marketing partnerships to drive its overall top-line performance. However, in the recent times, a tense macro-economic condition along with a slight dearth of tourists in the United States might affect the company’s revenues in Q1.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.27, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 11.4%. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.23 billion, mirroring a decline of 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.Wyndham Worldwide has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -0.99%, a combination that does not indicate a beat.

(NCLH  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results before the market opens. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.9%. Norwegian Cruise Line has also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of approximately 5.9%.However, things do not look rosy for the company in the soon-to-be reported quarter. High costs owing to the upsurge in fuel prices are likely to hurt results. In fact, the stock has been grappling with increase in operating expenses for quite some time. This is evident from the disappointing price movement in a year’s time.We expect high costs to limit bottom-line growth at Norwegian Cruise Line in the first quarter of 2018. In the last reported quarter, an increase in cruise operating expenses affected the company’s earnings growth and the first quarter is unlikely to be any different. Rise in fuel costs are primarily responsible for pushing up total expenses. The company expects fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, to be $450 for first quarter. Also, oil prices have been on an uptrend lately and were up approximately 8% in the January-to-March period. We note that high oil prices do not bode well for travel-focused companies like Norwegian Cruise Line as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of their expenditures.Norwegian Cruise Line has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of +0.47%, a combination that does not indicate a beat.

511,NCLH,"Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 1.Last quarter, the company reported a whopping positive surprise of 171.4%. Sony scored three colossal earnings beats over the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 105.0%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe PlayStation4 console, which is arguably Sony’s biggest growth driver, is going strong even after three years of release, as evidenced by the company’s latest released numbers. The consumer electronics giant announced that it has sold over 60.4 million units of the console to date. PS4 Pro, the upgraded version of PS4 gaming console, and virtual reality (VR) system are likely to act as major profit churners for the gaming business this quarter.Also, the array of gaming applications for mobile products launched over the past two quarters through ForwardWorks Corporation is likely to boost gaming division revenues in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Barring the Gaming business, positive industry trends including an uptick in smartphone and image sensor sales for mobile products are likely to drive sales at the Mobile Communications and Semiconductor businesses.In addition, Sony’s focus on cost-saving initiatives, lower exposure in low-profit geographic regions and reduction in advertising & promotion expenses are expected to boost fiscal first-quarter results. Over the past few quarters, major restructuring efforts and internal shuffles have helped Sony optimize its business structure. This is expected to prove conducive to operating profit growth in the upcoming quarters.Despite these positives, Sony has been grappling with a host of issues, some driven by market forces, others self-inflicted, impeding top-line growth. High costs in relation to transfer of the battery business, stiff competition in multiple product lines and negative foreign currency translation impact pose headwinds for the future. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, currency headwinds dented profits at multiple segments.Volatility in panel prices and foreign exchange rates, especially in emerging market currencies, add to Sony’s conerns. This apart, lingering effects of the Kumamoto earthquakes, one of Japan’s most formidable natural disasters in recent times, may prove to be an overhang. Moreover, costs associated with the ongoing restructuring efforts are likely to escalate operating expenses, thus restricting earnings and margin expansion in the quarter under review.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Sony this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 48 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Sony Corp Ord Price and EPS Surprise  Sony Corp Ord Price and EPS Surprise | Sony Corp Ord QuoteZacks Rank: Sony has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of the ESP. However, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Cedar Fair, L.P. (FUN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.84% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

512,NCLH,"The leisure industry has been benefiting from several factors like a strong economy, growing incomes, higher consumer confidence and a strong labor market.As people are steadfast on spending time with loved ones and keep looking for unique experiences at all price points, companies in the leisure and recreation industry believe that their diverse portfolio of offerings can continue to deliver on this growing demand.Economic Fundamentals EncouragingConsumer spending is expected to rise through 2018 backed by a favorable economic scenario. This raises optimism for the companies in the leisure and recreation space. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017, following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3%, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This marked the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009. Improving economic indicators bode well for the industry as these lead to an increase in leisure and business travel demand.Meanwhile, consumer spending, the main engine of the economy, grew by 3.8% in the fourth quarter after a 2.2% gain in the third quarter. Again, there was a marked improvement in Consumer Confidence Index in January, after a setback in December. Consumer Confidence rose 2.3 points to 125.4 in January. The momentum is expected to continue through 2018.Thus, we see no reason why the industry should not continue to enjoy gains on both the top and the bottom lines in the near term, especially when unemployment rate is at a 17-year low and wages are growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade.Industry Numbers PromisingAccording to Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), demand for cruising has increased 20.5% from 2011 to 2016. The cruise industry is expected to continue growing significantly in 2018 with 27.2 million passengers likely to cruise. This figure is 5.4% higher than projected for 2017.Coming to the global luxury travel market, ITB World Travel Trends Report 2017/2018 forecasts strong worldwide travel trends. The consultancy anticipates worldwide outbound trips to increase 5% with strongest growth Latin America and Asia.  Holiday trips, city trips and Sun and beach holidays are expected to grow 6%, 16% and 9%, respectively.According to a report from Statista, revenues from the sports and outdoor space are expected to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.9% from 2018 to 2022.  User penetration, which is currently at 8.7%, is anticipated to touch 10.4% in 2022.A Mixed Bag for the Broader SectorThe Consumer Discretionary sector that includes leisure and recreational companies is expected to deliver a mixed performance this earnings season.Per the Earnings Preview, total earnings for the sector are likely to decline 3.7% year over year against 0.9% growth in the last quarter. Total revenues are projected to grow 3.7% year over year in the fourth quarter, slightly higher than the 3.5% growth recorded in the preceding quarter.Choosing the WinnersThough the overall picture may not be impressive, a few leisure stocks are expected to outperform. So, this is the right time for investors to select some leisure stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

513,NCLH,"Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report) fell 6.1% to $48.77 at the close of business on Jun 25, thus slipping to a 52-Week low of $47.33. Moreover the stock has declined 9.9% in a month against the industry’s 3.8% rise. What Caused the DownfallNorwegian Cruise stock decreased yesterday, primarily due to its competitor Carnival Corporation’s (CCL  -  Free Report) announcement of a dismal forecast. The company’s trimmed full-year earnings outlook (mainly due to rising fuel costs and currency-related headwinds) also induced a drop in the share price of another rival, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report).It is important to note that the cruise industry has been grappling with unfavorable demand-supply conditions and Norwegian Cruise is no exception. Per CNBC reports, high industry supply, slackening yield growth and weakness in the Caribbean and China are causes for concern in the industry.Rising fuel prices are another headwind for the company as well as the entire industry. With fuel prices shooting up, such costs are anticipated to hurt the company’s bottom line in the second quarter of 2018. Notably, high costs have been affecting the company since the past few quarters. Total cruise operating expenses were up 7.5% in 2017. Moreover, the same rose 6.7% in the first quarter of 2018. Zacks Rank & A Key PickNorwegian Cruise carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

514,NCLH,"Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second quarter of fiscal 2018 results on Jun 25, before the opening bell.The company’s overall top line is likely to witness an uptick in the second quarter, given robust performance across Passenger Tickets business, and Onboard and Other segments. Higher revenues and revenue yields are likely to boost earnings as well.Notably, shares of Carnival have lost 5.2% in the past year against the industry’s growth of 2.8%.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that might have shaped up the company’s second-quarter results.Top Line to Gain From Higher Segmental RevenuesCarnival generates revenues from Passenger Tickets business, Onboard and Other, as well as Tour and Other segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter total revenues is pegged at $4.3 billion, reflecting an increase of 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.Also, in the last reported quarter, the company’s top line grew 11.6% year over year, reflecting sales strength across all segments. The upside trend is likely to have continued in the second quarter as well.Passenger Tickets revenues are expected to increase year over year, driven by price improvements in Carnival’s European, Caribbean and Alaska programs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.2 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 10.1%. In the first quarter, passenger tickets revenues improved 8.3% year over year.Onboard and Other revenues will carry on the momentum of the first quarter (up 7.3% year over year) and are anticipated to further improve in the quarter to be reported. Higher onboard spending by guests and capacity rise in available lower berth days (ALBD) are expected to drive the growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $1.1 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 9.3%.Tour and Other revenues are expected to increase, given robust booking trends. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $43.2 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 16.8%.Meanwhile, per the consensus estimate, net revenue yield is likely to improve 8.1% year over year in the second quarter, following the 3.9% increase in the last reported quarter. The upside trend is attributed to higher net ticket, and net on-board and other yields. The company however expects net revenue yield to improve in the band of 2.5-3.5% year over year in the to-be-reported quarter.Top Line to Drive EPS Even though the company anticipates net cruise costs to increase in the range of 4-5% from the prior-year quarter, adjusted earnings per share is still expected within 56-60 cents. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 60 cents for the to-be-reported quarter, mirroring 15.4% year-over-year growth. The improvement is expected to be driven primarily by higher revenues and an increase in net ticket, and on-board and other yields.Our Model Doesn’t Suggest a BeatAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided, especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Carnival has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -1.80%, a combination that does not suggest an earnings beat.Carnival Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Carnival Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Carnival Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are some leisure stocks that according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their respective quarters to be reported.Live Nation Entertainment (LYV  -  Free Report), Norwegian Cruise (NCLH  -  Free Report) and Cinemark (CNK  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #3, have Earnings ESP of +25.58%, +0.36% and +1.88%, respectively.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

Furthermore, Carnival announced that its cumulative advanced bookings for 2018 are ahead of the prior year, “at higher prices.”""Despite booking disruptions from this year's multiple hurricanes, we are still heading into 2018 with a stronger base of business and higher prices than last year,” CEO Arnold Donald said in a statement.“We have numerous efforts underway to keep the momentum going in 2018 and beyond, from our innovative approaches to increase consideration for cruising, including our recently announced partnership with Univision, to the further roll-out of our state-of-the-art revenue management system.”What’s more, Carnival announced that it expects to post first-quarter 2018 EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.41.

518,NCLH,"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, before the market opens.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.9%. Norwegian Cruise Line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of approximately 5.9%.However, things do not look rosy for the company in the soon-to-be reported quarter. High costs owing to the upsurge in fuel prices are likely to hurt results.In fact, the stock has been grappling with high operating expenses for quite some time. This is evident from the company’s disappointing price movement in a year’s time. While the stock has shed  2.9% of its value, the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry gained 0.8%.Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on the company’s results in the quarter to be reported.We expect high costs to limit bottom-line growth at Norwegian Cruise Line in the first quarter of 2018. In the last reported quarter, an increase in cruise operating expenses affected the company’s earnings growth and the first quarter is unlikely to be any different. Rise in fuel costs are primarily responsible for pushing up total expenses. The company expects fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, to be $450 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Also, oil prices have been on an uptrend lately and were up approximately 8% in the January-to-March period. We note that high oil prices do not bode well for travel-focussed companies like Norwegian Cruise Line as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of their expenditures.This apart, investments undertaken by the company to upgrade the facilities for travel are also pushing up costs, which are likely to hurt the bottom line in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Net Cruise Cost per Capacity Day in the quarter is pegged at $154, above $145 unveiled by the company in the fourth quarter of 2017.Moreover, foul weather, which was prevalent in the January-to-March period, might hurt results as well. In fact, higher marketing and promotional expenses along with increased cruise costs are likely to dent margins.However, increased ticket revenues should boost Norwegian Cruise Line’s top line in the soon-to-be reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for passenger ticket revenues in the first quarter of 2018 stands at $875 million, above $787 million unveiled by the company a year ago.  Additionally, Capacity Days are projected to increase approximately 11% year over year.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. QuoteWhat Does Our Model Indicate?Our proven model shows that Norwegian Cruise Line is unlikely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the stock does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.Zacks ESP: Norwegian Cruise Line has an Earnings ESP of +0.47%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), acts as a spoiler.

523,NCLH,"SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (SEAS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company’s loss was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss, which led to a negative earnings surprise of 24.53%. In fact, this Florida-based theme park and entertainment company, has delivered negative earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters, with an average miss of 17.07%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderGenerally, the second and the third quarters of each year are seasonally strong quarters for SeaWorld. In this regard, the company expects the trend to heighten in the to-be-reported quarter as it has come up with a robust lineup of new products that include new rides and an Orca show to replace the one which was shut. All of these are expected to boost attendance in the quarter.Moreover, SeaWorld expects the calendar shift of Easter from the first quarter to the second quarter in 2017 to enhance its profitability.Additionally, it has launched tactical pricing initiatives at several of its locations. Therefore, with the combination of direct price increases and dynamic pricing initiatives, the company anticipates achieving an increase in admissions per capita in the quarter.SeaWorld is making every possible effort to regain customers’ confidence as well. Evidently, it continues to organize consumer events to drive attendance. Also, management is undertaking various initiatives to stabilize and deliver improved results in California, Texas and Florida markets. Extended hours at SeaWorld Parks, strategic season pass promotions and more such strategies are expected to offset the prevailing negatives to some extent and attract customers, thereby improving attendance.We are also optimistic about the company’s sincere efforts to control costs without harming efficiency, and improve its financial standing through debt refinancing that might help in improving margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Nevertheless, SeaWorld’s total revenue per capita has been under pressure mostly due to lower attendance, especially from Latin American and the UK visitors. The company also believes that though Latin American visitation has improved sequentially, it will take a long time to return to its previous glorious levels.Additionally, costs related to marketing and reputation campaigns as well as investments in new attractions might hurt profits in the second quarter.Now, it remains to be seen if promotional offerings are successful in arresting the decline in traffic trends at SeaWorld locations.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for SeaWorld this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen, which is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: SeaWorld has an Earnings ESP of -5.88%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 32 cents per share, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 34 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: SeaWorld has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. But its negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in a similar space to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Inc. (NCLH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.03% and a Zacks Rank #2.

524,NCLH,"Cable ONE Inc. (CABO  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.20%. However, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 5.80%.Over the past three months, shares of Cable ONE have increased 12.76% while the industry to which it belongs gained 1.98%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayBased in Phoenix, AZ, Cable ONE is among the top 10 cable companies in the U.S., serving more than 800,000 residential and commercial customers in 21 states with high-speed internet, cable television and telephone service. As of Dec 31, 2016, it served 513,908 data customers, 320,246 video customers and 115,811 voice customers. The company provides consumers with a wide range of latest products and services, including wireless internet service, high-definition programming and phone service with free, unlimited long-distance calling in the continental U.S.Cable ONE made major changes in its channels and their availability to customers. New lineups were implemented to make news, sports and other channels easily accessible to viewers. We are also impressed with the company’s efforts to reward shareholders with a quarterly cash dividend of $1.75 per share, marking an increase of 25 cents per share in the company’s quarterly cash dividend. The dividend will be paid on Sep 1 to stockholders of record at the closure of business on Aug 15.  The acquisition of NewWave Communications (a cable operator providing high-speed data, video and voice services) will create a leading high-speed data and cable company serving more than 1.2 million primary service units in 21 states. The deal will aid Cable ONE to expand its footprint into additional non-metropolitan markets and non-urban areas like Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas, for which the company has optimized its strategy and operations.On the other hand, we are concerned about the company’s operation in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market. Moreover, cable companies continue to face stiff competition from online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc. because of their cheap source of TV programming. Furthermore, gaining customers from competitors is a difficult task as most pay-TV operators are offering innovative packages.Moreover, being a US cable TV company, Cable ONE faces immense competition from leading cable multi-service-operators (MSO) like Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report). This is likely to act as a major dampener to the company’s earnings.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cable ONE is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Cable ONE has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $5.10. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cable ONE has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Cable One, Inc.

525,NCLH,"As Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) approaches the end of its Double-Double program, bookings are at record levels, dividends are at an all-time high, costs have been well managed and guest satisfaction has improved significantly.Consequently, the company’s shares have rallied 51.9% in the past year, as against the industry’s growth of 25.1%.The company has thus once again developed a multi-year period program named — 20/20 Vision — that leverages the culture and the discipline instilled by the Double-Double program while including a broader set of goals.Meanwhile, Royal Caribbean posted mixed third-quarter 2017, wherein earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues lagged the same. Though strong close-in booking and pricing trends bolstered the quarterly performance, hurricanes had a negative impact on the same.In fact, the company has solid long-term growth potential but the risks from near-term headwinds might somewhat restrict its growth momentum.Key Growth DriversGiven the strength and diversity of its brands and itineraries, the company has successfully captured potential and repeat cruise vacationers and enjoys immense popularity among cruisers.We note that Royal Caribbean’s Asia-Pacific itineraries have been mostly performing strongly over the past few quarters. Though the China market has been recently experiencing bumps in the road, it is poised to be a long-term growth driver. Per data from the Chinese Ministry of Transport, China’s cruise market is projected to grow to 4.5 million passengers, up from 1 million in 2015. Also, the country is expected to become the world's second-largest cruise market by 2030, after the United States.Demand for European sailings, both in the Mediterranean and Baltics, has been particularly strong from North America. Meanwhile, although demand for Caribbean sailings softened as the recent hurricanes moved to the Caribbean and Gulf beginning in late August, virtually all its bookings in the region are back to pre-storm levels.In fact, the company stated that bookings continue to be very robust. Booking volumes have been up more for sailings that are further out, given the ongoing extension of the booking window. Management noted that they are experiencing strong early booking trends for 2018. Notably, Royal Caribbean is benefiting from its global sourcing model, revenue management strategies and the price integrity program.Given the consistent increase in bookings, the company is required to increase its capacity. Notably, with upcoming fleet launches like Symphony of the Seas — arriving in spring of 2018 — and Celebrity Edge that debuts in the fall of 2018, it expects to meet this requirement comfortably. Also, Royal Caribbean recently announced that Azamara Pursuit will join Azamara Club Cruises brand, which increases the company’s capacity there and upgrades its capabilities.Over the next three years, 20/20 Vision is expected to serve as a guiding light for the organization and build on its proven formula for success of modest yield and capacity growth, strong cost control along with efforts to enhance customer advocacy and employee engagement.Going forward, Royal Caribbean aims to improve its already excellent guest satisfaction and employee engagement while delivering its environmental commitments, under 20/20 Vision program. These operational drivers are expected to aid in further improving its double-digit return profile and deliver double-digit earnings per share by the end of 2020.Bottom LineDoes this mean that the company has been lying on a bed of roses? Well, not really!Adverse forex translations, a potential rise in fuel prices and lingering global uncertainties in certain international markets might continue to keep growth at check.Royal Caribbean as well as the other cruise operators is experiencing a decrease in demand for their China sailings due to restrictions on travel to South Korea, given the recent dispute between Chinese-Korean governments. This, in turn, is resulting in less-than-ideal itineraries and lower pricing. Consequently, the company’s business might suffer due to the volatility of the overall Chinese tourism industry.Furthermore, higher-than-anticipated load factors, timing and investment in revenue-generating activities are adding to the company’s costs. In fact, Royal Caribbean expects net cruise costs, excluding fuel, to be up about 8.5% year over year in fourth quarter on a constant-currency basis. This increase in the cost metric is anticipated to be driven by planned sales and marketing investments, timing of third quarter costs and lower-than-expected Available Passenger Cruise Days (APCD) due to the recent hurricanes.The company also faces competition from other cruise operators including Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report).Despite the headwinds, Royal Caribbean is well poised for growth given its strong fundamentals, strong bookings trend, various strategic initiatives and an expected increase in demand for cruise travel, going forward.Royal Caribbean currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the industry is Vail Resorts, Inc. (MTN  -  Free Report) holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.For fiscal 2018, Vail Resorts’ EPS is expected to grow 18.8%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

526,NCLH,"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 9, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.2%. Also, Norwegian Cruise Line’ssecond-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.02 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. The bottom line improved substantially on a year-over-year basis.Revenues came in at $1,344 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,309 million. Also, the top line increased 13.2% from the year-ago figure.However, this Miami-based company is likely to face turbulence in the quarter. Evidently, multiple headwinds including the back-to-back hurricanes have hurt travel-focused stocks including cruise line companies. In fact, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings has moved down 2.7% over the last 90 days.Also, the stock has struggled of late underperforming the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry over the last six months. Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line have declined 0.2%, as against the industry’s rally of 4.9%.Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Norwegian Cruise Line’s third-quarter results.Norwegian Cruise Line like its fellow cruise line operators — Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL  -  Free Report) and Carnival Corp (CCL  -  Free Report) — had to call off voyages and re-route ships to avoid stops at islands affected by the hurricanes. In fact, hurricane Irma forced Norwegian Cruise Line to bring back two of its Miami-based ships. The cancellations/ rerouting are likely to adversely impact the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Despite the headwinds, the company is expected to benefit from robust marketing initiatives and impressive booking environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter passenger ticket revenues is pegged at $1,188 million, higher than $938 million reported in the second quarter of 2017.Notably, Norwegian Cruise Line was recently included in the S&P 500 Index. It expects earnings per share (excluding special items) of approximately $1.83 in the third quarter of 2017. Fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, is projected at $455. Also, we expect the companyto provide a subdued fourth-quarter guidance due to hurricanes.What Does Our Model SayOur proven model does not show conclusively that Norwegian Cruise Linewill beat earnings in the third quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks Rank: Norwegian Cruise Line carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: Norwegian Cruise Line has an Earnings ESP of -1.02% as the Most Accurate estimate of 2 cents is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.82 per share. The negative Earnings ESP combined with the Zacks Rank leaves the surprise prediction inconclusive. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.A Stock to ConsiderWith Norwegian Cruise Line likely to disappoint, investors interested in the broader Consumer Discretionary space may consider Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report) as our model shows that this company possesses the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in its upcoming release.Marriott International has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank #2.

527,NCLH,"Hurricane Irma has grown into a massive Category 5 storm that is now surging through the Caribbean towards Florida. Irma’s looming threat to the large tropical island area has already triggered evacuation measures and other hurricane-based precautions. The hurricane also helped to sink stocks with strong ties to the Caribbean tourism industry on Tuesday.Irma UpdateThe National Hurricane Center recently updated its assessment of Hurricane Irma and outlined details of the tropical storm’s likely path though the Caribbean.“Irma is a potentially catastrophic category 5 hurricane and will bring life-threatening wind, storm surge, and rainfall hazards to portions of the northeastern Leeward Islands beginning later today and the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico beginning tomorrow,” the NHC said in a statement on Tuesday.The center also issued hurricane watches for a portion of the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the southeastern Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos. Irma is set to hit these areas by Thursday and Friday.The new report also suggests that the rest of the Bahamas, Cuba, Florida, and the Keys are on watch for later this week.New #hurricane watches have been issued for the Turks & Caicos Islands, SE Bahamas & the north coast of #Haiti https://t.co/tW4KeGdBFb #Irma pic.twitter.com/uJmnbDnlY3— NHC Atlantic Ops (@NHC_Atlantic) September 5, 2017“However, it is too soon to specify the timing and magnitude of the impacts,” the NHC noted. “Elsewhere, it is too early to determine what direct impact Irma might have on the continental United States.”Irma is currently belting out 180 miles winds east of Antigua with a Northwestern trajectory. The storm is expected to remain a strong Category 4 or 5 hurricane in the coming days. Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for the entire state yesterday. He also called for all 7,000 National Guard members in the state to report for duty this Friday.The new Irma report prompted Governor Scott to continue his now-constant tropical storm watch and preparation updates to Florida residents on Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report).#HurricaneIrma is now a Category 5.

528,NCLH,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Norwegian Cruise is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NCLH in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 98 cents per share for NCLH, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NCLH, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.03% heading into earnings season.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

529,NCLH,"With the Q2 earnings season in its last leg, the widely diversified Consumer Discretionary sector has grabbed much of the attention.Per the Earnings Preview, 69.4% of the Consumer Discretionary companies in the S&P 500 index have reported their results, as of Aug 4. The growth rate for earnings and revenues is 9.0% and 10.5%, respectively. In fact, the beat ratio of 68.0% and 56.0% for the bottom and top line, respectively, is also noteworthy.Leisure Stocks in FocusComing to the leisure companies from the Consumer Discretionary sector, we note that their performance has been healthy so far this earnings season as they usually see an uptick during the spring and summer seasons.Notably, among the leisure stocks that have already reported results, Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.

(RCL  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  have delivered an impressive performance with the bottom and top lines surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Meanwhile, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.

In fact,SeaWorld has witnessed negative earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters, with an average miss of 17.07%.For the quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of -5.88%, which makes surprise prediction difficult even though it has a Zacks Rank #3. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s bottom line is pegged at 34 cents.It is to be noted that SeaWorld’s total revenue per capita has been under pressure mostly due to lower attendance, especially from Latin American and the UK visitors.

530,NCLH,"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 22, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.2%. Norwegian Cruise Line has also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of approximately 3.8%.Notably, the stock’s impressive earnings history is well reflected in its robust price performance in a year's time. While the company has gained 24.7%, the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry rallied 20.5%.Things look rosy for the company in the soon-to-be reported quarter as well. Strong passenger ticket revenues are likely to boost results.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 earnings has remained stable at 63 cents per share over the last 30 days. However, this reflects a year-over-year improvement of 12.5%. The consensus mark for sales of $1.26 billion also indicates a 11.9% increase from the prior-year quarter.Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on the company’s results in the quarter to be reported.We expect Norwegian Cruise Line’s top line in the fourth quarter to be aided by increased ticket revenues. Additionally, improved pricing and an increase in Capacity Days should aid the company’s revenues. The impressive demand for cruise travel also seems to bode well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for passenger ticket revenues in the quarter is pegged at $841 million, above $759 million reported by the company in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Additionally, Capacity Days are projected to increase approximately 9% year over year. Gross yield is anticipated to be higher on a year-over-year basis.Furthermore, the company is expected to benefit from robust marketing initiatives in the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, we expect high costs to limit Norwegian Cruise Line’s bottom-line growth in the quarter. Investments undertaken by the company to upgrade the facilities for travel are also pushing up costs. Moreover, an increase in fuel prices is further likely to prove detrimental to the company’s earnings growth.What Does Our Model Indicate?Our proven model shows that Norwegian Cruise Line is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.

531,NCLH,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 numbers on Aug 7, after market close.Last quarter, Marriott came up with a positive earnings surprise of 12.22%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four-quarters, with an average beat of 5.21%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Marriott International Price and EPS Surprise  Marriott International Price and EPS Surprise | Marriott International QuoteFactors Likely to Influence Q2 ResultsFor the second quarter, earnings per share are estimated between 99 cents and $1.03. Notably, Marriott’s earnings have been surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate consistently in the last 12 quarters. Given the company’s increased scale and distribution post Starwood purchase, its top-line is likely get a boost in the to-be-reported quarter. This, in turn, should drive the bottom-line and aid in keeping up the earnings streak.Meanwhile, Marriott expects comparable system-wide revenue per available room (RevPAR) to be flat to up 2% in North America on a constant dollar basis. RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties is projected to inch up in the range of 1- 3%. Outside North America, the company expects the same to increase in the 3- 5% band. Notably, the company's RevPAR guidance for the second quarter reflects the unfavorable shift of Easter into the same period.The company also anticipates fee revenues between $820 million and $835 million. While the operating income is projected in the range of $620-$640 million, general, administrative and other expenses are projected between $220 million and $225 million.Moreover, increasing business and leisure travel on the back of improving economic indicators and positive employment numbers, along with strong transient demand might boost performance. Marriott’s rising North American business and large international exposure are also expected to drive growth in the quarter. Furthermore, investments in technology for hotel bookings are likely to improve guest experience, which in turn is anticipated to boost occupancy.However, lingering global uncertainty in some key operating regions is likely to limit revenue growth. Also, heightened competition in the domestic market given increased supply is expected to mar second-quarter RevPAR.Additionally, the company has been witnessing fewer international guests at its U.S. hotels for the last few quarters, given the stronger dollar. This, in turn, may hurt revenues and profits in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Marriott this quarter.

QuoteFactors Likely to Influence Q2 ResultsHealthy demand for each of the company’s different product categories for climbing, mountaineering and skiing across all geographic regions, particularly in North America, might drive the top line in the second quarter.Moreover, this sporting goods company’s strategies like streamlining of manufacturing processes and overhead cost reduction are expected to boost the quarter’s performance. Meanwhile, increased investments in marketing campaigns is strengthening brand equity and translating into strong bookings for fall 2017. This coupled with product innovation are likely to further propel the quarterly results.Black Diamond’s independent global distributor business is also likely to experience growth in the quarter, particularly in the large Asian markets. In fact, a strong load of preseason orders facilitated by improved availability of products, and efforts to encourage distributors to increase the company’s brand presence within retailers are expected to be driving factors.However, negative currency translations may impact sales and gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter.

534,NCLH,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 numbers on Aug 3, before market opens. We expect the company to surpass expectations.Last quarter, the company came up with a positive earnings surprise of 2.70%. In fact, its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 2.64%.Wyndham Worldwide Corp Price and EPS Surprise Wyndham Worldwide Corp Price and EPS Surprise | Wyndham Worldwide Corp QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Wyndham is likely to beat on earnings because it has the perfect combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Wyndham has an Earnings ESP of +1.33% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.53 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.51. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Wyndham currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Wyndham’s favorable Zacks Rank and positive Earnings ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors at PlayWyndham’s diversified product portfolio, prudent acquisitions and robust marketing efforts are expected to drive earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, last December, the company acquired Latin America's leading Fen Hotels while the company’s Vacation Rentals entered into a strategic partnership with Unique Ventures (Veeve). Both these deals are expected to boost sales considerably as they add to the company’s international presence.Meanwhile, increasing business and leisure travel on the back of an improving economy and positive employment numbers, along with higher transaction volumes should also boost the quarter’s results.Furthermore, Wyndham’s robust vacation ownership or timeshare business is one of the fastest evolving and profitable sectors in the hospitality industry and is likely to further propel second-quarter performance. Also, its attractive Loyalty and Rewards Program along with other strategic initiatives undertaken are expected to increase occupancy.However, lingering uncertainty in various economies like Europe, Brazil and Africa might limit revenue growth. Also, soft demand in oil producing regions is likely to hurt revenue per available room (RevPAR) in the to-be-reported quarter. Consumer concerns related to pandemic virus like Zika may somewhat temper growth in the Caribbean region too.Moreover, given Wyndham’s considerable international operations, negative currency translation might continue hampering the company’s results as it has been doing over the last few quarters.Notably, though the new owner strategy is expected to benefit Wyndham’s timeshare business in the long run, it is expected to weigh on the company’s revenues and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) in the to-be-reported quarter.Stocks to ConsiderWyndham is not the only company looking up this earnings season. Here are some other companies in the Consumer Discretionary sector to consider as our model shows they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Time Warner Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #2.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

535,NCLH,"On Oct 18, we issued an updated research report on cruise and vacation company Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report).Last month, the company posted better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, Carnival anticipates fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.64 to $3.70 (previous projection was in the range of $3.60 to $3.70).In fact, the company continues to reflect strength in several areas and is thus expected to continue performing well in the quarters ahead.Key Growth DriversOf late, Carnival has been continually introducing new flagships to formulate measured capacity growth over time. This also allows its global fleet to meet escalating demand for cruise vacations in every region of the world. In fact, the company currently has 18 new ships planned to be delivered between 2018 and 2022.We note that the launch of new ships is also a part of the company’s long-term strategy to build state-of-the-art vessels that aid in providing guests with a remarkable vacation experience at an exceptional value. Given burgeoning demand for cruise travel, the addition of ships to its fleet bodes well.Meanwhile, Carnival continues to drive revenue yield growth by creating demand in excess of measured capacity growth through its ongoing guest experience, marketing and public relations effort.The company is particularly positive on its recent innovations like the transformational new ocean experience platform, featuring Ocean Medallion, a guest experience platform; PlayOcean, a proprietary mobile gaming portfolio and OceanView, a proprietary digital streaming network. These new offerings are anticipated to accelerate and expand engagement and step up the company’s already high guest experience delivery by leveraging its industry-leading scale.Carnival also believes that it is well positioned for continued earnings growth, given the current strength in its bookings. In fact, management noted that cumulative bookings for the first half of 2018 are still well ahead of the prior year at higher prices, at this point in time. It thus expects revenue yields (in constant dollars) to continue improving in fiscal 2018 backed by marketing initiatives and a better booking environment.Markedly, Carnival has adopted a strategy to grow beyond its familiar itineraries and capitalize on new markets. The Asian source market for cruises is expected to continue growing significantly as it becomes more consumer-driven. Going forward, the company expects to continue profitably growing its presence in China and throughout Asia. Carnival is especially optimistic about growth prospects of the Japanese and Australian markets.  In the meantime, the company continues to lookout for sailing to new destinations in order to drive demand for cruising. Already, Carnival had sailed to markets like Cuba, Mexico and Bermuda in fiscal 2016, where demand is expected to ramp up and boost revenues, significantly.Bottom LineDoes this mean that the company has been lying on a bed of roses? Well, not really!Continual strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the functional currencies of the company’s foreign operations is likely to adversely impact the company’s results. Moreover, an increase in fuel prices may further prove detrimental to the company’s earnings growth.Lingering global uncertainties in certain international markets has also been keeping growth at check. Meanwhile, increased investments in advertising, TV programming and other revenue generating opportunities might put pressure on near-term margins and earnings.In addition, the company faces competition from other cruise operators including Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report).However, notwithstanding the headwinds, Carnival is well poised for growth given its global leader position in the cruise industry and an expected increase in demand for cruise travel, going forward.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

536,NCLH,"Shares of cruise line companies surged on Tuesday after Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and signaled that the recent wave of tropical storms in the Caribbean didn’t destroy its bottom line.Carnival reported earnings of $2.29 per share (excluding $0.46 in non-recurring items), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.20 per share. The company also beat sales expectations, with $5.52 billion in revenues topping our estimate of $5.39 billion. Carnival’s quarterly revenues popped 8.2% and increased for the seventh straight quarter.What investors might appreciate even more is the fact that the string of powerful hurricanes in the Caribbean, including Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, did not greatly impact Carnival.The storm’s devastation would likely not have affected the company in its third quarter, but Carnival said that it expects to continue full-speed ahead during the holiday travel season, having avoided any major impact from the storms.""Many people throughout these areas have been impacted and several ports are temporarily unavailable,” Carnival President and CEO Arnold Donald said in a statement. “Fortunately, our owned destinations including Amber Cove, Dominican Republic; Cozumel, Mexico; Mahogany Bay, Honduras; Half Moon Cay and Princess Cays, Bahamas, as well as more than 40 other ports, plus all those in Mexico, are fully operational and welcoming guests.""The tropical storms did force Carnival to lower its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings and revenue projections slightly, but these estimates are still calling for year-over-year growth and are higher than previously anticipated.The company now expects full-year 2017 net revenues to climb 4%, which is up from its June guidance. Carnival projects to post fourth-quarter earnings between $0.44 and $0.50 per share and full-year earnings in the range of $3.64 to $3.70 a share.On top of this, Carnival's cumulative bookings for the first half of next year are ahead of last year’s rates. The company has also been able to boost its on-ship experiences, which helped it raise overall ticket prices 5%.Shares of Carnival climbed over 4% in morning trading to hit $66.25 per share, which is roughly $3.50 below its 52-week high. Carnival stock has already gained 40.53% year-to-date, blowing away the S&P 500 average of 10.18%.Rest of Industry Aside from the very real and devastating impact on homes, property, infrastructure, and peoples’ safety and lives, it seems that the string of Caribbean hurricanes have not really hurt the cruise industry.Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH  -  Free Report) popped over 2.75% on Tuesday, while Royal Caribbean (RCL  -  Free Report) saw its stock price jump over 3%.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.
