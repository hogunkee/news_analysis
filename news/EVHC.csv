23,EVHC,"The IPO Leaders screen has yielded some big breakouts lately from the likes of two midcaps, Envision Healthcare (EVHC) and Intrexon (XON).Meanwhile, names like Diplomat Pharmacy (DPLO), Ambarella (AMBA) and Globant (GLOB) continue to show solid supporting action at the 10-week moving average.Don't chase them, though, because they're all extended from proper buy points.The good news is that three names in today's screen boast compelling fundamentals and are near proper buy points.For a small-cap name, Inogen (INGN) has a lot going for it.

"
25,EVHC,"Hospital emergency rooms have their hands full providing care.And from the incessant sounds of sirens echoing through many city streets, ambulance operators seem just as busy.Outsourcing these services has become common practice. Envision Healthcare Holdings (EVHC) comes to the rescue on both fronts.The Colorado-based company is a leading player in staffing hospital emergency departments through its EmCare division and providing medical transport through American Medical Response, or AMR.Both businesses have ""brand recognition,"" said Envision Chief Executive William Sanger, who has been overseeing both as CEO since 2005.Envision went public last year, for the second time — two years after a private-equity firm had taken it private again. But the firm's roots go back much further.EmCare, the larger business of the two, was founded in 1972, two decades before AMR. At first it provided emergency-department staffing and related services to hospitals in Texas. But acquisitions broadened its reach nationwide.Now more of EmCare's growth is organic rather than acquired.Doctors On CallHospitals can buy single services or bundled packages to meet their staffing needs. EmCare can provide ER physicians, trauma surgeons, anesthesiologists, radiologists and ""hospitalists"" — doctors who give care in the hospital after an initial episode is treated.""They have really differentiated themselves with their bundled offerings. And that's led to industry leading organic growth,"" said analyst Richard Close of Avondale Partners.He says Envision's new contracts are growing 13% to 15% annually. In contrast, chief rival Team Health Holdings (TMH) is primarily growing through acquisitions, he says.On the medical transportation side, competition is fragmented. About 50% of 911 emergency requests are handled by local fire departments, the other half by private ambulance services, Sanger says.Not only is Envision's AMR the largest of its kind in the country, it has been ""benefiting from financial woes of some competitors,"" says Jason Gurda, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets.For example, one of its largest rivals, Rural/Metro, declared bankruptcy last year. More recently, a smaller rival ""went out of business overnight,"" he said.Sanger says AMR has ""several hundred 911 contracts and literally thousands of relationships with hospitals,"" the latter for transporting patients to facilities such as dialysis centers and nursing homes.""We've identified protocols to improve survival rates,"" Sanger said of its ambulance service. AMR gets high marks in cardiac survival and is looking to improve stroke survival rates.Both of Envision's core businesses are getting modest boosts from health care reform under the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.""It's translating into more patients, more revenue and more profit,"" Sanger said of expanded insurance coverage under ObamaCare.The 20% of patients who weren't able to pay for ambulance services or emergency-room visits is now closer to 18% because of ObamaCare, he says.""Generally the positive impact from the Affordable Care Act has been a shift from the uninsured into Medicaid,"" Close said.Health care reform has also put a sharper focus on integrated health care, which is a positive for Envision. Reimbursement based on outcomes or quality metrics has ""positioned Envision to be a partner to hospital systems,"" Gurda said.That's because EmCare provides a more integrated approach to health care than the fragmented care typically delivered by hospital staffs, he says.""One of the things EmCare does well is help those partners achieve quality outcomes. Part of it is being focused — making that a key operational point for employees. And it's invested quite a bit on the (information technology) side,"" Gurda said.New Hospital DealsSuch strategies have led to a growing number of contract wins with hospitals, which in turn is driving much of the company's revenue growth. Revenue year-over-year has grown in double digits for seven straight quarters.EmCare has around 750 individual contracts with hospitals or hospital systems, Sanger says. Its largest ones are with Hospital Corporation of America, or HCA Holdings (HCA), and Baylor Health Care System in Texas.EmCare generated net revenue of $690 million in the second quarter, a 21.2% gain over the prior year. AMR's revenue rose 16.7% to $385.3 million, its strongest performance in years.Total revenue in the second quarter jumped 19.6% from the earlier year to $1.08 billion. Adjusted earnings were 28 cents a share, up from the equivalent of 5 cents in the prior year.Based on improving financial results this year, Envision raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $1.15 to $1.20 from $1.10 to $1.15 previously. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year revenue to climb 17% over last year to nearly $4.4 billion and per-share earnings to rise 73% to $1.17.Aftercare OpportunityA third business, called Evolution Health, is in early development. It currently generates just a small amount of revenue, Sanger says.Evolution embraces a ""continuum of care"" model, he says, which seeks to manage patients' health care after they are discharged from a hospital.""We started an integrated-care model in the hospital so we're taking it to another level,"" Sanger said.Evolution has been lining up work with health plans to manage their most seriously ill customers and has already hired roughly 1,500 clinicians.Starting in January, Envision's Evolution will spearhead six pilot programs in conjunction with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, involving the ""sickest patients,"" Sanger says.He thinks Evolution will grow quickly over the next five to seven years.""It could be the size of our other two services,"" Sanger said.

However, Envision's post-LBO (leveraged buyout) liquidity is not reflected through the SGL-1 rating.Ratings RepresentationThe rating agency review of KKR’s pending LBO of the company will be focused on the go-forward capital structure and resulting leverage, coverage as well as cash flow generating capabilities. Moreover, its B1 Corporate Family Rating shows the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy as well as its moderately high financial leverage.Envision’s credit profile is supported by its scale and market position as the largest physician outsourcer.

36,EVHC,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Envision Healthcare Corporation (EVHC  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 4.6% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is EVHC due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Envision Healthcare Q4 Earnings Beat, Revenues RiseEnvision Healthcare  reported fourth-quarter earnings of 59 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18%. Earnings significantly declined from $1.08 reported in the year-ago quarter, due to high operating expense.Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter came at $211.4 million, up 14.8% year over year.The company reported net revenues of $2 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1% and improved 68% year over year.The company incurred a net benefit of approximately $600 million from a reduction of deferred tax liabilities from the Tax Reform Act as well as a non-cash impairment charge of $500 million in goodwill reduction in its Physician Services segment.Total operating expenses of $2.36 billion increased 82.7% year over year, due to higher salaries and benefits, insurance expenses and depreciation & amortization expenses.Favorable Segment PerformancePhysician ServicesNet revenues from the segment were $1.67 billion, reflecting an increase of 8.3% year over year. The revenue growth was driven by 8.6% contribution from acquisitions and 0.4% from same contracts.Adjusted EBITDA was $133.1 million, up 10.5% year over year.Ambulatory ServicesNet revenues were $333.1 million, up nearly 2% year over year, led by procedure volume growth.For the reported quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $78.3 million, up 23.1% year over year thanks to a $7.7 million favorable legal settlement.Financial UpdateEnvision Healthcare had cash and cash equivalents of $312.2 million, down 1.4% year over year.Total long-term debt increased 8.2% year over year to $6.26 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.The company’s ratio of total net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA on Dec 31, 2017 as calculated under its credit agreement was 4.6 times.Net cash provided by operating activities was $236.4 million as of Dec 31, 2017, up from $68.8 million as of Dec 31, 2016.First-Quarter 2018 GuidanceThe company expects adjusted EPS within the range of 61 cents and 67 cents and adjusted EBITDA in the band of $195-$205 million.Full-Year 2018 GuidanceThe company expects net revenues in the range of $8.35 to $8.53 billion, adjusted EBIDTA of $960 million to $1 billion and adjusted EPS between $3.46 and $3.70.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

37,EVHC,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Envision Healthcare Corporation (EVHC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Envision Healthcare has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.09, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.95. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Envision Healthcare’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 19.76 over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it could be a great entry point.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.03. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Envision Healthcare has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 10.54, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Envision Healthcare stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Envision Healthcare has a P/S ratio of about 0.59. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.37 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, EVHC is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Envision Healthcare currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Envision Healthcare a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Envision Healthcare is just 0.88, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.44. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 6.13, which is far better than the industry average of 13.63. Clearly, EVHC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Envision Healthcare might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B. This gives EVHC a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher and lower each, in the past sixty days, while the full year estimate has seen eight upward and three downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 10.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Envision Healthcare Corporation Price and Consensus  Envision Healthcare Corporation Price and Consensus | Envision Healthcare Corporation QuoteThis indicates that though the company may face some short-term hurdles, its ongoing prospects look promising. Notably, Envision Healthcare sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineEnvision Healthcare is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, this Zacks Rank #2 company enjoys a solid Zacks Industry Rank (among top 21% of more than 250 industries).So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

38,EVHC,"Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) is well poised for growth on the back of its recent business-boosting pacts. In March 2018,  it has purchased a stake in cloud-based pharmacy benefit manager, RxAdvance, which should help it to  lower drug costs and provide improved health care services.The stock further looks attractive given its successful acquisition of Health Net, which has led to membership growth, strong medicaid business and a solid balance sheet. Moreover, its pending acquisition of Community Medical Holdings Corp, MHM Services, Inc. and Fidelis Care should drive long-term growth in a highly regulated industry.Estimates of Centene have moved upward over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the stock. The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year and 2019 earnings being revised 22% and 23% upward to $7.07 and $8.13, respectively.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have outperformed its industry in a year’s time. The stock has soared 54.2% compared with the industry’s growth of 35.1%.  Let’s focus on the factors that make Centene an attractive pick for investors.Solid 2018 Guidance: Centene has issued its earnings guidance for 2018. It expects adjusted earnings per share to range between $6.95 to 47.35. This is not only higher than the previous projection of $5.47-$5.87 but also reflects a 42% rise over 2017 earnings. The medical insurer also anticipates operating revenues in the band of $60.6-$61.4 billion, up from the earlier view of $60.0-$60.8 billion and lying 26% above the value of 2017 revenues. This upbeat outlook further instills shareholders' optimism on the stock.Consistent Top-line Growth: Centene has witnessed steady revenue growth over the past several years (CAGR of 42% from 2012 to 2017). Revenues have followed this uptrend on the back of the company’s solid inorganic strategies. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $61 billion, reflecting 26% year over year growth.Strong Capital Position: Centene’s solid cash position has enabled the company to deploy capital most effectively in order to enhance shareholders’ value. Net cash flow from operations, which has been increasing since 2010 (except for 2017), has financed most of the company’s growth-oriented investments.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Centene boasts an encouraging earnings surprise history, having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 9.8%.Attractive Valuation: Going by the price to earnings (P/E) ratio, Centene is trading at a forward 12-month P/E multiple of 14.5x, lower than the industry average of 17.3x. This also compares favorably with the S&P 500 index’s average of 18.1x. The company’s valuation indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued compared with its peers. The stock carries an impressive Value Score of A.  Back tested results have shown that stocks with a Value Score of A or B combined with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer best investment bets.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the medical sector can also consider some other top-ranked stocks like AMN Healthcare Services Inc.

39,EVHC,"Envision Healthcare Corporation (EVHC  -  Free Report) has completed the divestiture of its medical transportation business, American Medical Response, to an entity affiliated with KKR & Co. This divestiture was announced in August 2017. Sales proceeds of $2.1 billion from the transaction will be utilized, to pay off the company’s debt, which will improve its balance sheet position.The company’s total debt has been increasing over the past many years. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had total debt of approximately $6.4 billion, up 10.3% year over year. The rise in leverage has consequently led to a spike in interest expenses, increasing from $17 million in 2012 to $142.4 million in 2016. Interest expenses in 2017 also rose 62% year over year. Envision's debt is about 4.6 times EBITDA, which is above the 3 to 4 times EBITDA that it is comfortable with.With this sale, Envision Healthcare will be focusing on its two main businesses — Physician Services with 84% revenue mix and Ambulatory Surgery contributing the rest.  The company is optimistic about the physician services market ($90-$100 billion addressable and highly fragmented market), which is witnessing consolidation. Various factors such as mandate for clinical integration, value-based pricing innovation, lack of scaled physician practices, shortage of physician supply, hospital cost pressures, MACRA readiness and finally, increasing regulations will lead to increased demand for physician services.In order to expedite growth in the Physician Services business, the company is planning to grow inorganically. It had an active acquisition strategy in 2017, having invested more than $758 million in buyouts for the full year. The company will continue to invest its free cash flow (expected $400 million) in accretive acquisitions and expects the M&A activity to add an extra 4-5% to its growth profile.The company has also undertaken operational improvements initiatives. Via revenue cycle management, clinical labor management and operational efficiencies, the company has plans to realize $50 million of incremental adjusted EBIDTA in 2018.In six month’s time, the stock has lost 17% underperforming the industry’s growth of 4.23%.

40,EVHC,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is BioScrip, Inc. (BIOS  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in BIOS.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen two estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from a loss of 21 cents a share a month ago to its current level of a loss of 24 cents.Also, for the current quarter, BioScrip has seen two downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 11 cents a share from a loss of 9 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 8.1% in the past month.BioScrip, Inc. Price and Consensus BioScrip, Inc. Price and Consensus | BioScrip, Inc.

43,EVHC,"Investors in Envision Healthcare Corporation (EVHC  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 15, 2018 $35.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Envision Healthcare shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Envision Healthcare is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry that ranks in the Top 11% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 95 cents per share to 90 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Envision Healthcare right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

44,EVHC,"Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 and full-year results on Feb 27, 2018. The company anticipates an increase in revenues from the company's Physician Services segment (contributing nearly 84% of the company’s revenues), driven by synergy from recent acquisitions as well as organic growth.Revenue growth in the segment is likely to come from higher patient volumes as well as improved pricing. We also anticipate an improved EBIDTA, possibly benefiting from merger-related synergies. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segmental revenues is pegged at $1.65 billion compared with $865.8 million reported a year ago.The company’s Ambulatory service segment will likely report decline in revenues due to disposal of centers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment stands at $324 million, down from $326.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Moreover, the company is reeling under escalating operating expenses for several quarters on higher salaries and benefits expenses. Most alarming is the rate at which the metric rose, which has overshadowed the revenue growth rate, thwarting the company’s bottom-line growth in turn. The same is forecast in the to-be-reported quarter.A huge debt load is also affecting Envision Healthcare. Its total debt burden has been swelling since 2013, leading to a spike in interest expense. This in turn might also dent the company’s operating margins.Company's Preliminary ResultsEarlier this February 2018, the company came up with preliminary fourth-quarter 2017 and full-year numbers. Envision Healthcare projects net revenues from continuing operations at approximately $2.0 billion and adjusted EBITDA at or slightly above the high end of its guided range of $182-$202 million.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company has a mixed earnings history.

49,EVHC,"Teldoc Inc.’s (TDOC  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results, scheduled for release on Feb 27, are expected to witness an increase in patient visits — one of the major revenue drivers.The company’s Telehealth services are gaining rapid acceptance due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness and superior quality, which are driving demand. Consequently, the company witnessed increased patient visits in the fourth quarter. Also, the acquisition of HealthiestYou and Best Doctors is expected to have driven visits and call volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for patient visits is 436,206, reflecting an improvement of 45% year over year.A major component of the company’s revenues is  subscription access fees, which account for 80-85% of revenues.

Since the company has been consistently gaining clients by virtue of its superior service, a wide network of doctors and round-the-clock medical assistance, this revenue component is expected to see a surge in the upcoming quarterly results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $64 million, which translates into year-over-year growth of 110.5%.The company is in its growth phase and incurring heavy expenditure in the form of substantial investments made to acquire new clients, build proprietary network of healthcare providers and develop technology platform. The bottom line will witness a drain, thanks to huge expenses on higher advertising, sales, technology and development, general and administrative functions as well as depreciation and amortization.However, expenditures are likely to decline as the company has started to realize leverage from the scale of its operation.Q4 Preliminary ResultsFourth-quarter revenues of $76 million were up 103% year over year.

51,EVHC,"Proper guidance is often the difference between success and failure in life. The same holds true for the investing world. The need for proper guidance is all the more required now as the Q4 earnings season is just round the corner. This is because investors would look to add stocks to their respective portfolios, which have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the current reporting cycle. This is because an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation.The task of designing one’s portfolio with outperformers is by no means an easy one. The uncertainties in the investment world make the task a daunting one. Moreover, a deluge of stocks flood the market at any given point in time. In the absence of proper guidance, identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for ‘a needle in a haystack’, for an investor. The proper guidance, in this respect, comes from brokers, who are deemed to be experts, equipped with vast knowledge of investing.Of the three types of brokers/analysts (sell-side, buy-side and independent) present in the investment world, sell-side analysts are most common. Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research. Buy-side analysts are employed by hedge funds, mutual funds etc. while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors.Earnings Estimate Revisions – A Proper GuideBroker ratings are backed by sound logic and are by no means arbitrary. Brokers, not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents, but also attend company conference calls and other presentations. Naturally, it is in the best interest of investors to pay heed to such well-researched information as they aim to generate maximum returns from their portfolio.Since brokers closely follow the stocks in their coverage, they revise earnings estimates only after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company. In fact, a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to influence the price of the stock.Naturally, when investors see brokers revising their estimates or recommendation on a stock, they often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention. In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation. Similarly, the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade.Estimates can move north for a number of reasons – favorable earnings performance, a bullish guidance, product launch or any favorable macro scenario.Framing a Winning Strategy The above write-up clearly suggests that by following broker actions, one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks. Keeping this in mind, we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions to earnings estimates over the last four weeks.Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it has been included. The price/sales ratio takes care of the company’s top line, making the strategy foolproof.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last four weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past for weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Sonic Automotive (SAH  -  Free Report) is one of the leading automotive retailers in the United States.

52,EVHC,"First-quarter earnings (reported so far) have showed all-around strength backed by a strong economy. Even the Fed, in a recent comment, stated that “economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.” Business investment “continued to grow strongly,” reinstating the firm footing that the U.S. economy is on.Importantly, the U.S. economy featured a record-low unemployment rate and gradual wage increase, both of which bode well for the healthcare sector. High employment increases demand for healthcare, and in turn the size of the healthcare market. This in turn pushes up the number of participants with the entry of new hospitals or expansion of existing hospitals, expansion of products and services by insurers, higher demand for diagnostic and lab service operators, and more.Moreover, an increase in wages would raise consumers’ propensity to spend on costly healthcare services (it is to be noted that U.S. healthcare is the costliest in the world). While insurance covers a large part of healthcare spending, the rise of high-deductibles health plans in recent years had kept consumers away from the market when the unemployment rate was high and wage growth was low. High deductible requires the insured to pay the initial amount (which is quite high), before the insurance coverage kicks in.The overall bullishness reinforces our sentiment that the growth cadence for the sector should continue. Let’s take a look at the factors affecting Q1 results for payers in this sector.Acute Flu SeasonThe 2017-2018 flu season was severe and has been a shot in the arm for the hospital operators, diagnostic and lab service providers, and companies in the drug supply chain. Most of the hospital companies that reported first-quarter results saw an increase in emergency rooms and inpatient admissions on account of flu.According to an article in Pharmacy Times, this flu season broke records in terms of higher-than-average hospitalization rates. According to the report, the overall and all age-specific hospitalization rates surpassed the end-of-season hospitalization rates for the 2014-2015 season, which was also an influenza-A predominant season categorized as high severity.Nevertheless, increased flu activity has been a pain for insurers, having been slapped with high claim costs as more patients seek treatments and file for claim on their health insurance cover.Aging Population to Fuel DemandThe aging U.S. population has been one of the main drivers for healthcare services, as retirees demand more healthcare services in their old age. The graying population of America has led to an unprecedented rise in demand for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, a private version of the Medicare plan provided by the government to the retirees.While previously Medicare was provided by the government to Americans, saddled with high cost in recent years, the government is increasingly outsourcing this program to the private health insurance, which has effectively managed costs for this program. This has led to an increase in private participation in the MA market. These plans have been highly profitable for health insurers. Since MA members have higher medical utilization rates, they bring in about three times more revenues than commercial members, which has helped top-line growth of the companies engaged in MA. Also, health insurers have been able to maintain profitability in these plans by keeping claim cost down via measures such as preventive healthcare and accountable care organizations. This business has proven to be a cash cow for the health insurance industry. Health insurers UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana Inc., Centene Corp. that have already reported earnings results this quarter have reported an increase in membership in MA, which has aided revenue growth.High CostWe, however, expect to see high capital costs for hospitals as companies invest in the electronic health record system. Moreover, high labor expenses in its largely unionized workforce would cause a rise in labor and wage expenses, which should weigh on their margins. For health insurers, a number of acquisitions made recently should lead to an increase in acquisition integration costs. Adoption of technology would entail greater expenditure too, thereby raising operating costs.Tax ReformAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which became effective in December 2017, companies in the health care space project a reduction in the corporate income tax (CIT) rate.  Most of the companies that have reported first-quarter results so far have seen higher margins on account of lower taxes.The tax reform, however, repealed Obamacare's key requirement that all Americans obtain health insurance, which would cause an increase in uninsured rate. But since this provision will be effective in 2019, we would not feel an impact in the first quarter earnings.3 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Heading in to Q1The aforesaid factors will surely help healthcare companies to emerge as winners in Q1. The healthcare industry is a part of the broader Medical sector.For the Medical sector, we now have Q1 results from 83.1% of the sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these companies are up 14.7% on 8.1% higher revenues, with 88.9% beating EPS and 75% beating revenue estimates.Let’s take a look at some of the stocks that are poised to beat estimates in the first quarter. These stocks have a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) operates as a financial holding company for TBK Bank, SSB that provides banking and commercial finance products and services to retail customers and small-to-mid-sized businesses in the United States. The company is expected to report earnings results for the quarter ending March 2018 on May 7.Envision Healthcare has an Earnings ESP of +0.52% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company surpassed earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 1.15%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Addus HomeCare Corp. (ADUS  -  Free Report) is a comprehensive provider of a broad range of social and medical services in the home. The company's services include personal care and assistance with activities of daily living, skilled nursing and rehabilitative therapies, and adult day care.The company is expected to report earnings results for the first quarter on May 7. Addus HomeCare has an Earnings ESP of +11.39% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company surpassed earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 1.81%.Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc. (ADVM  -  Free Report) is a gene therapy company. The company discovers and develops novel medicines for patients living with rare diseases.The company is expected to report earnings results for the first quarter on May 8. Adverum Biotechnologies has an Earnings ESP of +6.9% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company surpassed earnings in two of the last four quarters.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

53,EVHC,"Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) has disclosed the status of a number of initiatives undertaken for its long-term growth. These initiatives were taken to offset headwinds such as low patient volumes, increased leverage, high operating expense and a weak operating environment.Strategic InitiativesThe company has appointed James D. “Denny” Shelton as lead independent director, effective immediately. It expects to gain from Shelton’s rich experience. Also, for better corporate governance Envision Healthcare will amend its articles of incorporation provided for the election of directors on an annual basis. Changes to this effect will cause the directors to be appointed for a three-year term (in 2018 annual meeting), who will then be reelected every year for one year term.Furthermore, the company plans to modify its bylaws to incorporate proxy access, which implies that a long-term share holder of the company will have the ability to nominate a limited number of director candidates. This, in turn, will lead to a better corporate governance and provide more powers to its long-term shareholder’s, thereby increasing their trust in the company.Envision Healthcare provided an update on its pending divestiture of its medical transportation company — American Medical Response — which is under progress. The company will benefit from the recently enacted tax act, thereby leading to an increase in net proceeds from the sale to $2.1 billion from $1.9 billion as envisaged earlier.Also, the tax reform will cause a reduction in estimated tax liability association with this divestiture transaction. The company intends to use the funds from this sale to pay off its debt, which is expected to improve its balance sheet position.In fact, the company stands to gain from Trump’s tax reform as well, which lowers the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. Additionally, it expects that capital expenditures for continuing operations will be eligible for accelerated depreciation, thus allowing higher deductions in the initial years of an asset's life.This is an important tax incentive that supports a business for purchasing new assets. Further, Envision Healthcare anticipates net interest expenses to be deductible based on thresholds specified in the law.For fiscal 2018, the company stated that it is on track to generate $50 million of savings from operational improvements..Its operating margins for 2018 will also witness an improvement of 50 basis points from reduced overhead expenses and more efficient revenue cycle management. Envision Healthcare intends to make additional cost saves from effective labor cost management.Moreover, it reaffirmed the company’s financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017, which included revenue of $1.88 billion to $2.02 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $182 million to $202 million and adjusted EPS of $0.44 to $0.54. This excludes an anticipated benefit from a reduction of net deferred tax liabilities associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Will These Initiatives Assist a Bounce Back?Envision Healthcare’s headwinds weighed on its stock price which tanked 46% in a year’s time, significantly underperforming the industry’s decline of 4%. We believe these initiatives will be able to relieve the company and help it to address its low profitability. But we choose to remain on sidelines til the effects of these strategies are reflected in earnings numbers.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderEnvision Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the healthcare space are Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report), Amedisys Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report) and Chemed Corp. (CHE  -  Free Report). While Centene sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), the other two stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

54,EVHC,"Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) has lately fallen out of investors’ favor due a number of factors working against it. These include low patient volumes, increased leverage, high operating expense and a weak operating environment.The company’s bleak outlook is evident from its dismal stock performance and recent fall in estimates. Further, the company now has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Stock Continues to DeclineShares of Envision Healthcare have plunged 47% year to date, against the industry’s decline of 2.5%.  Estimates Trend Down on Bleak ViewFollowing the dismal quarter, the company provided a bleak view for 2017, which led to a downtrend in estimates.The Zacks Consensus Estimate moved south in the last 60 days. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has declined 19% to $2.72 per share. The same for 2018 has moved down 22% to $3.06 per share.What’s Bothering?Weak Guidance: For 2017, the company lowered its adjusted EBIDTA guidance. The guidance calls for EBIDTA of $922 million, down from the previous guidance of $1.02 billion to $1.04 billion. This reduction is attributable to downward revision in same contracts and met the new contract outlook in the Physician Services segment. This is the third time this year that the company has cut its guidance. This raises a question on the company’s ability to perform, thus raising skepticism among investors.Challenges in Physicians Services segment: The unit that generates most of the company’s revenues carries a weak outlook for 2017. An expected decline in same contract outlook and net new contract revenues will weigh down the segment’s revenues. Same Contract assumptions were driven by lower-than-expected seasonal anesthesia rate increases from the first half of 2017 to the second half. Lower-than-expected emergency department rate increase, net volume growth and higher labor and other supportive costs will keep the segment’s earnings under pressure.Increasing Debt: The company’s total debt has been increasing for the past many years. As of Dec 31, 2016, the company had total debt of approximately $5.79 billion, 145.6% higher year over year. For the first nine months, the same increased 8.4% from end 2016. The rise in leverage has consequently led to a spike in interest expense from $17 million in 2012 to $142.4 million in 2016. The same for the first nine months of 2017 increased 77% year over year. Envision's debt is about 6.8 times EBITDA, which is above 3 to 4 times EBITDA that the company feels comfortable at. Such high debt levels increase leverage risk and increasing interest costs may dent the company’s margins.  High Operating Expense: The company’s operating expense has been increasing over the past many years. Most alarming is the rate of increase of operating expense, which is higher than the revenue growth rate. To be specific, operating expense increased at an average of 54% from 2012-2016 while revenues grew at an average of 43.4% during the same time frame. The same trend was seen in the first nine months of 2017, with expense rising 183.4%, surpassing revenue growth of 152%. This increase in expense has put pressure on the bottom line and will continue to do so in the coming quarters.Though the company has undertaken a strategic review of a broad range of alternatives to enhance shareholder value, the stock will remain on the sidelines until the results show sustained profitability.Forget Envision Healthcare, Check These Healthcare StocksSome better-ranked stocks in the healthcare space are Amedisys Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report), Chemed Corp. (CHE  -  Free Report), and Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report). Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Amedisys beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four reported quarters, with an average positive surprise of 13.1%.Chemed Corp. surpassed estimates in three of the last four reported quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.9%.Centene Corp. gave positive surprises in each of the last four quarters, with an average of 10.6%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

55,EVHC,"Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) is suffering low patient volumes, increased leverage, high operating expenses and a weak operating environment.These headwinds induced the company’s earnings miss in the third quarter. The bottom line also declined year over year.The company’s negatives have taken a toll on its share price, tumbling 53% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 11%.So What’s Dragging Down the Stock?Decline in Guidance: For 2017, the company lowered its adjusted EBIDTA guidance. The full-year guidance calls for EBIDTA of $922 million, down from the previously guided-range of $1.02-$1.04 billion. This decrease is attributable to the downward revision in same contracts and new contracts outlook in the Physician Services segment. This unfavorable sentiment around the stock raises a question on the company’s ability to perform, spreading skepticism among its investors.Soft Physicians Services Segment: The unit generating most of the company’s revenues carries a weak outlook for 2017. An expected decline in same contract outlook and net new contract revenues will weigh on the segment’s revenues. Same contract assumptions were driven by lower-than-expected seasonal anesthesia rate increases from the first half of 2017 to the second half. Lower than expected emergency department rate increase, net volume growth and higher labor and other supportive costs will keep the segment’s earnings under pressure.High Leverage: The company’s total debt has been on the rise for the past many years. As of Dec 31, 2016, the company had total debt of approximately $5.79 billion, up 145.6% year over year. For the first nine months, the same increased 8.4% from 2016 year-end level. The rise in leverage has consequently led to a spike in interest expenses, which increased from $17 million in 2012 to $142.4 million in 2016.  The same for the first nine months of 2017 soared 77% year over year. Such high-debt levels increase the leverage risk and mounting interest costs may dent the company’s margins.  High Operating Expenses: The company’s operating expenses have been increasing over the past many years. Most alarming is the rate of rise of operating expenses, exceeding the revenue growth rate. To be specific, operating expenses escalated at an average rate of 54% from 2012 to 2016 while revenues grew at an average rate of 43.4% during the same time frame. The same trend was seen in the first nine months of 2017 with expenses skyrocketing by 183.4% and sadly, surpassing even the revenue growth of 152%. This growth in expenses has put pressure on the bottom line and is likely to persist in the coming quarters too.Though the company has undertaken a strategic review of a broad range of alternatives to enhance shareholder value, the stock will remain dull until the results show sustained profitability.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderEnvision Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the healthcare space are Amedisys Inc.

56,EVHC,"Investors in Envision Healthcare Corporation (EVHC  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 15, 2017 $80 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Envision Healthcare shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Envision Healthcare is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry that ranks in the Bottom 20% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have revised their estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 99 cents per share to 57 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Envision Healthcare right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

57,EVHC,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Envision Healthcare Corporation (EVHC  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in EVHC.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 10 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $3.39 a share a month ago to its current level of $2.85.Also, for the current quarter, Envision Healthcarehas seen six downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 56 cents a share from 99 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 37.6% in the past month.Envision Healthcare Corporation Price and Consensus Envision Healthcare Corporation Price and Consensus | Envision Healthcare Corporation QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Medical industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Amedisys, Inc.

58,EVHC,"The first-quarter earnings season has crossed the halfway mark, with results from 343 members from the elite S&P 500 index on board. Per the latest Earnings Trends, performances of these index participants indicate a 24% increase in total earnings on 9.5% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 78.4% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 75.8% outperforming on the top line.From the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors), we now have Q1 results from 83.1% of its total market cap in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these companies are up 14.7% on 8.1% higher revenues, with 88.9% beating EPS and 75% beating revenue estimates.Healthcare is part of the broader medical sector, which includes diversified industries like health maintenance organizations (HMOs) popularly known as health insurers, clinical, laboratories and diagnostics research, medical equipment, hospitals & nursing homes, telehealth services and more. The sector is so diverse that a single factor influencing one of the industries latent in it positively can be a negative for the other. For example flu, which causes an increase in medical services utilization, is an earnings driver for the hospital space, while at the same time a negative for insurers as it causes a spike in claim costs.To put it into perspective, the January-to-March 2018 period was an unexpectedly brutal flu season, which led to a spike in medical cost for insurers. But because of UnitedHealth’s superior medical cost management, the flu season did not have any adverse impact on its results. UnitedHealth is considered to be a bellwether for the other companies and its results provide a broad picture of the industry that despite increased flu, the first quarter will be profitable.Health insurers are likely to have witnessed an increase in premium and enrolment from the government businesses — Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. A surge in the baby boomer population has led to higher demand for these policies. Earnings should also see an upside from ancillary and health service businesses, which the health insurers have been investing in for the past many years to diversify the revenue base. These businesses, which focus on data management, management of clinical records, analytics, clinical care, pharmacy care and more, have been a nice contributor to the group’s earnings in recent years and the trend is expected to continue.However, this severe flu season should be a shot in the arm for care providers and other companies all along the pharmaceutical supply chain, as it would lead to higher revenues from increasing hospital visits and drug sales. Companies in the hospital sector should see higher patient revenues and admissions as more patients seek medical help, which in turn should drive their top-line growth.Nevertheless, the hospital companies should continue to feel the heat from walk-in clinics and other outpatient treatment options that have been eating into their admissions volumes for the past many quarters.Let’s find out where the following healthcare stocks insurers stand ahead of their earning releases on May 7.Brookdale Senior Living, Inc. (BKD  -  Free Report) is a leading owner and operator of senior living facilities throughout the United States.

(EVHC  -  Free Report) should see an increase in revenues from its Physician Services segment (which contributes nearly 84% of the company’s revenues), driven by synergies from recent acquisitions, same-contract revenue growth as well new-contract growth.Revenue growth in the segment is expected to come from higher patient volumes, due to the acute flu season in the first quarter.

60,EVHC,"Shares of Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) tumbled to a 52-week low of $26.34 during the trading session on Nov 6. The slide is believed to have been driven by poor third-quarter results and a subsequent guidance cut.   Over the past 52 weeks, shares of Envision Healthcare have ranged from a low of $26.34 to a high of $74.75. The average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 3.26 million.Poor Results BotherInvestors were particularly disappointed by lackluster third-quarter results which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.1% and declined 36% year over year. Earnings from its Physician Services and Ambulatory Service operations were impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which had a negative impact of $22 million on revenues.Also, lower-than-anticipated volumes for emergency medicines and a lower-than-expected anesthesia rate adversely impacted the top line in its core Physician Services business.The continued shift in the composition of health insurance exchange patients from higher paying carriers to carriers that pay a lower rate per encounter, as well as lower acuity, will keep patient volumes under pressure going ahead.Envision Healthcare has struggled following its merger with AmSurg, as soft industry volumes and weaker execution have plagued results. Since then the shares have lost nearly 60% compared with a decline of 7.5% for the industry.Also concerning is fact that the company is reeling under escalating operating expenses for several quarters, due to higher salaries and benefits expenses. The rate of increase in operating expense is the most alarming as it has overshadowed the revenue growth rate, thereby thwarting bottom-line growth. The same was seen in the third quarter.Uninspiring OutlookThe company’s fourth-quarter outlook was grim as it baked in declining emergency medicine volumes and the effect of start up costs. The company now anticipates emergency volume that will be lower than the run rate in the third quarter. The company thus reduced its emergency volume growth expectation from 3% to flat. It also reduced its emergency rates to amounts consistent with the third quarter. These two factors account for approximately $28 million of adjusted EBITDA.Second, the company’s previous forecast assumed a lift in anesthesia rate, similar to what it experienced in the fourth quarter of 2016. Its revised outlook assumes the same anesthesia rate as it experienced in the third quarter. From the prior year, the anesthesia rate is projected to decline approximately 2.5% to 3%. This change accounts for approximately $22 million to $25 million.Overall, the revised outlook for the fourth quarter includes the following: revenue of $1.88 billion to $2.02 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $182 million to $202 million, and adjusted EPS of $0.44 to $0.54. Also, same-contract growth for Physician Services was modified to 2% to 3% from the previous assumption of 3% to 4%.Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, the stock has lost 60%, significantly underperforming the industry’s decline of 3%. The continued deceleration of health sector utilization will keep business volumes under pressure in the coming quarters. We thus do not expect any breather for the stock anytime soon.Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider.Envision Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some of the better-ranked stocks in the same space are Amedisys Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report), Chemed Corp. (CHE  -  Free Report) and LHC Group (LHCG  -  Free Report). Each of these stock carries a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy).

62,EVHC,"Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report), expected to report  first-quarter 2018 results on May 7, should see an increase in revenues from its Physician Services segment (which contributes nearly 84% of the company’s revenues), driven by synergies from recent acquisitions, same-contract revenue growth as well new contract growth.Revenue growth in the segment is expected to come from higher patient volumes, due to the acute flu season in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment is $1.70 billion, up 9% year over year.The company’s Ambulatory service segment will likely report revenue growth from higher procedure volume growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment is $319 million, up 1% year over year.During the quarter, the company completed the divestiture of its medical transportation business, American Medical Response, for net proceeds of $2.1 billion. The company intends to use these funds to reduce debt. We thus expect to see a lower leverage ratio in the first quarter.Envision Healthcare has also undertaken operational improvement initiatives. Via revenue cycle management, clinical labor management and operational efficiencies, the company has plans to realize $50 million of incremental adjusted EBIDTA in 2018. Part of this benefit will be seen in the first quarter.Like most companies, the company’s adjusted EPS was influenced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Since the company carries deferred income tax liabilities, the new tax law had a positive impact on its adjusted EPS in the previous quarter, and we expect the same to see in the first quarter, which should aid its margins.Guidance for Q1For the first quarter of 2018, the company expects adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations between $195 million and $205 million, and adjusted EPS of 61 cents to 67 cents.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company has an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 1.15%.

68,EVHC,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare sector have probably already heard of Envision Healthcare (EVHC  -  Free Report) and Addus HomeCare (ADUS  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Envision Healthcare and Addus HomeCare are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that EVHC is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.EVHC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.10, while ADUS has a forward P/E of 30.25. We also note that EVHC has a PEG ratio of 1.10. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. ADUS currently has a PEG ratio of 2.02.Another notable valuation metric for EVHC is its P/B ratio of 0.76. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ADUS has a P/B of 3.89.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to EVHC's Value grade of B and ADUS's Value grade of C.EVHC stands above ADUS thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that EVHC is the superior value option right now.

69,EVHC,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Envision Healthcare Corporation (EVHC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Envision Healthcare has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.3. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Envision Healthcare’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 19.8 over the past five years. In fact, the current level stands close to the lows for the stock, thus indicating immense scope for entry.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should point out that Envision Healthcare has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.2 so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Envision Healthcare has a P/S ratio of about 0.9. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, EVHC is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Envision Healthcare currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Envision Healthcare a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Envision Healthcare is just 0.9, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.9. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, EVHC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Envision Healthcare might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of A. This gives EVHC a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite discouraging. The current quarter has seen six estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no upward revisions, while the full year estimate has seen one upward revision and six downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 6.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 2.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Envision Healthcare Corporation Price and Consensus  Envision Healthcare Corporation Price and Consensus | Envision Healthcare Corporation QuoteIn light of these bearish trends, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which indicates why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineEnvision Healthcare is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 company enjoys a solid Zacks Industry Rank (among Top 18% of more than 250 industries). However, the industry has underperformed the broader market over the past two years. This is visible from the chart below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

70,EVHC,"Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) has announced organizational changes, which include a realignment of its top brass and a stock repurchase plan.These changes are aimed at bolstering its leadership team as it transitions from an operator of ambulatory surgery services to a leading diversified healthcare services organization.The company announced succession plans for current CFO Claire Gulmi and the President of Physician Services, Bob Coward.Gulmi will be succeeded by Kevin Eastridge, currently the Chief Accounting Officer. Coward’s responsibility will be taken over by Brian Jackson, who is presently Chief Operating Officer for the Physician Services Group.The company also created a new role, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, to be held by Karey Witty who will report to CEO Chris Holden. Also, Kevin Eastridge (current Chief Accounting Officer) will be appointed CFO, effective Oct 2, although Gulmi will remain an advisor to the company for a year to assist in the transition.The new leadership comprising seasoned healthcare executives with vast experience is expected to steer the company to new heights.The company also authorized a program to repurchase up to $250 million of its common stock. This buyback represents nearly 4% of the company’s current market capitalization.Envision Healthcare is rapidly transforming its business after its merger with AMSURG last December. The merger created the nation's largest physician-staffing company, with more than 19,000 physicians and clinicians and annual revenues of more than $10 billion.The company is now focusing on expanding its core business of physician services. In this vein, it recently announced that it will divest its medical transportation business, known as American Medical Response, to KKR & Co. in an all-cash deal valued at $2.4 billion.Year to date, the stock has lost 32% significantly underperforming the decline of 4% suffered by the industry it belongs to. We believe these transformational steps will address investors’ concern to some extent regarding the stock’s underperformance.These developments mark significant steps in building the new Envision Healthcare  around a set of physician-centric clinical solutions to better serve the hospital system and payer clients.The merger and related transformation is expected to enhance overall growth at Envision Healthcare and evolve it into a better company with a superior return on capital trajectory.Envision Healthcare caries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks from the medical sector are Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) and WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

71,EVHC,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Envision Healthcare Corporation (EVHC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 11.4% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Envision Healthcare Q2 Earnings BeatEnvision Healthcare reported second-quarter earnings of 85 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.66%.The company reported net revenue of $1.95 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.5% but increased from $758.5 million in the year-ago quarter.     Total operating expenses of $1.75 billion increased from $600 million in the year-ago quarter.Segment UpdateNet revenues from the Physician Services segment were $1.63 billion in the second quarter of 2017, reflecting an increase of 9.3% year over year. The revenue growth was driven by 10.6% contribution from acquisitions and 2.5% from same contracts.Net revenues from Ambulatory Services were $318.5 million, reflecting a decline of 0.4% year over year. Same-center revenues increased 0.6%, comprising a 0.5% increase in net revenue and a 0.1% increase in procedure volume.Financial UpdateEnvision Healthcare had cash and cash equivalents of $441.3 million, up from $316.9 million as of Dec 31, 2016.Total long-term debt increased to $6.3 billion as of Jun 30, 2017 from $5.8 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.The company’s ratio of total net debt at Jun 30, 2017 to trailing 12-month EBITDA as calculated under the company’s credit agreement was 4.5 times.Guidance UpdateFor 2017, the company lowered its revenue guidance to $7.75–$8.00 billion (from the previous guidance of $7.80 billion to $8.05 billion), adjusted EBIDTA to $1.02 billion to $1.04 billion (from $1.038 billion to $1.066 billion) and adjusted EPS to $3.35 to $3.45 (from $3.38 to $3.52).It, however, kept intact, the same contract revenue growth guidance of 3% to 4% in the physician services segment and 0% to 1% in ambulatory services.For the third quarter, the company expects adjusted EBIDTA of $266 million to $278 million and adjusted EPS of 87 cents to 93 cents. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been six revisions lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted downward by 6.9% due to these changes.Envision Healthcare Corporation Price and Consensus  Envision Healthcare Corporation Price and Consensus | Envision Healthcare Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

72,EVHC,"On Aug 11, we issued an updated research report on Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report), a provider of physician-led services, ambulatory surgery centre management, post-acute care and medical transportation.During the most recently reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat estimates but declined year over year due to a significant rise in operating expenses. It is to be noted that the company’s operating expense has been increasing over the past many years.Most alarming is the rate of increase of operating expense which is exceeding the revenue growth rate. In the first half of 2017, expense rose by 191.4%, surpassing revenue growth of 165%. This increase in expense has put pressure on the bottom line and will continue to do so in the coming quarters.We also remain concerned with the 2017 guidance cut for the second time so far this year. The company lowered its revenue guidance to $7.75–$8.00 billion (from the previous guidance of $7.80 billion to $8.05 billion), adjusted EBIDTA to $1.02 billion to $1.04 billion (from $1.038 billion to $1.066 billion) and adjusted EPS to $3.35 to $3.45 (from $3.38 to $3.52). This raises questions on the company’s ability to perform thus raising skepticism among investors.Shares of the company have suffered a loss of 16.7% year to date, compared with a decline of 1.2% for the industry. Given the headwinds faced by the company and a reduction in guidance, we do not expect any respite for the shares in the coming quarters.Also the company’s saddles high debt, which has been increasing for the past many years. As of Dec 31, 2016, the company had total debt, approximately $5.79 billion, 145.6% higer year over year. For the first half the same increased 8.4% year over year. The rise in leverage has consequently led to a spike in interest expense. The same for first half of 2017 increased 73% year over year. Such high debt levels increase leverage risk and increasing interest costs may dent the company’s margins.  Further, Envision Healthcare’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) undermines its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 5.35%, has declined in the past four years and remains significantly lower than the ROE of 12.6% for the industry, and 16.04% for the S&P 500, reflecting inefficiency in using shareholder funds.Envision Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked players in the space are Amedisys Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report), Chemed Corp. (CHE  -  Free Report) and Pharmerica Corporation . Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy).

74,EVHC,"Envision Healthcare Corporation (EVHC  -  Free Report), a physician staffing company, has entered into an agreement to be acquired by the global investment firm KKR.   Financial Terms of the Deal Envision Healthcare will be acquired in an all-cash transaction worth nearly $9.9 billion, including the assumption or repayment of debt. Each share of Envision Healthcare will fetch $46.00 per share in cash, which reflects nearly 32% premium to Envision Healthcare’s volume-weighted average share price from Nov 1, 2017, when the company disclosed that it was reviewing strategic alternatives to enhance shareholders’ value.  Earlier in the year, Envision Healthcare sold its American Medical Response, the provider of ambulance services in the United States to KKR for net proceeds of $2.1 billion. The deal, subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions, should see light by the fourth quarter of 2018.  Strategic Alternatives  The deal does not come to us as a surprise since the company had already hinted at this direction when last year it disclosed that it has reviewed all the strategic alternatives. The different options included – capital structure alternatives, potential acquisitions, portfolio optimization, a potential sale of the whole company and continued operation as a standalone business. The sale to KKR is expected to generate utmost shareholder’s gain according to the company’s management, which after thorough scanning of a number of potential buyers found KKR the best fit. Moreover, the sale of the entire company was the best option among others, considering business and competitive landscape, the company’s opportunities and challenges and strategic and financial alternatives available. Envision Healthcare Corp. was formed in December 2016 as a result of a merger of Envision Healthcare Holdings Inc. with AmSurg Corp. With its sale to KKR, the company will go private.Recent Troubles In recent times, Envision Healthcare was mired in lawsuits over allegations over “balance-billing” and outrageous billing practices which increased costs for hospitals and consumers.  The company also lost its contract with UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), due to the egregious billing practices of the former to UnitedHealth’s customers.  Envision Healthcare was already struggling with weak patient volumes and given its tarnished image for overbilling, it was not easy to expand its in-network relationships with private insurance carriers. Moreover, the sale of its ambulatory services business caused a loss of business diversity and decline in business scale, which would limit its top-line growth. Given these headwinds, the company going into the hands of a private player is probably the best that Envision shareholders could wish for.  In year's time the stock has lost 23% compared with the industry's growth of 4.3%.  Envision Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks worth considering in the healthcare space are INC Research Holdings, Inc. (SYNH  -  Free Report) and  OncoCyte Corporation (OCX  -  Free Report). Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2.

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

75,EVHC,"Ecolab Inc. (ECL  -  Free Report) is a popular name in the MedTech space. The stock has returned 12.7%, comparing favorably with the industry’s decline of 2.1% in a year’s time. Also, the current return is higher than the S&P 500’s rally of 11.4%.With a market capitalization of approximately $40.51 billion, the stock has met earnings expectations in the second and third quarter of 2017. However, the company missed estimates in the first and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Currently, Ecolab is grappling with stiff competition and foreign exchange volatility in the niche space. The mixed sentiments justify the stock’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here we take a detailed look at the company’s performance and operations to analyze why investors should hold on to this stock.What’s Acting in Favor of Ecolab?Ecolab’s segmental businesses continue to gain from product innovation and strategic buyouts. The company’s Global Industrial segment has gained from the Water, Food & Beverage and Life Sciences units in the fourth quarter. While Global Institutional segment sales witnessed solid growth in North America and Asia Pacific, Global Energy segment sales rose on strong growth in the well stimulation business and modest gains in the downstream business.Ecolab Inc. Price and Consensus  Ecolab Inc. Price and Consensus | Ecolab Inc. QuoteEcolab’s raised guidance for 2018 instills optimism. The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $5.25-$5.45 per share, up 12-16% year over year.For the first quarter of 2018, Ecolab expects adjusted earnings in the range of 85-93 cents per share, up from the previous range of 84-92 cents. The current outlook reflects an increase of 6-16% year over year.Ecolab has also been banking on acquisitions to gain market traction and boost profits. Recently, Ecolab acquired Cascade Water Services Inc., a privately-held company, based in New York that provides water treatment programs and services to the U.S. institutional market. Notably, acquisitions broaden services and improve opportunities in strategic water treatment market, enhancing Ecolab's ability to help customers address growing water limitations in and outside the United States.DrawbacksEcolab operates in highly competitive markets. Competitors include large companies, selling directly or through distributors, and many smaller regional players who focus on limited geographical areas, product line, and/or end-user division.Probable cost fluctuations, especially in Europe, might prove detrimental for the company. The frequent changes in oil or raw material prices, the absence of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or their substitutes coupled with other factors can mar the business model of the company. The company further expects inflation to stay in the first half of 2018 and also to continue till the end of 2018.Despite Ecolab’s strong global foothold, volatility in currency exchange rates have adversely impacted overall results. Such volatility is expected to persist till the end of 2018.Bottom LineUnhindered by the issues, analysts are optimistic about Ecolab. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 88 cents, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 10%.Consequently, investors might want to hold on to the stock, courtesy of its prospects of outperforming peers in the near future.The company has been successful in driving revenues, evident from its year-over-year rise in top line. We believe strategic acquisitions and a strong international presence will continue to drive overall growth.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are BIOHAVEN PHARM (BHVN  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

81,EVHC,"Third-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Oct 26, 229 S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers.Per the latest Earnings Preview, third-quarter results of the 229 S&P 500 members account for 48.1% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies are up 7.7% year over year on 5% rise in revenues, with 75.5% beating earnings per share estimates and 65.1% topping revenue estimates.Healthcare Sector TrendsThe sector has been in the spotlight ever since Donald Trump became the President. Trump’s intention to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, has resulted in an uncertain future for the whole sector. As a result, the medical stocks continue to be in focus.Players in the healthcare industry have largely benefitted from a surge in membership fuelled by the Healthcare Reform. Third quarter is expected to witness an increase in enrollment across Government programs particularly Medicaid and Medicare. While Medicaid sales is driven by Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, Medicare  is in huge demand from the growing population of baby boomers.Earnings for players in the hospital industry are likely to reflect the softness in volumes persisting throughout the industry. Factors such as payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals, rising deductibles and prevalence of high deductible health plans, increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are driving away volumes and the same is likely to be seen in the quarter.Nevertheless, aggressive inorganic strategies helped the players achieve fast-paced growth. In addition, new product launches, improving service, expansion into ancillary businesses and expense management strategies are expected to add to the top line.Moreover, the companies face headwinds  like the rising level of bad debt, demand for increasing investments in technological innovation, integration cost related to acquisitions and high interest expenses on debt-funded acquisitions that are likely to put pressure on the bottom line.Let’s take a sneak peek into the expected performance of three medical stocks that are scheduled to report earnings on Oct 31.Aetna Inc.’s( (AET  -  Free Report) third-quarter results are expected to witness a decline in Health Care segment revenues due to lower contribution from Commercial health insurance partly offset by premium increase in Government business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $14.4 billion, down 4% year over year.Medical Benefit Ratio is expected to increase in the quarter, owing to an unfavorable performance in individual Commercial products and suspension of the health insurer fee. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 84%, up from 82% in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total medical membership, one of the key drivers of revenues is 22.14 million, down 4.2% year over year. The decline is likely to be due to lower membership in the company’s public exchange compliant Individual and Small Group products.However, the company’s continuous focus on managing costs is likely to reduce its operating expenses.Our proven model shows that Aetna has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that significantly increases the chances an earnings beat.

The same is expected to be seen in the to-be-reported quarter.The quarter is also likely to see increased interest expenses as a result of increased borrowings related to the merger and incremental term-loan borrowings to fund recent acquisitions. This, in turn, will dent its operating marginsHowever, we expect to see an increase in revenues from the company's Physician Services segment, driven by synergy from recent acquisitions and organic growth.

82,EVHC,"Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, after market close.Last quarter, this health services company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.7%. However, earnings declined year over year due to an increase in expense, which outdid revenue growth.The company does not have an impressive surprise history. Though it missed estimates in only one the last four quarters, the average is a negative earnings surprise of 0.7%. This is depicted in the graph below:Q3 FlashbackThe company is likely to see lower revenues from its Ambulatory Services segment, which experienced soft business volumes in the past few quarters.Moreover, the company is reeling under escalating operating expenses for several quarters, due to higher salaries and benefits expenses. Most alarming is the rate of increase in operating expense, which has overshadowed the revenue growth rate, thereby thwarting bottom-line growth. The same is expected to be seen in the to-be-reported quarter.A huge debt load is also niggling Envision Healthcare. Its total debt has been swelling since 2013, leading to a spike in interest expense. This, in turn, will dent its operating margins.The quarter is likely to see increased interest expense as a result of increased borrowings related to the merger and incremental term-loan borrowings to fund recent acquisitions.We, nevertheless, expect to see an increase in revenues from the company's Physician Services segment (which contributes nearly 84% of the company’s revenues), driven by synergy from recent acquisitions as well as organic growth. Revenue growth is expected to come from higher patient volumes as well as improved pricing. We also expect to see improved EBIDTA which must have benefited from merger-related synergies.The company’s Ambulatory service segment will likely report a decline in revenues due to disposal of centers.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Envision Healthcare is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

84,EVHC,"Envision Healthcare Corp. (EVHC  -  Free Report) is rapidly transforming its business after its merger with AMSURG last December. The deal created one of the nation's largest physician-staffing companies.Envision Healthcare is now focusing on expanding its core business of physician services (contributing nearly 81% to total revenues) and selling non-core assets. In this vein, it recently announced that it will divest American Medical Response, its medical transportation business, to KKR & Co. in an all-cash deal valued at $2.4 billion.The company is optimistic about the physician services market which is witnessing consolidation.
