21,ACN,"The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite retreated in a volatile market as Trump trade war fears waxed and waned, with Nike (NKE) and bank stocks fueling a Friday rebound. Crude oil prices hit multiyear highs. General Electric (GE), kicked out of the Dow Jones, announced a partial breakup. Amazon.com (AMZN) moves disrupted the pharmacy and shipping industries. Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran. The Trump Administration warned allies that they needed to stop importing Iranian crude by November, according to reports. Meanwhile, a key oil-sands facility in Canada will be shut down until August. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 9.9 million barrels, more than expected, while gasoline supplies rose by 1.2 million barrels, according to weekly Energy Information Administration data. Domestic production was flat last week at 10.9 million barrels per day.General Electric (GE) ended a century-plus run on the Dow Jones industrial average and said it plans to shrink even further. The industrial giant, seeking to pare debt and simplify, will spin off GE Healthcare and divest its majority stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE). After prior, smaller divestitures, GE will now focus on aviation, power and renewable energy. The decisions followed a year-long ""deep dive"" by new CEO John Flannery, a period over which GE stock crumbled in half. Analysts warned of another dividend cut, the second since both the payout and earnings outlook were sliced last year. GE stock rebounded after falling to multiyear lows.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

North America sales rose 3%, bucking three straight quarters of year-over-year declines. The world's largest athletic apparel brand also announced a $15 billion share buyback program. Shares of Nike leapt 11% Friday, hitting a new high.Harley-Davidson faced a double-whammy in the past week, first getting hit with a 25% tariff from the European Union, then getting slammed by President Trump for waving the ""white flag."" The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles. That plan helped send shares of UPS down 2.3% and FedEx 1.3% on Thursday.The Federal Reserve released the second and final round of its annual stress tests, clearing most shareholder payout plans for the nation's largest financial firms. Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion. Several IPOs showed double-digit gains on the first day of trading. Among biotech new issues, Neuronetics (STIM) rallied 63% in its debut and Tricida (TCDA) rose 37%. The largest IPO was BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ), which raised $637.5 million, as shares rose 29% on the first day. Furniture retailer Lovesac (LOVE) jumped 50% on its first day of trading.Canadian marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) reported its first quarterly earnings as a U.S.-listed company. Canopy turned in a steeper loss than a year ago as it spent more on investments ahead of Canada's recreational legalization. Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ), which has taken a stake in Canopy, reported fiscal Q1 earnings per share that missed estimates, with sales roughly in line. Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue. The fast-food drive-in chain now projects full-year earnings of $1.45-$1.49, vs. prior guidance for $1.43-$1.50. The narrower guidance implies below-consensus Q4 EPS. Shares retreated.Lennar (LEN) stock popped after it demolished earnings estimates on Tuesday, though the largest U.S. homebuilder fell back later in the week. Meanwhile KB Home (KBH) rose Friday after the builder scored a double beat late Thursday.Carnival (CCL) shares sank to their lowest level in more than a year after the cruise line pared its full-year EPS outlook from $4.20-$4.40 to $4.15-4.25. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) shares also dropped as Carnival warned on fuel costs and exchange rates.Paychex (PAYX) retreated from a potential 73.20 buy point after quarterly earnings met and revenue edged past estimates. The payroll and HR services provider expects revenue to grow 6% to 7% in fiscal 2019 and EPS to rise 11%, as it fends off existing and new rivals, such as cloud-based Paycom Software (PAYC).Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a $10 billion buyback and quarterly dividend hike to 44 cents. The drugstore company also topped earnings views and guided modestly higher. Same-store sales fell though. Shares plunged to their lowest level in three years on Amazon's deal to buy PillPack.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) cut its revenue guidance on currency headwinds but raised its EPS outlook on greater-than-expected operating efficiencies.Accenture (ACN) delivered a fiscal third-quarter earnings beat.

X When looking for the best stocks to buy and watch, one factor to watch closely is relative price strength.IBD's proprietary RS Rating measures technical performance by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks compares to that of other stocks on the major indexes. Decades of market research shows that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains tend to have an RS Rating north of 80 in the early stages of their moves.Looking For Winning Stocks? Try This Simple RoutineCACI International broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 159.50 entry from a flat base. If a stock you're tracking clears a buy point then retreats 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new consolidation and breakout. Also understand that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, and such bases are more prone to failure. CACI International showed 5% EPS growth in the latest quarterly report. Sales increased 3%. The company earns the No. 16 rank among its peers in the Computer-Technical Services industry group.

26,ACN,"The popular Super Bowl commercial laid out a tongue-in-cheek crisis in the future of AI. Amazon.com's (AMZN) digital assistant Alexa loses her voice. What to do in a world dependent on artificial intelligence in business and at home?X Enter a series of stand-ins, including actor Anthony Hopkins, who goes into creepy Hannibal Lecter mode and unnerves the people he's supposed to help. Thankfully, Alexa recovers her digital voice and restores order. AI proves its value.Corporate America is on the cusp of a plunge into this future of AI in business. And giant technology companies — which stand to benefit by both harnessing their own artificial intelligence applications and helping other companies make the leap — are immersed in it now.Artificial intelligence innovations are well along at Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Alexa, found on Amazon's Echo devices, is just one example. Digital aides like Google's aptly named Assistant on its Home smart speaker and Apple's Siri on its Home Pod can help with shopping, entertainment, school work and other tasks.Tech companies also are busy at work on deploying AI in self-driving cars. And companies ranging from giant IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL) to a wave of startups are competing for talent and technology so they can cash in as AI spreads to non-tech enterprises.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportOutside Silicon Valley, companies are dipping a tentative toe into AI. Surveys show that most companies plan to evaluate how artificial intelligence can make them better, whether in making sales forecasts, automating tasks now done manually, improving existing products or enabling new ones. Budgets could more than triple in the next few years.""There's a lot of interest and experimentation; companies are still in the proof-of-concept, project phase,"" said Nicholas McQuire, vice president of enterprise research at CCS Insight. ""We'll see more deployment in about one or two years.""Artificial intelligence software programs — essentially computer algorithms — analyze huge amounts of data to identify patterns and predict outcomes.Companies are developing AI software that could save lives through early cancer detection. Other projects might someday thwart a cyberattack.Banking, retail and health care are among the sectors pushing into AI with pilot projects. Conversational ""chat bots"" are popping up on company websites, answering questions and improving customer service.Walmart Stores (WMT) harnesses AI to optimize inventories and supply chains by predicting future demand and reordering stock. Monsanto (MON) uses artificial intelligence to identify the most promising molecules in bioengineering. John Deere (DE) expects AI to reduce chemical spraying volumes in farming.

Banks see the future of AI in detecting money laundering and fraud. Manufacturers see AI as helpful in scheduling equipment maintenance. In health care, AI could predict diabetes and other diseases before they develop and identify the most promising treatments. A new algorithm from Google can help predict heart disease via retinal scans.In e-commerce, marketers expect AI tools to personalize website content to spotlight products or services that each online shopper is most likely to buy and to target ads more effectively. The telecom, oil and gas, media, entertainment and agriculture industries also are expected to embrace AI in their business.""A lot of companies see AI as transformational, but maybe not quite yet,"" said Jeff Cotrupe, an analyst at Frost & Sullivan.Industry disruptions and AI-based business models are off in the future.""The enterprise has been a bit slow,"" said Aditya Kaul, research director at Tractica. ""Many companies are still in the early stages of understanding what is AI, what problems can be solved, what is possible.""IDC forecasts that worldwide spending on AI hardware, software and services will jump to $58 billion by 2021, up from just $12 billion in 2017.""AI is not a budget line-item at this stage,"" said CCS's McQuire.JPMorgan estimates that AI will account for 1.8% of global enterprise IT budgets by 2021. Though still small next to, say, the 8% spent on cybersecurity, that would be up from a scant 0.3% in 2016.An AI spending boom would boost growth at enterprise software firms, cloud computing providers and IT service providers such as Microsoft, IBM, Accenture (ACN), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Oracle.""The AI killer app has emerged: cost savings,"" Brent Bracelin, a KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst, said in a recent note to clients. Aside from customer service, he says many time-consuming, back-office tasks  such as human resources, finance and accounting will be automated with AI.One key to the future of AI will be to make it easier for companies to forge ahead with artificial intelligence projects, say analysts. Salesforce.com, AT&T (T) and Google are among those seeking a faster track for AI in business.AT&T, with an open-source software project, aims to make developing AI predictive tools as easy as building a website.  Working with IT consulting firm Tech Mahindra, AT&T has launched an open-source artificial intelligence software project with the Linux Foundation.""There is some confusion that doing AI is very expensive if you look at the R&D budgets of Google and Amazon,"" said Kaul. ""But you don't need billions of dollars to get AI projects started. There is open source software — it's a big trend within AI — that helps companies build their own solutions.""Salesforce.com has a mantra to help customers build AI tools ""with clicks not code."" That means companies don't need their own programmers to write algorithms that can find patterns or make inferences from sales data.Salesforce has a line of tools it calls Einstein that use a company's historical lead and account data to predict which deals are more likely to close.""What companies need is the ability to apply AI to their business. There's not a lot of off-the-shelf AI, like Salesforce's Einstein,"" said CCS Insight's McQuire. ""But technology is advancing quickly. We're going to see a lot more technology that helps companies automate the creation of custom AI models, which will speed up the market.""McQuire says nearly 60% of companies surveyed by CCS Insight are testing or studying AI. One problem is that high-tech companies are willing to pay much higher salaries for AI specialists, which increases their expenses.If they lack in-house expertise, McQuire says many companies are turning to cloud computing vendors — Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google — to get a head start.Cloud computing vendors aim to provide AI-as-a-service. Companies can run artificial intelligence apps on powerful computers rented by the hour to crunch massive quantities of data.""All the public clouds are fighting over who has the best AI platform,"" said Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, in a report.Google is focused on providing cloud customers with tool kits for ""machine learning,"" one type of AI. Google's AI tools enable cloud customers such as a hospital radiology department to focus computer vision algorithms so they can spot lung cancer.Many midsize or large companies lack internal technology staffers who can build AI-powered apps. That gives information technology services firms such as Accenture and IBM an opening as companies look to develop custom AI apps, says Bhavan Suri, analyst at William Blair. IBM, which has focused its Watson AI platform on health care, is moving into new markets such as digital marketing.Wall Street analysts anticipate that AI tools will be integrated with existing big data, business intelligence and industry-specific enterprise software. Kaul says many industries are still in the early stages of digitizing records handled as paperwork. Once that data is available, AI tools can go to work to help deploy AI in business.""Although Google, Facebook (FB), Baidu (BIDU), Apple, Microsoft and Amazon may have taken early advantage of their large data sets and established platforms, enterprise  software vendors like SAP, Oracle, and Salesforce are gradually embedding AI into their offerings,"" said the JPMorgan report.Software companies pushing into AI include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Tableau Software (DATA), Zendesk (ZEN), Coupa Software (COUP), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), HubSpot (HUBS), Splunk (SPLK) and Workday (WDAY).The fact that most non-tech companies need a helping hand getting into artificial intelligence also provides an opportunity for startups pushing into the enterprise market. Among them: Sentient Technologies, DataRobot, Clarifai, Algorithmia, Affectiva and SpaceKnow.At this early stage of AI in business, corporate America is using what's called ""machine learning"" for the most part as opposed to more complex ""deep learning."" With ML, algorithms are trained to create predictive models or identify patterns. ML helps predict what a particular customer is likely to buy or detects insurance claims fraud.Tech companies use machine learning to personalize web content and other tasks. But they also are plowing ahead in applying deep learning, which mimics neural networks in the human brain, for classifying images and other purposes. Self-driving cars will require deep learning to map their surroundings and detect hazards.Technology giants are in an AI arms race. They're funding or acquiring startups and paying super-salaries to hire AI computer scientists.Amazon isn't stopping at Alexa-powered digital assistants. Its Amazon Go retail stores use computer vision and AI to do away with cashiers.Apple uses artificial intelligence software for facial recognition in the new iPhone X. And Apple is developing AI health care mobile apps.For Facebook users, AI lurks behind the scenes, playing a central role in what advertisements or news they see. And at Netflix (NFLX), programming recommendations are getting better as software algorithms are trained to identify movie matches.What sets the tech giants apart is commitment. For them, the future of AI is now.Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai makes a point to show this. On earnings calls and tech conferences, he now calls Google an ""AI first"" company.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Is It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?No. 1-Ranked Stock With 118% Growth Breaks Out With Earnings DueBirth Of An Industry: Early Investing  Hot Spots In Artificial IntelligenceIt's An AI Arms Race: What China Has To Offer Vis-A-Vis U.S.

29,ACN,"Blockchain exchange traded funds are one way for investors to get exposure to the underlying technology of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, says one Wall Street brokerage, but there still are hurdles for many industries when it comes to distributed ledger technology, or DLT.UBS says non-cryptocurrency ETFs will be one option for investors, since ""pure-plays"" do not yet exist. But ETFs may be hard-pressed to find company data for inclusion.""Companies that directly or indirectly enable the use of DLT products and services as well as companies that could use or stand to benefit from the technology could be included,"" the UBS report said. ""Due to this broad definition and low thresholds to satisfy the criteria, you'll see a wide range of companies within the ETFs. This may include, but is not limited to, large technology companies, semiconductor companies, banks, and capital markets companies. Over time, as the DLT ecosystem develops, a purer-play universe may develop.""But UBS noted: ""Although we believe DLT is where the 'rubber meets the road' for innovative ledger and data sharing technology, we think there could be significant friction that will likely impede widespread adoption for a number of years.""Blockchain is basically a shared public ledger, also called a distributed database, which tracks transactions and ensures that the record of those transactions remains transparent and tamper-proof. While developed initially for Bitcoin, many projects aim to develop non-crypto currency versions of DLT for broader applications.Banking and financial services, e-commerce, food safety, supply-chain management, digital media, and pharmaceuticals are among industrial applications of blockchain technology.IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky. That's why Investor's Business Daily makes it easy with educational tools, stock lists, research, Leaderboard and more.Any web-shared blockchain is meant to be impossible to edit or forge because there's no centralized database vulnerable to hackers or chicanery.""The possibility of a longer-than-expected adoption of DLT has not dampened investors' appetite for DLT-themed investment strategies,"" said UBS. ""In fact, so far this year, there have already been three exchange traded funds (ETFs) issued that focus on companies that have some sort of exposure to the DLT ecosystem. Two of the ETFs track indices while the other is actively managed.""Banks such as Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) as well as tech companies IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Accenture (ACN) are among those pushing into non-crypto blockchain technology.RELATED:Japan Will Probe Crypto Exchange Security After Massive TheftIBM Launches Blockchain Joint Venture With Maersk For Global TradingBitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet

75,ACN,"Investors shrugged off speculation that Oracle (ORCL) could buy Accenture (ACN), a global tech consulting and services company, as a Morgan Stanley analyst asked ""Why buy the cow?"" in a report.Accenture stock dipped 0.3% to 120.98 in the stock market today, despite takeover speculation prompted by a report in The Register. Shares in software giant Oracle fell 0.4% to 44.52.""While Accenture has been growing its top line nicely, keep in mind that the company is one of the largest global partners and system integrators for the likes of SAP (SAP), Salesforce.com (CRM), and ServiceNow (NOW) to name a few. An acquisition by Oracle of one of these vendors' largest partners could put a meaningful amount of Accenture revenue at risk,"" said Brian Essex, a Morgan Stanley analyst in a report.""We view a combination between the two as unlikely as we believe the negatives in this case would outweigh the positives,"" he added.Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard has a similar view.""We believe services companies are viewed as credible with their customers when they are significantly independent. Accenture has relationships with nearly all software companies we cover, many of which compete with Oracle (SAP, Salesforce, Workday (WDAY)), making it difficult for an Oracle-owned Accenture to be viewed as independent,"" Pritchard said in a report.IBD'S TAKE: Oracle stock hit an all-time high of 46.99 in intraday trading on March 16 but has retreated 5% since then. Acquisitions have turned the database software vendor into a provider of many software tools. Learn more about Oracle's cloud computing strategy at IBD Stock Checkup. Moshe Katri, a Wedbush analyst, also views an Oracle-Accenture merger as problematical.""Being affiliated with a product company will impact Accenture's critical vendor-neutrality role, especially as Accenture consults clients undergoing technology transformation, which includes recommendations for using best of breed products/technology,"" Katri said in a report.Dublin, Ireland-based Accenture reported flat fiscal second-quarter adjusted earnings that topped views with revenue that just fell short of forecasts. For the quarter ended Feb. 28, Accenture earned $1.33 per share, down a penny vs. a year earlier.

76,ACN,"Some of America's most venerable tech companies aim to renew growth by breaking up.The jury is still out on whether that will work for Conduent (CNDT), which has a long road ahead, analysts say. Separated from Xerox (XRX) in January, Conduent helps other companies get their financial house in order in the field known as business process outsourcing.Some analysts say Conduent aims to build a more competitive business. Others contend it could be a more attractive takeover target down the road. Its results have been lackluster of late, though the company's outlook indicates a growth path ahead.Complicating matters is activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a piece of Conduent. The big question is what will happen if its turnaround starts clicking.""We think Conduent is an unlikely (merger) target,"" Keith Bachman, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, said in a recent report. ""We don't think any of the established BPO leaders, such as Accenture (ACN), IBM (IBM) or Genpact (G), have any interest in acquiring Conduent, given its focus on the low end of the market.""But others say a sell-off could come piecemeal.""(Chief Executive Ashok) Vemuri may choose to divest/sell portions of the business that are either 'noncore' or less profitable,"" said Frank Atkins, a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst, in a recent note to clients. ""While this would have impact on top-line trajectory on a reported basis, it is a quick way to drive margin as well as restore balance-sheet powder for strategic investment. In our view, this could be in low-margin, more commoditized work, or in certain geographies which may not be of adequate scale.""In investor meetings, Vemuri has outlined plans to increase its sales force, invest in digital technologies such as data analytics, and focus on North America and Europe as core markets.What the company also wants to do is exit low-margin contracts and pursue new deals with better pricing. It aims to migrate toward higher-value-added work rather than being a soup-to-nuts services provider.""The core philosophy now is to drive a more repeatable, scalable and predictable business,"" Vemuri said on Conduent's fourth-quarter earnings call in February.  ""We are not in the business of trying to capture a headline by doing a big deal that we do not even understand how to start working on.""Regardless of what awaits the company, the split/merger strategy isn't unfamiliar. Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard in 2015 split into two publicly traded companies: Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus on services and products for businesses, and HP Inc. (HPQ) to focus on PCs and printers.HPE in early April took a step further, spinning off its enterprise services businesses. But that entity merged with IT consulting firm Computer Sciences to create DXC Technology (DXC), now a rival of Conduent.Whether Conduent pursues a strategic direction similar to HP's remains to be seen. Xerox stock gapped up on Jan. 3, the day the spinoff was completed, and is up about 8% this year. Xerox is set to launch a slew of new products, aiming to spur revenue growth in the back half of 2017, analysts say.The move to split from Xerox was endorsed by Icahn, who built up a stake in the copy machine maker.Icahn now holds a nearly 10% stake in Conduent and picked three members of its board of directors. So he figures in whatever strategic options Conduent is looking at, analysts say.IBD'S TAKE: Conduent hasn't been a publicly traded company for long, but it's already is forming a cup-with-handle base that could lead to higher stock gains. Read here for more information on stocks forming cup bases.As its own entity, Florham Park, N.J.-based Conduent handles such services for businesses as state Medicaid payments, tollbooth collections, and other transactions.Along with Accenture, IBM and Genpact, a number of other business process providers compete with Conduent. They include Convergys (CVG), ExlService (EXLS) and WNS Holdings (WNS), as well as large multinational tech service providers including Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Cap Gemini (CGEMY), and the new DXC Technology.The worldwide BPO market is growing about 5% annually, says Citigroup. In 2018, it's expected to reach $197 billion, from $188 billion in 2017.As it grows, CEO Vemuri aims to provide multiple services to customers rather than spread out too thinly.""The thing we have to work on is to take various service capabilities, find the common thread between them, and sell (services) as a bundled solution,"" he said on Conduent's earnings call.Prior to joining Conduent last year, Vemuri was chief executive of iGate, an information services firm. France-based Cap Gemini acquired iGate for roughly $4 billion in 2015. Vemuri earlier worked at Infosys (INFY), an India-based consulting and tech services firm.Current results may not bode well for a takeover, though. Conduent's 2016 revenue fell 4% to $6.4 billion. Adjusted revenue in the December quarter fell 6.5% to $1.6 billion, below estimates.Conduent posted a fourth-quarter loss of $4.69 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of 3 cents. Excluding a goodwill impairment charge and restructuring-related costs, Conduent said it earned an unadjusted profit of 29 cents per share vs. analysts' estimate of 23 cents. Analysts estimate that Conduent profit will rebound to 95 cents in 2018 from 75 cents this year. But it notched $1.06 in unadjusted profit last year.With a market valuation of some $3.2 billion, Conduent does not plan to repurchase shares or issue a dividend in the near term. Conduent has told analysts that if cost-cutting generates more free cash flow it could start making small acquisitions in 2018 to expand into new areas.Conduent has moved quickly to reduce its worldwide workforce to 91,000 as of Feb. 15, down from 96,000 at the end of 2016.While shares in Conduent are up about 7% since its spinoff from Xerox, Citigroup says one drag on Conduent stock has been that the company was not added to either the S&P 500 or midcap S&P 400 index post-spinoff, limiting its exposure to index investors.RELATED:Analysts Shoot Down Oracle-Accenture Deal; 'Why Buy The Cow?'

77,ACN,"Accenture (ACN) reported flat fiscal second-quarter adjusted earnings that topped views with revenue that just fell short of forecasts. Shares in the global tech consulting and services company slipped Thursday.In May, Accenture expects to record a principally noncash settlement charge of about $425 million, pretax, in connection with the termination of its U.S. pension plan. This settlement charge will reduce the company's fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS by approximately 39 cents.""Our strong performance reflects our continued rotation to new, high-growth areas such as digital, cloud and security services — which now account for more than 45 percent of total revenues — as well as our increasingly innovation-led approach to creating cutting-edge solutions for clients,"" said Pierre Nanterme, Accenture's chairman and CEO, in a release.Offshore information technology outsourcing (ITO) companies have shown decelerating revenue growth in recent quarters. Dublin-based Accenture's outlook for IT spending and plans for investments in digital, cloud and security will be key, analysts say. Accenture competes with IBM (IBM) India's Infosys (INFY), Tata Consultancy Services, and others.Wall Street fiscal Q2 estimates: Analysts estimated earnings would slip 3% to $1.30 a share, with revenue rising 5% to $8.34 billion.Results:  For the quarter ended Feb. 28, Accenture earned $1.33 per share, down a penny vs. a year earlier. Revenue climbed 4.7% to $8.32 billion, the third straight quarter of gradually decelerating growth.Fiscal Q3 and 2017 guidance. Accenture expects revenue in a range of $8.65 billion to $8.9 billion, up 5% to 8%, vs. analyst estimates of $8.8 billion. Accenture sees full-year revenue growth of 6% to 8%, slightly up from its earlier forecast of 5% to 8%. The company lifted its non-GAAP EPS outlook to $5.70 to $5.87 from $5.64 to $5.87.Fiscal Q1 results:  For the quarter ended Nov. 30, Accenture reported fiscal first-quarter profit that topped views, but net revenue that missed estimates. Accenture said it earned $1.58 per share, up 23% from $1.28 per share in the year earlier period, vs. consensus estimates of $1.49. Accenture said net revenue rose 6% to $8.52 billion from $8.01 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $8.59 billion. Accenture lowered its full-year earnings guidance, citing the currency exchange rate impact on its business.Stock: Accenture stock closed down 4.5% at 120.76 on the stock market today, dropping below a 125.82 buy point from a cup base cleared on Wednesday, when it rose 1.5% to an all-time high of 126.48.RELATED:Why This Is The Time Of Year Cisco Investors Love The StockIBM, Alibaba, Google Shine In Morgan Stanley Cloud Outlook

79,ACN,"Technology unicorn Presidio (PSDO) began its first day of trading Friday by debuting below its offer price, showing subdued investor reaction following the more splashy initial public offering of Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP).Late Thursday, Presidio raised $233 million, pricing 16.7 million shares at 14 each and the low end of its estimated range of 14-to-16. Presidio stock opened at 13.50 on the stock market today, climbed as high as 14.36, closing up 1.8% at 14.25.Presidio specializes in digital infrastructure, cloud computing and security solutions, with about 7,000 business and government customers. For the fiscal year ended June 30, Presidio reported revenue of $2.7 billion, up 14%, and a net loss of $3.4 million, vs. a net loss of $29.4 million the previous fiscal year. It competes against information technology giants such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), IBM (IBM) and Accenture (ACN).Presidio came to market with a valuation of about $1.3 billion, making it the first tech unicorn to go public since the much-larger Snap did last week.The hope is that the Snap debut will lead to a burst of IPO activity, shrugging off a market that began to dry up in the second half of 2015 and continues. The IPO slowdown occurs despite U.S. stock markets at or near all-time highs.Three IPOs are scheduled for the coming week. The largest is ProPetro, a provider of hydraulic fracturing services for the oil and gas industry. It looks to raise $350 million, offering 20 million shares at a price range of 16 to 19. It trades Friday under the ticker PUMP.Ardagh Group, a provider of containers for consumer packaged goods, looks to raise $299.7 million, offering 16.2 million shares at a range of 17 to 20, trading Wednesday under the ticker ARD.MuleSoft, a provider of software application services, seeks $169 million, pricing 13 million shares at a range of 12 to 14, trading Friday under the ticker MULE.IBD'S TAKE: IBD focuses on the best-performing IPOs of the past three years in its IPO Leaders column. You can also read this Investor's Corner on how should you handle Snap's market debut to maximize your chances for success with IPOs.Snap held its initial public offering on March 1, giving the company a market valuation of $24 billion. Shares priced at 17, the high end of its estimated range, and popped 44% on the first day of trading to close at 24.48. The offering raised $3.4 billion, making it the largest IPO of a U.S.-listed company since Alibaba (BABA) in September of 2014. The following day Snap hit a record high of 29.44 but has been on a downward slide since, with the stock currently trading near 23, up fractionally. Snap was hit with several sell ratings.Snapchat is a mobile messaging platform that competes mainly against the Instagram program of Facebook (FB), both being photo- and video-sharing applications with special features.Some observers hope that a successful IPO of Snap will lead to a stampede of big-name debuts. Other unicorns expected to go public in 2017 are music service provider Spotify, data analytics company Palantir Technologies and social network Pinterest.In other IPOs this past week, women's apparel provider J. Jill (JILL) priced 11.7 million shares at $13, below its estimated range of 14 to 16. J. Jill stock fell modestly in Thursday's debut and was up 2.4% to 12.95 Friday.RELATED:First Tech Unicorn IPO After Snap Prices At Low End Of Price RangeInstacart Valued At $3.4 Billion: Unicorns Still Prized After Snap IPOIPO Stock News And Analysis: Find Today's Top New IssuesSnap Gets A More Upbeat Review Amid A Series Of Sell Ratings

84,ACN,"Highly rated business process outsourcing firm Cognizant Technology Solutions gapped down 8% after the Monday stock market opening bell, shortly after management disappointed investors with guidance lower than Wall Street expected for the first quarter and 2016.Cognizant (CTSH) beat analysts estimates for Q4 earnings growth and came in short of analysts' revenue expectations. Its stock fell as low as 53.46 early Monday in a rough market, 23% below its all-time high 69.80 reached Oct. 28. Shares were down 7% midday in the stock market today.Cognizant stock enjoys a high IBD Composite Rating of 90, meaning it's performing better than 90% of stocks across a variety of metrics. That's a hair better ranking than its larger business process outsourcing (BPO) rivals Infosys (INFY), somewhat better than Accenture (ACN) and far better than IBM (IBM). Like Cognizant with huge operations in India, Infosys was down 5% at midday Monday. Accenture about 4.5% and IBM was off 1%.A new concern for BPO companies -- not that they haven't been competing already -- is Xerox's (XRX) BPO spin-off, announced just 10 days ago. Xerox has been offering outsourcing for years, but as a free-standing publicly traded company its BPO is likely to receive heightened attention in the market. Cognizant declines to discuss Xerox, a spokeswoman said. Xerox stock was down about 5% at midday.Cognizant said the current Q1 earnings per share should reach 78-80 cents on revenue of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters thought Cognizant could do better on earnings, expecting adjusted EPS up 12% to 81 cents from 71 cents a year ago, on sales up 14% to $3.319 billion from $2.911 billion in Q1 2015.For Q4 2015, Cognizant said it earned 80 cents per share minus items, up 19.4% from 67 cents a year earlier, on revenue up 17.9% to $3.23 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had on average been expecting 78-cents EPS minus items on $3.24 billion in revenue.""Our cash and investment balances, net of debt, grew by $1.5 billion during 2015 due to our strong business performance and strong cash flows,"" said CFO Karen McLoughlin in Cognizant's earnings release. She said Cognizant spent more than $375 million buying back stock in 2015, ""reflecting our commitment to drive shareholder value.""Said President Gordon Coburn: ""While digital opportunities significantly expand our addressable market, our rapidly growing consulting, infrastructure and business process services and geographic market expansion, continue to be solid drivers of demand for our services.""Cognizant and Infosys recovered in December from heavy flooding in Chennai, India, where they employ tens of thousands of workers.

89,ACN,"Presidio (PSDO), a provider of information technology services, priced its initial public offering late Thursday at the low end of its expected range, showing subdued investor reaction toward the tech unicorn following the IPO of Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP).Presidio focuses on providing IT to mid-sized companies. It competes against giants such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), IBM (IBM) and Accenture (ACN).Presidio sold 16.7 million shares at 14 a pop, raising $233 million. It had set a price range of 14-16 each.The stock is expected to begin trading Friday on the Nasdaq under the ticker PSDO. Apollo Global Management (APO) owns a majority stake.With an initial market cap of about $1.3 billion, Presidio is the first tech unicorn to go public since the much-larger Snap did last week.Snap on March 1 priced its IPO slightly above its estimate range, raising $3.4 billion, making it the largest U.S.-listed IPO since Alibaba (BABA) in 2014.Snap, which had an initial valuation of $24 billion, soared 44% in its March 2 debut and kept rising the next session. But this week shares have tumbled 16% so far, as several analysts have issued sell ratings.Snap shares rose 1% to 22.94 in morning trade in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Snap's IPO and post-IPO action shows why investors should be wary about buying into a new company initially. Let the market separate the hype from the real winners. Here's how spot and exploit an IPO base.On Thursday, Airbnb completed a $1 billion funding round that valued the room rental marketplace at $31 billion, up from $30 billion about six months ago.

90,ACN,"On the eve of a summit last month between technology executives and then-President-elect Donald Trump, IBM (IBM) Chief Executive Ginni Rometty publicly pledged to hire about 25,000 U.S. workers and spend $1 billion on training over the next four years.She didn't mention that the tech giant was also firing workers and sending many of the jobs overseas.In late November, IBM completed at least its third round of firings in 2016, according to former and current employees. They don't know how many people have lost their jobs but say it's probably in the thousands, with many of the positions shipped to Asia and Eastern Europe.""The thing I found really insulting was that the quote-unquote reason for my termination was it was a 'skills transformation,'"" says Sean Ott, a 20-year IBM veteran asked to clear out his desk a couple of months ago despite what he describes as a strong performance rating. ""But at the same time, they have my exact job out there, they have my colleague's job out there for other people to get hired into.""During the presidential campaign, Trump routinely criticized offshoring, although he didn't specifically mention IBM. The firings — known internally as ""resource actions"" — have continued into the new year. This month, IBM started notifying more U.S. workers that they would be let go, according to a current employee, who says colleagues in the services business are bracing for further rounds.Many industries and companies have been sending jobs overseas to take advantage of lower wages and to be closer to local markets. In some cases, technological advances, including automation, have made positions obsolete.In an emailed statement, IBM spokesman Doug Shelton pointed out that the company generates more than two-thirds of its services revenue overseas. He reiterated plans to hire 25,000 people in the U.S. and said IBM will end up adding a net number of jobs over the next four years.""If we are able to fill these positions,"" he said, ""we expect IBM U.S. employment to be up over that period.''Shelton declined to say how many IBM workers were fired in 2016 but said the company enjoys an attrition rate that's historically much lower than the industry average.Rometty's hiring pledge prompted current and former IBM workers to vent on message boards and Facebook groups. Some complained that the new recruiting drive wouldn't offset jobs sent overseas in recent years. Others said Rometty had neglected to mention whether and how many people would be fired in the meantime. Some urged online communities to contact the Trump transition team and educate his aides about IBM's history of layoffs and outsourcing.""Ginni Rometty is terminating thousands of IT workers and touting herself as some hero who's out to hire 25,000 workers,"" says Sara Blackwell, a Sarasota, Fla.-based lawyer and advocate for Protect U.S. Workers, who represents about 100 ex-employees of IBM who have filed discrimination and other complaints. ""To me, that's hypocritical.""When Rometty became CEO in 2012, she began pushing IBM into new businesses such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. So far, results have been mixed. On Jan. 19, IBM reported that fourth-quarter sales fell 1% to $21.8 billion and operating margins narrowed, evidence that revenue from cloud computing and AI hasn't yet replaced sales from older businesses.However, some areas showed promise. Sales in the unit that houses analytics and AI software increased for the third quarter in a row, and the technology services and cloud platforms segment also recorded year-over-year growth.In a call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said that the company expects to improve its margins this year, partly from ""savings we have from workforce rebalancing as we continue to remix the workforce.""IBM's reorganization inevitably meant some workers would lose their jobs. Automation wiped out some positions, and the company says some of the firings were done to make room for people with skills in IBM's new businesses. Layoffs have slowed but are continuing.In an Op-Ed published in USA Today in December to explain the creation of 25,000 new positions over the next four years, Rometty wrote: ""We are hiring because the nature of work is evolving.""At the same, time IBM has sent thousands of jobs offshore. It's not alone in doing this. In the last 15 or 20 years, Accenture (ACN), Cap Gemini (CGEMY) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) have all done the same.IBM doesn't disclose how many of its 300,000-plus employees work in the U.S. or in its various divisions. But the services businesses, which generate more than half the company's sales, have taken the brunt of the offshoring.For example, early last year, the technology services division aimed to have just 30% of permanent employees located in the U.S. by the end of 2016, according to two former managers, who received the information from superiors. Later in the year, the target had been reduced to 20%, said one of the people, who asked not to be named to discuss internal matters. Shelton said the numbers are inaccurate.As recently as three years ago, it was easier to track IBM's staff cuts. Employees losing their jobs received a list of colleagues being fired too, along with their positions, departments, ages and other information.They were able to use the information to determine whether they wanted to waive age-discrimination claims, which they needed to do to receive a severance package. Then in 2014, IBM ended the disclosures, making it much more difficult to tally job cut totals.The company hasn't entirely sidestepped criticism for firings. In 2015, local and federal officials lambasted IBM for dismissing 1,200 workers in Iowa and Missouri just five years after opening facilities there.The firings were a blow to the cities of Dubuque, Iowa, and Columbia, Mo., which spent a combined $84 million on sweeteners to lure Big Blue in the hopes of incubating a startup scene. Republican Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley wrote to the company to express concern about the firing of 700 workers.Today, Big Blue gets rid of people quietly and in smaller batches, former and current employees say. The firings have become so commonplace, they say, that many workers are resigned to losing their jobs and simply wait for their names to be called.Then, many are asked to train potential replacements overseas. In case of Ott, the former IBM employee, those people were in China, India and Argentina.""Clearly,"" he says, ""my skills are still relevant.""

In May, when fund lead manager Scott Migliori spoke with IBD, the now-$756 million portfolio was up about 8% for the year, topping 89% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500's 4% gain.Now, going into Tuesday, the fund, which carries an A+ 36-Month Performance Rating from IBD, is up 11.1% for the year, outperforming 93% of its peer mutual funds and the S&P 500's gain, stuck at 3%.That good trend has required hard work and savvy moves.""If anything, the stock market today is more narrow,"" Migliori said. ""Fewer names are making newer highs. I wouldn't call it the Nifty 50. There are maybe 10 to 15 stocks that are consistently performing well, mainly in the tech and consumer discretionary spaces. We've owned enough of those to generate outperformance, but it's gotten tougher.""How? The health care sector has rolled over. ""It had been in leadership for a number of years,"" Migliori said. ""But it's fallen off the last few months because earnings revisions were not as strong as investors wanted, and because of potential political challenges over price controls.""The fund has cut exposure to drugmakers and biotechs, including Gilead (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB).Proceeds from those trims have been rotated into names like Palo Alto Networks (PANW).Trading around 187, shares in the next-generation firewall and security software maker are close to a 189.82 buy point.Since going public in 2012, revenue has swelled nearly 1,800% to $928 million. And the firm, which is on IBD's Leaderboard, has notched three quarters of triple-digit earnings per share gains.""The security area is fast growing, given the cyberattacks that governments and corporations are facing,"" Migliori said.The fund recently started its stake in Accenture (ACN), which performs consulting and provides IT services. Many investors were concerned that Accenture's business would be hurt as customers shifted to cloud-based software.""But what we've seen is fairly robust business for Accenture in integrating cloud-based services with (customers') existing IT infrastructures,"" Migliori said. ""The cloud has not only not been negative; it's been a positive growth driver.""Increasingly, amid a slow-growth economy and the prospect of rising interest rates, the fund looks for companies that can boost earnings in any market.Monster Beverage (MNST) is one of those. ""Energy drinks are taking share of the overall beverage market,"" Migliori said. ""Their partnership with Coke (KO) will let them grow more quickly. They'll be able to expand distribution more quickly.""Still Likes FacebookThe fund is high on Facebook (FB), yet recently took some profits. Why? Because the stock had enjoyed a big run and because its growth rate had slowed slightly.""But we still like it,"" Migliori said. ""They're just starting to monetize Instagram. The amount of their capital spending is not as bad as people had feared. They're consolidating after a big run, but there's nothing to fundamentally derail the story at this point.""Amazon (AMZN) is another name that Migliori thinks can carve out growth in any macro environment.Also, last year's spending on warehouse improvements is contributing to this year's operating efficiencies.

126,ACN,"Can lofty Luxoft (LXFT) fly higher? Earnings reports always mark a crucial time for a stock, so how much higher analysts could take the tech services firm might be known after the close, when the company is expected to report a 22% jump in EPS and 35% rise in revenue for its fiscal Q2, which ended Sept. 30. Luxoft stock…
"
127,ACN,"Luxoft (LXFT) stock gapped up to a new high Wednesday after the tech service firm late Tuesday reported earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street expectations.The third-party software developer also raised its fiscal 2016 guidance for profit and sales.Luxoft rose as much as 10% in the stockmarkettoday, above 77, and was up 7%, above 75, in afternoon trading.Luxoft reported second-quarter earnings minus items of 84 cents a share, up 45% from the year-earlier, smashing analyst expectations for 71 cents.Sales rose 29% to $161.5 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, beating Thomson Reuters analyst consensus of $159.9 million.Luxoft's annual sales growth hasn't been below 24% since the June 2013 quarter, and its EPS growth has exceeded 22% in all but two quarters since then, growth rates that would be the envy of much-bigger rivals IBM (IBM) and Accenture (ACN).For fiscal '16 ending March 31, Luxoft raised its adjusted EPS guidance to at least $2.60 per share vs. $2.55 guided previously, on revenue up at least 24% to $645.5 million instead of the earlier 23% estimate. Analyst consensus suggests $2.76 EPS on $661.93 million for fiscal '16.Luxoft is among the healthiest in IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group, where only Tyler Technologies (TYL) and Virtusa (VRTU) share the best-possible 99 Composite Ratings with Luxoft. Cognizant Technology (CTSH) and Epam Systems (EPAM) both have 98 CRs. IBM, though, has a low 44 CR. It's by far the largest company in the group, with a market valuation of $130.7 billion, followed by Accenture's $63.4 billion. Luxoft is barely above a small cap, with a $2.5 billion valuation.The Computer-Tech Services group ranks No. 5 out of 197 that IBD tracks.In a corporate presentation distributed Wednesday that notes its 30.7% annual growth rate since going public in 2013, vs. the 20% the company suggested two years ago, Switzerland-based Luxoft cited some of its largest customers.Its financial service customers include Deutsche Bank (DB) and Citi (C).Auto industry customers include Delphi (DLPH) and Ford (F).Other customers are Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) .In Luxoft's earnings release, CEO Dmitry Loschinin said the company won ""several landmark contracts with high potential accounts (HPAs) and (we) maintain a healthy pipeline of opportunities ahead. We have secured four new HPAs in the past quarter: two in automotive, one in telecom and one in financial services.""

"
129,ACN,"A bout of recent investor jitters took a bite out of its shares this week, but Epam Systems continues to rank as a strong performer that shows potential.Epam (EPAM) competes with the likes of huge names in computer tech services such as IBM (IBM), Accenture (ACN), Infosys (INFY) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH). Yet the provider of outsourced software engineering and other IT services holds its own — and often bests the other players — with a stock price that's up 50% for the year.And the company says that it's not slowing down.""We are hiring people across all locations,"" Chief Executive Arkadiy Dobkin said Thursday on an earnings call with analysts. ""Over the last 18 months, we have expanded in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as in Latin America. We look at this from a global perspective of how to grow clients.""Although he has an overweight rating on the stock, JPMorgan analyst Alexei Gogolev is nevertheless bullish on Epam's growth prospects. He cites its ""unique delivery capabilities and rising demand for offshoring as an underpenetrated form of IT delivery.""RoadblocksBut there are roadblocks standing in Epam's way. For one, the company's earnings report this week left a number of questions unanswered as Epam suffered a rare hiccup in an otherwise stellar run of late.Reporting after the close on Wednesday, Epam logged third-quarter adjusted earnings of 70 cents a share. That was up 17% from the prior year and 2 cents above consensus analyst views. However, revenue fell short of estimates, growing 22% to $236 million vs. estimates for $239 million.Part of the problem was currency-exchange headwinds. More than half of Epam's business comes from outside the U.S., which means the strong U.S. dollar can drag on results.The company also does a lot of business in Ukraine, where tensions with Russia have been a challenge. Meanwhile, Epam must deal with rising inflation in the Russia-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).On the analyst call, Chief Financial Officer Anthony Conte said that currency ""remains a big piece of our story, suppressing our Q3 revenue by about 8%."" He also said that a ""significant slowdown"" in the Russian banking industry, coupled with the weak ruble, hurt business in Epam's important banking/financial segment.Weakness In RussiaJPMorgan's Gogolev reiterated that point in a Thursday morning note, saying, ""Low-teens growth of the financial services vertical comes on the back of continued weakness of the Russian banking industry.""Wall Street's reaction was negative. Leading up to the Wednesday report, Epam shares fell 4% for the day. On Thursday, investors initially panicked, sending down shares more than 11% in early trades. But the market thought better of it, and Epam pared its losses to 5% by the close, ending the day at 71.69.Those investors may be noting that even with the revenue miss, Epam's results continued a streak of 12 straight quarters of double-digit per-share earnings and revenue growth. Epam shares touched a record high of 81.95 on Oct. 7.That kind of strong, consistent growth has made Epam one of the top stocks in IBD's Computer-Technology Services group, which ranks No. 3 out of 197 industries tracked. Epam can't match IBM, Accenture, Infosys and Cognizant for billions of dollars in annual revenue. But it's the leader of the pack in the Investor's Business Daily Composite Rating, with a best-possible score of 99.Epam provides outsourced software engineering and other IT services to clients worldwide, though most of its business is in North America and Europe. Its portfolio of services includes product and application development, technology consulting, infrastructure and hosting, application testing, and maintenance and support. End markets include banking and finance — its biggest — as well as retail, travel, media and entertainment, software, technology, health care and life sciences.Buying And GrowingEpam has used a combination of organic growth and acquisitions to more than double its revenue over the past three years and gain more market share.Its latest buyout came in July, when it acquired NavigationArts, a digital consulting and content management firm with clients including Marriott International (MAR), privately held Ernst & Young and Time Warner Cable (TWC).Epam's biggest client is Swiss financial giant UBS (UBS), which accounts for more than $100 million in annual revenue. That's a pretty big chunk, considering that analysts expect Epam's 2015 revenue to be about $910 million.Its revenue from UBS rose more than 20% during the third quarter, Conte said on the conference call.""The growth there remains solid and strong. It was pretty much in line with what we expected it to be,"" he said. Conte noted that growth wasn't limited to just UBS, adding, ""We continue to gain traction and grow our business with the top clients.""The company says that revenue from Epam's top five customers grew about 20% from a year earlier, while revenue from the top 10 grew about 25%.In terms of geographic markets, Conte said, North America ""continues to be our strongest sector,"" helped by the strong U.S. dollar. ""We are seeing growth across all verticals in North America.""On the downside, Epam has now reported two straight quarters of decelerating revenue growth, which analyst Gogolev said ""may be partially explained by tougher (year-over-year) comps.""Still, the company continues to expand its operation and payroll. It ended the quarter with around 14,000 information technology professionals.Such expansion should help Epam continue its strong financial gains. It expects year-over-year revenue growth to be ""at least"" 30% this year. The company also said that its full-year EPS should be ""at least"" $2.65. That's below the $2.69 expected from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters but would still represent a 19% gain.

WNS (WNS) and ExlService (EXLS) are more niche-focused players.Genpact shares are up nearly 30% this year.Analysts project a 19% earnings gain on an 8% increase in revenue when the company reports its Q3 results after the market closes Nov. 4.

Even with that, though, shares have tripled this year and it remains No. 1 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks, a feature that should be on your regular checklist.At CES 2016, fitness wearables, drones, virtual reality, self-driving cars and hoverboards were headliners.The latest advancements of those technologies will be on display at CES 2017, but the tech press always gravitates to the next shiny new thing. After all, what's new is the nature of the news business.Six years ago, CES exhibitors en masse started labeling all their products as smart because they included a processor and connected to the internet. This year, companies are marketing their products as having artificial intelligence, or AI.Among the products at the show being promoted as having AI include cameras, drones, robots, autonomous cars, and even toothbrushes and patio umbrellas.""Artificial intelligence has the potential to be the story of the show,"" John Curran, managing director of Accenture's (ACN) Communications, Media and Technology business told IBD. ""It could be the golden thread that weaves together so much of what's happening at the show.""AI looks to be a core piece of many product categories, combining Big Data analytics, machine learning and natural language processing, he said. AI allows for easy access to information and device controls as well as predictive capabilities for personalized experiences, Curran said.Another big theme of CES 2017 is expected to be products with voice controls and virtual personal assistants.Amazon is poised to dominate the show with its Alexa voice-response technology, which powers its Echo smart speakers. Amazon is working to make Alexa a standard interface across a range of consumer electronics devices.Companies at CES will be demonstrating Alexa voice controls in such products as air purifiers, smartwatches, speakers and sprinkler systems.Amazon is even hosting a series of educational sessions at CES on building next-generation voice interfaces with Alexa.Rival voice-based digital butlers, such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home and Microsoft's (MSFT) Cortana also will be making their presence felt at the show.""One of the stories to watch at CES will be the platform aspects of these intelligent assistants,"" Curran said.Expect to hear about a lot of product partnerships using intelligent assistants from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and possibly Apple's (AAPL) Siri as those platforms seek to become standards in the home.""This has the potential to be a game changer and unlock a wave of innovation,"" Curran said.Intelligent assistants could spur sales of smart home devices and appliances such as connected thermostats, lighting and home security, he said.Augmented reality systems will be on display at CES 2017 for smartphones, smart glasses, toys, automotive head-up displays and other gadgets. Augmented reality overlays digitally created content into the user's real-world environment.""There's going to be a lot of virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality"" at CES 2017, Marjorie Costello, editor and publisher of Consumer Electronics Online News told IBD. ""There are going to be 360-degree cameras so people can create their own content (for VR headsets).""Major chip companies, which provide enabling technologies for consumer electronics, will be touting their latest advances at the show. Intel (INTC), Nvidia and Qualcomm (QCOM) are among those planning a big presence at the CES 2017.Major car companies including Ford (F), Honda (HMC), Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) also are exhibiting at the show, as are auto tech suppliers such as Mobileye (MBLY), Continental and Valeo (VLEEY).As usual, there are some big no-shows among exhibitors at CES, including Apple and Microsoft, which prefer to do their own product events.Big-screen TVs will remain a staple of the show, with major vendors expected to show off super-crisp OLED TVs and lower-priced 4K TVs with high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging.RELATED:Amazon Gets Big Boost For Echo As Microsoft Readies A Rival DeviceThe Top Selling Products On Amazon Over Holidays Came From ...

Secondly, Accenture continues to book long-term contracts, which take longer to convert to revenue. Furthermore, pricing pressure continues to suppress the growth in consulting.

What does that mean, and how do you mix in fundamental research with that?De Vassal: I look at our process as a quantitative discipline based on fundamental insights. I worked with fundamental managers for 20 years. They were value-oriented, growth-oriented, small-cap, large-cap, even international. Basically, one of my responsibilities was objectively assessing their criteria in selecting stocks in their particular sectors or universe, and assessing what worked and what didn't.And I've tried to remove the emotion and subjectivity out of the process.So we've built a library of the factors that worked and that didn't. They're different for different sectors. If you talk with a tech analyst versus a utility analyst, they talk about very different metrics as to why a company is effective or not.So we've built models that are unique for each sector. Some factors may be similar, but when we look at stocks, we look at them relative to their peers in the sector in terms of their attractiveness. This is a continual process every year.We add each year of data to our analysis. And we'll test new ideas.We have dialogue with our internal portfolio managers and analysts. We also have dialogue with some leading Street research firms like Empirical (Research Partners), Bernstein, JPMorgan (JPM) and Citi (C).IBD: What type of market does your approach work best in?De Vassal: Our process works when valuations and earnings matter. We look to create a portfolio that is cheap with high cash flow versus its benchmark, but has strong consistent profitability. And the stocks we own are likely to have positive earnings and revenue surprises, and fewer negative earnings and revenue surprises, than the benchmark.Where the strategy can struggle is when investors are distracted by macro issues. In the financial crisis in the Great Recession, earnings didn't matter. Investors fled equities, and they didn't care at what price.In that situation, when investors are not focused on specific company fundamentals but are driven by macro and behavioral issues, our models have less efficacy.IBD: What about more recently?De Vassal: Other periods when the strategy underperforms would be risk rallies, like 2009, and we've had a pretty strong risk rally starting in March this year, when a lot of the riskiest names are outperforming, in the last couple of months.But in this risk rally, there's been a lot of price dislocation when you look across stocks within sectors, a lot of gap between high- and low-priced stocks measured on, say, price-to-book.So this year's risk rally is a good environment for active equity managers because there seems to be a large arbitrage opportunity between cheap and expensive stocks that maybe can be taken advantage of. Those create opportunities for future price appreciation.IBD: So you like the current market?De Vassal: Our indicators still suggest we're in a positive growth environment for the U.S. economy. We had two weak quarters in Q4 and Q1. But our models suggest we should expect a rebound. Most economists expect 2% to 3% annualized growth in GDP for this quarter and the next couple of quarters.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceWe favor more cyclical sectors right now, like technology and consumer discretionary. We're underweight in interest-rate sensitive sectors like utilities and REITs.IBD: Let's talk about how you put your strategy to work. How does Edwards Lifesciences (EW) fit in? All of my questions are as of your latest disclosure.De Vassal: We owned it as of Jan. 31. It had good return on equity, over 20%. More sell-side analysts were raising than lowering estimates for the year and next year. The valuation was not cheap. But the fact that more analysts are raising estimates and that it has strong profitability and momentum -- historically, strong earnings growth offsets a rich valuation. And that's why we included this stock.IBD: What other holdings were you attracted to for similar reasons?De Vassal: Other names we bought in January were Oracle (ORCL), Masco (MAS), Schwab (SCHW). Again, they were attractive based on our criteria, a combination of earnings growth and analysts' estimates.One stock we sold in January was H&R Block (HRB). It was in the bottom quintile of its sector. Fortunately -- it's down 40% since we sold it.If there's something hitting one of our downside screens, we force it out of the portfolio. No questions asked.It takes time for fundamental analysts and portfolio managers to fall in love with a stock. But once they put it into a portfolio, it's hard for them to let go. We try to remove that emotion out of the process. In the long term, that adds to our performance.IBD: How does your approach differ from a fundamentals-only fund manager's?De Vassal: We look for stock that is cheap and has positive growth metrics and (whose coverage) analysts are raising estimates. We just look at what criteria work best in differentiating stocks in a sector. If it's a health care company, we don't look at what's in their pipeline, for example. Our stock ranking model for health care emphasizes high free cash flow yield, low relative price-to-book, strong reinvestment rate and positive earnings and revenue estimate revisions.IBD: Facebook (FB) has three quarters of accelerating earnings-per-share growth. How do you look at this holding?De Vassal: It's attractive in our models. Its valuation is not cheap. But its fundamentals and growth story are positive. So is the fact that analysts are raising estimates.There have been periods when we sold Facebook because it was getting too rich. Last year, the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, which is now Alphabet (GOOGL)) were just flying. But their valuations got too rich, and we wouldn't hold on. But at this point, Facebook would still be considered a buy in our models.IBD: You opened a stake in Lowe's (LOW) just last year. What was your thesis?
"
218,ACN,"De Vassal: We started our stake in June 2015. It ranked in the top third of our stock-ranking models. It had positive (revenue and earnings) estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. Valuation was not too extreme. The price-earnings ratio on this year's earnings was under 20.Our stock-ranking models are based on 12-month periods. We look to turn over about 1/12th of the portfolio each month to maintain attractiveness. Every month we look to refresh and harvest losses to offset short-term gains in particular.IBD: Cadence Design's (CDNS) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for two quarters. What's your quant view?De Vassal: It has had very positive earnings revisions. When we ran this in January, every analyst raised estimates for this company. Its P-E is not that expensive. It was 17.7 in January. It has done well and is now a little over 20.IBD: Thinly traded Mettler Toledo (MTD) is in an uptrend, but its EPS growth is slowing slightly. What's your view?De Vassal: It is still attractively ranked in our model. Estimate revisions are more neutral. But we showed positive for looking forward on analysts' estimates. It has very strong profitability, very high ROE. January ROE was over 40%. Some was contingent on book value. It's decelerating, but historically their growth has been over 10%. Looking forward, this still looks like double-digit growth, even if low double digits.IBD: You've been boosting your stake in Accenture (ACN). Why?De Vassal: It has a very attractive rank in the tech sector for us. Analysts at the margins are raising their estimates. It has high ROE and a good track record of dividend growth.IBD: What makes you different from other quant-oriented fund managers?De Vassal: The difference is in four principles.First, we believe in active management, and that stocks get mispriced. One issue with benchmark indices is that if a stock is overpriced, effectively it is overweighted. To address that, we ignore weights of individual stocks. We want to avoid the idiosyncratic risk of overexposure to a single name. If everything else is equal between a midcap and a mega-cap name, why wouldn't you invest in both instead of overweighting one just because it has a larger weight in the benchmark?Second, we treat each sector differently. I don't believe one model should be used for all stocks. Stocks in different sectors have different attributes and business models.Third, downside risk screens, including quality of earnings; avoiding companies with poor stock quality, debt and/or high idiosyncratic risk.Fourth, we differentiate stocks that are more likely to have positive versus negative surprises based on sell-side analyst behavior, company fundamentals and technical data.IBD: The idea behind your quantitative approach is that it homes in on the factors that identify stocks which outperform and it enables you to avoid being sidetracked by subjective factors that are, basically, irrelevant to outperformance, right?De Vassal: Yes, we build extensive back tests going back 20 years-plus, that identify which combinations of criteria would create a portfolio of stocks that outperform the average stock in the sector on a rolling 12-month basis, and which would be in the top 20%, the most attractive stocks.IBD: What about risk?De Vassal: We're looking for the most consistent excess return over rolling 12-month periods. So we're looking for the highest return per unit of shortfall risk. And shortfall risk would be any (stock) that didn't outperform the average stock by at least 200 basis points.We want to have upside, but we don't want to have much downside performance relative to the average stock.IBD: Some managers portray themselves as people who eat and sleep fund management, doing nothing else. But you've got at least one interesting hobby. Tell me about it, please.De Vassal: Well, one of my hobbies is genealogy. My last name is French. It's an old French name. We have a family tree going back more than 1,000 years. Apparently family members did a thousand-year reunion in 1987. We learned about it after the fact.We have a lot of documentation, interesting history. Our family went from France to the Ukraine in the early 1800s. We actually, this past Saturday, we saw relatives that we didn't know about. One, she was my third cousin. We got in touch through a Frenchman who was doing genealogical research on my family, and we ended up connecting for the first time.

233,ACN,"In factor investing with ETFs, the sum may be more than the parts.To be sure, single-factor exchange traded funds have dominated recently. Specifically, strategies to smooth the ride in a bumpy stock market.Investors have poured $5.28 billion in new money into iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV) so far this year -- or more than a third of the $12.97 billion in assets that it holds. That's made it the No. 1 equity ETF in terms of net inflow.However, the average investor may not fully grasp the risk-reward trade-off tied to single factors, says Rob Nestor, head of iShares smart beta.Low volatility ETFs have historically offered protection in down markets.  But they tend to underperform in market rallies, taking away from their returns over a full market cycle. An investor seeking to beat the market may end up feeling short-changed.Investors should not expect low volatility ETFs to outperform the market over a full market cycle. They should use low volatility strategies to reduce risk and to aim for a smoother ride, Nestor says.Nestor believes multifactor ETFs may be a good choice for many investors.""The multifactor approach is for the investor who wants to outperform, but not on a highly volatile path,"" Nestor said.Certain stock characteristics or ""factors"" -- such as size, quality, value and momentum -- have historically rewarded investors. They're also very lowly correlated to one another. So while the factors can be volatile individually, they help to reduce overall portfolio risk when combined, according to Nestor.Basically, multifactor ETFs aim to offer market risk with higher returns. Low or minimum volatility ETFs offer the market return with less risk.Multifactor ETFs have proliferated as investors seek to both outperform and manage risk. More than two dozen multifactor ETFs have launched within the past year from multiple issuers.IShares Edge MSCI Multifactor USA (LRGF) has racked up assets of $86.2 million in just over a year since its launch. LRGF focuses on financially healthy firms (quality), inexpensive stocks (value), smaller companies (size) and trending stocks (momentum).Its 141 large- and midcap holdings include Accenture (ACN), TJX Cos. (TJX) and Gilead (GILD).This month, iShares launched nine new multifactor ETFs focused on equity sectors such as technology and finance.John Hancock also offers a multifactor ETF suite.According to ETF firm Global X, the four multifactor funds in its ""Scientific Beta"" suite have all outperformed their market-cap-weighted benchmarks, with lower volatility, since launch. Global X Scientific Beta Japan (SCIJ) was down 0.3% year to date through May 19 vs. a 4.8% loss for iShares MSCI Japan (EWJ).""Multifactor funds are the latest evolution in smart beta investing,” said Jay Jacobs, director of research for Global X. “The rigorous research put into these strategies, combined with the low fees and increased tax efficiency associated with ETFs, represents an attractive alternative to expensive actively managed mutual funds.”Keep in mind that multifactor funds haven't much been tested in the real world. Jacobs also cautioned that not all multifactor ETFs are the same. He advised investors to assess the quality of the methodology. In particular, he noted that increasing a portfolio's factor exposure at the expense of diversification has been shown to result in lower risk-adjusted returns.""Multifactor ETFs backed by a methodology that adheres to academic research and seeks to maximize risk-adjusted returns are likely more appropriate as core portfolio holdings,"" he added.At CLS Investments, multifactor ETFs tend to be used in simple portfolios holding a handful of funds. Single-factor ETFs fit better in more complex portfolios.""That way we control exposures more to our liking,"" said Rusty Vanneman, CIO of the Nebraska-based firm, which manages north of $6 billion in assets.The firm emphasizes the use of factor-based, smart beta ETFs ""that will enhance performance relative to market benchmarks,"" according to Vanneman. In a low-growth climate, the firm favors high-quality stocks and accesses them through iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor (QUAL).Smart beta ETFs (also called strategic beta or alternative beta ETFs) include factor-based strategies. They typically tweak traditional indexes to boost returns, reduce risk or generate income.BlackRock projects smart beta ETF assets will reach $1 trillion globally by 2020, and $2.4 trillion by 2025. That's a 19% annual organic growth over the next five to 10 years, and double the rate of the overall ETF market.

235,ACN,"Wall Street seems to be more interested in what the Indian outsourcing companies will do next than how they performed previously. No surprises are expected when one of the biggest, Infosys (INFY), reports its fiscal 2016 fourth-quarter earnings way after the close Thursday, scheduled for 11:45 p.m. ET -- or about 9:15 a.m. Friday in Bangalore.The consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters suggests Infosys will report earnings up 5% to 23 cents minus items, on revenue up 13.6% to $2.43  billion for the quarter ended March 31.That would be its best revenue growth rate in six quarters and its best earnings growth in the last five quarters.Robert W. Baird analyst David Koning sees the EPS consensus as ""reasonable,"" but anyone expecting a tad above consensus for revenue ""seems aggressive based on historical trends,"" he said in a Tuesday research note. Baird rates Infosys stock neutral, with a 19 price target.Cowen analyst Bryan Bergin, who rates the stock as market perform with an 18 price target, says the company's Q4 ""results tend to be seasonally soft, and we don't expect any surprises there with low single-digit sequential revenue improvement, modeled at 1.4% (quarter to quarter in U.S. dollars, or about 2% in constant currency).""Instead, Bergin said, ""the primary focus will be its FY'17 guide. In sum, expectations are somewhat elevated going into this print, given INFY's recent momentum. We think a year-on-year top-line (in constant currency) growth midpoint of (about) 12% is benchmark for expectations. (We model a foreign-exchange headwind of 2.5%.) Its guide on operating margin will also be a key focus; we think at worst, a flat operating margin target range of 24%-26% is built into expectations, given its ambitious long-term target of 30% by 2020.""Analysts expect fiscal 2017 EPS of 98 cents minus items on revenue of $10.41 billion, up from an expected 90 cents and $9.46 billion, respectively, the previous year. For fiscal 2015, Infosys earned 87 cents per share minus items on $8.61 billion.

247,ACN,"As tablet penetration reaches half of U.S. households, sales growth for high-end tablets will decrease, with the next wave of adopters more attracted to lower-priced utility tablets, Gartner said. Apple (AAPL) is tablet leader, but Android is expected to take the lead this year.Research firm Gartner on Monday said that global spending on information technology is expected to reach $3.7 trillion in 2014, up 2.1% from 2013 but below Gartner's earlier projections of 3.2% growth.The reduced outlook is partly due to lowered expectations for revenue from devices and data-center systems.""Price pressure based on increased competition, lack of product differentiation and the increased availability of viable alternative solutions has had a dampening effect on the short-term IT spending outlook,"" Richard Gordon, managing vice president at Gartner, said in IT spending press release.The expected 2.1% growth this year would be an improvement from IT spending growth of 1% in 2013.From 2015 through 2018, Gartner expects a return to ""normal"" spending growth levels — 3% to 4% — as pricing and purchasing styles reach a new equilibrium.The category expected to see the strongest growth in 2014 is enterprise software, a field that includes companies such as Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT).

250,ACN,"When General Electric (GE) reports first-quarter earnings Friday before the market opens it will be as a radically different company than it was a year earlier.The industrial giant has been shedding its GE Capital financial businesses aggressively, and in January it agreed to sell its home appliances business to China's Haier Group for $5.4 billion as it dives deeper into technology, selling more software and services.Analyst consensus is for GE to report 19 cents earnings per share minus one-time items, a penny lower than the 20 cents it posted the same quarter in the previous year. It's only missed quarterly EPS estimates once in the prior two years. Analysts project revenue will fall 5.4% to $27.76 billion amid weakness in the energy and railroad industries and global economic uncertainty.Since announcing a few years ago that it planned to sell the bulk of its GE Capital businesses, GE has signed agreements for about $166 billion of the $200 billion in investments it plans to unload and now seeks to have its ""too big to fail"" label removed from its finance unit by federal regulators.Last week, GE announced that it had completed the sale of GE Capital Bank's U.S. online deposit platform, including all $16 billion of GE Capital Bank's U.S. deposits, to Goldman Sachs (GS) for an undisclosed sum.""With this sale, we are now in a position to fully exit the U.S. banking system by extinguishing our final U.S. bank charter and terminating our FDIC insurance, which we are targeting to complete by the end of this week,"" GE Capital Chairman and CEO Keith Sherin said in a statement last Monday.Meanwhile, GE in February launched a global partners network for its Predix operating system software, which is key for GE's ""Industrial Internet"" efforts. The network includes dozens of high-profile companies, such as Accenture (ACN), Deloitte Digital, Infosys (INFY) and No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC).GE's stock rose above a first-stage cup with handle base with a 30.69 buy point on March 17, and has remained in buy range.

252,ACN,"Shares of Accenture, the tech outsourcing and consulting company, jumped to a record high Thursday after the company reported a 24% improvement in fiscal second-quarter earnings, well beyond what Wall Street expected. It also beat revenue estimates.The company also raised its earnings guidance for the fiscal year ending in August. The improvements are driven by the digital transformation of Accenture's customers and their fear of disruption, according to the CEO.Accenture (ACN) stock was up 5.5% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, above 113 and up more than 20% from a seven-month low of  93.35 hit on Feb. 9, in the depths of the infamous Software Sag of 2016.Rivals IBM (IBM) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) were each up more than 1.7% Thursday afternoon, and India tech outsourcer Infosys (INFY) was up nearly 1%.Dublin-based Accenture said adjusted EPS reached $1.34 after removing income taxes and the gain on the sale of Navitaire, vs. $1.08 a year ago, on revenue up 6% to $7.9 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected EPS of $1.18 minus items for the quarter ended Feb. 29 on revenue of $7.72 billion.""We are benefiting from the focused investments we are making to rotate our business to new, high-growth areas where our capabilities are clearly resonating with the needs of our clients and differentiating us in the marketplace,"" said Accenture CEO Pierre Nanterme in the earnings release. ""At the same time, we continue to manage Accenture with discipline to further enhance our competitiveness. We remain very well-positioned to continue driving profitable growth and delivering value for our clients and shareholders.""In the company's earnings conference call with analysts, Nanterme, echoing his remarks in October,  said, ""The overall economic environment is sluggish, to say the least ... unstable, risky, extraordinarily complex.""He said he is ""not noticing"" much change in the sources of revenue from his customers, but ""it's all about digitalization. ... All the leaders in all the industries are subject to disruption. That's the new factor in town. It's about not being disrupted ... . I see this cycle is here for quite a while. They have to invest (into) rationalization of the operations, IT efficiency ...  across the board ... (which)  is driving our business.""The company guided the current Q3 revenue to $8.1 billion to $8.35 billion, up 7% to 10% in local currency after assuming a 2.5% foreign exchange impact, compared with $8.275 billion a year ago. The midpoint is slightly above analyst views. The company didn't project Q3 earnings, but analysts expect EPS ex items of $1.42, up 9%.Accenture raised its fiscal year earnings guidance to $5.21 to $5.32 per share excluding the after-tax impact of the gain on the sale of Navitaire vs. its earlier guidance of $5.09 to $5.24. Analysts were modeling $5.22, up 8.3% from $4.82 in fiscal 2015. At the new $5.265 midpoint, the fresh guidance represents a 9.2% gain for adjusted EPS.Accenture said sales for its communications, media and technology unit rose 6% to $1.61 billion; financial services also rose 6%, to $1.59 billion; health and public services rose 12% to $1.48 billion; and products rose 8% to $1.85 billion.But resources, which include the struggling energy industry, fell 3% to $1.21 billion.North America sales rose 11% to $3.41 billion, while Europe rose 5% growth to $2.78 billion and growth markets slowed 4% to $1.37 billion.The company declared a semiannual cash dividend of $1.10 per share. In Q2 it repurchased or redeemed 8.1 million shares for $829 million, bringing the total spent  on repurchases to $1.49 billion for the year.With an IBD Composite Rating of 82, Accenture is one of the better performers in IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group, among the top 18% of all stocks on a variety of metrics, including earnings and sales growth and stock performance. The biggest company in the group, IBM, rates a 55 CR. Infosys has an 87 CR and Cognizant an 84.Image provided by Shutterstock.

254,ACN,"Seemingly fully recovered from the infamous Software Sag of 2016 in January and February, big-cap Accenture (ACN) is flirting with a record-high stock price amid growth in its services, as it heads towards its fiscal Q2 earnings release due before the market open Thursday.Accenture stock was down a fraction in early trading in the stock market today, near 108, 18% above its seven-month low of 91.40 touched on Feb. 9 and just 2% off an all-time high of 109.86 set Oct. 28.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average estimated Accenture earned $1.18 per share minus items for the quarter ended in February, up 9% from the year-earlier period, on revenue of $7.72 billion, down 2.6%. Accenture guided Q2 to $7.62 billion at the midpoint of its range.Dublin-based Accenture ""cited no weakness in its financial services pipeline"" during its Q1 earnings release on Dec. 17, wrote Cowen analyst Bryan Bergin in a recent research note. ""This was (about) three weeks before a tumultuous start to 2016, and nearly two months prior to (services rival Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH)) sounding warning bells in its banking and financial services vertical.""In the Cowen Feb. 25 research note, entitled ""The Sky Does Not Appear to be Falling in Financial Services IT Spending,"" Bergin wrote that ""vendors that have noted service interruption have generally tied such weakness to a handful of specific clients. There have been Indian vendors with reports of healthy internal fiscal 2017 revenue growth targets, (notably Infosys (INFY) and Wipro (WIT)) and positive industry demand narratives across investor days by (Genpact (G), Epam Systems (EPAM) and Tata Consultancy Services) that have not yielded indications of across-the-board financials' spending declines.""He noted that Accenture has grown revenue in financial services in constant currency in four of the last five quarters, although financial clients represent only 21% of Accenture revenue in the last 12 months.In a research note last week, Trefis applauded Accenture for a ""very resilient business model,"" with 45% of its business in outsourcing and 55% in consulting.Cowen rates Accenture stock at outperform, with a 115 price target.With a healthy IBD Composite Rating (CR) of 80, meaning its stock is outperforming 80% of S&P 500 issues in a variety of metrics, Accenture is worth about half of IBM's (IBM) $142.8 billion in terms of market cap. IBM has a weak 56 CR.Infosys, with an 86 CR, has a $42.5 billion market cap, while Cognizant, with an 83 CR, is worth about $36.2 billion based on its stock price.Newly freed from PCs and printers, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) earns a 65 CR, with a $30.4 billion market cap.

256,ACN,"Genpact (G) has made its mark helping companies operate more efficiently, but over the last two years the business processing firm has invested heavily to make its own firm run more effectively.The company, once an India-based arm of General Electric (GE), had gone through some growing pains. The outsourcer for hundreds of companies worldwide -- handling non-core functions such as accounting and finance -- decided it was time to be more selective in the businesses it pursued.Out of the loop went telecom, utilities and government, among other lackluster sectors. More attention was paid to financial services, manufacturing, consumer products, pharma and high tech -- and in finding new ways to service those customers.""We’ve spent about $100 million-plus across a range of new capabilities to take the company to the next level, such as building out mobile and analytical solutions,"" Chief Executive N.V. ""Tiger"" Tyagarajan told IBD.Making such a move came with a price, though. Margins and earnings took a hit initially. In 2014, per-share earnings fell 9%. And as part of that, business from its largest client and former parent, GE, has shrunk to a fraction of what it was.But it’s a different picture now. The strategy to invest in client sectors with the best growth potential and dial back on smaller, less lucrative areas is starting to pay off.""They basically decided to take down their profitability to strategically drive revenue in specific areas,"" analyst Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald told IBD. ""You’ve seen growth rates pick up and positive data points in bookings’ numbers.""Genpact's total revenue in 2015 rose 8% over 2014 to $2.46 billion, but new bookings jumped 20%. Earnings for the year climbed 22% to $1.26 a share. In the fourth quarter, earnings grew 31% to 34 cents a share on revenue of $646.5 million, up 7% from the prior year.Revenue would have been higher had it not been negatively impacted by GE’s business divestitures. In the fourth quarter, GE revenue fell 1% year-over-year to $117 million, accounting for 18% of the total. Non-GE revenue from other global clients rose 10% to $529 million.For the full year, revenue from GE was down 1% to $460 million, representing 19% of total revenue. Global-client revenue grew 10% to $2 billion, or up 13% in constant currency.GE once accounted for 100% of Genpact’s revenue, when it was still an India-based business process management and information technology services arm of the massive U.S. conglomerate. In 2005, Genpact started providing services to non-GE clients, too, as an independent company. It went public in 2007.“As GE continues to change its portfolio, our relationship changes,” Tyagarajan said.About 60% of Genpact’s work is still performed in India. The rest is done in 18 other countries, including Romania, the Philippines, China, Mexico and Hungary. The company is headquartered in New York.The shrinking of GE’s contributions has been especially apparent since last March, when GE announced it would divest its financial services arm, GE Capital. Accelerated GE divestitures will weigh on 2016 results: Genpact expects GE revenue to fall 8% to 10% this year. But it forecasts that revenue from non-GE global clients will rise by 12.5% to 14%.Analysts expect total revenue this year to grow 7% to $2.64 billion, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. Earnings are seen rising 12% to $1.42 a share.Tyagarajan doesn’t seem worried about lost business from GE.“As GE sells those businesses, it’s natural for us to enter into new relationships with the buyers. The work has to continue,” he said.Of the 12 GE Capital businesses sold so far, Genpact has already entered into contracts with four buyers, including Bank of Montreal (BMO). Tyagarajan says it’s in talks with the eight others.Meanwhile, the outsourcing of business and technology services is a market with a lot of growth left in it, he says.“So much change and disruption in technology is very good for us,” he said. “Our role is to help our clients think about change and help them change.”As Genpact has changed its focus, its client roster has fallen from more than 800 to roughly 700, though Tyagarajan says the value of its contracts has been growing.Clients range from drug-store retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to manufacturers such as Boeing (BA), Nissan Motor (NSANY) and Honeywell (HON). Consumer products customers include Mondelez (MDLZ) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB). In pharma, it counts AstraZeneca (AZN) and others among its clients.The company’s ties with GE are a ""competitive advantage,"" noted analyst Frank Atkins of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey in a recent note to clients, which came with a buy rating and price target of 30.Among those advantages are GE’s culture of lean principles and systems. What’s more, he noted, many GE execs go on to management roles at other firms, creating an expanded network of potential new client wins for Genpact.""Its relationship with GE and recent investments give it solid positioning versus competitors,"" Atkins wrote. The company also addresses more industry verticals than many of its peers, he said.Genpact competes with pure-play business process management providers WNS (WNS) and ExlService Holdings (EXLS), as well as business processing units of larger global consultancies such as Accenture (ACN) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH).Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro (WIT) and Infosys (INFY) are also rivals in certain areas.""Genpact has a longer sales cycle than typical outsourcing companies,"" said Cantor Fitzgerald's Foresi, meaning it takes longer to land a sale and start servicing clients once a deal is signed. ""So the business is potentially stickier.""

IT business process outsourcing (BPO) rivals Infosys (INFY) and Accenture (ACN) were each down about 2% midday Tuesday.And IBM (IBM) stock was down more than 1.5% Tuesday. Its new IBM Watson Health is geared specifically to getting hospitals and medical practices migrating toward better electronic health records. Health care software vendor Athenahealth (ATHN), which has been struggling near seven-month lows, was down 1%.""Rising medical costs, consumerization of health care and a changing regulatory environment, among other things, are driving industry consolidation in the payer industry,"" said Cognizant President Gordon Coburn in the company's earnings conference call with analysts. ""We're seeing some slowdown in our health care practice due to this consolidation, particularly in the early part of this year, as reflected in our Q1 guidance.""That said, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities within the payer segment and are quite encouraged by the large deal pipeline in this area for 2016. As the health care industry shifts from fee-for-service to value-based care models, health care organizations are simultaneously looking for new ways to deliver consumer-centric care while driving operational efficiencies.""

"
293,ACN,"In 2012, news surfaced that the IRS was looking into Ebix's income tax returns for 2008 through 2012 amid speculation that Ebix was booking U.S. revenues to low-tax foreign subsidiaries. Later that year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched a related investigation into the company's accounting practices. The IRS found no money laundering issues in the 2012 matter and Ebix announced in January that it had resolved the audit with an assessment resulting in a roughly $1.4 million impact on its net income for 4Q 2014. That apparently ended the SEC probe into the firm's accounting practices, though the SEC made no official announcement.

Revenue from the contract is expected to start being reflected in Q1 2016, but the companies have not revealed details.Insurance Software MiddlemanEbix plays an intermediary role among agents, brokers and financial advisors and carriers. For example, a wealth advisor can take information from a potential client seeking an annuity and input that into Ebix's customer relationship management product. The software populates the fields in the application with pertinent information and the form is sent to various carriers, to be returned with quotes and other information to help customers choose. An agent or broker can bind a policy, or put it into force, within the Ebix platform.In Ebix's Aug. 7 earnings release, CEO Raina said ""momentum is on our side"" thanks to new contracts and partnerships.""We are also pursuing a number of key acquisition opportunities that are expected to be quite accretive for our shareholders,"" Raina said then. ""We also believe that we can increase our reach and top line revenue growth substantially by forging strong strategic alliances with reputed advisory and consulting companies who will market and sell our products to their large client base.""Ebix to date has mostly provided software through direct sales, not partnerships.Asked for comment on possible acquisitions or partnerships, Ebix spokesman Aaron Tikkoo told IBD via email that the firm is pursuing acquisitions in the U.S. and Asia and ""is in advanced discussions with a few targets.""Expects Big PartnershipVan Rhee says it's not unusual for a company like Ebix to telegraph such moves. He expects Ebix will partner with a large firm to enter a new market.""I see some strategic relationships that could be needle movers,"" Van Rhee said. ""I suspect we'll see them sign some noteworthy distribution relationships with a tier-one systems integrator.""A string of acquisitions in the insurance software niche already was in the works when Google officially entered the U.S. auto insurance market in March with its Google Compare. The site lets auto insurance customers do cost and coverage comparisons online. The move had been expected.Others have moved as well.In April, Ebix competitor Vertafore partnered with Microsoft (MSFT) to give its customers the ability to tap into Microsoft's customer relationship management platform.In June, Bothell, Wash.-based Vertafore acquired agency management software firm QQ Solutions.Another Ebix competitor is University Park, Ill.-based Applied Systems. Privately held Applied in June acquired Lincoln, Neb.-based Semcat, a provider of comparative rating technology.Applied has since announced expanded contracts with German financial services firm Allianz and several mutual insurance firms.While not a direct competitor at present with Ebix, Google has moved into the insurance distribution channel by partnering with existing operators like Compare.com and CoverHound. Google has also teamed with New York-based insurance software provider Bolt Solutions.The partnership with Compare.com gives Google Compare users access to some of Compare.com's carrier partners, through the Google Compare site. Compare.com is compensated by carriers for policies initiated via its site.Google 'Disruptive'Google has a similar arrangement with CoverHound, which offers online quotes for insurers including Hartford, Progressive, Travelers and 21st Century.No financial terms for these Google partnerships were disclosed. Google spokesman Joe Osborne declined to comment on the company's plans in the insurance market.These deals made Google a consumer-to-carrier go-between. And in May, Google added to its market presence when it announced that it was offering consumers the ability to reach a local insurance agent to get help with a policy.Google has followed a pattern similar to its efforts with Google Compare in the U.K., where since 2012 it has provided auto and travel insurance quotes, as well as mortgage quotes.""Google's entry into the auto insurance space was very disruptive in the U.K.,"" Van Rhee said. ""It's still early in the U.S., but it's clearly a competitive move in the insurance sector.""Van Rhee, though, maintains his buy rating on Ebix stock, with a 40 price target.""I think it's underappreciated in terms of the current valuation,"" he said.Ebix, though, has endured some rough seas.Shareholders sued Ebix in 2011, accusing company executives of padding Q4 2009 revenue. In 2014, the company agreed to pay $6.5 million to settle this suit.In 2012, news surfaced that the IRS was looking into Ebix's income tax returns for 2008 through 2012 amid speculation that Ebix was booking U.S. revenues to low-tax foreign subsidiaries. Later that year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched a related investigation into the company's accounting practices. The IRS found no money laundering issues in the 2012 matter and Ebix announced in January that it had resolved the audit with an assessment resulting in a roughly $1.4 million impact on its net income for 4Q 2014. That apparently ended the SEC probe into the firm's accounting practices, though the SEC made no official announcement.In May 2014, Ebix had to terminate an agreement to be acquired by a unit of Goldman Sachs (GS) for $820 million, after being notified by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia that it had opened an investigation into allegations of intentional misconduct in pending shareholder class-action lawsuits.These issues put the firm in the cross hairs of short-sellers. A year ago, Ebix was near the top of the S&P 1500's most-shorted stocks.But its problems have mostly been resolved, and short interest has fallen from 13.07 million shares at the start of the year to roughly 9.8 million as of mid-August, according to Nasdaq.With the air cleared, Ebix made four acquisitions last year, all for undisclosed sums.

"
342,ACN,"Epam Systems (EPAM) might not be the best known stock in its industry group — not when that group includes tech heavyweights IBM (IBM), Accenture (ACN), Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) and Infosys (INFY) — but the provider of outsourced software engineering and other IT services takes a back seat to no one when it comes to consistently strong financial growth.With seven straight quarters of double-digit earnings and revenue gains, Epam has put in one of the best recent financial performances of any stock in IBD's Computer-Technology Services group.The company's 98 Composite Rating places it No. 2 in the group behind Cognizant, which boasts a 99 rating. Epam's stock is still trading near the all-time high of 75.89 it established on July 13. Epam stock closed Friday at 74.11, up 55% since the beginning of the year.Epam is expected to continue its double-digit growth streak when it reports second-quarter earnings after the close on Tuesday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see Q2 earnings of 65 cents a share, up from 53 cents the prior year. Revenue is expected to rise 23% to $215.6 million.The strong growth numbers come despite some pretty significant headwinds for Epam.More than half of its business comes from outside the U.S., which means the strong U.S. dollar acts as a drag.

"
344,ACN,"Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) is no stranger to the acquisitions game. The provider of information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing has made 16 buys since 2010. Its acquisition strategy has been to focus on geographic expansion and strengthening its industry knowledge or technological abilities, Cognizant President Gordon Coburn told IBD.
"
345,ACN,"Until recently, most buys had been tuck-in acquisitions for $200 million or less. The exception came in November, when Cognizant closed on the $2.7 billion purchase of TriZetto, a privately held provider of health-care IT software that helps payers and providers work more efficiently together.
"
346,ACN,"TriZetto could have wound up elsewhere, though few firms could have provided a healthier home. Only IBM (IBM), Accenture (ACN) and Infosys (INFY) enjoy larger market caps than Cognizant's $40.9 billion in IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group, although Wipro (WIT) isn't far behind. But Cognizant is the only member of the industry group to earn the highest possible 99 Composite Rating.
"
347,ACN,"At the time of the purchase, TriZetto software managed the health benefits of close to half the insured population of the U.S. and supported about a quarter of all U.S. care providers with more than 350 health plans.
"
348,ACN,"TriZetto broadened the offerings of Cognizant's already fast-growing health-care segment, which provides health insurers, drug companies, biotech and other health-related businesses with services that address regulatory requirements, including compliance with the Affordable Care Act. At the time of the buy, Cognizant's health-care segment served more than 200 clients and accounted for about 26% of sales.
"
349,ACN,"New Software Platforms
"
350,ACN,"""TriZetto further strengthened our position in health care,"" Coburn told IBD. ""TriZetto is the leading platform in health care administration.
"
351,ACN,"""Most important, TriZetto brought us (software) platforms (complementing) technology and business process services"" that Cognizant already offered.
"
352,ACN,"Coburn says that with TriZetto in the mix, Cognizant is expanding from being a services provider to a combination of providing both services and platform products.
"
353,ACN,"""That's a key component of our growth for the future in the health-care industry as well as other industries,"" he said, adding that Cognizant's strategy is to ""buy, build and partner,"" using those platforms across various industries.
"
354,ACN,"He says there will be ""similar (growth) opportunities"" in financial services and pharmaceuticals due to ""changes in the regulatory environment, cost pressures and changing industry dynamics.""
"
355,ACN,"The financial services segment is Cognizant's biggest business, accounting for 41.8% of revenue in 2014. Its manufacturing, retail and logistics segment accounted for 20.4% of 2014 revenue.
"
356,ACN,"An IBD Leaderboard stock, Cognizant has been on a long-running winning streak with 16 straight quarters of double-digit sales and earnings growth.
"
357,ACN,"In the second quarter, adjusted earnings rose 20% to 79 cents a share, ahead of views. Revenue climbed 23% to $3.09 billion, also topping forecasts. Cognizant also raised its full-year 2015 earnings and revenue estimates for the second time this year.
"
358,ACN,"Cognizant's stock rose 6.4% on Aug. 5, the day it reported second-quarter results. Its stock continues to hover near its all-time closing high of 68.44.
"
359,ACN,"""This is a company where revenue growth is by far the main driver of its valuation,"" said Robert Baird's David Koning. Year-to-year ""revenue growth in Q2 was the strongest in almost two years in both reported and organic and constant currency revenue.""
"
360,ACN,"Koning says the ""backdrop"" to support strong revenue growth is Cognizant's ""good execution and willingness to invest in growth along with an industry backdrop that's still in a secular growth mode.""
"
361,ACN,"The industry's growth mode, he says, is being driven by companies' willingness to spend on offshore IT and certain vertical segments having ""solid underlying growth.""
"
362,ACN,"The health care segment was the quarter's fastest grower, with a 39% rise in revenue.
"
363,ACN,"TriZetto contributed about $171.1 million in sales and was one of the ""drivers"" of the big gain, said CEO Francisco D'Souza on the quarter's conference call.
"
364,ACN,"Koning calculates that the offshore IT services industry has grown organic revenue on a constant currency basis about 10%-13% annually over the past few years, while Cognizant has grown around the mid-teens to 20%.
"
365,ACN,"How has Cognizant kept up such a fast pace?
"
366,ACN,"""When we went public in 1998, we made the decision to keep margins at between 19% and 20%, which was lower than many of our competitors at the time, and use that money to invest for the long term and deliver industry leading revenue growth,"" Coburn said.

"
371,ACN,"In the last year or so, he adds, Cognizant has seen ""very strong demand"" from customers in implementing digital transformation within their businesses.
"
372,ACN,"""We've experienced explosive growth in this area,"" he said.
"
373,ACN,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Cognizant's earnings to grow by 17% in 2015 to $3.03 a share. They see a 15% increase in 2016 and a 16% gain in 2017.
"
374,ACN,"""The combination of all the changes related to the Affordable Care Act and the aging of the population creates a nice backdrop for growth in Cognizant's health-care segment, which represents about 30% of the company's revenue,"" said Koning. ""We believe the backdrop is solid, but it's hard to predict when the ebbs and flows come.""
"
375,ACN,"Other highly rated members of IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group include Epam Systems (EPAM) and CDW (CDW).Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) is no stranger to the acquisitions game. The provider of information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing has made 16 buys since 2010. Its acquisition strategy has been to focus on geographic expansion and strengthening its industry knowledge or technological abilities, Cognizant President Gordon Coburn told IBD.Until recently, most buys had been tuck-in acquisitions for $200 million or less. The exception came in November, when Cognizant closed on the $2.7 billion purchase of TriZetto, a privately held provider of health-care IT software that helps payers and providers work more efficiently together.TriZetto could have wound up elsewhere, though few firms could have provided a healthier home. Only IBM (IBM), Accenture (ACN) and Infosys (INFY) enjoy larger market caps than Cognizant's $40.9 billion in IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group, although Wipro (WIT) isn't far behind. But Cognizant is the only member of the industry group to earn the highest possible 99 Composite Rating.At the time of the purchase, TriZetto software managed the health benefits of close to half the insured population of the U.S. and supported about a quarter of all U.S. care providers with more than 350 health plans.TriZetto broadened the offerings of Cognizant's already fast-growing health-care segment, which provides health insurers, drug companies, biotech and other health-related businesses with services that address regulatory requirements, including compliance with the Affordable Care Act. At the time of the buy, Cognizant's health-care segment served more than 200 clients and accounted for about 26% of sales.New Software Platforms""TriZetto further strengthened our position in health care,"" Coburn told IBD. ""TriZetto is the leading platform in health care administration.""Most important, TriZetto brought us (software) platforms (complementing) technology and business process services"" that Cognizant already offered.Coburn says that with TriZetto in the mix, Cognizant is expanding from being a services provider to a combination of providing both services and platform products.""That's a key component of our growth for the future in the health-care industry as well as other industries,"" he said, adding that Cognizant's strategy is to ""buy, build and partner,"" using those platforms across various industries.He says there will be ""similar (growth) opportunities"" in financial services and pharmaceuticals due to ""changes in the regulatory environment, cost pressures and changing industry dynamics.""The financial services segment is Cognizant's biggest business, accounting for 41.8% of revenue in 2014. Its manufacturing, retail and logistics segment accounted for 20.4% of 2014 revenue.An IBD Leaderboard stock, Cognizant has been on a long-running winning streak with 16 straight quarters of double-digit sales and earnings growth.In the second quarter, adjusted earnings rose 20% to 79 cents a share, ahead of views. Revenue climbed 23% to $3.09 billion, also topping forecasts. Cognizant also raised its full-year 2015 earnings and revenue estimates for the second time this year.Cognizant's stock rose 6.4% on Aug. 5, the day it reported second-quarter results. Its stock continues to hover near its all-time closing high of 68.44.""This is a company where revenue growth is by far the main driver of its valuation,"" said Robert Baird's David Koning. Year-to-year ""revenue growth in Q2 was the strongest in almost two years in both reported and organic and constant currency revenue.""Koning says the ""backdrop"" to support strong revenue growth is Cognizant's ""good execution and willingness to invest in growth along with an industry backdrop that's still in a secular growth mode.""The industry's growth mode, he says, is being driven by companies' willingness to spend on offshore IT and certain vertical segments having ""solid underlying growth.""The health care segment was the quarter's fastest grower, with a 39% rise in revenue.TriZetto contributed about $171.1 million in sales and was one of the ""drivers"" of the big gain, said CEO Francisco D'Souza on the quarter's conference call.Koning calculates that the offshore IT services industry has grown organic revenue on a constant currency basis about 10%-13% annually over the past few years, while Cognizant has grown around the mid-teens to 20%.How has Cognizant kept up such a fast pace?""When we went public in 1998, we made the decision to keep margins at between 19% and 20%, which was lower than many of our competitors at the time, and use that money to invest for the long term and deliver industry leading revenue growth,"" Coburn said. ""We've continued to successfully execute on this strategy ever since.""He says Cognizant has invested in having ""strong global delivery capabilities combined with deep industry knowledge and strong client relationships.""He added: ""Our customers today have a dual mandate. They have to run their businesses better by becoming more efficient and effective.

376,ACN,"Tyler Technologies, which bills itself as America's largest provider of information management software and services to local governments, continues to bolster its position with an expanding portfolio of products to meet what it views as reliable demand from the public sector.
"
377,ACN,"The Plano, Texas, firm's client base of over 13,000 local government offices spans all 50 states, as well as Canada, the Caribbean and the United Kingdom.
"
378,ACN,"Following the 2007-08 financial crisis and the recession that accompanied it, local governments grappled with tax revenue shortfalls and budget struggles, forcing many to put off investments in new technology. In turn, Tyler (TYL) saw its growth curbed in 2010 and 2011.
"
379,ACN,"As this happened, aging software and management systems — many of which dated to the late 1990s when governments last made upgrades en masse ahead of Y2K — grew outdated.
"
380,ACN,"Once the economic recovery took hold, analysts say, rejuvenated local governments moved with haste to address pent-up demand for new technology, bolstering Tyler's fortunes.
"
381,ACN,"Meeting Demand
"
382,ACN,"Tyler Chief Financial Officer Brian Miller says the market has settled into a new normal now, one defined by solid demand from a broad customer base. The replacement cycle, coupled with increasing needs for advanced technology and Tyler's ability to sell more of its services to existing customers, creates a long runway for ongoing sales growth, he said in an interview.
"
383,ACN,"""It's a very steady market with strong long-term opportunities,"" Miller said.
"
384,ACN,"The company has generated double-digit gains in revenue for 14 straight quarters. Most recently, for the first quarter, it reported revenue of $135 million, up 20% from a year earlier. It posted net income of 59 cents per diluted share, an increase of 38%.
"
385,ACN,"For Tyler's second-quarter report on July 22 after the stock market close, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of 61 cents, up 17%, on revenue of $142 million.
"
386,ACN,"For the full year, Tyler has guided for revenue of $568 million to $575 million, with EPS of $2.46 to $2.54.
"
387,ACN,"The analyst consensus is for a little under $574 million in revenue and $2.52 EPS.
"
388,ACN,"Tyler is a part of IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group. The biggest names in the group by market cap are IBM (IBM), Accenture (ACN) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH), but Tyler is highest-ranked by Composite Rating, with a 98 out of a possible 99 from IBD.
"
389,ACN,"Tyler's managerial offerings include enterprise resource planning (ERP) for cities, counties and schools — everything from electronic records management to payroll processing — as well as software and systems that automate property assessments.
"
390,ACN,"Revved Up In The Downturn
"
391,ACN,"Miller says the company invested in research and development in the aftermath of the recession, pushing for innovation when most competitors pulled back on that front.
"
392,ACN,"It has developed faster, more comprehensive and easier-to-integrate systems that are of increasing appeal to local governments that need to replace systems and want to do so with technology that can make them more efficient.
"
393,ACN,"Miller says that as Tyler invested in R&D, many of its smaller competitors who ""went the opposite direction"" have since lost relevancy.
"
394,ACN,"Miller adds that two-thirds of the local government ERP systems needing to be replaced in the near future were bought from companies that no longer compete with Tyler — creating fertile ground for new business.
"
395,ACN,"Another big advantage for Tyler, analysts say, is that it operates in multiple areas of the local government arena, while smaller players tend to be less diverse.
"
396,ACN,"This lets Tyler provide more comprehensive services at competitive rates and sell more of its offerings to each customer.
"
397,ACN,"""They've really become the standout,"" Benchmark Co. analyst Mark Schappel told IBD, adding that smaller competitors are ""less and less meaningful. Tyler is in the driver's seat.""
"
398,ACN,"Miller also credits Tyler's ""evergreen"" program for its software.
"
399,ACN,"Under a systems support or subscription agreement with a customer, he says, the client pays small annual maintenance costs, as opposed to dealing with large periodic licensing fees, and in exchange gets regular software updates to stay current.
"
400,ACN,"Tyler this year introduced a companion offering, its EverGuide initiative for services and consulting. This should further boost customers' ""upsell likelihood,"" William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho said in a research report.
"
401,ACN,"Tyler competes with industry stalwarts such as SAP (SAP) and Oracle (ORCL). Miller says that Tyler often wins business over its larger rivals because customers appreciate its focus solely on the public sector —local governments in particular.
"
402,ACN,"The Tyler staffers responsible for integrating new technology for customers ""know that business backward and forward,"" he said.
"
403,ACN,"Winning Contracts
"
404,ACN,"Miller says that Tyler has been consistently posting overall win rates of 60% or better — meaning it beats out the competition at least 60% of the time on the business it goes after — and that is 10% better than prior to the recession. Tyler is generating even higher win rates in certain businesses.
"
405,ACN,"The company's courts-and-justice operation is a key example of this, Miller says. Its software helps administrators manage jails, aids police and prosecutors in tracking cases, and connects the three entities to provide efficient case management and records updates.
"
406,ACN,"Tyler's Odyssey court-case management system, an electronic filing service, processes fines and generates court documents among other tasks, reducing staffing hours and paper costs for local governments, the company says.
"
407,ACN,"Tyler's win rate is ""north of 85%"" in the courts-and-justice business, Miller said. ""We are winning virtually every meaningful deal in that space.""
"
408,ACN,"Business has been particularly robust in California. Miller notes that a drawn-out effort to develop a statewide court system there was ultimately scrapped two years ago.
"
409,ACN,"It left counties, which had put their own systems in limbo in anticipation of moving under a state umbrella, to hastily pursue upgrades.
"
410,ACN,"""That created an accelerated demand,"" he said. ""A lot of the counties had very urgent needs to replace systems.""
"
411,ACN,"Courting California
"
412,ACN,"Of 58 counties in California, 28 have bought new systems, and Tyler has won 25 of those deals, Miller says. ""I think we've won the last 18 in a row. We clearly have been very, very successful in that marketplace,"" he said.
"
413,ACN,"Its clients range from the smallest counties all the way up to the largest, Los Angeles County.
"
414,ACN,"The L.A. County contract was valued at $32 million, Miller says.
"
415,ACN,"""In our view,"" analyst Ho wrote, ""the courts-and-justice business continues to be a source of significant opportunity for the company.""
"
416,ACN,"Tyler's growth plans could include acquisitions, Miller says, adding that the company is ""very disciplined"" on pricing. With no debt on its balance sheet and strong cash flow, he says, it has its eyes open for attractive opportunities.
"
417,ACN,"He points to its acquisition of Brazos Technology in May as a good example. Brazos makes handheld electronic devices for police officers to record traffic tickets and accident information. Brazos had generated annual revenue under $10 million. But by pairing its devices with Tyler's broader offerings and larger client base, Miller says, Tyler can boost those sales.
"
418,ACN,"He adds that Tyler in recent years has sought out targets of Brazos' size, largely to fill gaps in its service, and has the wherewithal to do larger deals too. That said, Tyler is so confident in its organic growth prospects that it feels no pressure to move urgently on the deal front.

436,ACN,"Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) will have a lot to prove when it reports its fiscal second-quarter earnings after the market close Thursday.The computer products giant aims to rebound from its first-quarter earnings report, which included revenue that fell short of analyst estimates. Sales fell or were flat across all six of HP's business sectors. HP stock tumbled nearly 10% on Feb. 25, the day following its earnings report, to a seven-month low. HP stock is down more than 15% this year.Prior to Q1, HP had been building a groundswell of support from investors as the company gets closer to splitting into two separate companies, with PCs and printers in one company and enterprise services, equipment and software in the other. The split is expected to occur in October.HP is also amid a five-year restructuring plan launched in May 2012 aimed at placing more emphasis on emerging growth areas, including the cloud and security, as PC and printer growth slows.HP is in a quandary by operating in a difficult PC and printer market while trying to compete with rivals such as Accenture (ACN) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) in the enterprise services and equipment businesses, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. He rates HP stock a hold.""PCs is obviously a very difficult business,"" White told IBD. ""though they did pretty well last year. And they do a good job in printing, but it's kind of a secular, declining business.""They are not really great at the enterprise side.

487,ACN,"When you build trust into the fabric of your organization, people can depend on others and are reliable enough for their peers to count on them. A good firm needs both, says Charlie Green, founder and president of Trusted Advisor Associates, a West Orange, N.J.-based training and leadership development firm. Here's why and how to achieve that.
"
488,ACN,"• Speed it up. Things go faster and costs fall when you have a workplace built on trust, Green says. When you trust your customer, and vice versa, you can make deals faster. Employees don't have to check up on each other constantly, either. And customers stay with you. ""The economics of customer retention are huge,"" he told IBD. ""They're bigger than being the low-cost producer.""
"
489,ACN,"• Get creative. A trusting environment is a breeding ground for innovation. People share ideas only with others they can rely on, underscores Green. That collaboration leads to new approaches.
"
490,ACN,"• Display. Leaders must show they can be trusted if they want others to rely on fellow employees. Follow through on commitments and be consistent and transparent.
"
491,ACN,"""If the leader isn't accountable, the employees won't be, and it trickles on through,"" said Bette Price, CEO of Dallas-based leadership consulting firm Price Group. ""But if I can trust my supervisor, I'll be more committed to not letting that supervisor down.""
"
492,ACN,"• Recruit. Trust is a huge factor for young workers such as millennials, Price says. If you have it, they'll come to work for you. They tend to want to trust their supervisor and to be trusted. The key is to avoid overseeing every little move an employee makes. ""If I'm being micromanaged, it means you don't trust me,"" Price said.
"
493,ACN,"• Focus on others. If you make decisions based on what's best for the customer or the other employees, you'll win their trust, Green says. One tech company rep told a client it didn't need an expensive overhaul, just a low-cost product. He looked past the big commission to help the client.
"
494,ACN,"""The customer says, 'I believe him, because why would he give up the sale?'"" Green said. ""That's enormously credibility-building.""
"
495,ACN,"• Communicate. Some managers don't mean to seem distrustful, but come across that way. Price worked with one firm where the employees complained that the manager constantly asked questions about how they did their jobs. It made them feel that he didn't trust them. It turned out he asked simply so he could explain their jobs to higher-ups.
"
496,ACN,"""If he completely communicated that, it would put it in a whole different context,"" Price said.
"
497,ACN,"• Talk about it. Price knows one leader who garnered trust by meeting once a month with employees. They could ask anything, and he answered as much as he could.
"
498,ACN,"""That establishes that credibility of trust,"" she said.
"

512,ACN,"On Monday, Linux leader Red Hat (RHT) also gave a disappointing outlook, in part due to macroeconomic concerns focused on Europe, as IBD reported.Accenture (ACN) stock fell nearly 4% in morning trading Friday, one day after the big technology consulting and outsourcing services company's earnings and outlook missed Wall Street expectations, as an executive cited a ""lower growth"" cycle.For its fiscal Q4 ended Aug. 31, Accenture reported per-share profit minus items, of $1.01, which missed views by a penny, vs. 88 cents in the year-earlier period.Revenue rose 4% to $7.1 billion, edging views by $200,000.For its first quarter, Accenture expects revenue of $7 billion and $7.3 billion, up 2.8% to 4.2%, below views of $7.39 billion.During a conference call late Thursday with analysts, Accenture CEO Pierre Nanterme said the company continues to be challenged by a tough macroeconomy.""At a time where volatility and uncertainty are still the name of the game, we continue to focus on driving our own competitiveness, applying rigor and discipline across the board to increase our efficiency and expand our margins,"" he said. ""And this is giving us the capacity to invest in the business to continue to capture new ways of growth.""But the company's growth path doesn't appear to be getting easier, David Rowland, Accenture's chief financial officer, said on the call.""For the past four to five quarters, it's clear that our addressable market has been in a cycle of lower growth and this has clearly impacted our growth,"" he said. ""As we look forward, we think it's likely that our overall market conditions won't change much in the near term. In other words, it will be more of the same.""Accenture stock, which hit an all-time high of 84.22 in May, is trading near 73 in the stock marketFriday.On Monday, Linux leader Red Hat (RHT) also gave a disappointing outlook, in part due to macroeconomic concerns focused on Europe, as IBD reported.

538,ACN,"Accenture's revenue ascended in its fiscal fourth quarter, but investors focused on the company's Q4 earnings miss and lower-than-expected sales outlook for the current quarter.The global management consulting, technology and outsourcing service company announced its fourth-quarter numbers before the market opened Wednesday, results that showed its first double-digit revenue growth in more than two years.Accenture's (ACN) Q4 revenue beat Wall Street's estimates, but that was tempered by earnings per share that were short of views.The company's revenue estimate range for the current quarter was also on the light side of estimates.The stock rose 0.8% to 80.20.The fact that Accenture reported double-digit revenue growth across four of its biggest operating groups and encouraging year-over-year gains in the U.S. and Europe seems to indicate the company is on the right track, says James Friedman, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group. He has a buy rating on the company.""This is the fastest growth the company has had in 2-1/2 years,"" he told IBD, noting that the company posted its first double-digit, year-over-year quarterly growth since early 2012. ""This is a large company that is suggesting a pattern of acceleration.""Joseph Foresi, an analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott, was more cautious in his assessment of the quarter. He also has a buy rating on the company.""The growth was relatively steady across most service verticals and geographies,"" he told IBD. ""The underlying business appears stable; that was evident in the execution in the quarter.""For the quarter ended Aug. 31, Accenture reported earnings per share minus items of $1.08, up 7% from the same period last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $1.10. Revenue climbed 10% to $7.78 billion. Wall Street was looking for sales of $7.62 billion, or growth of 7%.For the year, Accenture reported earnings per share of $4.52, up nearly 8% but a penny short of views. Revenue climbed 5% to $30 billion, ahead of estimates of $29.8 billion, or growth of 4.4%.For the current quarter, Accenture said it expects revenue of $7.55 billion to $7.80 billion, or growth of 2.7% to 6%. Analysts were expecting $7.8 billion in sales. For the full year, Accenture expects earnings per share of $4.74 to $4.88, up 4.8% to 7.9%.While analysts expect $4.91, Friedman says investors shouldn't read too much into the company's light forecast.""They do have a pattern of starting conservative,"" he said.Pierre Nanterme, Accenture's chief executive, was upbeat about the company's performance and prospects during the company's conference call with analysts early Wednesday. ""Our performance for the fiscal year, especially ... in the fourth quarter and the second half of the year demonstrates that we are executing the right growth strategy,"" he said. ""We are providing relevant and highly differentiated services that are clearly resonating with the needs of our clients, and we are gaining market share even in an environment that continues to be very demanding and highly competitive.""In the quarter, Accenture's consulting revenue grew 6% to $4 billion, while outsourcing revenue climbed 15% to $3.8 billion.Accenture's new bookings for its consulting business were $3.9 billion, 47% of total bookings, while outsourcing accounted for $4.4 billion, or 53%.Revenue from the company's communications, media and technology operating group jumped 14% to $1.58 billion.Financial services climbed 10% to $1.67 billion. The health and public service business also grew 10%, to $1.29 billion. The firm's products unit rose 14% to $1.93 billion.Growth in Accenture's resource group was flat at $1.29 billion.On the regional front, Accenture's Q4 revenue from the Americas increased 9% to $3.77 billion, while the $3 billion in Europe, the Middle East and Africa marked a 14% jump.Revenue from the Asia-Pacific region grew 3% to $982 million.One key to Accenture's growth resurgence is the company's offering of more fast-growing tech services such as mobile applications, data analytics software and interactive applications, Friedman says.""Accenture is the first large service company that is actually pivoting to the next generation of computing,"" he said. ""Accenture sells a lot of different stuff than they did two years ago, and that new stuff has a much better budget trajectory; that is why the growth is back.""

554,ACN,"Francisco D'Souza is used to surfing the big waves of change.He was born in Nairobi, Kenya; grew up in 10 other countries, including Panama and Congo; and had to learn languages just to survive in school.During the boom of the late 1990s, he helped launch the tech service firm Cognizant (CTSH), was its North American director through the tech crash of the early 2000s and became CEO in January 2007.Despite the recession that started late that year, D'Souza has overseen revenue growth from $1.4 billion to 2012's $7.4 billion while providing everything from software system integration to high-tech strategic consulting.Arvind Ramnani of BNP Paribas predicts that Cognizant's revenue will bulge to $8.9 billion in 2013 and $10.3 billion in 2014.Meanwhile, Cognizant's stock has rocketed 525% since late 2008.""I think the key to success in the business world today is to learn how to adapt rapidly,"" D'Souza, 45, told IBD.D'Souza is the son of an Indian diplomat, which meant the family moved to a different country every few years. His parents put their children in native schools instead of the international ones, favored by many foreigners, that minimized contact with the locals.Worldly""We learned to thrive in a flat world long before the term became in vogue,"" said D'Souza. ""My multicultural experience had a decisive impact on the way we consciously built Cognizant to serve a global marketplace.""His father bought him a computer when he was 13.Frank taught himself programming and in three years developed software to manage the inventory of a division of the Trinidad army.At 18 he worked as a teller in an international bank in Hong Kong during the day and went to the University of East Asia in Macau at night. The bank was using a punch-card system that was no longer supported by the vendor, so he helped implement a software program.A year later he worked with a small startup to invent a mass fax machine that could send out advertising for products and daily stock quotes, in the process learning the basics of entrepreneurship.After earning a bachelor's degree in business in 1991, D'Souza entered the MBA program at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University. He had to take a job on campus to pay the bills, so he pulled all-nighters before tests and took power naps between classes.He dreamed of starting a tech company, but had no green card to let him stay in America as an entrepreneur. After graduation in 1992, he joined credit information provider Dun & Bradstreet (DNB) and went to Germany. The next year, he heard D&B wanted to focus on emerging markets, so he volunteered to help create a software service arm in Chennai, India.Originally called DBSS and servicing D&B's in-house needs, the unit was spun off as Cognizant in 1996 and the next year moved to Teaneck, N.J. It went public in 1998.Meanwhile, D'Souza got his green card, and from 1997 to 2003 he directed North American operations and business development, getting through the dot-com bust by doing information technology projects that bigger firms ignored.""One day, I might be out selling to prospective clients; the next, I could be figuring out how to process our payroll,"" he said.D'Souza's lesson is that marketing experience can be a great plus to help reach your career goals, no matter what they are. He served as chief operating officer from December 2003 to December 2006 before becoming CEO at 38.Cognizant rolled onto Fortune's ""100 Fastest-Growing Companies"" list from 2003 to 2012 and became one of the Fortune 500 in 2011.While it has big-name allies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and SAS, Cognizant faces competition from giants such as IBM (IBM), Accenture (ACN) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ).Cognizant does general business and management consulting, which can range from business process re-engineering to mergers-and-acquisitions program management. Its sweet spot is to address points where technology and operations intersect, such as integrating complex systems and implementing new applications.Cognizant operates in over 40 countries, but D'Souza cautions that keeping costs low for clients should not be the sole value when it comes to outsourcing.""Clients today need to address a dual mandate — driving costs down in their core business, while simultaneously innovating and transforming their business by leveraging the new SMAC stack,"" D'Souza said, referring to social mobility, data analytics and cloud service. ""With structural shifts in economy, business and technology, enterprises are forced to re-examine how they operate, moving from merely incremental levels of performance efficiency to building new digital business capabilities. In this context, not only do they need to run better; they need to run different.""GrowthCognizant has convinced so many C-level executives that it can do a superior job at reasonable prices while driving their innovation agenda that its client list has grown from 400 to 1,100 under D'Souza.His firm currently has more than 166,000 employees globally.""It has also doubled revenue per client over the past five years,"" wrote Ramnani. ""The trend is reflective of the value that Cognizant provides to its clients in an environment where they were consolidating their vendor relationships.""Cognizant's inroads into some industries are nothing short of stunning. Its customers include 27 of the top 30 global pharmaceutical companies, nine of the 10 leading biotechs, 12 of the biggest medical device makers, four of five online powerhouses, as well as six of the top 10 North American financial institutions and all top 10 in Europe.Part of the company's formula for gaining loyalty is deep experience with its Two-in-a-Box approach. One part of the team is a Cognizant business expert who has over 15 years' experience in that industry and works at the client's site. That specialist works with an IT specialist who has the same level of experience implementing projects.When the recession hit in late 2007, D'Souza decided to invest in growth. Meanwhile, rivals were cutting back.D'Souza told everyone at Cognizant to spend more time with customers and more effort in marketing to potential ones. Over the next few years, he traveled to meet many of them, showing that the company was committed top to bottom to making itself invaluable.Differentiating itself from tech outsourcing companies, Cognizant acquired consultancies and emphasized its long-term strategic advisory relationships.All For OneIn February 2012, D'Souza made a radical decision. The company was reorganized under three leaders to leave him free from day-to-day operational management to concentrate on future technology.With $3.36 billion in cash and short-term investments and no debt, Cognizant is placing its bet on balancing its core revenue sources with a gamble on potential ones.Headed by President Gordon Coburn and group CEOs Rajeev Mehta and Chandrasekaran Ramakrishnan, Cognizant's services are divided into three horizons:• 1. The cash cow of application development, maintenance and testing, enterprise resource planning, data warehousing and business intelligence.• 2.

555,ACN,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) is transitioning more into services — and its services unit is in its own transition, adding its first consulting initiatives.
"
556,ACN,"The No. 1 maker of networking gear continues to scramble to boost revenue from areas outside its core network routers and switches, where sales have been slowing.
"
557,ACN,"As part of these efforts, Cisco is launching consulting initiatives within its services business, focusing on areas such as security and cloud computing. Services accounts for more than 20% of Cisco's revenue, but the unit's growth has slowed the past year.
"
558,ACN,"In consulting, Cisco is targeting fast-growing areas such as data analytics, software-defined networking (SDN) and the ""Internet of Things"" trend of many types of machines connected to the Internet.
"
559,ACN,"IBD recently discussed Cisco's services strategy with Edzard Overbeek, Cisco senior vice president.
"
560,ACN,"IBD: Is Cisco's service business synonymous with systems integration?
"
561,ACN,"Overbeek: It's different. We are introducing smart services. We build analytics to help run optimized and configured networks. About 10 years ago, we started to get more requests from customers to help design their networks. We built an advanced services group that's aligned with our data center architectures, networking equipment, etc.
"
562,ACN,"IBD: How is the company expanding the service business ?
"
563,ACN,"Overbeek: We are extending into areas (such as) application centric infrastructure, which is a new way for us to address SDN and basically help our customers solve their challenges around cloud, mobility, security and social (media).
"
564,ACN,"IBD: What are the target areas for the new consulting services?
"
565,ACN,"Overbeek: Our security service is one, which helps companies become even more secure using our technology, solutions, methods and processes. The security agenda is a big concern (of customers). In our cloud services, in some cases, we manage the networks for our customers. In our industry solutions unit, we are building industry templates that help customers in retail .
"
566,ACN,"IBD: Why emphasize consulting?
"
567,ACN,"Overbeek: Customers have questions about these new business opportunities. (With consulting) we can sit in front of them and help them define those from the problem statement to building solutions. That will help them become more agile, save costs and increase productivity.
"
568,ACN,"IBD: Why launch these now?
"
569,ACN,"Overbeek: The biggest transition is ahead of us (with things like) lighting systems, air conditioning systems, traffic management systems, smart grids — all of these networks are starting to open up and basically create a huge connection of potentially billions of devices that now will be moving toward a network fabric, and we believe we are at the core of that transition. If you want to build that, you need to offer different solutions and different insights in consulting.
"
570,ACN,"IBD: How critical is the service business to Cisco?
"
571,ACN,"Overbeek: It's always been very critical. And it will shift toward even more critical going forward.
"
572,ACN,"IBD: How does Cisco compete with other service providers such as Accenture (ACN) and IBM (IBM)?
"
573,ACN,"Overbeek: Of course we have a lot of competitors, but the services we are building are really around our networking and compute fabric. Accenture and IBM are big partners of our services into their customer base. ... We need partners to really get reach and depth and breadth in our solutions portfolio. We then build our full capability around services to address cloud, Big Data and analytics, social and security. We have a huge market position ahead of us.
"
574,ACN,"IBD: Cisco's service revenue growth rate has slipped steadily the past five quarters. Why?
"
575,ACN,"Overbeek: We have a slower product and technology sales cycle now. That has an implication on the services business.

598,ACN,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH  -  Free Report) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.4%.With long-term earnings per share growth rate of 12.6% and a market cap of $46.8 billion, it seems to be a stock that should maintain a place in investors’ portfolio.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors that are impacting the company’s performance.Significant exposure to the fast-growing verticals like financial services and healthcare has boosted Cognizant’s growth. The company is consistently developing its capabilities for the integration of the new digital framework with legacy technology platforms.Additionally, transactions such as the TriZetto buyout and more recently, the acquisitions of Bolder Healthcare and Mirabeau are likely to benefit the company. Apart from gaining new customers from these buyouts, the company expanded its capabilities in the healthcare industry and improved overall digital delivery abilities.Cognizant is expected to continue benefiting from solid demand for high quality, lower cost technology services. Based on its global delivery model and capacity expansion in low cost areas in India, China, Philippines and Latin America, the company remains well-positioned in the outsourcing market.Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Revenue (TTM) Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation QuoteHowever, the company faces significant geographic concentration risks, with North America’s significant contribution to its revenues. Cognizant also earns nearly 40% of its revenues from the financial services industry. Therefore, any slowdown in the region’s economic environment or consolidation in the financial services industry is anticipated to have a negative impact on the company.Cognizant too faces stiff competition from the likes of Infosys Technologies (INFY  -  Free Report), Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report), Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro among others, which is an added concern.Furthermore, the company relates to the nature of its business, which necessitates bringing employees into the United States for on-site application maintenance work. With continuous pressure to avoid outsourcing and employment of foreign nationals, the U.S. government under President Donald Trump is mulling to reduce the number of H1-B visas granted each year. This, in turn, might negatively impact Cognizant’s performance.Nevertheless, the company’s foray into growth-oriented markets, strong domain expertise and ability to keep up with ongoing digital transformation justify the retention of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock in investors’ portfolio.Key PickA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The long-term earnings growth rate for NVIDIA is projected to be 10.3%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

599,ACN,"Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) recently announced partnership with The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report). The announcement was made at Cisco’s Advanced Imaging Society conference, XR On the Bay.

The collaboration is also aimed at delivering effective ways to convey production assets and data from the studio set to the cloud.""This partnership is a game changer for the media industry, and we are excited for the opportunity to work closely with The Walt Disney Studios team to prototype, develop and showcase new technology at StudioLAB. This will be the place where true innovation comes alive in media entertainment,"" said David Ward, senior vice president, CTO and chief architect, Cisco.We believe this is a big customer win and Cisco will benefit a great deal from the collaboration by stepping up its game in media and entertainment industry.To ConcludeIn early March this year, Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) had announced that The Walt Disney Studios selected the company for SLAB initiative. Given that Cisco services were preferred in its stead is a positive for the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCisco carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Micron Technology Inc.

600,ACN,"The trade war is officially on with new Trump tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports going into effect last week. China has retaliated in a like manner, imposing tariffs on $34 billion worth of American goods. Both are at 25%. That’s a lot of extra cost that consumers will have to bear.The only thing worse is if everything threatened is actually charged, because of the implications for trade that are honestly hard to guess at right now.Sino-U.S. relations remain as sour as ever in the meantime, as struggling Chinese telecom ZTE continues to be denied U.S. parts because it dared to engage in trade with North Korea and Iran, the two countries the U.S. wishes to pressure. This despite the fact that it recently changed its leadership to comply with U.S. conditions to lift the ban. ZTE is also required to pay a $1 billion fine, place $400 million in escrow and allow outside monitoring if it wants the Commerce Department to allow some companies to do business with it.Of course, China’s MOFCOM hasn’t approved Qualcomm’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) NXP purchase, but this may not be an existential crisis for Qualcomm.The U.S. is also opposing Chinese attempts to invest in U.S. companies or in startups engaged in developing “key” technologies. The government is looking to further empower the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to block this kind of deal. So Chinese firms are looking elsewhere.Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), one of the leading deal makers of China has been busy. Read on to know more:Focus on Non-U.S. MarketsWith the Trump administration going anti-China, Alibaba was involved in just one major U.S. investment this year: leading a $26.4 million funding round in a data-analysis startup called SQream Technologies. This is a far cry from the significant investments in social media company Snap, ride-sharing company Lyft, VR startup Magic Leap and online sports merchandise retailer Fanatics in the recent past.Alibaba is instead continuing investments in other emerging areas, notably Asia and the Middle east-North Africa (MENA) region.This month, the company announced the EMEA Ecosystem Partner Program to strengthen collaboration between its cloud customers and partners in the region. Its bigger partners include Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report), Hashicorp, Ecritel, Altran and Micropole. The program is also available to startups via Station F, one of the largest startup campuses that has incorporated the program into its exclusive perks for startups.The focus on international markets also got it interested in popular Turkish online fashion retailer Trendyol. The two companies will work together to help Trendyol expand in Turkey and its neighboring countries. The timing and amount of investment is unknown. This follows a $600 million plan to set up a smart city concept near Dubai’s free port Jebel Ali to house 3,000 firms developing robotics, artificial intelligence and new mobile apps.Adopts Blockchain TechnologyAlibaba founder and CEO Jack Ma has talked down bitcoin technology while embracing the blockchain authentication system that backs it. The company has a big remittance business through its Ant Financial affiliate and has expressed its intention to use some of the $14 billion raised in its IPO to build the technology and solutions based on it.Blockchain is expected to bring down the cost of transferring money while speeding up transactions and making them more secure, which is probably why Ant Financial is already deploying it in a solution targeting Hong Kong’s large Pilipino working population that regularly sends money back home (that remittance was $33 billion in 2017 and 10.2% of the Philipplines’ GDP in 2016, according to the World Bank).Hong Kong is a great place to start with a number of companies already adopting the technology successfully. Singapore-based startup Toast for example, says it can transfer money in about 2 minutes. Another startup called EMO says it can transfer money in about 10. China’s Tencent has also introduced a service targeting the same remittances market through its Wechat platform.  Alibaba recently strengthened its position in Ant by acquiring a 33% stake in exchange of the then existing profit sharing arrangement (the company made a loss in the last reported period).Alicloud Surpasses IBMAccording to Synergy Research Group, Alibaba’s Aliyun moved ahead of IBM in the first quarter of 2018 to become the fourth largest provider of cloud services in the world. The company’s growth was initially driven by its strong position in the domestic market, but it has built on this position to become the second largest provider in the Asia Pacific region.Today, it is expanding the world over with some of its more illustrious customers being InterContinental Hotels Group, KPMG, Nestle, Philips, SAP, Schneider Electric and Conversant. The company generated revenue of over $2 billion in its last fiscal year. It trails Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), all of which are growing just about as fast.AI-Powered Fashion RetailWith its artificial intelligence-powered fashion retail solution, Alibaba has attempted to do the seemingly impossible: match the fashion trends to your own preferences to suggest trendy items that may satisfy you.The system’s personalized recommendations come from its ability to read and analyze data generated by Alibaba's ecosystem, images of more than 500,000 outfits from Taobao stylists and fashion expertise from Tmall partner brands. For the more fashion-conscious, it also offers cross-brand recommendations.  A concept store embodying the technology will open on the Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus from July 4-7.Investment in China Media GroupAs the government gradually loosens its grip over firms by adopting a mixed-ownership policy change, Chinese technology giants Alibaba and Tencent are making the most of the situation. So after snapping up stakes in leading Chinese telecom company China Unicom, the two have now turned attention to media company CMC.  With a stake in the owner of English Premier League team Manchester City and a joint venture with Hollywood studio Warner Brothers Entertainment, China’s CMC is a media company with a media giant in its own right.The A-round fundraising brought in 10 billion yuan ($1.49 billion) for the company.Cozying Up with French ConglomerateThe French conglomerate Bollore Group has signed a global partnership agreement with Alibaba covering cloud computing services, clean energy, logistics and other areas including new digital technologies and innovation. Bollore controls a large logistics operation in French colonies in Africa, which could be one of the reasons it is interested in a relationship. Besides, it also controls a 20% stake in French media giant Vivendi. RecommendationsAlibaba shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

603,ACN,"We still have a few more weeks to go before the big banks start reporting June-quarter results. But the Q2 reporting cycle has (officially) gotten underway, with results from 9 S&P 500 members already out. All of these early earnings releases are from companies that have fiscal quarters ending in May, but these get counted as part of the June-quarter tally.We have another 11 index members with fiscal quarters ending in May on deck to report results this week. All in all, we will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members by the time JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) (unofficially) kick-off this earnings season on July 13th.The notable earnings reports coming out this week include:Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) reports on Tuesday (6/26) before the market’s open, with the homebuilder expected to earn $0.45 per share in earnings on $5.23 billion in revenues, which compares to $0.91 per share on $3.26 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. The stock was up big following the last earnings release, but overall it has been a tough period for Lennar shares as well as the broader homebuilder space.Lennar shares are currently trading close to 52-week lows and are now down -18.8% since the start of the year, underperforming the Zacks Construction sector’s -8.1% year-to-date decline vs. the S&P 500 index’s +4% gain. KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), which is scheduled to report results Thursday morning (06/28) is down even more than Lennar (down -19.9% YTD).    General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) reports on Wednesday (6/27) morning, with the company expected to earn $0.75 per share on $3.91 billion in revenues, which compares to $0.73 per share on $3.81 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. Estimates have come down a bit in recent days and the stock has lost ground following each of the last two earnings reports. The stock was down big in the run up to and the day of the last earning release on March 21st and has essentially remained flat since then. General Mills shares are currently down -22.3% since the start of the year, underperforming the struggling Consumer Staples sector’s -10.3% year-to-date decline.Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) reports after the market’s close on Thursday (6/28), with the company expected to earn $0.64 in EPS on $9.39 billion in revenues, which compares to $0.60 EPS on $8.68 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. The stock was down following each of the last three earning releases, but has been an impressive performer this year, outperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector as well as the broader market. Nike shares are currently trading close to their 52-high and are up +18.6% vs. the Consumer Discretionary sector’s +4.7% year-to-date period.Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) will report before the market’s open on Thursday (6/28), with the company expected to earn $1.71 per share in earnings on $10.02 billion in revenues, up +12.5% and +13% from the year-earlier period, respectively. Accenture has been spotlighting its opportunity in the digital, cloud and security areas in recent quarters and revenues from those areas should show strong momentum in this release as well. Management’s commentary about technology spending trends typically has read through for IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report). The stock was down big following the last quarterly release on March 22nd, but has recovered since then and is currently up +4.9% in the year-to-date period.The chart below of weekly reporting calendar for the S&P 500 index clearly shows that we still have another three weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season really takes off.Expectations for Q2Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +18.5% from the same period last year on +7.9% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors. This would follow +24.6% earnings growth in 2018 Q1 on +8.6%, the highest growth in almost 7 years.The chart below plots the evolution of Q2 earnings growth expectations. As you can see, the growth rate has ticked up a bit, partly reflecting results from the 9 S&P 500 members that have reported results already. But even after accounting for the results that have come out, Q2 estimates revisions are nowhere near the impressive positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season.A big part of the positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season reflected the direct impact of the tax law changes, which was obviously a one-off development. Had all positive revisions been a result of tax law changes, we would have seen only EPS estimates go up, with no changes to revenue estimates. But that wasn’t the case, as revenue estimates had gone up as well, which raised our hopes that the aggregate revisions trend had finally turned positive after many years being in the other direction.But as the chart above shows, we didn’t see much in positive revisions. In other words, while the overall growth picture remains very strong – there is no other way to describe +18.5% quarterly earnings growth - there is not much improvement in expectations for Q2 and beyond. The recent strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar and questions about global growth will likely serve as incremental negatives for folks like us monitoring the aggregate revisions trend.This flattish aggregate revisions trend notwithstanding, June quarter estimates have actually modestly ticked down for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors and gone up for 7 sectors. The sectors enjoying positive revisions in the aggregate include Technology, Energy, Medical, Industrial Products, Basic Materials, Business Services, and Retail. Estimates have gone up the most for the Energy sector, reflecting momentum in oil prices. Excluding the gains made in the Energy sector, the aggregate revisions picture for the S&P 500 index would be in negative territory.The table below shows the summary picture for Q2, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q1.The Earnings Growth PeakThe chart below compares current Q2 earnings growth expectations with what was actually achieved in the preceding 5 quarters and what is expected in the following 3 quarters.Please note that while the Q2 growth pace represents a deceleration from the preceding quarter’s impressive level, the overall level of total earnings is in record territory, as the chart below shows.The two charts above provide different answers to the ‘peak earnings’ question. The first chart shows that the growth rate likely peaked in 2018 Q1, while dollar earnings aren’t expected to ‘peak’ till the last quarter of 2018. Even with respect to the growth rate, it is very much possible that final growth rates for Q2 and Q3 may surpass what we saw in Q1.We should keep in mind that this earnings cycle got underway back in 2009 when the U.S. economy got out of its last recession. By this time, earnings growth should have come down to the historical ‘normalized’ pace in the mid-single digits level. The reason we have these impressive growth numbers and positive revisions trend is thanks mostly to the effect of the tax cuts, which will start wearing off towards the end of 2019.In other words, earnings likely haven’t peaked yet. But with this cycle so long in tooth, we are steadily moving towards that stage.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

604,ACN,"Avis Budget Group, Inc. (CAR  -  Free Report), through its Avis brand, boosted its long-term marketing association with Universal Parks and Resorts with the opening of vehicle rental services at five Loews Hotels of Universal Orlando Resort. This extended partnership was announced yesterday.The five Loews Hotels to be provided with Avis’ high-quality vehicle rental services are Loews Portofino Bay Hotel, Loews Royal Pacific Resort, the Hard Rock Hotel Orlando, Loews Sapphire Falls Resort and Universal’s Cabana Bay Beach Resort. Additionally, an Avis counter is scheduled to be opened at Universal’s Aventura Hotel, this summer.Universal Parks and Resorts, also known as Universal Studios Theme Parks or Universal Theme Parks, is the theme park subsidiary of NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report). The Universal Orlando Resort, commonly known as Universal Orlando, is a subsidiary of Universal Parks and Resorts.Avis Budget and Universal Parks and Resorts’ alliance goes back a long way. On availing Avis’ vehicle rental services, guests of Universal Parks and  Resorts are offered special packages coupled with attractive discounts. Additional benefits are provided through Avis customer channels, which include services from-and-to airport locations of Orlando and Hollywood. Advertisements of Avis vehicles also appear on the online booking portal of Universal Parks & Resorts. Bottom LineThe Avis brand accounts for almost 58% of Avis Budget’s total revenues and is one of the world’s leading providers of vehicle rental services. In 2017, the brand reported $5.2 billion in revenues from company-operated Avis locations, globally. Based on the type of customers, it earned 49% of revenues from the commercial customers, with the remaining derived from the leisure segments of the travel industry. Market-wise, it generated around 70% of revenues from on-airport locations and 30% from off-airport locations.While Avis Budget already enjoys a dominant position in the airport car rental business, the launch of these onsite hotel rental locations in Orlando should help the company increase its off-airport presence. Stephen Wright, senior vice president, global travel, partnerships and associations at Avis Budget stated, “Universal’s theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood are popular attractions in the United States visited by travelers the world over.”Considering the brand’s overall robust growth, Avis Budget is focused on further strengthening its Avis brand with continuous investments in technology and enhancement of customer services with different applications. Further, the company is highly optimistic about its Avis brand benefiting from the opportunities in mobility solutions and vehicle-related technologies. Meanwhile, the comeback of Avis brand in Japan, after a gap of 14 years, is a major positive, which should help the company expand globally and boost its top line.Zacks Rank & Price PerformanceCurrently, Avis Budget is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. A glimpse of the company’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse in the last year.

605,ACN,"Shares of ABM Industries Inc. (ABM  -  Free Report) have lost 33% against the industry’s growth of 17.4% in a year. Moreover, the facility management provider’s shares tumbled to a 52-week low of $28.54 during the trading session on May 29. The figure recovered marginally to close at $28.82, down 1.3%.Reasons Behind the PlungeABM Industries operates in a highly competitive industry where the barriers to entry are very low. This makes it difficult for the company to maintain strong and long-term relationships with clients. In order to win new clients and retain the existing ones, the company has to remain technologically updated to meet varying and rapidly changing client demands.This increases operating expenses of the company, thereby reducing margins. In 2017, operating expenses rose 14% to $1.34 billion. As of Jan 31, 2018, the figure was up 19.6% to 1.43 billion. Rising operating costs are a major headwind for the company’s growth.The company’s business outside the United States, especially in the United Kingdom, remains susceptible to the outcome of Brexit. With the exit of U.K. from the European Union (EU), the European economy has become highly unpredictable with disruptions and restrictions in acquisitions and trade with other European Union members. Such activities weigh on company’s revenues and margins.ABM Industries has a highly leveraged balance sheet. Notably, its long-term debt rose from $268.3 million in 2016 to $1.16 billion at the end of 2017. The company had $62.8 million of cash and cash equivalents in 2017. As of Jan 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $68.6 million while long-term debt was $1.17 billion. This implies that ABM Industries is currently unable to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report), NV5 Global (NVEE  -  Free Report) and Bureau Veritas S. A. (BVRDF  -  Free Report). All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).   The long-term expected earnings per share growth rates for Accenture, NV5 Global and Bureau Veritas are 10%, 20% and 8%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

610,ACN,"Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) yesterday opened an innovation hub in Metro Detroit to assist companies in the automotive, industrial equipment, technology, energy and utilities industries in preparing for a digitalized economy.The innovation hub — equipped with Accenture’s Industry X.0 Innovation Center —  is expected to help clients improve product development, engineering, manufacturing and field operations. The hub will allow practical experiments including invention, co-creation and evaluation of digital solutions to help clients better understand applications.Julie Sweet, chief executive officer at Accenture North America, stated, “Continuous innovation is an imperative to succeed in today’s digital economy.” She added, “In metro Detroit we are bringing innovation to our clients’ doorsteps to help them achieve tangible, ground-breaking results faster than ever.

612,ACN,"TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) announced yesterday that it has partnered with the University of Illinois at Chicago's (UIC) College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to aid the study of data science. The broader goal is to help address the increasing need for data science expertise.The partnership aims at creating a position for the TransUnion Professor of Data Science, for which a nation-wide search will be done. The professor will join as a senior faculty member in the Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science department, and work with a large group of researchers of data science across the campus.TransUnion president and CEO informed, “We’re looking forward to fostering a program with UIC, and bringing more students into this course of study—ultimately leading to greater innovation and technology breakthroughs that we can only imagine today.”We observe that TransUnion stock has rallied 58.6% over the past year, significantly outperforming the 25.2% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.The Bigger PictureWhile LinkedIn’s 2017 Emerging Jobs Report lists the data science industry as the second-fastest growing industry, McKinsey projects a shortage of 140,000-190,000 deep analytic talent positions, and 1.5 million analysts and analytics managers in 2018 in the United States alone.This is naturally a matter of concern for TransUnion, which is a leading provider of data and analytics solutions. It appears, by trying to add more students to the field of data science, the company is paving way for future recruitments from UIC.For UIC, the partnership will strengthen its capacity of developing undergraduate and graduate curriculums, professional education opportunities and inter-disciplinary research groups.Other Stocks to ConsiderTransUnion currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report), NV5 Global (NVEE  -  Free Report) and Convergys Corp.

613,ACN,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we focus on Stericycle, Inc. (SRCL  -  Free Report), a stock with an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.6%. Its earnings are expected to register 6.7% and 3.4% growth, respectively, in 2018 and 2019.The company has outperformed its industry in the past three months. The stock has soared 2.1% against the industry’s gain of 1.1%. We believe the stock has the potential to continue the bull run. The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s strategic acquisitions, organic growth coupled with similar prudent business moves.Let’s discuss them in detail.Strategic Acquisitions Stericycle continues to grow on the back of acquisitions in both domestic and international markets. In 2017 and 2016, Stericycle completed 30 and 31 acquisitions, respectively.  Further, acquisitions contributed 570.1 million to 2016 revenues and $32.2 million to 2017 revenues. For first-quarter 2018, the contribution from buyouts was $7.1 million.Stericycle is highly optimistic about “tuck-in” acquisition opportunities, which are expected to create value for shareholders and widen its services suite. In first-quarter 2018, Stericycle closed nine tuck-in acquisitions (all in the domestic market, with eight in Secure Information Destruction and one in Regulated Medical Waste). The deals together contributed about $0.7 million to corporate revenues, with estimated annualized revenues of $8.5 million.The acquisition pool of the company remains robust in multiple geographies and lines of business. The global acquisition strategy increases Stericycle’s customer base by providing a long-term growth platform for selling multiple services. The company is continuously on the lookout for strategic acquisitions that will grow its market share and expand its geographic base.Organic GrowthWe appreciate Stericycle’s continuous focus on its internal development initiatives. To better meet customer demands, the company has been improving its solution offerings and platforms. This has helped Stericycle built a strong and loyal customer base along with a revenue retention rate of nearly 90%. With the help of these strong client relationships, Stericycle is trying to grow by selling additional services to the existing ones, while securing new customers. In 2017 and 2016,organic growth contributed $20.1 million and $94.6 million to total revenues, respectively.Other Strategic Business MovesBy providing business-to-business services in highly regulated areas, Stericycle intends to help customers and businesses comply with tough regulatory policies. It mainly targets smaller businesses with high demand for regulatory assistance compared to larger businesses due to the lack of specialized staff.  To this end, Stericycle is offering services, depending on the varying customer needs. We believe this business strategy will help the company earn profits as well as expand into additional service offerings like hazardous or pharmaceutical waste management, communication services and secure information destruction.Moreover, government regulatory bodies require proper and immediate implementation of rules and regulations, trying to protect the overall health environment. This is a major positive for Stericycle, which is focused on providing regulated business-to-business services.Bottom LineThe aforementioned factors positively impacted Stericycle’s performance in the last reported quarter. In fact, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 0.8%. We believe the upbeat performance will continue in the quarters ahead, thus giving investors enough reasons to remain optimistic on the stock.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Stericycle has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company’s international presence provides it the opportunity to work with world’s leading professionals on multiple issues.

The majority of the company’s clients are multinational firms facing complicated issues.We also believe CRA International’s international operations help expand its geographic footprint and contribute to top-line growth. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, the company earned 20%, 22% and 20% of its total revenues, respectively, from its international business.Diversified BusinessCRA International has a diversified business with service offerings across areas of functional expertise, client base and geographical regions.

Further, the company gets to know about business strategies adopted across the world. This multidisciplinary set up enables the company bring experts from all fields under one platform. The diversification in business helps reduce CRA International’s dependence on any specific market, industry or geographic area. It also increases the company’s ability to adapt to any changing conditions.Well-Equipped Professional TeamCRA International is well-known for its global consulting services focused on areas of economic, financial and management consulting. We believe itsexcellent professional team has helped it maintain its solid reputationfor its high-quality consulting services. Almost three fourths of the company’s senior consultants are highly educated, having doctorate or other advanced degrees and are recognized experts in their respective fields. As of Dec 30, 2017, its team comprised 631 consultants, including 476 senior staff and 155 junior staff.Additionally, the company works with a select group of non-employee experts belonging to top educational institutes to better serve clients. These experts also generate business for the company and provide access to other leading academic and industry experts. The key areas of focus for the company are generating balanced and profitable growth across the organization through optimum organic and inorganic means, strengthening client relationships within two lines of business and simplifying internal processes. These activities augur well for the long-term growth of the company.Shareholder-Friendly MovesWe are impressed with CRA International’s consistent record of returning value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. In fiscal 2017, CRA International returned $24.6 million to its shareholders, which included $5.1 million of dividend payments and $19.5 million of share repurchases. In fiscal 2016, the company returned $20.3 million to its shareholders, inclusive of $1.2 million of dividend payments and $19.1 million through share buybacks.During first-quarter 2018, CRA International returned $9.8 million to its shareholders, which includes $1.5 million of dividend payments and $8.3 million through share repurchases. Additionally, on Apr 26, 2018, the company’s board of directors announced a quarterly cash dividend of 17 cents per share, payable on Jun 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 29, 2018.Such moves indicate the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.Bottom LineThe aforementioned factors positively impacted CRA International’s performance in the last reported quarter. In fact, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 36.2%.

615,ACN,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein its top and bottom lines came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also marked robust year-over-year improvements. The robust quarterly results were mainly driven by the merger of the Computer Sciences Corporation and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report).Notably, in 2016, Hewlett Packard Enterprise entered into a spin-off-merger agreement with Computer Sciences Corporation, wherein it agreed to spin-off its Enterprise Services division and merge the same with the latter’s businesses.

The company continues to witness shift in traditional application services to enterprise and cloud applications.Global Infrastructure Services (GIS) revenues during the fiscal fourth quarter came in at $3.22 billion, marking 3.3% year-over-year growth on a pro forma combined company basis. The year-over-year improvement was mainly driven by growth in the company’s “cloud and platform services as well as mobility and workplace.”USPS revenues came in at $710 million during the quarter, up 11.1% year over year on a pro forma combined company basis. Notably, this was the last quarter when the company reported USPS results as its operating segment. As the spin-off of USPS will close on June 1, this year, the company will not include this segment under its operating results anymore.The company’s adjusted operating income from continuing operations, on a pro forma combined company basis, amounted to $1.03 billion. Adjusted operating margin came in at 16.2% as compared with 10.2% reported in the prior-year quarter, on a pro forma combined company basis. The robust improvement was mainly driven by the achievement of approximately $1.1 billion of cost synergies from CSC and HPE’s Enterprise Services division merger during fiscal 2018.Adjusted net income from continuing operations came in at $661 million during the quarter as compared with $387 million reported in the year-earlier period on a pro forma combined company basis.The company exited the reported quarter with $2.648 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared with $2.926 billion recorded in the previous quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $8.97.During the fiscal, the company projects incremental cost savings of $400 million.Bottom LinePost merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. This alliance has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom.Following the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology might be seen making strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio, which is likely to drive growth over the long run. Notably, since its formation, the company has announced six acquisitions — Tribridge, Logicalis SMC, Racemi, M-Power, eBECS and Stable37.Currently, DXC Technology has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

616,ACN,"The chances of a trade war are unlikely to wane any time soon. There was a sign of relief for U.S. companies after Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Sunday that the U.S.-China trade conflict has been put on hold and a negotiation is in progress that would reduce the massive trade deficit United States has with China.But just when the markets thought that the risk has subsided, President Donald Trump reignited uncertainty, stating that the current framework makes it “too hard to get done.”“Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely, but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion”, he tweeted early on Wednesday.Further, with a surprise announcement later in the day, the Trump administration launched a national security investigation into whether automobile imports are harming U.S. national security.The investigation, under Section 232, is the same tactic used by the Trump administration before it imposed global tariffs on steel and aluminum import earlier this year.Given the latest developments, tensions over trade policy are most likely to escalate again in the coming months.A Sector That’s Showing ResilienceThe business services sector is gaining strength because it is firmly tied to manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities that are currently benefiting from all-round strength in the economy. The sector added 54,000 jobs in April and 518,000 in the past 12 months, the highest among all sectors.Economic activity in the manufacturing sector expanded in April as the PMI measured by Institute of Supply Management (ISM) touched 57.3%. This shows strong growth in manufacturing for the 20th consecutive month, driven by continued increase in new orders, production activity and employment and inventories. Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 17 reported growth in April.Non-manufacturing clocked ninety-ninth month of growth in April as the NMI measured by ISM touched 56.81%. This expansion was driven by continued increase in business activity, new orders and employment. All 18 non-manufacturing industries reporting growth. Any reading above 50 indicates that the said sector is expanding.Although U.S. economic growth decelerated in the first quarter to an annualized pace of 2.3%, after averaging higher than 3% in the previous three quarters, the economy is likely to rebound in the coming quarters.Lower corporate and individual tax rates along with increased government spending are expected to push annual economic growth to the 3% target. The current 18-year low unemployment rate of 3.9% recorded in the month of April further raises optimism about the economy.Top Picks Given the promising developments in the service sector, buying sound stocks from the space should safeguard your portfolio amid trade war fears.We have selected four stocks that should make meaningful additions to your portfolio.

618,ACN,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 24, after the market closes. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this IT services company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Notably, DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation (“CSC”) and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was closed on Apr 1, 2017. So, this will be the fourth quarterly result of the combined business. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that DXC Technology is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it possesses the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.06%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.20, which indicates a massive 91.3% year-over-year jump. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged, over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $6.12 billion, up approximately 224% from the year-ago quarter.DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteSynergies from the merger of CSC and HPE’s Enterprise Services business will likely have contributed to the company’s top and bottom-line results. Apart from this, strategic partnerships and acquisitions are anticipated to have brought in additional revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. However, escalating interest expenses resulting from increased debt burden might have dampened the company’s profitability, offsetting the benefit of higher revenues to some extent.Let’s now discuss the aforementioned factors in detail.Merger Synergies — The Key Growth CatalystThe above-mentioned merger has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom. Post merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the combined entity will have generated revenues of  more than $24 billion in fiscal 2018. Also, DXC Technology is projected to generate cost synergies worth $1 billion during the first fiscal and record a run rate of $1.5 billion at the end of the same.Notably, the company registered more than 200% surge in revenues in all the preceding three quarters, mainly benefiting from the merger. The analysts covering the stock anticipate that the merger benefit will drive DXC Technology’s fiscal fourth-quarter top-line performance as well.Additional Revenues From AcquisitionsFollowing the footsteps of CSC, DXC Technology is also focusing on acquisitions to expedite growth. Since its formation, the company has announced six acquisitions — Tribridge, Logicalis SMC, Racemi, M-Power, eBECS and Stable37.Therefore, the buyout is likely to benefit the company’s soon-to-be-reported quarter results in the form of increased customer base and additional revenues.Partnerships Enhancing Customer BaseGoing ahead, the company’s continued focus on making strategic partnerships to expand its share in the cloud-computing market is likely to aid the fiscal fourth-quarter results. The company, in August 2017, collaborated with VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) and launched DXC Managed Cloud Services, supported by VMware's next-generation hybrid-cloud platform.It should be noted that the company has strategic partnerships with the likes of AT&T and HCL. It has also joined forces with Amazon to develop cloud-based solutions for enterprise and public-sector clients. In addition, it has entered into cloud-partnership agreement with IBM and SAP, as well. These alliances have increased its access to new technology, backed innovative product development and creation of new markets.Also, it has enabled clients to leverage the benefits of mobility, social networking and big data facilities. This, in turn, is likely to expand DXC Technology’s customer base and help garner additional revenues.Escalating Interest Costs to Impede ProfitabilityRising interest expenses due to increased debt burden might dampen the company’s profitability. As of Dec 31, 2017, DXC Technology has a total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $6.37 billion, while it had paid $231 million as interest expenses during the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, which was 166% higher than the previous fiscal-period tally.The company’s long-term outstanding debt significantly increased last fiscal. CSC, prior to the completion of its merger with HPE’s Enterprise Services business, had taken additional debt. This increased DXC Technology’s total long-term liability, thereby escalating its interest-cost burden. Any elevation in interest cost will have a negative impact on the company’s bottom-line results.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

619,ACN,"Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2018 results.

Also, quarterly earnings increased over twofold on a year-over-year basis.Quarter DetailsBroadridge’s fiscal second-quarter revenues of $1.013 billion increased 13.5% year over year. Moreover, it came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $954 million. Better-than-expected revenues “from an elevated level of event-driven activity” were a catalyst.Recurring fee revenues increased 5% during the quarter that included contribution from organic growth, Net New Business, internal growth and acquisition-related synergies. Event-driven fee revenues soared a whopping 227% to $97 million during the quarter, primarily due to higher proxy contest and mutual fund proxy activities. Distribution revenues during the quarter increased 7%, primarily due to favorable foreign-currency fluctuations.Revenues from the Investor Communication Solutions segment (78% of total revenues) increased 13.9% from the year-ago quarter to $802.2 million. The improvement was attributable to higher recurring revenues from net new business, closed sales, elevated event-driven fee revenues, internal growth and acquisitions.Global Technology and Operations segment (22% of total revenues) revenues came in at $228 million, reflecting an increase of 10.1% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by higher Net New Business from closed sales, internal growth and recent acquisition.Broadridge’s adjusted operating income margin expanded from 9.4% to 13.6%, primarily due to the higher recurring fee revenues and event-driven fee revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues contracted to 12.6% from 14.1% in the year-ago quarter. The company’s adjusted net income of $94.7 million or 79 cents was up from $46.8 million or 39 cents in the year-ago period.The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $366.5 million compared with $288.8 million in the previous quarter.

Free cash flow came in at $89.3 million in the period.Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. QuoteRevised Fiscal 2018 GuidanceBroadridge revised its 2018 outlook. The company now projects revenue growth in the range of 2-4% compared with the earlier guidance of 2-3%.

Adjusted operating income margin is still estimated to be approximately 16%.Bottom LineBroadridge reported stellar fiscal second-quarter results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Year-over-year comparisons on both the counts were favorable backed by higher recurring revenues, internal growth, contribution from Net New Business, increased distribution revenues and acquisition-related synergies.We remain optimistic about Broadridge’s strategic acquisitions and product launches. We also believe the company’s close association with Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) will be beneficial over the long run.However, competition from DST Systems Inc.  and pricing pressure remain headwinds.Broadridge carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another top-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Micron Technology, Inc.

623,ACN,"The excitement surrounding the blockchain technology comes with the astronomical surge in bitcoin price, which soared above $19,000 last month. The blockchain is a decentralized public ledger, which offers a secure, faster and cheaper medium of carrying out online transaction and transfer of information without the need of third-party verification.Now, investors could easily capitalize on this fast-growing technology with the two blockchain ETFs that go live today. Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF BLCN and Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF BLOK are designed to benefit from the booming blockchain technology. The duo is the first ETF targeting the fast-developing world of the blockchain-based technology (read: How to Invest in the Hottest Technologies With ETFs).Inside BLCNThis fund is passively managed and seeks to track the Reality Shares Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index, a smart-beta benchmark that measures the returns of global companies committing resources for developing, researching, supporting, innovating or utilizing blockchain technology for their proprietary use or for use by others. The index will utilize internal and external research, as well as their proprietary Blockchain Score ranking system.Per the filing, the index will hold 50 to 100 companies with the highest scores and are weighted based on their scores. Information technology is expected to be the top sector for the index, accounting for about 60% of assets, followed by financials (29%) and consumer discretionary (8%). Companies like Overstock (OSTK  -  Free Report), International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report), Nasdaq (NDAQ  -  Free Report) and Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) will find their entry into the fund’s portfolio (read: Blockchain ETFs: Profit from the Technology Behind Bitcoin).Inside BLOKThis is an actively managed ETF providing investors global exposure to a basket of the leading companies engaged in advancing the blockchain-based technology and other distributed ledger technologies. American firms will dominate about 70% of the portfolio while the rest will go to firms in China, Canada and Japan.Additionally, the top 10 holdings will likely comprise about 45% of the assets with some well-known companies like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), Overstock, IBM, Square (SQ  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report). This new fund has an expense ratio of 0.70%.How does it fit in today’s portfolio?These ETFs could be an intriguing choice for investors seeking to bet on the technology that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The digital currency was the hottest trade of 2017, having climbed more than 1300% and witnessed wild swings (read: 10 Hottest ETF Themes for 2018).The strong trend is expected to continue this year as bitcoin is now easily available to individuals and businesses with the launch of futures contracts on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE  -  Free Report) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) last month. Additionally, rising institutional investor interest and strong demand from Japan added to the frenzy.While there are some strong critics and fears of bubbles bursting in the digital currency, blockchain technology possesses extraordinary potential to grow in the years to come. This is especially true given the increased adoption of the technology by the largest banking institutions in Asia and the Middle East particularly in payments, as well as cybersecurity firms due to the rise of ransomware attacks.Investing in blockchain technology will likely generate returns as big as today's FAANG stocks. According to a report from Research and Markets, the global blockchain market is expected to witness a CAGR of 61.5% from $210.2 million in 2016 to $2,312.5 million by 2021. Per Gartner, Blockchain is estimated to have delivered $4 billion in business value-add or technology innovation in 2017, and are expected to reach $21 billion by 2020, $176 billion in 2025, and $3.1 trillion by 2030.ETF Competition & Bottom LineThough there aren’t any real competitors to these new products, ETFs offering exposure to the blockchain ecosystem via semiconductor companies that make chips required for bitcoin mining, might pose a threat. The most popular funds include iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) and VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report). Both are soaring on the blockchain craze and have AUM of $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively (read: 5 ETF Ways to Tap Hot Semiconductor Stocks).The new funds offer investors a pure play to the blockchain technology that backs cryptocurrencies and has the potential to change the world. The ETFs will no doubt get a first-mover advantage that could help in garnering immense investor interest.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

The company has established itself as a trusted partner for business enterprises who seek to transform the entire landscape of their operations including applications, cloud, business networks and platforms.

Rothco’s strategic planning and designing for impactful communications campaigns are expected to strengthen Accenture Interactive’s footprint in the United Kingdom and Ireland.Rothco’s  efforts to enhance the technological impact on creative procedure to optimize brand experience and its impressive clientele  including the likes of Tesco and Heineken are further positives.Another notable acquisition in this domain was that of Karmarama.  It  added luxury car manufacturer Maserati to its client base.These acquisitions have helped the company enhance its product offerings and penetrate into newer markets, thereby contributing to the company’s financials. Accenture stock has gained 38.1% last year, outperforming the 33.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.We believe the company’s strategy of enhancing Accenture’s Interactive capabilities bodes well for future growth, which  is backed by Gartner Inc.’s (IT  -  Free Report) data on digital marketing spending.According to U.S. IT research firm, companies have spent nearly 12% of revenues for marketing in 2016,  with web, digital commerce and digital advertising accounting for the majority of the spending.Considering the growing need for digital marketing, we anticipate Accenture’s investment in digital marketing capabilities to  aid long-term growth.

626,ACN,"The Waste Management industry mainly deals with all the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. It’s a multi-billion dollar industry and major services include waste collection, waste treatment and disposal, and remediation.The industry is highly dependent on industrial, commercial and construction business activities. Growth in these sectors results in higher waste production, thereby increasing demand for industry services. The waste management industry is thus firmly tied to the health of the broader economy, which is currently quite favorable.A rise in GDP, an improving employment scenario, easing of the U.S. dollar and momentum in oil prices are all signs of improvement of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities are currently benefiting from all-round strength in the economy. The Trump administration’s business-friendly policies, including tax cuts and the repeal of regulations, are additional tailwinds.Furthermore, increasing demand for renewable energy and solid waste recycling has opened up revenue generation opportunities for this industry.Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Waste Removal Services stock — Waste Management, Inc. (WM  -  Free Report) and Stericycle, Inc. (SRCL  -  Free Report).

Moreover, the long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 12.1% for Waste Management is higher than Stericycle’s growth rate of 9.6%.Thus, Waste Management has an edge over Stericyle in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth.Earnings Estimate Revisions The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Based on full-year earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days, Stericycle is better placed. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings increased 1.1% for Stericycle against a decrease of 0.5% for Waste Management.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock’s performance in the previous quarters.Waste Management has performed better than Stericycle, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, resulting in an average beat of 3.6%. Stericycle has delivered positive surprises in two of the prior four quarters with an average beat of 0.8%.Valuation We have tried to evaluate Waste Management and Stericycle in terms of price to earnings Ratio (P/E). This metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Waste Management and Stericycle is 23.9 and 14.2, respectively, while that of the industry is 26.1. Stericycle has an edge with a lower P/E ratio and is undervalued relative to the industry.ROE and ROCReturn on Equity (ROE) is the measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. Waste Management’s ROE for the trailing 12-months looks impressive in comparison to Stericycle.

It has amassed assets over $983.84 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance, growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.64%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 23.20% of the portfolio. Industrials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Accenture Plc Class A (ACN  -  Free Report) accounts for about 2.45% of total assets, followed by Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 20.37% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskLRGF seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Diversified Multiple-Factor Index before fees and expenses. The MSCI USA Diversified Multiple-Factor Index is composed of U.S. large and mid-capitalization stocks that have favourable exposure to target style factors subject to constraints.The ETF has gained about 2.52% so far this year and was up about 17.19% in the last one year (as of 05/15/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $27.87 and $33.90.The ETF has a beta of 0.93 and standard deviation of 13.25% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 150 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesIShares Edge MSCI Multifactor USA ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors.

There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD  -  Free Report) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV  -  Free Report) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $36.70 B in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $36.32 B.

628,ACN,"A successful portfolio manager is aware of the importance of having well-performing stocks in one’s portfolio. Indicators of a stock’s consistent performance include a rally in share price and robust fundamentals.One such stock that investors need to hold on to right now is Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report). Though there are a few concerns, these are short lived. The stock has the potential to perform well over the long run.Accenture’s share-price movement has been quite encouraging. In the last one year, its shares have appreciated 34.5%, while the industry to which it belongs to recorded a decline of 30.5%.What’s Driving Accenture?Accenture is one of the leading providers of management consultancy, technology and outsourcing services in the world. The company is on a growth trajectory, gathering momentum from its positive earnings surprise history and robust fundamentals. It delivered a positive earnings surprise in three out of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3%.Last quarter, Accenture reported sturdy year-over-year improvement in revenues and earnings. The year-over-year upswing was primarily driven by its continued focus on innovative product roll outs, continued investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, along with major acquisitions.Furthermore, Accenture pursues strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and expand operating markets. The company closed 37 acquisition deals worth approximately $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017. Also, over the last three fiscals, Accenture has invested approximately $3.4 billion in acquiring nearly 70 companies, including start-ups.These acquisitions have helped the company enhance its product offerings and penetrate into newer markets, thereby contributing to the company’s top line. We believe its acquisition strategy will have a positive impact on Accenture’s top-line performances in the upcoming quarters.Apart from acquisitions, Accenture’s strategic partnerships with companies like Google, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report) have also been key catalysts.  Partnerships have always helped the company fortify its presence across segments like IT security, customer-relationship management and consulting, in turn bolstering its revenues. We expect the company to retain this bullish momentum, backed by its continued focus on operational efficiency.Bottom LineGiven that the company’s long-term earnings per share growth rate is 10% and has a VGM Style Score of A, we believe the stock still has much upside potential. We can essentially filter the negatives and focus on the positives which drive price.Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

629,ACN,"Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) seems to be on track to enhance its offerings for mutual fund and investment managers. Its latest inorganic addition is Morningstar, Inc.’s 15(c) board consulting services business. The financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps.This business segment of Morningstar helps “ boards of directors and executive teams of mutual funds” in meeting their 15(c) fiduciary duties for the process of reviewing and approving the fee related agreements with each investment advisor. The buyout will help Broadridge in better serving its fund board clients.The company in its press release revealed that, “This acquisition will enable Broadridge to provide its fund board clients the ability to benchmark funds using both Morningstar and Lipper data via an objective, independent source in order to better assess their fund advisors and sub-advisors.”The acquisition is anticipated to strengthen Broadridge’s ability to provide a comprehensive source for financial data required for the fulfillment of governance related responsibilities by the board of directors of mutual funds.Dan Cwenar, Broadridge’s head of buy-side data and analytics stated, “This acquisition broadens the breadth and depth of the data-driven solutions Broadridge provides to the investment management industry and underscores our commitment to providing innovative services to help clients get ahead of today’s challenges and capitalize on tomorrow’s opportunities.”Share PriceBroadridge stock has gained 36.9% over the past year, substantially outperforming the 6.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors Driving the StockAcquisitions have been key catalysts for Broadridge’s growth. Prior to the abovementioned acquisition, the company acquired Summit Financial Disclosure, a provider of financial document management services in October 2017. The company is expanding its product portfolio and customer reach as well as evolving as one of the leading financial and outsourcing services providers on the back of its buyouts. These have also proved to be revenue boosters for the company.Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. QuoteApart from this, regular additions to the company’s clientele have been tailwinds. In December 2017, the company’s solutions were adopted by a Miami based broker-dealer, Beta Capital Wealth Management as the latter is transforming to a  self-clearing process.Additionally, the company’s partnerships have also been  driving growth. The company recently joined forces with Wealthsimple, a Canadian digital investing service to step into the “robo-advisory” market. The company also formed a strategic alliance with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to build a new solution that can store documents and data in a repository, which will be further used for machine learning and artificial intelligence.Furthermore, Broadridge’s product launches, share repurchase programs and regular dividend payment policies look encouraging.

630,ACN,"On Dec 27, we issued an updated research report on management services provider, FTI Consulting, Inc. (FCN  -  Free Report).Increased regulatory scrutiny and a proliferation of corporate litigation matters are likely to propel demand for FTI Consulting’s products. Additionally, structural change has become a necessity in the rapidly evolving global markets as management teams look to fend off rivals, protect intellectual property rights and transform businesses via M&A, divestiture and other restructuring activities. These developments call for FTI Consulting’s specialized skill sets and are likely to boost its revenues.In addition, FTI Consulting’s unique capabilities of bringing together damage assessment, accounting, economics, statistics, finance and industry under a single umbrella make it an excellent partner for global clients dealing with international arbitration issues. This, in turn, leads to continued revenue growth from the existing international operations. Moreover, acquisitions on a global basis in high-growth segments and significant investments in technology are likely to fuel growth. The company recently elected few highly qualified executive officers for improving its operational performance in the long term. These drivers are expected to enhance economic performance of the segments and are likely to benefits the company in 2017.FTI Consulting also increased its existing share repurchase program to buy an additional $100 million worth of stocks over a period of time through the open market or through negotiated transactions. The share buyback program is an extension of the strategic objective of the company to reward its shareholders with risk-adjusted returns.However, FTI Consulting has underperformed the industry with a year-to-date loss of 4.2% against a gain of 27.6% for the latter. Despite improving corporate earnings and a strong liquidity, clients’ spending patterns remained cautious, given concerns over the current market environment, volatile financial markets and a lack of visibility regarding the impact of future tax and regulatory policies.FTI Consulting is also highly exposed to foreign exchange rate risk. The revamped market dynamics from the Brexit referendum are expected to affect its trade relationship with the U.K. The company is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering productivity of the company.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Better-ranked stocks in the industry include UniFirst Corporation (UNF  -  Free Report), NV5 Global, Inc. (NVEE  -  Free Report) and Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

631,ACN,"On Dec 27, we issued an updated research report on business services provider, Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report).Cintas maintains a focused approach for steady top-line growth. Revenues have witnessed an increasing trend over the past few quarters. From fiscal 2010-2017, revenues have seen a compounded annual growth rate of 5.2%. In second-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues increased 26.4% year over year to $1,606.4 million, primarily driven by the accretive acquisition of G&K Services Inc. Moreover, addition of new customers, strong customer retention and higher penetration of existing customers through better and innovative products and services led to organic growth of 7.7%.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio.The acquisition of G&K Services has further expanded Cintas’ customer profile as the combined company is catering to more than 1 billion customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service has also improved with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings from the fourth year of its operation.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry.With a diligent execution of operational plans, Cintas has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 34.5% compared with a gain of 31.8% for the latter. Cintas has also raised its earlier guidance for fiscal 2018 on favorable growth trends. Revenues are currently expected in the range of $6,365 million to $6,430 million, up from $6,325 million to $6,400 million anticipated earlier. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be between $5.39 and $5.46 per share, up from earlier projections of $5.30-$5.38.However, Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks which are beyond its control. A sustained increase in raw material costs such as cotton also weighs on the margins. Cintas also faces stiff competition from national, regional and local companies on various factors such as design, price, quality, service and convenience to customers. Specifically, its first aid and fire protection services are decidedly commoditized markets and hence are subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, which further weakens its profitability. Moreover, a persistent challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas, which has resulted in some loss of businesses.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Better-ranked stocks in the industry include UniFirst Corporation (UNF  -  Free Report), NV5 Global, Inc.

633,ACN,"Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) recent announcement of creating a new blockchain division has taken the market by surprise. The new division will be spearheaded by David Marcus, the head of messenger services for the last four years. Per Reuters, another senior-executive Kevin Weil, head of product at Instagram, is also joining the division.The company’s push to include senior executives in the new division reflects the social-media giant’s resoluteness in getting itself fast accustomed to the emerging technology. Per David Marcus, the new division will “explore how to best leverage Blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch.”Blockchain Gaining Fast TractionBlockchain powers bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions. The underlying distributed ledger technology (DLT) makes tampering of data impossible as a number of people are involved and have access to it. This safe system lowers monetary losses with minimum chances of double counting and hacking.Notably, blockchain has already started gaining traction in insurance, banking, food supply, automobile, shipping and freight industries. We note that the industry is currently dominated by the likes International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report).IBM has been winning deals in multi-line insurance, bank guarantee, automobile industry and global food supplying industry among others.Microsoft has also introduced blockchain solution on its cloud platform Azure, which is finding large scale adoption, given the flexibility in usage. Further, Accenture’s patent in editable blockchain and continuing deal win presents significant growth opportunities.Nevertheless, Facebook’s foray into blockchain will surely bring the technology mainstream much faster. Blockchain’s decentralized, transparent and incorruptible characteristics are potent enough to prevent data mishandling, which has been plaguing the social media for a long time. Facebook, Inc. Price and Consensus Facebook, Inc. Price and Consensus | Facebook, Inc. QuotePer IBM’s blockchain expert Bridget van Kralingen “the technology enables users to set permissions for who can access any data tracked by a blockchain.” Consequently, the technology can be used to authenticate a person. It can also be run to validate the source of news, which is likely to prevent the fake-news menace.Facebook’s successful leverage of the blockchain technology will surely boost adoption in the long haul. Market research firm Gartner projects blockchain's business value-add to grow to $176 billion by 2025.Facebook Can Use Blockchain to Secure Data Handling ProcessFacebook’s data storage and usage practices have long been under the scanner of privacy advocates, which gained some credibility after the Cambridge Analytica (“CA”) data scandal broke out.COO Sheryl Sandberg admitted that Facebook failed to audit CA’s data holdings. The company was made to believe that CA had deleted the user data, which was not the case. Apart from the CA data scandal, Russian ad-fiasco and proliferation of fake news on the platform have also hurt user trust in recent times.Facebook is now taking all possible measures to regain user trust and the blockchain initiative is one of those strategies.Although Facebook is rumored to launch its own cryptocurrency using the technology, we believe the company is more likely to use blockchain in building efficient data tracking as well as security systems. This will help the company prevent another data scandal like CA, which affected almost 87 million users.Currently, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a monthly active user base (MAU) of 2.2 billion.

Notably, DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was closed on Apr 1, 2017.So, this will be the second quarterly result of the combined business. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.99, representing a year-over-year increase of a whopping 145.7%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been revised upward over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $6.23 billion, up a massive 224.9% from the year-ago quarter.DXC Technology’s fiscal third-quarter result is likely to benefit from CSC and HPE’s Enterprise Services business merger, strategic partnerships and acquisitions. However, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden might dampen the company’s profitability, offsetting the benefit of higher revenues to some extent.DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteLet’s now discuss the aforementioned factors in detail.Combined Entities Opened Up Avenues of GrowthPost merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. The merger has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom.It is anticipated that the combined entity will generate revenues of approximately $26 billion. Also, DXC Technology is projected to generate cost synergies worth $1 billion during the first year and record a run rate of $1.5 billion at the end of the same.Notably, the company had registered a 229% surge in the fiscal second-quarter revenues chiefly benefiting from the merger. The analysts covering the stock anticipate that the merger benefit will drive DXC Technology’s fiscal third-quarter top-line performance as well.Enhancing Customer Base with PartnershipsThe company’s continued focus on making strategic partnerships to expand its share in the cloud-computing market is likely to aid fiscal third-quarter results. The company, in August 2017, collaborated with VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) and launched the latest DXC Managed Cloud Services supported by VMware's next-generation hybrid-cloud platform.It should be noted that the company has strategic partnerships with the likes of AT&T and HCL. It has also joined forces with Amazon to develop cloud-based solutions for enterprise and public-sector clients. In addition, it has entered into cloud-partnership agreement with IBM and SAP as well. These alliances have increased the company’s access to advanced technology, backed innovative product development and creation of new markets.Furthermore, it has enabled clients to leverage the benefits of mobility, social networking and big data facilities. This, in turn, is likely to expand DXC Technology’s customer base and help garner additional revenues.Buyouts to Generate Additional RevenuesFollowing the footsteps of CSC, DXC Technology is also focusing on acquisitions to expedite growth. Since its formation, the company has announced two acquisitions — Tribridge and Logicalis SMC. While it completed the Tribridge buyout in July last year, the Logicalis SMC acquisition is still in process.Tribridge is one of the largest independent integrators of Microsoft’s Dynamics 365, which explains why this acquisition makes sense for DXC Technology. Therefore, this buyout is likely to benefit the company’s to-be-reported quarter results in the form of increased customer base and additional revenues.Rising Interest Costs to Dent ProfitabilityFlaring up interest expenses due to increased debt burden might dampen the company’s profitability. As of Sep 30, 2017, DXC has a total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $6.33 billion, while it paid $154 million as interest expenses during the first half of fiscal 2018, which was 185% higher than the first half of fiscal 2017 tally.The company’s long-term outstanding debt has significantly increased this fiscal. CSC, prior to the completion of its merger with HPE’s Enterprise Services business, had taken additional debt. This increased DXC Technology’s total long-term liability, thereby escalating its interest-cost burden. Any elevation in interest cost will have a negative impact on the company’s bottom-line results.Currently, DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Its foothold in the interactive content space will be bolstered with the buy-out of this producer of computer generated imagery (CGI) content based on its animation and 3D visualization abilities.The combination of the two companies will enhance Accenture’s abilities to address the requirements of the next-generation customer experiences, innovative content generation and extended reality applications, thereby boosting Accenture’s top line.Accenture stock has gained 37.4% over a year, outperforming the 32.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. Per the press release, “Mackevision’s creation, visualization and production services are used for online product configurators, digital and print catalogues, virtual showrooms, point-of-sale kiosks, augmented and virtual reality experiences, as well as broadcast video and feature films.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $9.11 billion. The company did not provide any earnings per share guidance.Accenture raised its lower-end revenue guidance range for fiscal 2018.

Accenture expects operating cash flow of $5-$5.3 billion and free cash flow of $4.4-$4.7 billion.Our TakeAccenture delivered impressive first-quarter results, wherein the top and bottom lines, both, surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and marked year-over-year improvement. In addition, the company provided encouraging second-quarter and fiscal 2018 outlook.The company’s long-term prospects look promising, driven by continued focus on innovative product roll outs, consistent investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, along with major acquisitions. In addition, we believe regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the revenue stream.However, Accenture’s announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020, and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results, in our opinion.Additionally, increasing competition from peers such as Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH  -  Free Report) and IBM Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report), and an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent.Accenture currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A better-ranked stock in the same space includes Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

643,ACN,"The Republican-led U.S. Senate managed to pass the tax bill, a big step in the direction of Trump’s promise to dramatically alter U.S. tax law. With corporate taxes likely to come down from 35% to 20%, expectations of higher corporate earnings and dividend payouts are likely to drive stocks.However, stock markets fell on the news with apprehensions over its probable effect on years of monetary policy stimulus and interest rates. As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screen:Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Accenture is one of the world’s leading providers of management consultancy, technology and outsourcing services.

644,ACN,"Leading business service provider Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Dec 21. The company is likely to report higher revenues from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment, which accounts for the lion’s share of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.This, in turn, is likely to result in higher earnings for the quarter.Top-Line ImprovementCintas recorded industry leading revenue growth over the past few quarters with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Moreover, the successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has more than 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The combined company is expected to cater more than one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment revenues is currently pegged at $1,296 million, up from $1,006 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from First Aid Safety and Protection segment are expected to be $137 million compared with reported revenues of $125 million in the year-earlier quarter.Other Key FactorsHowever, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn, is likely to impact its financial results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

648,ACN,"On Dec 11, we updated the research report on waste management firm, Republic Services, Inc. (RSG  -  Free Report).Republic Services is currently focusing on a series of quality acquisition opportunities, primarily of recycling assets, which are likely to act as a catalyst for a healthy long-term growth within its top 25 markets. The company is also transitioning to a fee-based recycling processing model to cover processing costs and generate a healthy return on investment.Healthy Growth DynamicsDuring third-quarter 2017, Republic Services acquired ReCommunity Holdings II, Inc., the largest independent recycling-processing firm in the United States, for an undisclosed amount. The strategic acquisition is likely to offer an unrivalled competitive advantage in the recycling business that continues to be one of the fastest growing segments of the waste stream. In addition, the deal will also facilitate Republic Services to gain control of multiple long-term municipal agreements of ReCommunity with processing fee-based structures. These agreements align perfectly with Republic Services' innovative recycling pricing model and are likely to generate incremental revenues.With 26 recycling centers in 14 states, ReCommunity operates single-stream recycling and multi-material processing facilities that transform waste materials into reusable items. These include the recycling of discarded paper into eco-friendly home insulation, aluminum cans and containers to harvest bauxite ore — a raw material for virgin aluminum and PET bottles — into fresh new bottles or carpeting and clothing.In addition, Republic Services continues to generate significant free cash flow, which is utilized for increased dividend payment, repurchasing shares and strategic acquisitions.

650,ACN,"Warren Buffett, one of the most influential and sought-after value investors, criticized cryptocurrency and its trading.Buffett, the owner of Berkshire Hathaway and its vice chairman, Charles Thomas Munger strongly criticized investments in bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting 2018. He believes that these will soon meet their end in a miserable way.Per Buffett, cryptocurrencies are non-productive assets. Hence, the cycle of investment might be pretty short, as it would require people interested to invest in such non-productive products. All this will lead to stagnation in the cryptocurrency industry in the near future.Volatility of CryptocurrencyThe lack of support from global central banks has made the acceptance of cryptocurrencies difficult in real-world transactions. Additionally, a number of fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs) have made investors further apprehensive about the industry’s future.Owing to all these, the cryptocurrency industry looks highly volatile. We have seen companies like Alphabet and Facebook banning cryptocurrency ads on their platforms.China has also imposed a ban on bitcoin trade, while a number of other countries have tightened regulations. These in turn have negatively impacted cryptocurrencies like itcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin.As continued volatility and rising skepticism over the future of cryptocurrencies make investors nervous, we believe, to keep risks at bay, they can shift their focus toward the underlying technology that powers cryptocurrency -– blockchain.Blockchain Witnessing Widescale AdoptionBlockchain’s process of secured storage and transmission of data through a decentralized database is the most attractive feature of the technology. Originally used for cryptocurrency transactions, the system is transparent and incorruptible and is meant to provide unaltered information.The distributed ledger technology (DLT) makes tampering of data impossible as a number of people are involved and have access to it. This safe system lowers monetary losses with minimum chances of double counting and hacking.Notably, the technology has already been adopted by the insurance, banking, food supply and automobile industries among others. It is also being adopted in the shipping and freight industries, aimed at more transparency and simplicity in tracking shipments across borders and trading zones.With such impressive visibility, the companies offering solutions and products related to blockchain operations are looking to gain immensely going ahead. Adoption of the technology is projected to reach $7.6 billion by 2022 from $411.5 million in 2017 at a CAGR of 79.6%, per data from MarketsandMarkets.Let’s take a look at some companies that are well-positioned to benefit from rapid adoption of blockchain technology.International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) has a strong foothold in the blockchain industry with deals in multi-line insurance, bank guarantee, automobile industry, global food supplying industry among others.The company has also unveiled a blockchain-based banking technology aimed at aiding financial institutions to simplify and quicken cross-border transactions. The company also partnered with the largest container shipping firm in the world, A.P. Moller-Maersk, intended to deliver a secure and efficient industry-wide trading platform using blockchain technology.We believe that with a variety of blockchain deals and more in the pipeline, this company will gain from the increasing adoption of the technology.

The company also introduced its blockchain solution on its cloud platform Azure, which is finding large scale adoption, given the flexibility in usage. It has clients like 3M, Webjet, Monetary Authority of Singapore and The Association of Banks in Singapore.With a Zacks Rank #3 and a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.96%, Microsoft is another company to make the most of the growth opportunity in the market.Microsoft Corporation Price Microsoft Corporation Price | Microsoft Corporation QuoteAccenture’s (ACN  -  Free Report) blockchain initiatives are backed by its motto of “Blockchain needs to adapt to an imperfect world.” Considering regulatory changes and human errors among other issues, Accenture provides Editable Blockchain and was awarded with a patent for the same last year.The company has also inked several blockchain based deals. Most recently, the company announced that it is developing a blockchain prototype along with DHL to track pharmaceuticals throughout the supply chain. This will be a huge step against tampering of drugs.

652,ACN,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report), a stock with an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10% and a Growth Score of B.Last year, the company has outperformed the industry it belongs to. While the stock has rallied 29.7%, the industry gained 17.5%.In fact, we believe Accenture has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. This optimism surrounding the stock is backed by the company’s strong cloud and digital marketing capacities owing to acquisitions and partnerships.Let’s delve deep to unearth the reasons behind the company’s impressive price performance.Acquisition: A Key Growth StrategyIn fiscal 2017, Accenture closed 37 acquisition deals worth $1.7 billion. So far this year, the company has either closed or is in the process of acquiring five businesses. Additionally, Accenture has invested approximately $3.4 billion in acquiring nearly 70 companies or start-ups over the last three fiscals. The company also intends to invest close to $1 billion on acquiring assets in fiscal 2018.In fact, we believe Accenture’s strategy of enhancing its cloud capabilities through acquisitions is a step in the right direction. This is evident from the recent forecast by several independent research firms. According to a research firm, Gartner, the public cloud services market is likely to witness a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.3% during the 2016-2019 period, reaching $383.4 billion by 2020-end. Moreover, Accenture has strengthened its digital marketing capabilities through some significant acquisitions, including Reactive Media, Acquity Group Ltd., dgroup and OCTO Technology. Again, the company inked a deal to acquire New York-based digital agency, Meredith Xcelerated Marketing, last month.Accenture Interactive is a well-integrated platform, enabling CMOs to devise marketing strategies and derive higher ROI (return on investment) from it. Considering the growing need for digital marketing, we expect Accenture’s investment in digital and marketing capabilities to boost its long-term growth.Further, Accenture has been aggressively trying to strengthen its position as a leading provider of Salesforce capabilities. To this end, the company has made several acquisitions, including the likes Cloud Sherpas, CRMWaypoint and Tquila UK. In fact, it is already a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with currently over 3,700 skilled consultants.Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM) Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM) | Accenture PLC QuotePartnership Strategies Enabling Entry to New MarketsWe believe that Accenture’s regular partnerships with the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) Web Services, Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report) and SAP are helping the company to enter new markets.In August 2017, Apple and Accenture joined hands to create a mixed team of designers, programmers and other Apple experts, within Accenture Digital Studios units in select locations across the globe. The team focuses on developing tools and services for building iOS apps in accordance to the requirements of Accenture’s clients across different industries.We opine that, the partnership should help Accenture in enhancing its digital transformation capabilities and bring in additional revenues. Apart from this, the agreement is expected to facilitate the company in effectively competing with other consulting companies such as IBM, Dell and Deloitte.Regular Quarterly Dividend Payment & Share RepurchasesAccenture’s strong operating cash flow has helped it to return cash through regular quarterly dividend payment and share repurchases. In fiscal 2017, the company paid a total dividend of $1.57 billion and repurchased $2.65 billion worth of its common stock.In first two quarters of fiscal 2018, the company repurchased share worth $1.37 billion and paid dividend of $854 million. Share repurchases and dividend payments are a good way of returning cash to investors while boosting the company’s earnings.Bottom LineRobust growth strategies in the forms of acquisitions and partnerships, strong prospects in cloud computing and digital marketing arenas along with a healthy track record of returning cash to shareholders lead us to have a positive outlook on the stock.Accenture has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It has amassed assets over $1.03 B, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance, growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.64%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 22.90% of the portfolio. Industrials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC  -  Free Report) accounts for about 2.45% of total assets, followed by Accenture Plc Class A (ACN  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 20.04% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskLRGF seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Diversified Multiple-Factor Index before fees and expenses. The MSCI USA Diversified Multiple-Factor Index is composed of U.S. large and mid-capitalization stocks that have favourable exposure to target style factors subject to constraints.The ETF has added about 2.33% so far this year and was up about 18.49% in the last one year (as of 04/18/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $27.71 and $33.90.The ETF has a beta of 0.93 and standard deviation of 13.33% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 150 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesIShares Edge MSCI Multifactor USA ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, LRGF is a great option for investors seeking exposure to the Large Cap ETFs segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The Vanguard Value ETF (VTV  -  Free Report) and the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD  -  Free Report) track a similar index. While Vanguard Value ETF has $36.29 B in assets, iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $36.60 B. VTV has an expense ratio of 0.06% and IWD charges 0.20%.Bottom-LineAn increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

The research firm expects enterprise software spending to experience maximum growth in 2018, with an 11.1% increase. As a result, Accenture seems well-positioned to take advantage of projected growth.Further, working with SAP Cloud Platform is likely to boost Accenture’s strategy of enhancing its cloud capabilities. We believe that the company’s efforts to enhance its cloud suite through and partnerships are steps in the right direction, evident from the recent forecast by several independent research firms. Gartner predicts that the public cloud services market will witness a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.3% during the 2016–2019 period, reaching $383.4 billion by the end of 2020.Considering the growing need for cloud-based applications and software, we expect Accenture’s investments in this space to propel long-term growth.Zacks Rank & Price PerformanceCurrently, Accenture is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

655,ACN,"Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report), a leading business service provider, is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Mar 22. The company is likely to report higher revenues from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment, accounting for lion’s share of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.This, in turn, is likely to result in higher earnings for the quarter.Top-Line ExpansionCintas recorded industry-leading revenue growth over the past few quarters, with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand the company's portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Moreover, the successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has more than 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The combined company is expected to cater to more than one million business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment revenues is pegged at $1,279 million, up from $993.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Total quarterly revenues are expected to be $1,568 million, up from $1,281 million reported in the year-earlier period.Other Key FactorsHowever, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn, is likely to impact its financial results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 0.00%, as both are pegged at $1.24.

659,ACN,"Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 21. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 37 cents, representing a year-over-year increase of a whopping 52%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $2.65 billion, up 23.5% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see what’s driving this overwhelming expectation.Amazon Partnership Stoking International GrowthFor the last few years, Salesforce has been keen on building partnerships to expand its international operations. Its partnership with Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) is very crucial and the company, during its last earnings conference call, stated that the collaboration has helped it gain businesses overseas.It should be noted that earlier Salesforce used to run its software at the company’s data centers, which was curbing its growth potential. However, last year, the company decided to utilize the AWS data center’s geographical reach to expand its international business. In addition, Salesforce plans to invest about $400 million on AWS’ cloud platform, over the next four years.In the last few months, Salesforce has entered into an agreement with AWS to run its software in the latter’s Canadian and Australian data centers. This has opened up fresh prospects in the Canadian and Asia-Pacific markets.During the fiscal second quarter, the company won several deals due to its international expansion initiatives. Companies like Toshiba, Nomura, Queensland Urban Utilities and Australia Post picked Salesforce’s solutions to fuel digital transformation. It is most likely that the company will continue winning international deals which will drive its fiscal third-quarter top- and bottom-line results.Salesforce.com Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Salesforce.com Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Salesforce.com Inc QuoteAcquisitions Driving RevenuesAcquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Over the last two years, the company closed a number of takeovers worth a combined deal value of more than $4 billion. Last year alone, the company made as many as 12 takeover deals, including its biggest ever buyout — Demandware — concluded in July 2016. These acquisitions have strengthened its position in the customer relationship management (CRM  -  Free Report) solution providing space. We expect the acquisition synergies to drive Salesforce’s fiscal third-quarter top-line performance.Salesforce Partner Program Adding CustomersTremendous growth in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the company’s top-line results. During its fiscal second-quarter conference call, Salesforce announced that its partner certification witnessed growth of five times over the last four years, and more companies are willing to invest in Salesforce activities. Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with over 11,000 skilled consultants.Notably, a number of big organizations, including Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), 21st Century Fox, Jefferies Investment Bank and Samsung, picked Salesforce solutions during the fiscal second quarter to drive their digital transformation. Analysts covering the stock believe that the fiscal third quarter will witness the same trend, thereby bolstering its top-line performance.Furthermore, during the fiscal second quarter, Salesforce broke through the $10-billion run rate and named itself the first company in the history of enterprise cloud software industry to have achieved this milestone so fast, including its closest rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and SAP SE.Currently, Salesforce carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company now expects revenues between $1.239 and $1.241 billion, up from the previous range of $1.210-$1.215 billion.Cloud revenues are now expected at $90 million, up from previous range of $85 million.Billings are now anticipated to be $1.485 billion compared with the previous guidance of $1.450 billion.

Operating margin is anticipated in the range of 12-14%. Moreover, customer base is expected to expand 20K by 2020.ConclusionSplunk’s market opportunity is growing on the back of its software, which is traditionally used for IT operational intelligence, security, fraud-detection, app analytics and other relevant cases. Additionally, partnerships with the likes of AWS, Booz Allen Hamilton and Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) are helping the company to launch products. The portfolio expansion is driving clientele, which is a key catalyst.Moreover, the company is well poised to benefit from the ongoing shift to modern analytics-based security information and event management (SIEM) from a traditional structured data legacy-based one. This is driving large security orders for the company.Although Splunk’s win rate against tracked competitors is impressive (generally 80% to upwards of 95%), intense competition remains a major concern.Splunk carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

661,ACN,"The world’s leading electronics components distributor, Avnet Inc. (AVT  -  Free Report), last week announced that its board of directors has increased the current share repurchase authorization by $200 million, thereby bringing the total authorization limit to approximately $500 million. However, management stated that the timing and number of shares to be bought will depend upon prevailing market conditions as well as other factors.Apart from this, management also announced a quarterly cash dividend of 18 cents per share to be paid on Dec 19 for the shareholders of record date as of Dec 6.Avnet has a steady track record of returning value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payouts. The company notified that in the past six years, it has returned more than $1.7 billion to its shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments.Also, it should be noted that the company has approved nearly $2 billion of cumulative share repurchase program since 2011, of which it has completed the purchase of approximately $1.43 billion worth of common stocks.The company’s strong balance sheet and cash flow provide it with the financial flexibility to undertake shareholder-friendly initiatives and scope for product innovation and expansion in newer markets. The company ended first-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of nearly $737.6 million.Avnet, Inc. Price  Avnet, Inc. Price | Avnet, Inc. QuoteSome other companies that have a consistent track record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments include Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) and Automatic Data Processing Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report).We believe such initiatives not only enhance shareholders’ return but also raise the market value of a stock. Through share repurchases and dividend payouts, companies bolster investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip. Looking ahead, Avnet remains confident on its growth potential, thereby raising hope for further rise in shareholder value.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

662,ACN,"In a concerted effort to return cash to shareholders, FTI Consulting, Inc. (FCN  -  Free Report) increased its existing share repurchase program to buy an additional $100 million worth of stocks over a period of time through the open market or through negotiated transactions. The share buyback program is an extension of the strategic objective of the company to reward its shareholders with risk-adjusted returns.With the hike in its share repurchase tally, FTI Consulting can now purchase an aggregate of $300 million worth of stock. As of Nov 30, 2017, the company bought back approximately 5.1 million shares at an average price of $36.39 per share for $186.6 million. Consequently, it presently has about $113.3 million worth of shares available for repurchase.The management service provider intends to repurchase its shares by utilizing its operating cash flow. FTI Consulting has a relatively healthy balance sheet position with adequate liquidity. Increased regulatory scrutiny and a proliferation of corporate litigation are likely to increase demand for the company’s products. Additionally, structural change has become a necessity in the rapidly evolving global markets as management teams look to fend off rivals, protect intellectual property rights and transform businesses via M&A, divestiture and other restructuring activities. These developments call for FTI Consulting’s specialized skill sets and are likely to boost its revenues.However, FTI Consulting has underperformed the industry with a year-to-date loss of 2.2% as against a gain of 23.4% for the latter. Despite improving corporate earnings and a strong liquidity, clients’ spending patterns remained cautious, given concerns over the current market environment, volatile financial markets and a lack of visibility regarding the impact of future tax and regulatory policies.FTI Consulting is also highly exposed to foreign exchange rate risk. The revamped market dynamics from the Brexit referendum are expected to affect its trade relationship with the U.K. The company is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering productivity of the company.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth prospects of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. Other stocks in the industry worth considering include Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) and NV5 Global, Inc. (NVEE  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and CRA International, Inc.

663,ACN,"On Dec 4, we issued an updated research report on leading comprehensive waste management services provider, Waste Management Inc. (WM  -  Free Report).Waste Management is successfully executing its initiatives to refocus on core business activities and instill price and cost discipline to achieve better margins. At the same time, the company aims to improve customer retention by providing better services and higher value solutions. Waste Management's successful cost-reduction initiatives have further helped it achieve remarkable gross margin expansion and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) growth over the quarters.In addition, Waste Management plans to return significant cash to shareholders through healthy dividends and share repurchases in the future. A steady dividend payment policy is part of Waste Management’s long-term strategy of providing attractive risk-adjusted returns to its stockholders. The company’s investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to execute its growth strategy. Furthermore, decent dividend increases at periodic intervals have been one of the company’s most attractive features.With strong yield, volume, and cost performance in the third quarter, the company has raised its guidance for 2017. It expects 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $3.19 to $3.21 per share compared with earlier expectations of $3.14 to $3.18. Free cash flow is expected between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, up from previous expectations of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. Such a bullish outlook raises investor confidence in the stock.With diligent execution of operational plans, the stock has outperformed the industry year to date with an average return of 15.4% compared with 12.1% gain for the latter.However, stringent government regulations are likely to contract margins as compliance with such regulations increases operating costs for the company. In order to develop or operate a landfill or any waste management unit, facility permits and other governmental approvals are necessary. These permits and approvals are often difficult to obtain, are time consuming and costly and could restrict its operations. All these are likely to impact the company’s profitability in the long term.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the solid growth prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Better-ranked stocks in the broader industry include S&P Global, Inc. (SPGI  -  Free Report), TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) and Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

664,ACN,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report) has recently launched an admitted cyber liability product named, CyberChoice First Response to address the cyberattacks suffered by the businesses. This initiative comes with an objective to lower the damages caused to the company’s profitability and reputations due to a spate of cyberattacks.The New OfferingCyberChoice First Response helps businesses combat cyberattack challenges like data privacy and network security, media, ransomware and business interruption with complete opportunity of customization. The product would also enable the company to track down and respond to cyber threats.Provision of coverage for pre-claim expenses, recognition of internal expenses incurred due to a breach, 24/7 cyber incident hotline assistance, protection against system failure and administrative error are some of the major features of the product. CyberChoice First Response would also offer coverage, related to a regulatory inquiry plus regulatory fines and defense as well as expenses incurred on a regulatory proceeding.The new product provides business owners with vital access to a guidance panel of pre-approved service providers, who could assist to secure the invaded networks with their expert advice and know-how. For customers, Hartford Financial offers a digital cyber risk management portal called The Hartford Cyber Center, which equips customers with tools, training materials and suggestions on best practices to mitigate the cyber intrusion risks.Rationale Behind the LaunchThe failure to protect information of the policyholders costs insurers millions in terms of fines and other costs. A report by Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) states that insurance companies experience 113 cyberattacks on an average every year with one out of three successfully inflicting serious data violation. This not only hurts a company’s underwriting results but also causes loss.Management at Hartford Financial believes that CyberChoice First Response is a comprehensive insurance solution to provide insurers and their clients with complete coverage on the rapidly changing landscape of cyber threats.The responsibility of the new product does not end once the claim is resolved but it also offers post-incident coverage to enable a business improve its overall security position prepared beforehand against possible cyberattacks.Initiatives by Other PlayersWith the average cost of a data breach exceeding $3 million, insurers are proactively adopting new technologies to protect their clients and customers.Earlier this April, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (WLTW  -  Free Report), a leading insurance broker, launched the latest version of its innovative Cyber Risk Profile Diagnostic tool, which allows organizations to identify and analyze risk prone areas of cyber exposure and vulnerability by measuring the respective current cyber maturity.Last December, American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) announced a new cyber benchmarking model, which quantifies and scores client cyber risk.Share Price PerformanceHartford Financial’s relentless efforts to ensure customer satisfaction have therefore helped it gain shareholders’ appreciation.

665,ACN,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company’s (HPE  -  Free Report) board of directors recently announced regular quarterly cash dividend of 11.25 cents per share to be payable on Jul 4 to the shareholders of record date as of June 13. The new dividend reflects an increase of a whopping 50% from the previous payment of 7.5 cents per share.This will mark the company’s third quarterly dividend payment in fiscal 2018. Prior to this, it had paid dividend in December 2017 and March 2018.The robust hike in dividend is believed to be in line with Hewlett Packard’s latest capital-return policy. It should be noted that during the first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call, the company had stated that it would return $7 billion to shareholders by fiscal 2019 through share buybacks and dividend payments. Of this, it is expected that Hewlett Packard will return at least half of the amount in the current fiscal.Notably, during fiscal 2017, Hewlett Packard returned $3 billion to its shareholders, of which $2.56 billion was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments. Continuing the same, the company, during the last reported quarter, returned $862 million to shareholders, of which $742 million was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments.The company’s strong balance sheet and cash flow provides it with the financial flexibility to undertake shareholder-friendly initiatives, and scope for product innovation, acquisitions and expansion into newer markets. The company ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of nearly $7.7 billion.Some other companies that have a consistent track record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments include The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report).We believe such initiatives not only enhance shareholder return but also raise the market value of a stock. Through share repurchases and dividend payouts, companies boost investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip. Looking ahead, Hewlett Packard remains confident on its growth potential, thereby raising hope for further increase in shareholder value.Notably, Hewlett Packard has outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period.

666,ACN,"Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) is witnessing strong demand for its services owing to solid performance across its insurance, banking and health care segments.In the second-quarter fiscal 2018, the company performed exceedingly well. Non-GAAP earnings (excluding the effect of US tax law changes) of $1.58 per share, outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents and improved 18.8% year over year. Also, revenues increased 15% year over year to $9.6 billion and surpassed the consensus mark by 3.2%.Furthermore, the company’s surprise history has been impressive as it surpassed the consensus mark in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 3.8%. For the fourth quarter, the consensus estimate moved down 1.7% over the past 30 days.Notably, shares of Accenture have gained 28.4% in the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s 24.1% rally. Acquisition is a Key Growth StrategyIn fiscal 2017, Accenture closed 37 acquisition deals worth $1.7 billion. So far this year, the company has either closed or is in the process of acquiring five businesses. Over the last three fiscals, Accenture has invested approximately $3.4 billion in acquiring nearly 70 companies or start-ups.For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates to invest close to $1 billion on acquiring assets. This is because acquisitions have enabled Accenture to enter new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, and maintain its leading position. Going ahead, such buyouts are expected to contribute significantly to the company’s revenue stream.Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM) Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM) | Accenture PLC QuoteCloud Offers Huge OpportunitiesAccenture’s strategy of enhancing its cloud capabilities through acquisitions and partnerships should benefit the company. This is evident from the recent forecast by several independent research firms. According to a research firm, Gartner, the public cloud services market is likely to witness a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.3% during the 2016-2019 period, reaching $383.4 billion by 2020 end.In fact, we believe that exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud-computing vendors. Therefore, considering the growing need for cloud-based applications and software, Accenture’s investments in this space are anticipated to propel long-term growth.Strengthening Digital Marketing CapabilitiesAccenture has strengthened its digital marketing capabilities through some significant acquisitions, including Reactive Media, Acquity Group Ltd., dgroup and OCTO Technology. Again, the company inked a deal to acquire New York-based digital agency, Meredith Xcelerated Marketing, last month.  Accenture Interactive is a well-integrated platform, enabling CMOs to devise marketing strategies and derive higher ROI (return on investment) from it. Considering the growing need for digital marketing, we expect Accenture’s investment in digital and marketing capabilities to boost its long-term growth. This will also facilitate the company in effectively competing with other digital marketing service providers such as IBM, Deloitte and Dell.Increasing Competition and Integration Risks Although acquisitions improve revenue opportunities along with business mix and profitability, it adds to integration risks as well. Moreover, frequent acquisitions are a distraction for management, which might impact organic growth moving ahead.Further, competition from companies like Genpact (G  -  Free Report), Cognizant (CTSH  -  Free Report) and Infosys (INFY  -  Free Report) is a mounting pressure. In fact, competition is particularly tough in the case of resurgent regions like Europe, since all the major players are fighting for business. This naturally increases pricing pressures.Zacks RankAccenture carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, on constant currency basis, revenues decreased 4.3% year over year. The decline was primarily due to completion of two large government contracts in the UK. Revenues from the new business for GBS came in at $2.5 billion during the quarter.Global Infrastructure Services (GIS) revenues during the quarter came in at $3.142 billion as compared with $836 million reported in the year-ago-quarter. On constant currency basis, revenues decreased 4.8% year over year (excluding the impact of purchase price accounting), primarily due to decline in traditional infrastructure services. Revenues from new business for GIS awards came in at $2.8 billion during the quarter.United States Public Sector (USPS) revenues were $710 million during the quarter. USPS revenue was up 5.5% year over year (excluding the impact of purchase price accounting).

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise DXC Technology Company. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteOutlookThe company reiterated fiscal 2018 revenues guidance. For fiscal 2018, DXC Technology continues to expect revenues to be in the range of $24-$24.5 billion in constant currency. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $24.18 billion. Non-GAAP EPS is now anticipated to be in the range of $7.25-$7.75 per share (previous guidance $6.50-$7 per share). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $6.84 per share.Recent activityDXC Technology recently announced the spin-off of its USPS business, and subsequently merged the same with Vencore Holdings and KeyPoint Government Solutions. The three companies have come together to form a publicly-traded IT service-providing company, primarily to the U.S. government. Notably, Vencore and KeyPoint are owned by private-equity firm Veritas Capital. The transaction is anticipated to close by the end of March 2018.Per the agreement, the deal will be structured as a ‘Reverse Morris Trust’ transaction, consequently making the entire transaction as tax-free to DXC Technology and its shareholders.Upon conclusion of the deal, shareholders of DXC Technology will receive 86% of the combined company’s shares. Along with this, the company will receive $1.05 billion of cash from USPS, upon the completion of its spin-off. The proceeds from USPS are intended to be used for debt repayments, share buyback and other general corporate purposes.Our TakeThe company reported stellar second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, where in both top and bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company also provided an encouraging guidance for fiscal 2018.Post-merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe that the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. The merger has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom.Following the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology may be seen making strategic acquisitions to enhance portfolio, which is likely drive growth over the long run. Further, the company is projected to generate cost synergies worth $1 billion during the first year and record a run rate of $1.5 billion at the end of the same.Nonetheless, the market is very competitive with companies like CACI International Inc. (CACI  -  Free Report)  and Accenture, which could hurt DXC Technology’s top and bottom lines. Additionally, a challenging macroeconomic situation and uncertain IT spending environment remain headwinds.Currently, DXC carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

669,ACN,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 7. Notably, DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was closed on Apr 1, 2017.So, this will be the second quarterly result of the combined business. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.53, representing a year-over-year increase of a whopping 150.7%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained nearly unchanged over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $5.99 billion, up 220.3% from the year-ago quarter.DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise  DXC Technology Company. Price and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteDXC Technology’s fiscal second-quarter result is likely to benefit from CSC and HPE’s Enterprise Services business merger, strategic partnerships and acquisitions. However, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability, offsetting the benefit of higher revenues to some extent.Let’s now discuss the aforementioned factors in detail.Merger Opens Up Avenues of GrowthPost merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. The merger has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom.It is anticipated that the combined entity will generate revenues of approximately $26 billion. Also, DXC Technology is projected to generate cost synergies worth $1 billion during the first year and record a run rate of $1.5 billion at the end of the same.Notably, the company had registered a 206% surge in fiscal first-quarter revenues mainly benefiting from the merger. The analysts covering the stock anticipate that the merger benefit will drive DXC Technology’s fiscal second-quarter top-line performance as well.Partnerships Enhancing Customer BaseGoing ahead, the company’s continued focus on making strategic partnerships to expand its share in the cloud-computing market is likely to aid fiscal second-quarter results. The company, in August 2017, collaborated with VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) and launched the latest DXC Managed Cloud Services supported by VMware's next-generation hybrid-cloud platform.It should be noted that the company has strategic partnerships with the likes of AT&T and HCL. It has also joined forces with Amazon to develop cloud-based solutions for enterprise and public-sector clients. In addition, it has entered into cloud-partnership agreement with IBM and SAP as well. These alliances have increased its access to new technology, backed innovative product development and creation of new markets.Also, it has enabled clients to leverage the benefits of mobility, social networking and big data facilities. This, in turn, is likely to expand DXC Technology’s customer base and help garner additional revenues.Acquisition to Generate Additional RevenuesFollowing the footsteps of CSC, DXC Technology is also focusing on acquisitions to expedite growth. Since its formation, the company has announced two acquisitions — Tribridge and Logicalis SMC. While it completed the Tribridge buyout in July this year, Logicalis SMC acquisition is still in process.Tribridge is one of the largest independent integrators of Microsoft’s Dynamics 365, which explains why this acquisition makes sense for DXC Technology. Therefore, the buyout is likely to benefit the company’s to-be-reported quarter results in the form of increased customer base and additional revenues.Escalating Interest Costs to Weigh on ProfitabilityFlaring up interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability. As of Jun 30, 2017, DXC has a total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $6.25 billion, while it paid $76 million as interest expenses during the fiscal first quarter, which was 200% higher than the year-ago quarter tally.The company’s long-term outstanding debt has significantly increased this year. CSC, prior to the completion of its merger with HPE’s Enterprise Services business, had taken additional debt. This increased DXC Technology’s total long-term liability, thereby increasing its interest-cost burden. Any elevation in interest cost will have a negative impact on the company’s bottom-line results.Currently, DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

670,ACN,"Teradata Corporation (TDC  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 results beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but compared unfavorably with the year-ago comparable period.The company reported adjusted earnings of 29 cents per share, which plunged 58% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 69 cents. Adjusted earnings however beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents.Notably, shares of Teradata gained 36.4% year-to-date, outperforming the industry’s 25% rally.Revenue DetailsTotal revenue of $526 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $510.5 million. However, it plunged 4.7% on a year-over-year basis. This was mainly due to the company’s ongoing business transformation activity, under which its large customers have begun shifting to subscription-based offerings.Products and Cloud revenues decreased 18% year over year to $172 million. Services revenues increased 4% on a year-over-year basis to $354 million.

Non-GAAP operating margin declined to 9.5% from 21.9% reported in the year-ago quarter mainly due to lower revenues, shrinking gross margin and higher operating expenses to support the company’s strategic initiatives.Balance Sheet & Share RepurchaseTeradata exited the quarter with $1.025 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $1.085 billion at the end of the previous quarter. Teradata had long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $493 million at the end of the third quarter compared with $508 million at the end of second-quarter 2017.In the third quarter, Teradata recorded net cash outflow from operations of $8 million and free cash flow of $40 million. Year to date, the company generated $301 million of cash flow from operational activities and $235 million of free cash flow.Teradata repurchased 6.3 million shares for $200 million during the third quarter.GuidanceTeradata expects 2017 revenues to decline 5%, compared with the earlier projected range of 5% to 7%.Teradata also provided earnings outlook for the full year.

Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to come between 47 and 52 cents.Teradata Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Teradata Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Teradata Corporation QuoteTo ConcludeTeradata revenues are being adversely impacted by the company’s ongoing business transformation. Also, restructuring related costs, a sluggish spending environment in the domestic market and increasing competition will continue to weigh on its financials.However, we expect growth to come from new strategic partnerships as Teradata has long-standing business relationships with large organizations such as Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report), Capgemini, Deloitte, Cognizant (CTSH  -  Free Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Wipro Limited, among others in the same niche market. We believe that new customer wins and strengthening relationships with large vendors will primarily drive revenues and profits.The company is expected to benefit from transition to the subscription-based revenue model in the long run.Zacks RankTeradata carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

671,ACN,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of IBB Consulting, a strategy consulting firm. Notably, the two companies had entered into the buyout deal last month. However, financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed.Founded in 2001, IBB Consulting helps organizations across communication, media and technology develop market strategies. The company, with approximately 160 highly-skilled professionals, as well as immense experience in business planning, strategy, technology and execution, assists organizations in successfully executing business operations, develop business models, and create new products and services.It operates in North America and Australia, though the majority of its professionals work in North America. The Philadelphia-based strategy consulting firm served big companies like Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report).Strengthens Presence in CMT Consulting MarketAccenture has integrated IBB Consulting’s business into its Accenture Strategy division. With the successful completion of the acquisition, the acquired company’s employees have joined the integrating division.With this acquisition, Accenture not only got a large talent pool, but has also gained a huge customer base as well. This acquisition has further fortified Accenture’s presence in the communication, media and technology (CMT) consulting market, and is believed to help it gain higher market share.Greg Douglass, senior managing director, Accenture Strategy, noted, “The acquisition of IBB Consulting enhances our ability to deliver the latest thinking and strategies to our clients by leveraging emerging technologies that ultimately help them compete and win in the face of an expanding and evolving competitive landscape.”The demand for network technology is on the rise as telecom companies have accelerated the deployment of 5G networks and cable operators, moving into the wireless space. Furthermore, media companies are making digital transformation in their internal operations, as well as bringing in technologically advanced new products. Here the buyout of IBB Consulting will help Accenture in advising its clients as the former has expertise in both these areas.Accenture stock has gained 17% year to date, outperforming 14.9% growth recorded in the industry it belongs to.Acquisitions – Key Growth StrategyAccenture pursues strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and expand operating markets. So far in 2017, the company has either completed or signed over 15 acquisition deals across various business segments, including Altitude, Genfour, SinnerSchrader and New Energy Group.  Last year, it completed or signed about 12 acquisition deals across various business segments, such as IT security, CRM capabilities and strategy consulting. In 2015, it closed 21 takeovers.These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to set foot in newer markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, and maintain a leading position in the market as well. A strong cash balance of $4.13 billion as of Aug 31, 2017, and an operating cash flow of $4.97 billion generated during fiscal 2017 are anticipated to support Accenture’s inorganic growth strategy.Bottom LineAccenture’s long-term prospects look promising due to its sustained focus on innovative product roll outs, consistent investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, and major acquisitions. Also, we believe regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the company's revenue stream.Additionally, the company is focusing on building partnerships which is helping it foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden the product portfolio. Most recently, Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Accenture joined forces to create a mixed team of designers, programmers, and other Apple experts, within Accenture Digital Studios units in select locations around the world.Currently, Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

672,ACN,"On Oct 6, we issued an updated research report on global marketing and corporate communications firm, Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report).Growth DriversOmnicom’s performance in developed markets like the United States and developing markets like Asia has been steady. The measures undertaken by the company to reduce costs have helped it boost earnings. It is expanding its global footprint and is moving into new service areas. The company is also building upon its digital and analytical capabilities by investing in agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies in key markets. Omnicom’s operations are diversified across technology platforms, thus lowering its dependence on any one product in these dynamic technological markets.Also, Omnicom is concentrating on strengthening its business and expanding its client base globally through the acquisition of complementary companies. The company maintains a balanced growth model through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and strategic acquisitions. We expect it to witness higher revenues in the imminent future on the back of prudent acquisitions and organic growth.The company has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date loss of 10.2% compared with a decline of 14.3% for the latter. In order to spur growth, Omnicom started using open-source technique to access the current information in the market. The increasing demand for media services, speedy growth of technologies and massive proliferation of channels are likely to translate into incremental revenues in the future.HeadwindsOmnicom forms part of the communications industry, which is highly competitive in nature. Various agencies and media service providers compete with each other to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. Also, keeping in view the service-oriented nature of the industry, it becomes imperative for the company to increase the count of talented employees and retain the existing ones. These factors are likely to pose some challenges for it.Furthermore, a significant portion of Omnicom’s revenues comes from Europe. At present, when the economy in the region is highly unpredictable, particularly after the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and reduce costs. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering the productivity of the company. In addition, it is susceptible to market risks of losing contracts related to media purchases and production costs, which thereby affects its bottom line and undermines its organic growth to some extent.Moving ForwardNevertheless, we remain impressed with Omnicom’s focused growth initiatives and expect it to witness higher revenues in the future.Omnicom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader industry include Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) and PageGroup plc , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and Stantec Inc. (STN  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Accenture has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.3%. It topped earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 2.6%.PageGroup has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 15%.

677,ACN,"Shares of Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) have been gaining solid momentum, of late, and even crafted a 52-week high of $135.71 yesterday. One of the major reasons behind this could be the company’s outstanding first-quarter fiscal 2019 results. Also, encouraging second-quarter and full-fiscal outlook drove its shares higher.Notably, the company has gained approximately 7% since it reported fiscal first-quarter results on May 29. The stock has outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period. Salesforce has returned 32.6% in the said period, while the industry has gained 17.7%.Salesforce’s fiscal first-quarter revenues were up 25% year over year to $3 billion and came ahead of management’s guided range of 2.925-$2.935 billion. The reported figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.94 billion as well. Rapid adoption of the company’s cloud-based solutions and acquisition synergies led to the splendid top-line results.The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 74 cents per share, trumping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. The figure increased more than twofold from the year-ago quarter.In fact, Salesforce beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 19.7%. Backed by the impressive results, the company has issued an upbeat outlook for the second quarter as well as full fiscal.Let’s take a look at what factors are driving Salesforce’s back-to-back robust quarterly performances.Buyouts Buoying Top LineAcquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Over the past two years, the company has closed or was in the midst of as many as 16 acquisitions, worth billions of dollars, including its latest biggest-ever buyout agreement — MuleSoft. These acquisitions have strengthened its position in the customer relationship-management solution-providing space. We expect the acquisition synergies to continue driving Salesforce’s top-line performance in the quarters ahead.Expanding International Business With PartnershipsSalesforce still generates only about 30% of total revenues from international operations, which is lower than its rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) or Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) composition of around 50%. Nonetheless, the company noted that its partnership agreements with the likes of Amazon and Alphabet for the firms’ cloud services have been helping it expand Salesforces’ international operations.Earlier, the company used to run its software at its own data centers which had been curbing its growth potentials. However, in 2016, Salesforce decided to utilize the geographical reach of other data-center service providers in order to expand its international business.The company’s first partnership in this space was with Amazon Web Services in 2016, followed by the next alliance with Alphabet last November. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the company won several deals due to its international-expansion initiatives.Partner Program Adding CustomersStellar growth in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the company’s top-line results. Notably, the company’s partner certification has witnessed five-time growth over the past four years and more companies are willing to invest in Salesforces’ activities. Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with more than 11,800 skilled consultants.The company added and strengthened its relationships with some notable customers during the fiscal first quarter such as Citi, Philips and Santander UK, SoftBank and LUXA among others. We expect the trend to continue and drive the overall financial performance of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

Moreover, the company raised its earnings guidance. We believe that the results and the guidance indicate the company’s ability in harnessing the ongoing digital transition. Cognizant is significantly benefiting from accretive acquisitions. Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation QuoteCognizant’s strong growth can be attributed to its significant exposure to the fast-growing verticals like Financial Services and Healthcare. The company has gained deep industry expertise and knowledge of the domains through partnerships with top firms like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report).This strategy has enabled the company to deliver more value to clients and capitalize on new opportunities.

We believe that the aforementioned factors will help the stock to rebound in the rest of 2017.Quarter DetailsSegment-wise, Financial services (38.3% of revenues), that includes insurance, banking and transaction processing, grew 4.1% year over year to $1.41 billion.Healthcare (28.6% of revenues) grew 9.5% year over year to $1.05 billion.Products and Resources (20.4% of revenues) continued its growth momentum and surged 13.2% year over year to $747 million.Communications, Media and Technology (12.7% of revenues) were $467 million, up 16.8% from the year-ago quarter.Region-wise, revenues from North America increased 8.7% year over year and represented 77.7% of total revenue.Revenues from the U.K. declined 7.4% year over year (7.8% of the total revenue).

679,ACN,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of LabAnswer, a research and laboratory informatics technology consulting firm. Notably, the two companies had entered into the deal last month. However, financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed.Headquartered in Sugar Land, TX, LabAnswer is specialized in providing informatics consultancy services to scientific and research laboratories. With approximately 250 employees, apart from life sciences, the company offers its services to various other industries, including chemicals, resources, energy, consumer goods, and government.With the successful completion of the buyout, the company has established a new business division – Accenture Scientific Informatics Services.Accenture is planning to leverage its digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation, analytics and cloud, with a fundamental redesign of the scientific user experience. With this, the company’s new division will be able to help life sciences companies in better capturing, managing, integrating and analyzing complex research data, thereby giving better ideas to identify new and more effective treatments for patients.We believe that this acquisition will enhance Accenture’s portfolio of life sciences services. The acquisition of LabAnswer will not only bring in a huge talent pool, but will also expand its reach in different markets.We are encouraged by Accenture’s strategy of growing through acquisitions. These buyouts have enabled the company to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden the product portfolio, as well as maintain a leading position. We believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to its revenue stream.Notably, shares of Accenture have outperformed the industry, over the last one year. The stock has gained 13.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 13.2%.Nonetheless, Accenture’s latest announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities will likely dent its bottom-line results. Increasing competition from the likes of DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH  -  Free Report), as well as an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter the company’s growth to some extent.Currently, Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is Exponent Inc.

685,ACN,"Shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) climbed nearly 2.5% on Monday as it looks to buck a nearly month-long downturn fueled by tariff-related woes and possible Chinese retaliation. Aside from reports that these potentially devastating headwinds might have been overblown, some substantive Boeing-related news helped push the stock higher today. Let’s take a look.Startup InvestmentBoeing just announced that it was part of a $15 million Series A investment round for Australian Internet of Things startup, Myriota.Myriota’s direct-to-orbit platform can enable more effective, lower cost connectivity for IoT applications across a range of industries, from logistics to defense, in relatively off-the-grid areas.“Myriota's technology influences how we think about space-based communications and connectivity in remote locations,” vice president of Boeing HorizonX, Steve Nordlund, said in a statement.The aerospace giant made this investment through its venture capital leg, Boeing HorizonX. Boeing’s Myriota investment marked its first outside the U.S. and its 10th since the company launched the fund last April.#BoeingHorizonX makes its first international investment in Australia-based @MyriotaGlobal, a nanosatellite communications startup bringing #IoT connectivity to remote locations https://t.co/WuBSAv0pna pic.twitter.com/b9aKUy6RkC— Boeing Australia (@BoeingAustralia) March 26, 2018Potential American Airlines DealLast Friday, Reuters reported that American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report) ended its negotiations with Airbus (EADSY  -  Free Report) to purchase a large number of aircraft. Europe-based Airbus noted that it was simply unable to meet or match the price Boeing offered for comparable planes.American is reportedly looking to purchase roughly 30 new wide-bodied aircraft, which could value any potentially deal with Boeing at roughly $8 billion.Dreamliner DeliveryBoeing delivered its first 787-10 Dreamliner to Singapore Airlines on Sunday. This is hardly an insignificant move as the company has banked a large portion of its future on the Dreamliner class of aircraft, of which the 787-10 is the largest of three planes in terms of length and passenger capacity.The aircraft reportedly costs roughly $325 million and is the latest and final—at least for the time being— model of the Dreamliner series, which debuted in 2012.Virtual RealityThe last piece of Boeing news that might have helped lift investor confidence comes in the form of a National Safety Council recognition. Boeing joined Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) and Brigham Health Sleep Matters Initiative as a 2018 Green Cross for Safety Innovation Award Finalist.Boeing cracked the list for its use of virtual reality technology to help engineers with real-time interactive simulations of build processes and service tasks. The VR allows the design team to “experience those tasks from the perspective of a production mechanic or airline maintenance mechanic and identify issues before they become a safety concern.”The National Safety Council noted that Boeing has developed 11 different virtual reality systems so far, and plans to add three more in 2018.  Bottom LineBoeing is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and also currently boasts an “A” for Growth in our Style Scores system. On top of that, Boeing stock comes at a discount compared to where it was just a few months ago, as its stock price sunk nearly 10% over the last four weeks alone.Now might not be a bad time to buy Boeing stock, especially when considering the latest company-related news that could propel further growth.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

Free cash flow is anticipated to be in the range of $4.6-$4.9 billion as compared with the previous guidance of $4.4-$4.7 billion.Our TakeAccenture delivered stellar second-quarter results, wherein it topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts. The company also raised fiscal 2018 guidance.The company’s product launches, consistent investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, along with major acquisitions will smoothen the path for its growth. Notable recent acquisitions include the likes of Mackevision, Altima and Rothco.Accenture’s strategy of growing through partnerships like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and buyouts like IBB Consulting and VERAX are encouraging.However, Accenture’s announcement of creating new jobs and investment plan of $1.4 billion in the United States may dent its bottom-line results in our opinion. Additionally, stiff competition from peers having the likes of Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH  -  Free Report) and IBM Corp.

However, the top line came within management’s guided range of $1,305-$1,365 million.

Further, the gross margin declined by 10 basis points (bps) to 41.2%, mainly due to lower gross margin at the Protiviti segment.

689,ACN,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) has opted for an inorganic path for enhancing its digital marketing capabilities. Over the last five years, Accenture has acquired 17 businesses and integrated into this segment.Moreover, the company recently entered into a negotiation to acquire Altima — a France-based digital commerce agency — which is specialized in customer experience design. If the deal materializes, Altima will mark its 18th buyout. Other recent notable acquisitions in the space are Karmarama and SinnerSchrader AG.In our opinion, these acquisitions have helped Accenture in providing end-to-end digital marketing services, bringing in a deeper and broader set of digital solutions to its clients. Also, the strategy has helped it diversify its offerings and expand its foothold in new markets.Industry Forecasts Support its StrategyThe increased penetration of Internet, PCs and smartphones has enhanced the scope of digital marketing. It should be noted that competent marketing is the key to success for every organization.According to the U.S. IT research firm — Gartner Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) — companies spent nearly 12% of revenues for marketing in 2016, of which spending on web, digital commerce and digital advertising were the top three categories of marketing. The report also suggests that 65% of the companies are planning to increase their 2017 digital marketing spending.Our TakeConsidering the growing need for digital marketing, we anticipate Accenture’s investment in digital marketing capabilities to be conducive to long-term growth. The company, in 2009, formed Accenture Interactive to tap the growing prospects in digital marketing space. Its Interactive platform is specialized in providing consulting, technology and analytics services to chief marketing officers (CMOs).The frequent acquisitions help the company in effectively competing with other digital marketing service providers, such as International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report), Dell and Deloitte.Going ahead, the company has applied similar approach for enhancing its capabilities in implementing Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report)-based software solutions. Accenture has acquired seven businesses in this space.We believe the strategy will significantly contribute to the company's revenue stream over the long-run.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

692,ACN,"Robert Half International Inc. (RHI  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high of $51.50 on Oct 2, eventually closing at $51.16. We believe that the company’s software upgrading initiatives and growth prospects in the temporary staffing arena has aided the stock to gain new highs.Evidently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased 5% in the past three months surpassing the industry’s growth of 1.1%.Let’s delve into some of the aspects that have been impacting the company’s performance lately.Technology & Software Investments Robert Half has been heavily investing in technology infrastructure and implementing improved software systems. A major portion of its capital expenditures are being allocated toward improving software systems. Such initiatives will ensure the company’s future growth prospects. Major software initiatives include upgrades to enterprise resource planning applications and the implementation of a global, cloud-based customer relationship management application.  Growth Prospects in Temporary Staffing Hiring cycle in the United States remains lengthy as employers take more time for hiring decisions, which is negatively affecting Robert Half’s profits. Nevertheless, Robert Half remains hopeful regarding improvements in the hiring activity in the United States as companies are increasingly using temporary and consulting professionals as part of their human resource mix. Also, the 2017 Salary Guides by Robert Half shows rising demand for skilled professionals across a range of occupations in the United States. This would aid in increasing the demand for professional staffing service providers, thus widening revenue opportunities for Robert Half.Bottom Line Though delay in hiring process and weakness in Protiviti segment due to declining margins and fewer high-margin clients have dented the company’s overall profitability, the company’s ongoing technology and software upgrading initiatives are expected to improve the performance of its segments. Thereby, we believe the company will be able to take advantage of the rising demand for professional staffing services internationally, going ahead.Further, Robert Half carries a VGM Score of A, indicating its underlying strength. It is also observed that some of the key financial ratios of the company are higher than the industry levels, as depicted in the figure below.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable at 69 cents over the past one month, ahead of the upcoming third-quarter results. The same also lies within the management’s guidance of 66-72 cents.Looking For More? Check These Three Picks Investors may also consider better-ranked stocks from the same sector such as Atento S.A.

693,ACN,"Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 22. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this memory chip maker will be able to continue its upbeat performance in the quarter or not.Notably, Micron has delivered positive earnings surprises for nine straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 10.2%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model conclusively shows that Micron is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has higher chances of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Micron currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.26%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second-quarter’s earnings is pegged at $2.76, which is 206.7% higher than the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 90 cents. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $7.23 billion, up 55.5% from the prior-year quarter tally.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteLet’s see what’s driving this overwhelming expectation.Higher Demand & Pricing for DRAM to Drive RevenuesThe main reason behind the optimism surrounding the stock is improved prices for DRAM. Increased pricing is mainly driven by better product-mix optimization, and higher-than-anticipated demand for PCs, servers and mobiles.Notably, DRAM generates majority of the company’s revenues, and in first-quarter fiscal 2018 it contributed approximately 67%. The company witnessed a year-over-year surge of a whopping 88% in DRAM revenues in the last reported quarter.Smartphone makers and cloud data-center operators will be the key growth drivers for DRAM chips. As per data compiled by DRAMeXchange, smartphones witnessed an increase of 33.4% in DRAM content in 2017, to an average of 3.2 GB per device. As smartphone original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) plan to roll out devices with higher capacity, and more demanding applications like AR and AI, demand for DRAM is likely to grow much faster.Furthermore, server DRAM demand is anticipated to remain strong as cloud data-center customers seek innovative solutions to reduce workload. The high-density modules based on advanced manufacturing nodes have come to the market, urging server OEMs to overhaul and shift to new technology for better results. This is likely to drive Micron’s top- and bottom-line results in the to-be-reported quarter.NAND Revenue Growth to ModerateLast fiscal, the company witnessed impressive growth in NAND revenues due to the huge demand-supply gap which hugely escalated chip prices. However, we expect the segment’s growth rate to be moderate this quarter as the supply-demand gap has narrowed down significantly, according to various research firms, which is affecting the chip prices adversely.Notably, in the fiscal first quarter, Micron witnessed a mid-single-digit rise in bit shipments, while average selling price (ASP) declined in the low-single-digit range. Therefore, looking at the current scenario, we believe decline in ASP will negatively impact the company’s NAND revenues and margins, and somewhat offset the benefits from improved demand and prices for DRAM products.Some Other Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Red Hat, Inc. (RHT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.24% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Paychex Inc.

696,ACN,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Booz Allen Hamilton Holding (BAH  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 11.6% over the past month. BAH hit a new 52-week high of $44.17 in the previous session. Booz Allen Hamilton has gained 15.5% since the start of the year compared to the 8.5% move for the Business Services sector and the 4.8% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 29, 2018, Booz Allen Hamilton reported EPS of $0.52 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.45 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 2.5%.Valuation MetricsWhile BAH has moved to its 52-week high in the recent past, investors need to be asking, what is next for the company? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Booz Allen Hamilton Holding has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 18X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.6X versus its peer group's average of 14.9X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.74. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation Price and Consensus  Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation Price and Consensus | Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Booz Allen Hamilton Holding meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though BAH shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Booz Allen Hamilton Holding have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Dun & Bradstreet (DNB  -  Free Report), Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report), and FleetCor Technologies (FLT  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 17% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for BAH, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

697,ACN,"Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) is one of world’s leading providers of management consultancy, technology and outsourcing services. The company is steadily gaining traction in its outsourcing business primarily backed by a rise in demand for technology to improve operating efficiencies and save costs.Furthermore, considering the growing need for digital marketing, we commend Accenture’s efforts to enhance its digital marketing capabilities through acquisitions which should positively impact second-quarter results.However, increasing competition from Cognizant Technology Solutions and International Business may temper its growth prospects to some extent. Additionally, Accenture’s plan of creating 15K new jobs in the U.S. by 2020 and investment of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results in our opinion.Accenture has a decent history when it comes to recent earnings reports as the stock has beaten estimates in all the last four quarters, making for an average positive surprise of approximately 3%.

698,ACN,"Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report), a leading business service provider, is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Mar 22. The company is likely to report higher revenues from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment, accounting for lion’s share of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.This, in turn, is likely to result in higher earnings for the quarter.Top-Line ExpansionCintas recorded industry-leading revenue growth over the past few quarters, with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand the company's portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Moreover, the successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has more than 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The combined company is expected to cater to more than one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment revenues is pegged at $1,279 million, up from $993.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Total quarterly revenues are expected to be $1,568 million, up from $1,281 million reported in the year-earlier period.Other Key FactorsHowever, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn, is likely to impact its financial results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 0.00%, as both are pegged at $1.24. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Cintas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cintas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cintas Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Cintas has a Zacks Rank #2. Although this increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need a positive ESP to make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and a Zacks Rank #3.

701,ACN,"Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report) is fast gaining traction in blockchain technology. The company has made impressive progress in recent times through its deal with Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) and the launch of Coco Framework for making blockchain-based systems faster and secure.Microsoft is now bringing the technology mainstream for the financial industry. The company is reportedly collaborating with an Israeli lender, Bank Hapoalim for blockchain technology based digital bank guarantees.Bank guarantees are a declaration of assurance from a bank that a debtor’s liabilities will be met if an obligation is not fulfilled. Notably, this combination of blockchain with bank guarantee will be the first of its kind in the Israel banking sector. This application, once deployed, will not require clients to visit the bank physically. The documentation process will be less time consuming and secure.Microsoft’s Azure will be used for the service delivery, which is anticipated to bode well for further penetration of the cloud platform. We believe that increased adoption of the company’s new technologies coupled with growth of Azure will help the stock rebound going forward.Shares of Microsoft have gained 21.1% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 27% rally.Blockchain Players: IBM and MicrosoftBlockchain technology has been in the industry since the commencement of cryptocurrency transaction. The technology, which was previously just related to bitcoins, has become popular due to the fact that it cannot be breached. The technology ensures unadulterated data storage and transfer via a shared database or ledger and aims at putting a check on cybercrime related losses.Per MarketsandMarkets, the blockchain market is estimated to reach $2.31 billion by 2021 from $210.2 million in 2016 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61.5%.Microsoft Corporation Revenue (TTM) Microsoft Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Microsoft Corporation QuoteThe blockchain market is currently dominated by International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report). Like Microsoft, the company has bank guarantee deals with Westpac and ANZ. IBM has also partnered with American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) and Standard Chartered PLC for a multinational insurance policy using the technology.Notably, Microsoft’s blockchain technology is based on Ethereum, developed by the Ethereum Foundation while IBM supports Hyperledger. The difference from consumer point of view is that Microsoft is not a member of the Ethereum Foundation while IBM is a key member of the committee behind Hyperledger. Thus, IBM will play a role in any change of the respective infrastructure but Microsoft will not be notified of any in advance.However, the advancements that Microsoft has already made in the field are testament to the fact that it has gained the confidence of a large part of blockchain customers, and this recent deal with Bank Hapoalim is anticipated to boost the company’s top line in the near term.Zacks RankMicrosoft currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

702,ACN,"In an effort to expand its agency business, global consulting giant Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently announced entering into exclusive negations to buy Altima — a digital commerce agency specialized in customer experience design. The deal is subject to customary closing conditions and needs ‘prior consultation with the relevant works councils’. As usual, Accenture has kept financial details of the transaction under wraps.Headquartered in France and founded in 1997, Altima helps its clients transform their businesses through its expertise in designing e-commerce, and providing mobile and in-store customer experiences, and related strategies. Approximately 370 people are currently working at its offices in France, China, Canada and the United States.Once the transaction materializes, Altima will join the Accenture Interactive platform, part of the company's digital marketing-services arm — Accenture Digital. Accenture Interactive was formed in 2009 to deliver superior consulting, technology and analytics services to chief marketing officers (CMOs).The key point behind this transaction is that with this acquisition, Accenture will be able to better help its Interactive clients in expanding their businesses in France, China, Canada and the United States. The integration of Altima’s expertise will enhance Accenture’s Interactive capabilities and help it provide end-to-end digital marketing services, which will bring a deeper and broader set of digital solutions to its clients.Accenture has outperformed the S&P 500 in the year-to-date period. The stock has returned 18.4% in the said period, while the index returned 14.2%.Since the formation of Accenture Interactive, the company has made significant acquisitions to enhance its digital marketing capabilities. Altima will be its 18th buyout in the last five years.We believe the company’s strategy of enhancing Accenture’s Interactive capabilities bodes well for future growth which can be better justified with Gartner Inc.’s (IT  -  Free Report) data on digital marketing spending.According to the U.S. IT research firm, companies have spent nearly 12% of revenues for marketing in 2016, of which spending on web, digital commerce and digital advertising were the top three categories of marketing. The report also suggests that 65% of the companies are planning to increase their 2017 digital marketing spending.Considering the growing need for digital marketing, we anticipate Accenture’s investment in digital marketing capabilities to be conducive to long-term growth. It will also help the company in effectively competing with other digital marketing service providers, such as International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report), Dell and Deloitte.Currently, Accenture holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Another top-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), which has an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 10%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

Net income for the reported quarter was $286.9 million or $1.13 per share compared with $278.2 million or $1.06 per share in the year-ago quarter.

704,ACN,"On Oct 10, we issued an updated research report on management services provider, Navigant Consulting Inc. (NCI  -  Free Report).Growth DriversOpportunities associated with healthcare reform continue to drive demand for Navigant as the industry seeks to improve profitability and address increasing regulatory pressures for compliance. Demand for data analytics in healthcare across all markets is also growing as the Affordable Care Act and new technologies have given access to new data. The company is presently developing data analytic tools across multiple groups to meet the growing demand for technology-enabled solutions that can help clients address many market challenges.Management is also taking steps to restructure the business in order to better align capacity with demand. Utilizing its strong cash flow generation capacity, the company continues to return capital to its shareholders while investing heavily in technology, new capabilities and client channels. At the same time, Navigant is focusing on corporate development efforts to build a robust pipeline of investment opportunities, which is in line with its growth strategy.Also, the company aims to expand through solid inorganic strategies. Navigant acquired Cymetrix Corporation, a revenue cycle management firm. The firm is expected to add significant depth to Navigant’s subsidiary Alleviant, LLC, which presently provides physician revenue cycle outsourcing services. The acquisition of RevenueMed will further strengthen its position as the leading provider of end-to-end revenue cycle management services and expand its platform to include global offshore capabilities 24 hours a day.HeadwindsNavigant has underperformed the industry with an average year-to-date decline of 35.3% as against a gain of 15.4% for the latter. The company operates in a highly labor-intensive sector. Ideally, the sector should employ a skilled workforce to keep up with the evolving business environment. However, as skilled workers are always in high demand, there remains a possibility of high attrition rate within the sector.On the other hand, training of unskilled workers increases operational costs, thereby affecting margins. The business service sector is highly fragmented with no single service provider possessing dominant market share to rule the industry. Hence, Navigant faces stiff competition from a number of peers while acquiring and maintaining clients for its different business segments, which could further reduce its profitability.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report), Stantec Inc. (STN  -  Free Report) and S&P Global Inc. (SPGI  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

705,ACN,"On Sep 11, we updated the research report on business services provider, ABM Industries Incorporated (ABM  -  Free Report).ABM has developed a platform to deliver an end-to-end service model to its clients by realigning its operational structure to an on-site, mobile and on-demand market- based structure. This realignment has improved its long-term growth prospects and provides higher margin opportunities by enabling it to better deliver end-to-end services to its clients across urban, suburban and rural areas. The company further expects to extend its global footprint and strengthen its position in existing markets through both inorganic and organic growth across the industry verticals.ABM recently completed the acquisition of GCA Services Group for approximately $1.3 billion. Founded in 2003, GCA Services is a leading national provider of quality facility services. It is a collaboration of various regional companies. GCA Services derives majority of its revenues from the education sector and aims to grow further as more school districts outsource their facility management to invest in teachers and equipment.The deal is likely to expand ABM’s foothold in the educational and commercial markets. In addition, the strategic transaction is expected to add approximately $1.1 billion in annual revenues and improve adjusted EBITDA by approximately $100 million. The acquisition is in sync with the core principles of the 2020 Vision and is likely to complement ABM’s industry-focused, client-centric organizational structure, yielding cost synergies of approximately $20 million to $30 million by the second full year of ownership.The 2020 Vision plan of the company outlines its vision for the next five years. The plan hinges on three primary phases, the first of which is aimed to increase the efficiency of the company through diligent execution of the operating plan and stringent cost-reduction activities. The second phase will focus on driving growth across the realigned verticals through effective realization of the cost savings from procurement, account management and other organizational changes. The final phase of the transformation will include accelerated growth impetus from the vertical alignment and account planning systems with a continuous focus on additional cost savings. ABM is currently focusing on the second phase of the plan and remains confident of achieving $40-$50 million in savings through operational efficiencies by the end of 2017.ABM has a healthy pipeline of future businesses with strength seen particularly in its government business. The company’s comprehensive, strategic and transformative initiatives are focused on driving sustainable profitability by effectively allocating resources to higher margin services and business verticals with a strong competitive edge. Management also reiterated that corporate restructuring initiatives are well on track to yield sustained long-term growth.However, ABM has underperformed the industry with an average year-to-date decline of 1.6% as against a gain of 15.8% for the latter. ABM has a significant presence in the U.K. and as the European economy is highly unpredictable post the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and reduce costs. The company is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering the productivity of the company. Strong competitive pressures could also limit the company’s success rate in bidding for profitable businesses and its ability to increase prices in accordance with the rising costs.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the long-term growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

The year-over-year decrease in adjusted earnings, despite top-line growth, was primarily attributable to the termination of a contract within the Aviation segment.

Organic growth (excluding the Government Services business) improved 2.3% year over year while acquisitions contributed $8.7 million of incremental revenues during the quarter. The organic growth in the Aviation segment was driven by higher passenger services, cabin cleaning, parking, catering and transportation services for new and existing customers. The organic growth in the Business & Industry segment was led by higher janitorial and facility services revenues in the U.S. and U.K. operations. Quarterly revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,317 million.Operating profit improved to $22.6 million from $18.5 million in the year-ago period, owing to higher revenue contribution and organizational savings due to the Vision 2020 plan. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) for the reported quarter decreased to $57.3 million from $61.1 million in the year-earlier quarter for respective margins of 4.3% and 4.7% owing to an additional working day during the quarter.AcquisitionSubsequent to the quarter end, ABM completed the acquisition of GCA Services Group for approximately $1.3 billion.

707,ACN,"In sync with its strategy of growing through acquisitions, Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire IBB Consulting — a strategy consulting firm. However, financial terms of the deal remain undisclosed.About IBB ConsultingFounded in 2001, IBB Consulting helps organizations across communications, media and technology develop market strategies. The company, with approximately 160 highly-skilled professionals, as well as immense experience in business planning, strategy, technology and execution, assists organizations in successfully executing business operations, develop business models, and create new products and services.It operates in North America and Australia, though the majority of its professionals work in North America. The Philadelphia-based strategy consulting firm served big companies like Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report).How Will Accenture Benefit from IBB Buyout? Accenture intends to integrate IBB Consulting’s business into its Accenture Strategy division. The target company’s employees will join the integrating division upon successful completion of the acquisition.With this acquisition, Accenture will not only get a large talent pool, but will also gain a huge customer base as well. This acquisition will also strengthen Accenture’s presence in the communication, media and technology (CMT) consulting market, as well as help gain higher market share.Per the company, the above discussed buyout is likely to enhance Accenture’s “ability to deliver deep, industry-specific strategies for our clients by helping them define and deliver a new breed of capabilities that drive competitiveness, reduce costs, leverage emerging technologies and expand operational excellence to put them atop the intersection of business, technology and operations.”The demand for network technology is on the rise as telecom companies have accelerated the deployment of 5G networks and cable operators, moving into the wireless space. Furthermore, media companies are making digital transformation in their internal operations, as well as bringing in technologically advanced new products. Here the buyout of IBB Consulting will help Accenture in advising its clients as the former has expertise in both these areas.Accenture stock has gained 12% year to date, substantially outperforming the 10.7% growth in the industry it belongs to.Acquisitions – Key Growth StrategyAccenture pursues strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and expand operating markets. So far in 2017, the company has either completed or signed over 15 acquisition deals across various business segments, including Altitude, Genfour, SinnerSchrader and New Energy Group.  Last year, it completed or signed about 12 acquisition deals across various business segments, such as IT security, CRM capabilities and strategy consulting. In 2015, it closed 21 takeovers.These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to set foot in newer markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, and maintain a leading position in the market as well. A strong cash balance of $3.38 billion and an operating cash flow of $1.79 billion at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2017 are anticipated to support Accenture’s inorganic growth strategy.Bottom LineAccenture’s long-term prospects look promising due to its sustained focus on innovative product roll outs, consistent investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, and major acquisitions. Moreover, we believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the company's revenue stream.Additionally, the company is focusing on building partnerships which is helping it in foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden the product portfolio. Most recently, Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Accenture joined forces to create a mixed team of designers, programmers, and other Apple experts, within Accenture Digital Studios units in select locations around the world.Currently, Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

But your voice assistant needs to go through a ton of data to get really good at assisting, which is the main reason that Amazon and Microsoft are getting together.Amazon’s Alexa is the dominant voice assistant in the home, with its Echo devices offering 20,000 plus “skills” (services) including ordering things on Amazon and elsewhere, turning out the lights and so on. It is also housed in a growing number of smart home devices. But unlike the Google Assistant-powered Home device or Apple Siri-powered Homepod, it can’t sync the home and work lives because it doesn’t have access to work devices. Microsoft’s Cortana is similarly handicapped, with access to work lives (through 500 million+ Windows 10 devices offering access to email, work calendar, etc) but no access to home lives.So later this year, once the integration is complete, you can tell your device “Alexa open Cortana” or “Cortana open Alexa,” for immediate access to all the services provided by the other. It’s important to note that the two assistants aren’t being molded into one, but just using data from the other for training purposes.Apple Extends Enterprise Reach with Accenture DealApple has been creeping up on the enterprise through partnerships and the one it announced with Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) last week, builds on earlier deals with IBM, SAP, Deloitte and Cisco. The companies will focus on banking and retail verticals for now through an Accenture dedicated practice for iOS. The group, which will include developers and other experts from both Apple and Accenture, will have offices spread across the world and will focus on modernizing Accenture’s customers’ operations through iOS devices and services.The deal, according to Apple, is built on a growing trend within enterprises to create internal iOS developer teams that optimize business operations for iOS devices. So the apps developed by the partnership will mostly be for internal use by enterprises to manage and maintain a growing fleet of Apple devices.This is a good deal for enterprises because Apple devices are generally more secure, run the same version of OS, have an uncomplicated backup system in the iCloud and also run software from Microsoft and other competitors when required.All this will help Apple sell more devices and services and Accenture service its clients better by migrating legacy workloads to Apple’s leading edge technology.Walmart Tapping NVIDIA in Cloud PushWalmart is one company with faith in NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) GPUs. According to Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research, the company will be greatly increasing NVIDIA GPU clusters over the next six months in preparation for an entry into the deep neural network space. What this means is that Walmart intends to develop artificial intelligence of its own based on the data it collects from its own customers. The whole thing will happen in the Walmart Cloud, the cloud computing network called OneOps that it acquired back in 2013 and on which it currently hosts most of its own infrastructure. He adds that Walmart’s NVDA GPU Farm will be a tenth of the size of the AWS GPU Cloud, which is pretty big for starters. There were also some other details about its running Ubuntu Linux and not Red Hat Linux to create a hybrid of Convolution Neural and Recurrent Neural Networks.Walmart said earlier this year that it was getting ready to completely move away from AWS, which makes perfect sense given the way Amazon has taken share from traditional retailers. Target is also following suit. TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL+2.62%+17.35%FB+3.43%+26.10%GOOGL+2.31%+12.03%MSFT+1.54%+15.11%INTC+1.19%-3.89%CSCO+2.74%-5.71%AMZN+3.49%+15.26% Other storiesCorporateApple Bidding for Toshiba Chip Unit: In another twist, Toshiba said that it couldn’t come to a decision about a favored buyer of its stake in Toshiba Memory, its JV with Western Digital. One of the bidders is a Bain Capital-led group, which has come back to the bidding process after replacing government backed investment firms with Apple.The government investors wanted Toshiba to settle things with WDC (which says its JV rights are violated by a sale to any party, in this case its competitors, without its consent) before they invested. Since WDC has taken the matter to court and Toshiba needs the deal approved by March in order to avoid getting delisted, this was a no go. With Apple as one of the investors and the government groups ready to invest after the case is settled with WDC, this becomes a viable alternative to the WDC-led offer.The Honhai-led group (the only other bidder) is unlikely to be chosen since the Japanese government is unlikely to approve a deal in favor of Chinese ownership. So what it boils down to is a Bain Capital-led group, which also includes Toshiba customer Apple and WDC rival Hynix on the one hand and a WDC-led group on the other. WDC spent over $15 billion to acquire a 50% stake in the JV and this will be money down the drain if processing secrets are lost to competitors. So WDC needs to win the bid.  Apple Speaks on Net Neutrality: Apple has finally taken a stand on net neutrality. In a letter to the FCC on the last day comments were accepted, Apple said that net neutrality facilitated consumer choice, transparency, competition, investment and innovation, while a ban on paid fast lanes was essential to ensure that carriers like AT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon couldn’t give preferential treatment to their own services or those from providers willing to pay them (fast lanes).In 2015, the FCC decided to tighten regulatory control over Internet service providers by reclassifying them as common carriers, which effectively characterized them as utilities. But President Trump-appointed FCC chairman Ajit Pai would like to repeal that reclassification, something that will make net neutrality difficult to enforce.As a reminder: the opposite view is that customers like Netflix, Google and increasingly, Apple, who use the network much more than others should share the cost of upgrading the network, in the absence of which network innovation will be throttled. This argument doesn’t really hold up since Google’s efforts at gigabit Internet have stepped up competition in the space and pushed carriers to upgrade. Google’s Assistant Gets New Boss: 21-year old Michael Sayman, who joined Facebook as a teenager and was given a full-fledged engineering job after he turned 18, just jumped ship to Google. At Google, he will be product manager for Assistant. Google’s Assistant is pitted against Amazon’s Alexa, which has the lion’s share (more than 70%) of the market.Google, which accounts for most of the rest of the market, needs some magic to take share from the market leader as well as growing competition from Apple’s Siri. Sayman, who taught himself to code from Google tutorial videos wrote, “On a personal level, I also see the Assistant as an opportunity for Google to lower the barrier of entry for kids/teens of all ages and backgrounds, to learn how to program -- and encourage them to explore the world of computer science in ways that were once considered impossible.”Samsung Self-Driving Car Permit: Samsung is the latest in a long list of automotive and technology companies that have applied for and received permits to test self-driving technology. Samsung already has a permit to test its technology in Korea and it already has an agreement with Hyundai, under which it equips some Hyundai cars with sensors and AI-powered modules. The company doesn’t intend to manufacture self-driving cars, so in all probability it wil go the same route as Alphabet and Apple.New Products/TechnologyFacebook Reality Show: Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) recently-launched and expanding Watch video tab now has a new reality series called “Ball in the Family,” which will feature LaVar Ball and his family, including his son, Los Angeles Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball. The Ball family has captured headlines because of the senior Ball’s dramatic promotion of his son. The series will however involve more than just the game; family and relationships will be showcased as well. Nest Tries Lower Pricing: Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Nest has introduced the Nest Thermostat E (for energy, everyone, easy, etc according to the marketing folks) for $169, $81 off the earlier version. This one uses polycarbonate instead of aluminum, is small and white-grey, doesn’t tell you the time and weather and is designed for invisibility. Other than these things and the fact that it also doesn’t offer some input details, it functions pretty much like its more conspicuous cousin, regulating the temperature in your home, allowing manual temperature setting, responding to your commands from pretty much anywhere and helping to control your smart home.  New Fitbit Smartwatch: Fitbit’s purchase of smartwatch makers Pebble and Vector may finally be paying off. Last week, the company launched its Ionic smartwatch for the fitness-conscious that at $300 is expected to offer some real competition to Apple, Samsung and others. With four days of battery life, improved sensors for more health insight (such as tracking sleep apnea), superior heart rate tracking during exercise and at other times, a better OS pairing with iOS, Android and Windows devices so you don’t need your phone while on a run, the ability to store up to 2.5GB worth of songs including Pandora stations for offline listening, the ability to pay with Fitbit Pay (using technology from its Coin acquisition) and water resistance up to 50 meters plus laps tracking to help swimmers calculate calories burnt in the pool. It’s also offering swappable bands so you to suit your mood or the occasion.Google Assistant Gets Inside More Devices: Soon after Google announced that its AI-powered voice controlled Assistant would be inside third-party devices, Sony, LG and some other companies announced that new speakers and to-be-launched fridges and washing machines that would incorporate the Assistant. The data sharing arrangement between the partners isn’t clear yet and is likely to vary on a case by case basis. Sony for instance might be interested in data sharing since it’s also entering the smart home controller market. But LG might not, if it intends to merely integrate Assistant with its electronic appliances.  Collaborations and M&AApple-Tencent In China: In recognition of the Chinese brand’s growing position in China, Apple will now accept WeChat Pay in its mainland China App and Music Stores provided the phone is running on iOS 10 or 11. Since Alibaba is the market leader, it already accepts AliPay. But it doesn’t look like Apple is making significant headway in the huge mobile payments market currently dominated by the two Chinese players. Apple’s wallet for instance accounts for a mere 1% of in-store payments, according to Business Insider.  Microsoft-Valve Deal: Microsoft has announced that its hardware partners will be selling $300 VR headsets to be used with Windows 10 PCs. It hopes these devices to do very well in the market and has entered into a partnership with the popular Steam gamestore owner Vive that will allow Steam apps and games to run on the devices. Microsoft is also working on “Halo”-based content and ensuring that lower-end computers with integrated graphics hardware can also be used with these headsets.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

(IBM  -  Free Report), and an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent.Accenture currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock worth considering includes Applied Materials, Inc.

712,ACN,"Accenture PLC (ACN  -  Free Report) recently announced that a consortium consisting of AB InBev, APL, Kuehne + Nagel and an anonymous European customs organization examined and approved its blockchain technology aimed at addressing global shipping issues.The pilot project marked an effort to transition to a process where data could be shared securely through blockchain instead of physical documents, thus leading to cost savings for the industry.Per the press release, “The solution can speed up the entire flow of transport documents, reduce the requirement for data entry by up to 80 percent, simplify data amendments across the shipping process, streamline the checks required for cargo and reduce the burden and risk of penalties for customs compliance levied on customers.”Accenture PLC Price Accenture PLC Price | Accenture PLC Quote The secured storage and transmission of data through a decentralized database is the most attractive feature of the blockchain technology. Originally used for cryptocurrency transactions, the system is transparent and incorruptible and is meant to provide unaltered information.Since blockchain uses a distributed consensus, tampering with its records without being noticed by an entire network is difficult. This makes the system extremely safe. With minimum chances of double counting and hacking, the possibility of monetary losses is low.Driven by multi-industrial adoption, the technology has rapidly gained traction over the last few years. The solutions offered by other key players in this domain like International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) have been adopted by the insurance, banking, food supply and automobile industries among others.Blockchain in LogisticsOf late, this technology is being used in the shipping and freight industry. In November 2017, United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) announced that it has joined Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA) in an attempt to form regulatory blockchain standards for logistics.In January 2018, IBM entered into a blockchain deal with A.P. Moller-Maersk, a prominent container shipping firm. The partnership is intended to deliver a secure and efficient industry-wide trading platform that will lead to more transparency and simplicity in tracking shipments across borders and trading zones.These initiatives indicate that blockchain technology might turn out to be crucial for the logistics industry going ahead.Accenture in BlockchainNotably, Accenture’s blockchain initiatives are backed by its motto of “Blockchain needs to adapt to an imperfect world”.Considering regulatory changes and human errors among other issues, Accenture is providing “Editable Blockchain” and has also been awarded with a patent for the same last year.Also, the company is a member of both Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and the Hyperledger committee, which provide the underlying technology for commonly used commercial blockchain systems. While Hyperledger is an open source global collaboration hosted by the Linux Foundation, Ethereum has been developed by a Swiss non-profit called Ethereum Foundation. This is an additional advantage for the company in comparison to Microsoft and IBM.Accenture has inked several blockchain deals in the past year. In June 2017, Accenture inked a deal with Microsoft to create digital ID databases for more than 1.1 billion people globally. Its other collaborations include Digital Asset, R2 and Ripple.  Most recently, the company announced that it is developing a blockchain prototype along with DHL to track pharmaceuticals throughout the supply chain. This will be a huge step against tampering of drugs.Accenture is expected to make the most of blockchain opportunity. The technology is projected to reach $7.6 billion by 2022 from $411.5 million in 2017 at a CAGR of 79.6%, per data from MarketsandMarkets.Accenture currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

713,ACN,"Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) has been investors’ favorite for quite some time as evident from its price momentum. The stock has soared 57.6% over the past year, substantially outperforming the 8.7% gain of the industry it belongs to. Let’s delve deeper and take a look at the key aspects, aiding the company’s performance.The stock has a stellar record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 21.2%.In the last quarterly results, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of 79 cents per share (excluding acquisition and amortization related expenses), surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents. Also, quarterly earnings increased over two-fold on a year-over-year basis.A higher level of event-driven activities resulted in a 13.5% year-over-year increase of revenues to $1.013 billion, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $954 million. Notably, the company’s fee revenues soared a whopping 227% to $97 million during the quarter, primarily due to higher proxy contest and mutual-fund proxy activities.Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. Quote The company generates recurring revenues and a good percentage of its business comes from recurring fees, which include contributions from the Net New Business and acquisitions related synergies. We believe, higher recurring revenues, internal growth, the contribution from Net New Business, increased distribution revenues and acquisition-related synergies are also being the top-line drivers for the company.Notably, Broadridge also positively revised its fiscal 2018 outlook. The company now projects revenue growth to be 2-4% compared with the earlier guidance of 2-3%. Adjusted earnings are now projected to surge 27-31%, up from the previous expectation of 15-19%. Management also raised free cash flow guidance range to $500-$550 million from $400-$450 million.The rise in the guidance keeps us optimistic about the near-term results. We are also positive about the company’s product launches, share repurchase programs and dividend-paying initiatives. Moreover, its business relations with the likes of Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) and Amazon Web Services are looking promising for the long term.Also, Broadridge has a Growth Style Score of A, which indicates that the stock is more suitable for growth investors. The stock has a long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 10% and sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Keeping these positives in mind, we believe that Broadridge is one such stock that deserves a place in investors’ portfolio.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Paycom Software, Inc.

714,ACN,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently announced its plan of opening an innovation hub in Zurich, Switzerland. Accenture defines its innovation hub as a place where clients can “work side-by-side” with the company’s professionals “to ideate, rapidly prototype and launch solutions”, in order to meet the requirements of the fast-evolving digital world.Innovation hub is an integral part of Accenture Innovation Architecture which brings in “together capabilities – from research, ventures and labs to studios, innovation centers and delivery centers – to develop and deliver disruptive innovations for clients, and to scale them faster.”The Zurich innovation hub will house all the five key elements — Accenture Studios, Accenture Interactive Studio, Fjord Studio, Liquid Studio and Accenture Extended Reality.

Earlier this January, the company opened two innovation hubs — one in Tokyo, Japan, and the other in Boston, the United States.This strategy will help Accenture have more offices near client headquarters. We believe with these footprint-expansion moves, the company will be able to help clients create, manage, integrate and analyze value-focused solutions, thereby reducing cost and giving clients increased response to change.The company’s long-term prospects look promising, driven by continued focus on innovative product roll outs, continued investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, along with major acquisitions. In addition, we believe regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the company’s revenue stream.Accenture’s shares have appreciated 28.7% in a year’s time, outperforming 17.7% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Currently, Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.

716,ACN,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein non-GAAP earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues fell short of the same. However, on a year-over-year basis, both marked a robust improvement mainly driven by the merger of the Computer Sciences Corporation and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report).Notably, in 2016 Hewlett Packard Enterprise entered into a spin-off-merger agreement with Computer Sciences Corporation, wherein it agreed to spin-off its Enterprise Services division and merge the same with the latter’s businesses. The transaction closed on Apr 1, 2017, and the new entity was named DXC Technology.Coming back to the fiscal third-quarter results, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of $2.15 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99 and also increased on a year-over-year basis.DXC Technology Company. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise DXC Technology Company. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DXC Technology Company. QuoteQuarter DetailsRevenues in the quarter soared a whopping 222.7% from the year-ago period to $6.186 billion. However, excluding the impact of purchase price accounting and last year’s one-time contract reset United States Public Sector (USPS), revenues were down 4%. On a constant-currency basis, revenues fell 5.9% year over year. DXC Technology’s revenues also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.228 billion.Segment wise, revenues from Global Business Services (GBS) surged a massive 121.3% on a year-over-year basis to $2.315 billion. Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, on constant currency basis, revenues decreased 6.6% year over year. The decline was primarily due to weak performance of traditional application services which was partially offset by growth at Enterprise Applications and Business Process Services businesses. Revenues from the new business for GBS came in at $3.3 billion during the reported quarter.Global Infrastructure Services (GIS) revenues during the fiscal third quarter came in at $3.145 billion as compared with $871 million reported in the year-ago quarter. On constant currency basis, revenues dropped 6.8% year over year (excluding the impact of purchase price accounting), primarily due to decline in traditional infrastructure services. Revenues from new business for GIS awards came in at $2.2 billion during the quarter.USPS revenues came in at $726 million during the quarter, however were down 11.9% year over year (excluding the impact of purchase price accounting). Revenues from new business for USPS awards came in at $527 million in the quarter.The company’s adjusted operating income from continuing operations (excluding one-time items) amounted to $927 million as compared with $626 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating margin came in at 15% as compared with 9.5% reported in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted net income from continuing operations came in at $622 million during the quarter as compared with $416 million reported in the year-earlier period.The company exited the quarter with $2.926 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared with $2.671 billion in the previous quarter.

Adjusted free cash flow for the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 came in at $1.870 billion. During this period, the company returned $189 million to shareholders through share buyback and dividend payments.Updated Fiscal 2018 OutlookThe company reaffirmed fiscal 2018 revenues guidance but increased its outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share. For fiscal 2018, DXC Technology projects its revenues in the range of $24-$24.5 billion in constant currency. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $24.32 billion.However, the non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range has been raised to $7.50-$8.00 from $7.25-$7.75 anticipated earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $7.52 per share.Bottom LineThe company’s upbeat guidance for earnings makes us optimistic about its near-term performance.Post merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. This alliance has combined Computer Sciences’ strength in insurance, healthcare, and financial services with HPE’s expertise in industries like transportation, pharma, technology, media and telecom.Following the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology might be seen making strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio, which is likely to drive growth over the long run. Further, the company is projected to generate cost synergies worth $1.1 billion during the first year and record a run rate of $1.6 billion at the end of the same.Currently, DXC Technology has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is GTT Communications, Inc.

As described by Accenture, an innovation hub is a place where its clients “can work side-by-side” with the company’s professionals “to ideate, rapidly prototype and launch solutions”, in order to meet the requirements of the fast-changing digital world.The center, which will be located at Technology Square’s Centergy building, is likely to open its doors next summer. Accenture already occupies 33,000 square feet of area in this building and with this new development, it will add another 44,000 square feet, making it the largest tenant. Accenture operate several offices and currently employs about 2,800 professionals in the city.Atlanta has emerged as the best destination for business communities, particularly the tech companies, in the last five-six years due to the availability of relatively less expensive and talented workforce. Apart from Accenture, some other Fortune 500 companies which have offices in Atlanta include General Electric Co. (GE  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report).With the opening of the innovation center, the company will be able to help clients create, manage, integrate and analyze value-focused solutions, thereby giving them “tangible results faster than ever.” Furthermore, the company noted that it intends to create more than 800 jobs over the next three years, across its “Strategy, Consulting, Digital, Technology and Operations” businesses.The recent move is part of its planned strategy of making $1.4-billion technology and training investment in the United States. Under the planned investment strategy, the company will open 10 innovation hubs and create 15,000 new jobs in the country by 2020. The recently announced innovation center will be Accenture’s second facility under the investment strategy, while the company already opened the first center this February in Houston.The Accenture stock has returned 17.9% year to date, outperforming 15.7% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Going ahead, the company’s long-term prospects look promising, driven by sustained focus on innovative product roll outs, consistent investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, along with major acquisitions.

718,ACN,"Continuing with its efforts to enhance shareholder value, Synopsys Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) last week announced that it is set to buy back $100 million worth of its common stocks under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. The initiative reflects the California-based company’s sound financial position and favorable prospects.Last Thursday, the company announced an agreement with HSBC in this connection. Per the agreement, Synopsys will initially receive approximately 1.01 million shares, while the remaining shares will be received on or before Nov 20, 2017, depending on the completion of purchase. The number of shares to be repurchased will be calculated on the basis of Synopsys’ volume weighted average share price during the stated period, after adjusting for a discount.Per the company, accelerated share repurchase arrangements are an integral element of its overall framework for enhancing investors’ worth. Since fiscal 2015, the company has completed $605 million worth of ASR program.Apart from the ASR agreements, the company also repurchased its common stock from the open market. In June 2017, Synopsys approved an extension of its existing share repurchase authorization to make it worth $500 million again. So far in fiscal 2017, the company has repurchased $300 million worth of its common stock.Synopsys’ financial strength enables it to continue with its buyback program. As of Jul 31, 2017, the company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.3 billion. Its aggressive share repurchase policies are anticipated to boost investors’ confidence. Synopsys’ strategy to return wealth to shareholders highlights its growth potential and stable liquidity position.Notably, in the year-to-date period, the stock has outperformed the industry to which it belongs to. Synopsys has returned 35.6% during the said time period, while the industry gained 25.5%.Other companies that have a consistent record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments are Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) and Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report).We believe that apart from enhancing shareholders’ return, these initiatives also raise the market value of the stock. Through share repurchases and dividend payouts, companies boost investors’ confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip. Looking ahead, Synopsys remains confident of its growth potential, thereby raising hopes for a further hike in shareholder value through dividend payouts and share buybacks.Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

719,ACN,"Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) is one of world’s leading providers of management consultancy, technology and outsourcing services. The company is steadily gaining traction in its outsourcing business primarily backed by a rise in demand for technology to improve operating efficiencies and save costs.Furthermore, considering the growing need for digital marketing, we commend Accenture’s efforts to enhance its digital marketing capabilities through acquisitions which should positively impact fourth-quarter results.However, increasing competition from Cognizant Technology Solutions and International Business may temper its growth prospects to some extent. Additionally, Accenture’s broad European exposure and a cautious spending environment are likely to have a negative impact on the to-be-reported quarter results. Due to this, investors are eagerly awaiting Accenture’ earnings report in order to set the record straight and to give some guidance on where this company is heading.Accenture’s consensus estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has moved downward in the last 60 days.

720,ACN,"Restaurant chain, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (CBRL  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 numbers on Sep 13, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.98%. In fact, the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 4.63%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayCracker Barrel’s distinctiveness in the restaurants space lies in the fact that apart from serving food, its restaurant establishments also have old-country feel along with unique gift shops.However, after posting 11 consecutive quarters of positive comps, the company’s comps decreased in the fiscal third quarter. The decline was due to the challenging macro environment coupled with higher promotional activity despite marketing programs and additional advertising expenses. In fact, the same is expected to have continued into the to-be-reported quarter as well. For the fiscal year, the company now projects comparable store restaurant sales to be flat to up 0.5% compared with the previous guided range of 0.5% to 1%.Moreover, management notes that Cracker Barrel’s retail business has been under pressure, given the challenges faced by the retail industry, as a whole.Notably, though the company has grown its offerings to target a younger demographic and is focusing on new product assortments, management believes that the fiscal fourth quarter’s comparable retail sales are likely to remain under pressure. Comparable store retail sales are expected to decline roughly 3.5% for the fiscal year, which reflects the company's more cautious expectation for the fiscal fourth quarter.Meanwhile, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might continue to affect traffic.Nevertheless, the company’s focus on improving guest experience, menu innovation, promotional offerings, excellent operations execution are expected to positively impact comps in the quarter.Furthermore, the return of Cracker Barrel’s widely popular Campfire Meals promotion in the fiscal fourth quarter is expected to drive incremental sales.The company expects earnings per share in the fiscal fourth quarter to be in the range of $2.10-$2.20. Additionally, management anticipates Cracker Barrel’s cost saving initiatives, commodity costs favorability and growth of its off-premise business to further drive the quarter’s results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Cracker Barrel this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Cracker Barrel has an Earnings ESP of -1.23%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.15 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.18.

721,ACN,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 28. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.33%. Notably, over the last four quarters, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWe are positive about Accenture’s latest product additions in the analytics application space, given the increasing demand for digital solutions. Moreover, the company’s strategy of growing through acquisitions is encouraging. These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to foray into new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, as well as maintain a leading position. We believe these will have a positive influence on the company’s upcoming quarterly results.Furthermore, the recent forecast for worldwide IT spending by Gartner gave some optimism about Accenture’s near-term performance. The research firm estimates worldwide IT spending to grow 2.4% to $3.48 trillion, marking a solid recovery after two consecutive years of decline.The research firm noted two major catalysts which, it believes, will drive IT spending this year. The first catalyst highlighted by Gartner is decline in the U.S. dollar against several foreign currencies. Secondly, the firm foresees an uptick in digital transformation projects in the near term, which will enable organizations to spend more on IT related infrastructure, products, and services. All these encourage us about the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter overall performance.Nonetheless, Accenture’s February 2017 announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results, in our opinion. The company has already started to work on this space, by opening two innovation centers and hiring people over there.The company is believed to be preparing itself for a more protectionist U.S. technology-visa program under President Trump. It should be noted that out of more than 394,000 of its total workforce, 140,000 are in India, which provides it a cost advantage. With the addition of 15,000 new jobs, Accenture’s total employee count in the United States will increase by 30% to 65,000, thereby increasing its salary expenses significantly.Additionally, heightening competition from peers such as Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH  -  Free Report) and International Business Machines Corporation, as well as an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.46 on $9-billion revenue projection.Accenture PLC Price and EPS Surprise Accenture PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Accenture PLC QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Accenture will likely beat on earnings this quarter.

722,ACN,"Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 26. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 8.7%. Over the last four quarters, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average positive earnings surprise of 23.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderMicron offers both DRAM and NAND products. While DRAM chips are key components in PCs, NAND flash chips are crucial for portable electronic devices. So far, the fiscal 2017 has been marvellous for the company.In the last reported quarter, Micron’s top and bottom lines surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate, as well as marked tremendous year-over-year growth, primarily due to pricing improvement in DRAM and NAND sales volume.We believe that the improving prices for DRAM and NAND chips make investors confident about Micron’s growth. Per various sources, prices for these specific chips have improved chiefly due to a better product-mix optimization and higher-than-expected demand for PCs, servers and mobiles.We believe that any elevation in prices will have a favorable influence on the company’s top line, the benefit of which will likely trickle down to the bottom line. The benefit from improved pricing was well reflected in the company’s last quarterly results as well. We anticipate these benefits to reflect in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.83 on $5.95-billion revenue projection.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise         Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteAdditionally, we are positive about the company’s strategy of enhancing its operating capabilities through acquisitions which are likely to boost its top-line performance.Also, it is worth mentioning that the buyout of Inotera in December 2016 will have some operational benefits, leading to efficient management of investment and cadence, followed by alignment with global manufacturing operations.However, after acquiring SanDisk, Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) has become a key player in the NAND space, which could heighten competition in the industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Micron will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

723,ACN,"DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) recently announced the pricing of a Senior Floating Rate Notes offering worth $650 million. Notes, carrying an interest rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.95% per year, are set to mature in 2021.Per the company, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated will lead the underwriting syndicate. Security brokerage and dealership services provider will act as the sole active bookrunner and representative of underwriters.DXC Technology intends to use the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which also include the repayment of outstanding indebtedness.Borrowing costs continue to be low, enabling companies to obtain easy financing. With the U.S. treasuries offering low rates, corporate bonds and borrowings from banks are now witnessing high demand. We believe that these notes will provide financial flexibility to the company and propel long-term growth.Nonetheless, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability. As of Jun 30, 2017, DXC has a total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $6.25 billion, while it paid $76 million as interest expenses during first-quarter fiscal 2018, which was 200% higher than the year-ago quarter tally.The company’s long-term outstanding debt primarily increased this year. Notably, DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), which was closed on Apr 1, 2017.CSC, prior to the completion of its merger with HPE’s Enterprise Services business, had taken additional debt. This increased DXC Technology’s total long-term liability, thereby increasing its interest cost burden. Any elevation in interest cost will have a negative impact on the company’s bottom-line results.Additionally, the company noted that the merger has opened up new avenues of growth and will help the combined entity to become a leading player in the IT services domain. Post merger, DXC Technology became the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report).However, we believe that the benefits of this merger will come over the long run, as DXC Technology’s near-term results are likely to bear the impact of the integration of the acquired businesses.Currently, DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).DXC Technology stock has gained 21.1% since Apr 1, substantially outperforming the 12% rally of the industry it belongs to.A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is CSRA Inc. , which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The stock has long-term expected EPS growth rate of 10%.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

On constant currency basis revenue decreased 4.7% year over year (excluding the impact of purchase price accounting), primarily due to decline in traditional infrastructure services.

Tax rate is expected to lie between 25% and 30% for fiscal 2018.Recent activityDXC Technology recently made its first acquisition after the merger, buying the privately-held Tribridge company. Tribridge is one of the largest independent integrators of Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Dynamics 365, which explains why this acquisition makes sense for DXC Technology.The company intends to integrate Tribridge business under DXC Eclipse business. Per the company, “DXC Eclipse is a leading global Microsoft Gold Partner delivering Microsoft Dynamics 365, ERP, CRM, business process, analytics, and collaboration solutions on premise and in the cloud.”Our TakeThe company reported mixed first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, where in the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line missed the same. The company also provided a modest guidance for fiscal 2018.Post-merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report). We believe that the merger has opened up avenues of growth for the combined company. Following the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology may be seen making strategic acquisitions to enhance portfolio, which is likely drive growth over the long run.DXC Technology has also been making strategic acquisitions, such as UXC and Xchanging, to strengthen portfolio, which is likely to drive growth in the long haul.Nonetheless, the market is very competitive with companies like CACI International Inc. (CACI  -  Free Report) and Accenture, which could hurt DXC Technology’s top and bottom lines. Additionally, a challenging macroeconomic situation and uncertain IT spending environment remain headwinds.Currently, DXC carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

727,ACN,"On Sep 1, we updated the research report on waste management firm, Republic Services, Inc. (RSG  -  Free Report).Republic Services is currently focusing on a series of quality acquisition opportunities, primarily of recycling assets, which are likely to act as a catalyst for a healthy long-term growth within its top 25 markets. The company is also transitioning to a fee-based recycling processing model to cover processing costs and generate a healthy return on investment.Solid Inorganic Growth ProspectsIn order to strengthen its market presence, Republic Services recently inked a definitive agreement to acquire ReCommunity Holdings II, Inc., the largest independent recycling-processing firm in the United States, for an undisclosed amount. The strategic acquisition is likely to complement the company’s existing recycling business and enable it to better serve its customers across multiple markets.With 26 recycling centers in 14 states, ReCommunity operates single-stream recycling and multi-material processing facilities that transform waste materials into reusable items. These include the recycling of discarded paper into eco-friendly home insulation, aluminum cans and containers to harvest bauxite ore, a raw material for virgin aluminum and PET bottles into fresh new bottles or carpeting and clothing.The various facilities of ReCommunity recover approximately 1.6 million tons of recycled commodities annually on an average. The state-of-the-art recycling facilities offer an unrivalled competitive advantage to Republic Services in the recycling business that continues to be one of the fastest growing segments of the waste stream. In addition, the acquisition will also facilitate Republic Services gain control of multiple long-term municipal agreements of ReCommunity with processing fee-based structures. These agreements align perfectly with the company's innovative recycling pricing model and are likely to generate incremental revenues.Moving ForwardThe transaction further reinforces Republic Services’ commitment to its Blue Planet sustainability initiative that aims at increasing its recycling capacity by an additional 150,000 tons or more per year by 2018. As part of this initiative, Republic Services is steadily building durable practices and programs to further improve its environmental and social impacts through decreased vehicle emissions, innovative landfill technologies, more use of renewable energy and community engagements.The stock has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 14.4% compared with 10.8% gain for the latter. We remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Better-ranked stocks in the industry include S&P Global, Inc.

728,ACN,"On Sep 1, we issued an updated research report on global marketing and corporate communications firm, Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report).Growth DriversOmnicom is concentrating on strengthening its business and expanding its client base globally through the acquisition of complementary companies. The company maintains a balanced growth model through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and strategic acquisitions. We expect it to witness higher revenues in the imminent future on the back of prudent acquisitions and organic growth.At the same time, Omnicom is witnessing a steady performance in developed markets like the United States and developing markets like Asia. The measures undertaken by the company to reduce costs have helped it boost earnings. It is expanding its global footprint and is moving into new service areas. The company is also building upon its digital and analytical capabilities by investing in agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies in key markets. Omnicom’s operations are diversified across technology platforms, thus lowering its dependence on any one product in these dynamic technological markets.The company has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date loss of 14.9% compared with a decline of 17% for the latter. In order to spur growth, Omnicom started using open-source technique to access the current information in the market. The increasing demand for media services, speedy growth of technologies and massive proliferation of channels are likely to translate into incremental revenues in the future.HeadwindsHowever, a significant portion of Omnicom’s revenues comes from Europe. At present, when the economy in the region is highly unpredictable, particularly after the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and reduce costs. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering the productivity of the company. In addition, it is susceptible to market risks of losing contracts related to media purchases and production costs, which thereby affects its bottom line and undermines its organic growth to some extent.Furthermore, Omnicom forms part of the communications industry, which is highly competitive in nature. Various agencies and media service providers compete with each other to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. Also, keeping in view the service-oriented nature of the whole industry, it becomes imperative for the company to increase the count of talented employees as well as retain the existing ones. These factors are likely to pose some challenges for the company.Moving ForwardNevertheless, we expect Omnicom to witness higher revenues in the future and remain impressed by its focused growth initiatives.Omnicom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Publicis Groupe S.A. (PUBGY  -  Free Report), Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) and TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

729,ACN,"Having a good consultant which has better resources, talent pool and global reach is much more effective in securing deals. It seems that Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) has learned it well and therefore, entered into a new partnership with the world’s leading consultancy firm — Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) — to develop iOS applications (apps) for the enterprise community.Per the agreement, the two companies will create a mixed team of designers, programmers, and other Apple experts within Accenture Digital Studios’ units in select locations around the world. The team will focus on developing tools and services for building iOS apps, as per the requirements of Accenture’s clients across different industries.This will help Accenture’s clients integrate the iOS devices to connect to their back-end systems, ease transfer of legacy apps and their data to iOS, and take data from IoT devices on iOS.Apple Expanding Partner EcosystemAccenture is the fifth company with which Apple has tied up to create innovative business solutions for iOS. The strong adoption of iPhone by both the retail consumers and enterprises has been a game changer for the company over the last decade.Since 2014, Apple has focused on penetrating the enterprise business. Growing demand for applications that can help enterprises in better engaging with customers helped the iPhone-maker to gain traction.International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) was the first tech giant with which Apple partnered, in order to develop industry-specific iOS apps. The very next year it partnered with Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report), followed by its collaborations with SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) and Deloitte in 2016.Notably, Apple stock has gained 41.7% year to date, outperforming the 39.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Win-Win for Both Tech GiantsThe recent alliance will prove to be beneficial for both companies, in our opinion.Accenture helps organizations in digital transformation. The company has a huge number of tech consultants operating across more than 40 industries. Therefore, the addition of Accenture as a partner will help Apple in reaching out to a large customer pool and simultaneously utilize the former’s expertise to further push into the enterprise marketplace.Going ahead, it should be noted that currently, Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Android-based operating system smartphone has a market share of 85%, while iOS has only 14.7%, per the latest report of IDC. Despite this, Apple has managed to maintain its dominant position in the enterprise-app developing community due to the aforementioned partnerships, as well as its superior features over Android like safety, reliability and easy integration across platforms.Apart from this, expanding into the enterprise market will bode well for the company, given the higher margins compared with retail offerings.Furthermore, it should be note that despite of having different composition in every partnership, all are centered at creating apps for enterprise employees. The idea is very simple, to turn iPhone and iPad into default devices for work. This will help Apple in selling more and more of these devices in the long run as enterprise employees have tendency to change these in one or two years.Also, by providing better iOS experiences, Apple may win deals from organizations to make iOS as their default operating system. This would mean eating into Microsoft Corporation’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Windows’ market share, which is currently the most preferred operating system by organizations. Obviously, it won’t happen in near-term, but certainly creates a possibility in the long-run.On the other hand, the partnership will help Accenture in enhancing its digital transformation capabilities and bring in additional revenues. Apart from this, this will also facilitate the company in strategically competing with other consulting companies such as IBM, Dell and Deloitte.Currently, Apple caries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Accenture has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

731,ACN,"Continuing its earnings streak for the sixth quarter in a row, Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) posted splendid second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein the top and bottom lines not only fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but also came ahead of management’s guided ranges. Quarterly revenues and earnings also marked year-over-year improvement.The world’s leading CRM platform provider reported non-GAAP earnings of 33 cents per share, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents, as well as the company’s guidance range of 31-32 cents. Moreover, the figure compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 24 cents, mainly driven by strong top-line growth and efficient cost management, partially offset by increased number of outstanding shares.Looking at the last quarter’s strong results and encouraging outlook for the next quarter and fiscal 2018, we believe that the stock will likely see upside movement during today’s trading session. Notably, the stock has outperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. Salesforce has returned 35.8% during the said time frame compared with the industry’s gain of 22.4%.Before discussing the fiscal second-quarter results in detail, here are some important business highlights of the quarter.Q2 Business HighlightsTremendous increase in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the company’s top-line results. During its fiscal second-quarter conference call, Salesforce announced that its partner certification witnessed growth of five times over the last four years, and more companies are willing to invest in Salesforce activities. Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with over 11,000 skilled consultants.A number of big organizations, including Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), 21st Century Fox, Jefferies Investment Bank and Samsung, picked Salesforce solutions during the quarter to drive their digital transformation.Furthermore, during the fiscal second quarter, Salesforce broke through the $10-billion run rate and named itself the first company in the history of enterprise cloud software industry to have achieved this milestone so fast, including its closest rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report).Amazon Partnership Stoking International GrowthThe company still generates only about 30% of total revenues from international operations, which is much lower than its rivals like Microsoft or Oracle composition of around 50%. Nonetheless, Salesforce noted that its partnership agreements with Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS), entered over the past year, have been helping it expand its international operations.Earlier, the company used to run its software at its own data centers which was curbing its growth potentials. However, last year the company decided to utilize the AWS data center’s geographical reach to expand its international business. In addition, Salesforce has planned to invest about $400 million on AWS’ cloud platform, over the next four years.Most recently, Salesforce entered into an agreement with AWS to run its software in the latter’s Canadian data center. This has opened up  fresh prospects in the Canadian market. Similarly, Salesforce is planning to do similar thing in Australia, in order to tap the growing opportunity in the Asia-Pacific region.During the fiscal second quarter, the company won several deals due to its international expansion initiatives. Companies like Toshiba, Nomura, Queensland Urban Utilities and Australia Post picked Salesforce’s solutions to fuel digital transformation.Having discussed the fiscal second-quarter business highlights, let’s now turn to the financial results.RevenuesSalesforce continued to witness solid growth in revenues. The company’s revenues of $2.562 billion not only jumped 25.8% year over year, but also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.514 billion. Furthermore, reported revenues came above the guided range of $2.51-$2.52 billion (mid-point: $2.515 billion).The improvement is primarily attributable to rapid adoption of the company’s cloud-based solutions. Also, higher demand for the Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform, part of the Salesforce1 Customer Platform, drove the year-over-year upside in revenues.Now, coming to its business segments, revenues at Subscription and Support climbed about 25.6% from the year-ago quarter to $2.369 billion. Professional Services and Other revenues surged almost 28.3% to $193.1 million.Geographically, the company witnessed constant currency revenue growth of 24%, 31% and 27% in the Americas, EMEA and APAC, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.MarginsSalesforce’s non-GAAP gross profit came in at $1.967 billion, up 26.1%. Additionally, gross margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) to 76.8%, primarily due to solid revenue growth, which was partially offset by increased investment in infrastructure development, including the expansion of the international data centers.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 22.3% from the prior-year quarter to $1.585 billion. However, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses decreased to 61.9% from 63.7% in the year-ago quarter.

732,ACN,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of Alexandria-based Phase One Consulting, a cloud computing and digital services provider. Notably, the two companies entered into the deal in June this year. However, financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed.Founded in 1997, Phase One offers Salesforce-based IT services and software solutions, mainly focused on the federal market. Its services and solutions help federal agencies in modernizing and digitizing.The company was owned by private equity firm – RLJ Equity Partners – which had acquired it in January 2015. Its stronghold in the federal market attracted investments from the venture capital arm of Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report), Salesforce Ventures in September last year.Post completion of this acquisition, Accenture intends to integrate under its Accenture Federal Services subsidiary. We believe that the recent acquisition will not only strengthen the company’s Salesforce capabilities, but will also help it in gaining more and more federal contracts, thereby boosting its top-line performance.Salesforce Capabilities Expansion ImpressiveSince 2014, Accenture has been aggressively trying to fortify its position as a leading provider of Salesforce capabilities. The recent buyout is the company’s seventh acquisition in the Salesforce space, while this is the first federal market acquisition related to Salesforce.Notably, Accenture is already a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with currently over 11,000 skilled consultants. Moreover, given that Salesforce is one of the largest providers of cloud-based applications and software, it is imperative that Accenture enhances its capabilities in delivering the former’s services.Industry Forecasts Justify StrategyThe company’s strategy of boosting its cloud capabilities through such acquisitions is a step in the right direction, as evident from the latest forecast provided by several independent research firms. According to Gartner, the SaaS and cloud-based business application markets are likely to grow from $38.6 billion in 2016 to $46.3 billion in 2017, reflecting year-over-year growth rate of approximately 20%. Also, the research firm forecasts that the market will double by 2020 from the 2016 level.Another research firm – International Data Corporation (IDC) – predicts that the cloud software market will witness a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.3% during the 2014–2019 period, reaching $112.8 billion by 2019 end.Exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud-computing vendors. Therefore, considering the increasing need for cloud-based applications and software, we anticipate Accenture’s investments in this space to propel long-term growth.Bottom LineWe are encouraged by Accenture’s strategy of growing through acquisitions. These buyouts have enabled the company to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, and maintain a leading position. We believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the company's revenue stream.Nonetheless, Accenture’s announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results, in our opinion. Furthermore, increasing competition from other players like DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and NV5 Global, Inc. (NVEE  -  Free Report), and an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.
