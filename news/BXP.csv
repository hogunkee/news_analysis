The figure was also higher than the year-ago quarter’s tally of $1.48. In addition, quarterly FFO per share was within the company’s previously guided range of $1.47-$1.49.Adjusted revenues, comprising base rent and recoveries from tenants during the quarter, increased 3.7% year over year to $614.6 million. The figure also comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $604.5 million. The rise was attributable to increases in both the revenue components.Property UpdateAs of Mar 31, 2018, Boston Properties’ portfolio comprised 179 properties, covering a total of around 50.3 million square feet. This included 13 under development properties, covering an area of 6.5 million square feet.The overall operating portfolio, including 163 properties (excluding two residential properties and hotel), was 90.5% leased as of Mar 31, 2018.Portfolio ActivityDuring the first quarter, Boston Properties entered an agreement with Leidos to construct a build-to-suit project which would include a Class A office space at company's 17Fifty Presidents Street development project located in Reston, VA, having about 276,000 net rentable square feet. The development of the project has started and will be ready for occupancy by the second quarter of 2020.Further, the company partly placed 508 apartments and retail spaces in service, spanning across 515,000 square feet, situated in Reston, VA.Also, Boston Properties entered a binding lease agreement with Fannie Mae for its Reston Gateway project in Reston, VA.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.31.The company projects its second-quarter 2018 FFO per share of $1.53-$1.55. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.58.Our ViewpointBoston Properties is well poised for growth, with the support of properties located in select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets and diversified tenants along with industry base. In fact, ownership of properties in strategic areas enabled Boston Properties to enter into a lease agreement with Fannie Mae for its Virginia property, which is currently under construction. Also, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, healthy growth in the demand for office spaces is expected to strengthen the company’s growth opportunities.However, the market is witnessing growth in the supply of office spaces, which remains a concern as higher supply usually leads to lesser absorption and curtails the landlord’s capability to demand more rent. A few big financial players are resizing their businesses and trying to cut costs, which is affecting demand for office spaces. Further, rate hike adds to its woes.The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Boston Properties, Inc.

2,BXP,"Boston Properties, Inc. (BXP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, after the market closes.Last quarter, this REIT, which mainly owns and develops Class A office real estates in the United States, delivered lower-than-expected performance in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share, witnessing a negative surprise of 2.61%.However, over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions and missed in the other two. It delivered an average positive surprise of around 0.28% during this period.The graph below depicts this surprise history:Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Properties, Inc. QuoteShares of Boston Properties have declined 0.3% over the past three months compared with the industry’s descend of 4.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors That Might Influence Q1 ResultsBoston Properties, based in Massachusetts, concentrates on a few select high-rent and high barrier-to-entry geographic markets. The company’s solid tenant and industry base, including several bellwethers, ensure steady rental revenue growth. Further, Boston Properties has achieved an annual compounded revenue growth rate of 7.09% over the last five years. Given the company’s improving core operations, we anticipate this trend to continue, going forward. Moreover, the company is likely to experience solid contribution in 2018 from its non-same-property portfolio, mainly driven by development deliveries.In fact, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, healthy demand for office spaces is likely to have continued in the company’s markets in the quarter under review. Particularly, growth in demand for office spaces is anticipated to have been fueled by technology and life sciences businesses.Nonetheless, the company faces intense competition from other operators of office properties. Further, growth in the supply of office spaces in the market remains a concern because higher supply usually leads to lesser absorption and also curtails the landlord’s capability to demand more rent.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the base rent of $514 million reflects marginal growth from the prior-quarter figure.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the first quarter remained stable at $1.50, reflecting year-over-year projected increase of 1.35%. The company projects first-quarter FFO per share to be in the range of $1.47-$1.49.However, consensus estimates for revenue for development and management services are projected to be $8.62 million, down 13.5% sequentially. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $604.5 million, indicating decline of 4.4% year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model cannot conclusively predict if Boston Properties will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time.

4,BXP,"Boston Properties, Inc. (BXP  -  Free Report) is slated to break ground on May 2 for its first residential project on the West Coast, per news from San Francisco Business Times. The move comes as part of the company’s effort to diversify its asset base.Specifically, a 402-unit apartment tower will be developed adjacent to Oakland's MacArthur BART station. As a result, the tower is expected to enjoy decent accessibility to transportation. In fact, per the report, buses plied by AC Transit, Emeryville and major neighboring employers halt there. Therefore, residential units in the tower are likely to enjoy demand.According to the company’s prior earnings call, excluding land, the tower is slated to cost $265 million. The project is planned to be fully financed with equity, rather than debt. Boston Properties has a ground lease with McGrath Properties, which is the long-time developer of MacArthur Transit Village, as well as the land’s owner.Boston Properties is basically an office landlord having millions of office spaces in its portfolio. However, the company aims to diversify and add more residential spaces in its portfolio because such property types usually ensure steady cash flow. The company’s residential development project includes around 400 units in Reston, VA, and a mixed-use project having housing and a hotel in Boston.The company’s assets are located in select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets, and its diversified tenant and industry base are expected to steadily drive the company’s long-term growth. Its properties are concentrated in five core markets: Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC. These regions comprise traditional tenants, like government, financial services and law firms, as well as businesses involving technology, advertising, media and information distribution, mobility, life sciences and medical devices.Nevertheless, there is growth in supply of office space and this remains a concern because higher supply usually leads to lesser absorption, and also curtails landlords’ capability to demand more rents. Further, a few big financial players are resizing their business and trying to cut costs, which is affecting demand for office space. Rate hike is another concern.Boston Properties has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors.However, as there is growth in supply of office space in the market, this remains a concern because higher supply usually leads to lesser absorption and curtails the landlord’s capability to demand more rents.

8,BXP,"Boston Properties (BXP  -  Free Report) has been witnessing rising demand for mixed-use properties from tenants. In a recent video interview at REITworld 2017 with Nareit, the company’s CEO — Owen Thomas — revealed the fact but noted that the company still remains an office REIT. According to him, although the company is involved in mixed-use development, retail and apartment assets constitute less than 10% of its total portfolio.Notably, mixed-use developments reduce the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, mixed-use developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area.Further, Boston Properties is right on track to record 25% increase in its net operating income (NOI) by 2020. Specifically, contribution from delivery of several new developments is likely to constitute two-third of this growth in NOI. Encouragingly, its developments are already 75% leased as of now, highlighting decent demand for the company’s properties.The remaining one-third is expected to be achieved by raising the combined occupancy level of nine properties to 93% from 90%. According to Thomas, the company is “about half-way” toward this target.Boston Properties enjoys the ownership and development of class-A office properties that are concentrated in five core markets — Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC. This focus on select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets is a strategic fit given that such markets usually fare better in an uncertain economy.Over the last five years, the company witnessed an annual compounded revenue growth rate of 8.17%. Given Boston Properties’ improving core operations and solid contribution from development deliveries, it is anticipated to experience growth in top line in the near term.Also, with economic improvement and recovery in job market, healthy growth in demand for office spaces is poised to continue. However, increased supply of office space has been curbing the pricing power of landlords and resulting in elevated concession levels. Furthermore, rate hikes have added to its woes.Boston Properties currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past six months, shares of the company have outperformed the industry. While the stock has gained 4.8%, the industry has incurred loss of 0.3% during this period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Better-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Franklin Street Properties (FSP  -  Free Report), Columbia Property Trust (CXP  -  Free Report) and MedEquities Realty Trust (MRT  -  Free Report). All three carry a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).Franklin Street Properties’ Zacks Consensus Estimates for 2017 FFO per share remained unchanged at $1.05 over the past month. Its share price has inched up 0.4% in three months’ time.Columbia Property Trust’s FFO per share estimates for the current year have climbed 2.7% to $1.15 in two months’ time. The stock has gained 5.3% over the past three months.MedEquities Realty’s FFO per share estimates for 2017 moved up 0.9% to $1.12 over the past two months. Its shares have lost 5.0% during the past three months.Note: All EPS numbers presented in this report represent funds from operations (FFO) per share. FFO, a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses to net income.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

9,BXP,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, office REIT Boston Properties (BXP  -  Free Report) announced a 6.7% hike in the company's quarterly cash dividend rate to 80 cents per share from 75 cents paid earlier. It will pay the raised dividend for the fourth quarter on Jan 30, 2018, to shareholders on record as of Dec 29, 2017.Reflecting positive sentiments of investors, the shares inched up 1.2% during Monday’s regular trading session to $130.96.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $3.20 per share, up from the prior annual rate of $3.00 per share, leading to an annualized yield of 2.4%, considering Boston Properties' closing price on Dec 18.Solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Boston Properties remains committed toward boosting shareholders’ wealth. The company has registered a five-year annual dividend growth rate of 4.87%. Prior to this dividend hike, in December 2016, Boston Properties had announced a 15.4% hike in its quarterly dividend rate.Boston Properties also has solid fundamentals to back dividend hikes. The company concentrates on a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets that usually fare better in an uncertain economy. Moreover, growth in demand for office space continues to be fueled by technology and life science businesses.The company has achieved an annual compounded revenue growth rate of 8.17% over the last five years. Given the company’s improving core operations, we anticipate this trend to continue, in the near future. In addition, the company is likely to experience solid contribution in 2018 from its non-same-property portfolio, mainly driven by development deliveries.Also, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, we expect healthy growth in demand for office spaces. This is because, as the economy revives, business grows and therefore, corporate sectors seek expansion, renting more space to accommodate the increased workforce.Additionally, the company remains focused on maintaining strong balance sheet with conservative leverage position. It enjoys substantial liquidity of around $2.5 billion and solid access to debt markets. Also, reflecting optimal utilization of equity, the company’s ROE is 6.43%, higher than the industry average of 5.78%.However, there is growth in supply of office space in the market and this remains a concern because higher supply usually leads to lesser absorption and also curtails the landlord’s capability to demand more rents. There is also a trend of increased concessions in some of the markets.Shares of Boston Properties have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have rallied 9.5%, while the industry has increased 1.3% during the same time period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Apart from Boston Properties, a number of REITs have announced dividend hikes in recent times. Notable among them are Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report), Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) and SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report).Mid-America Apartment Communities approved a 6% hike to its common dividend rate for fiscal 2018. Ventas raised the fourth-quarter 2017 dividend by 2% to 79 cents per share. Further, SL Green announced a 4.8% increase in its fourth-quarter dividend and will now pay a dividend of 81.25 cents per share.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BXP in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.55 per share for BXP, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BXP, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.50% heading into earnings season.Boston Properties, Inc.

11,BXP,"Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Nov 1. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are anticipated to experience solid year-over-year growth.Last quarter, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 2.1% with respect to FFO per share. Results indicated growth in revenues and same-center property operating income.The company has a decent surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, it surpassed estimates in three occasions and missed in the other. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 0.9%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS Surprise  Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Federal Realty Investment Trust QuoteNote: All EPS numbers presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.However, Federal Realty’s shares have descended 14.5% year to date, against the industry’s decline of 8.9%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to Consider Federal Realty has been taking advantage of the redevelopment opportunities. Particularly, amid a fast evolving retail environment, the company is making strategic efforts to reposition, redevelop and re-merchandise its portfolio.   These efforts will not only help the company counter competition from e-retailers but will also enable it to post decent operating results in the to-be-reported quarter. Subsequently, minimum rents from the retail and commercial segment will likely record year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148 million indicates encouraging growth of 8% as compared to the year-ago quarter. Furthermore, total rental income is projected to be $209 million, a marginal rise from the prior-quarter tally of $204 million.However, rising consumer purchases through the Internet has emerged as a pressing concern for this REIT. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures. Also, retailers not able to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Accordingly, percentage rents, which indicate additional rent based on the level of sales achieved by the tenant, are predicted to witness a considerable decline due to the tepid retail environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44 million reflects a 5.2% dip as compared to the prior-year quarter.Prior to the third-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for becoming optimistic about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the third quarter edged down 0.7% to $1.47 over the past two months.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Federal Realty will likely beat on earnings this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Federal Realty is -0.92%.Zacks Rank: Federal Realty’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:EPR Properties (EPR  -  Free Report),slated to release third-quarter earnings on Nov 8, has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

12,BXP,"Boston Properties, Inc. (BXP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Jan 30, after the market closes.Last quarter, this REIT, which mainly owns and develops Class A office real estates in the United States, delivered better-than-expected performance in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share, witnessing a positive surprise of 1.95%. Results indicated an improvement in portfolio operations, and development and management services revenues.Further, Boston Properties has a decent surprise history. The company exceeded estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 1.6%. This is depicted in the chart below:Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Properties, Inc. QuoteNotably, Boston Properties’ fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 3.1% in the past six months, outperforming the 2.1% decline of the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Earnings WhispersOur proven model cannot conclusively predict if Boston Properties will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. That’s because, it doesn’t have the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -1.77%.Zacks Rank: Boston Properties carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors That Might Influence Q4 ResultsBoston Properties, based out of Massachusetts, concentrates on a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets. The company’s solid tenant and industry base, including several bellwethers, ensure steady rental revenue growth. Over the past five years, it recorded annual revenue growth rate of 8.17%. This trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter as well.Per a recent study by CBRE Group Inc. (CBG), the U.S. office vacancy rate increased 10 basis points (bps) in the to-be-reported quarter. The elevation is due to the rise in supply and a minor loosening of the market. However, in most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy rates declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.In fact, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, healthy growth in demand for office spaces is likely to have continued in the company’s markets in the quarter under review. Particularly, growth in demand for office space is anticipated to have been fueled by technology and life sciences businesses in the to-be-reported quarter.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $638.3 million, indicating estimated growth of 0.4% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for base rent of $515 million reflects marginal growth from the prior-quarter figure.However, the consensus estimate for development and management services is projected to be $8.24 million, down 23.8% sequentially.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the fourth quarter decreased 2.6% to $1.49, reflecting analysts’ bearish sentiments. Also, it reflects a year-over-year decline of 3.3%. The company projects fourth-quarter FFO per share to be in the range of $1.53-$1.54.For full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues came in at $2.55 billion, whereas, the consensus estimate for FFO per share came in at $6.23, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 3.3%. Further, the management expects full-year 2017 FFO per share to be in the range of $6.24-$6.25.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE  -  Free Report), scheduled to release earnings on Jan 29, has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.CubeSmart (CUBE  -  Free Report), slated to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 15, has an Earnings ESP of +1.10% and a Zacks Rank #3.Diamondrock Hospitality Company (DRH  -  Free Report), scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Feb 28, has an Earnings ESP of +4.76% and a Zacks Rank #3.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

13,BXP,"Boston Properties, Inc. (BXP  -  Free Report) concentrates on a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry office markets that usually fare better in an uncertain economy. These office markets include Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC.The company has been experiencing solid leasing activity in its markets and growth in demand for office space created by technology and life science businesses. In fact, over the last five years, the company has achieved an annual compounded revenue growth rate of 8.17%.Moving ahead, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, we expect healthy growth in demand for office spaces to continue. This is because, as the economy revives, business grows and corporate sectors seek expansion. This then leads to renting of more space to accommodate increased workforce.Amid all this, Boston Properties remains well poised to grow, given its premium office portfolio and improving core operations. Further, the company is likely to experience solid contribution in 2018 from its non-same-property portfolio, mainly driven by development deliveries.Boston Properties also came up with a decent performance in the third quarter. The company’s funds from operations (“FFO”) per share of $1.57 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54. The figure also came in higher than the year-ago quarter tally of $1.42. In addition, quarterly FFO per share exceeded the company’s previously guided range of $1.52-$1.54.Results indicated an improvement in portfolio operations, and development and management services revenues. It also raised its full-year 2017 FFO per share guidance to $6.24-$6.25 from $6.20-$6.25 provided earlier.Shares of Boston Properties outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. The company’s shares logged in a gain of 2.9% compared with growth of 2.4% recorded by the industry. Moreover, the stock has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year FFO per share being revised 0.2% upward in a month’s time, reflecting analyst’ bullish sentiments. Given its progress on fundamentals, the stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead.Nonetheless, there is growth in supply of office space in the market. This remains a concern because higher supply usually leads to lesser absorption and curtails landlords’ capability to demand more rents.There is also a trend of increased concessions in some of the markets. Moreover, big financial players are opting for resizing of their business and cost-containment efforts, which is curbing demand for office space.Additionally, the company mainly has assets in only five U.S. markets, which makes it susceptible to economic downturns over there. Though these markets are among the best in the sector, Boston Properties’ geographic concentration could affect its operations.Further, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company, which would affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate and lower dividend payouts as well. Moreover, the dividend payout itself might become less attractive than yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Boston Properties currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the REIT space are Cedar Realty Trust (CDR  -  Free Report), DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report) and Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report). Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Cedar Realty’s FFO per share estimates for 2017 remained unchanged at 54 cents in a month. Its share price has increased 17.0% in the past six months.DCT Industrial Trust’s current-year FFO per share estimates have been revised upward by a cent to $2.44 in a month’s time.

Also, with economic improvement and recovery in job market, healthy growth in demand for office spaces is expected to strengthen the company’s growth opportunities.  However, several big companies are choosing to resize their businesses and contain costs, which are leading to lower demand for office space.

15,BXP,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, before the opening bell.Last quarter, this Irvine, CA-based healthcare REIT delivered a positive surprise of 2.13% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results reflected growth in three-month same-property portfolio cash net operating income (NOI).The company has a decent surprise history. In fact, over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded estimates in each occasion, generating an average positive surprise of 3.3%. This is depicted in the graph below.HCP, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  HCP, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | HCP, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.However, HCP’s shares have lost 14.3% of its value, year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 2.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderHCP enjoys a diversified, well-balanced portfolio in the healthcare sector. In the to-be-reported quarter, the company is likely to gain from rising healthcare spending and a growing aging population. Importantly, strategic investments, tie-ups and acquisitions are anticipated to drive decent cash flows.The company also remains on track with its deleveraging plan and its balance sheet is likely to reflect that. However, as part of such efforts, it significantly disposed non-core assets. While such moves are a strategic fit for the long term, the company cannot bypass the dilutive impact on earnings in the near term from huge asset dispositions.Moreover, growth might be hindered by cut-throat competition in HCP’s markets. In addition, there is increased supply in senior housing category. As this curtails landlords’ pricing power and limits growth in occupancy level, the prevalent oversupply situation is expected to impact the company’s third-quarter numbers.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $450.4 million, marking an estimated plunge of 31.2% year over year.Also, HCP’s performance during the quarter was inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved down 2.1% to 46 cents in two months’ time.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that HCP will likely beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.22%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: HCP has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).While a positive ESP is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise, its combination with a Sell-rated rank leaves our prediction inconclusive.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Nov 1, has an Earnings ESP of +2.96% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

(HST  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, after the market closes.Last quarter, this Bethesda, MD-based lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a better-than-expected performance in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share, generating a positive surprise of 6.5%. Results indicate growth in comparable hotel Revenue per available room (RevPAR) and improvement in margin.Moreover, Host Hotels has a decent surprise history. The company posted positive surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 7.5%. This is depicted in the graph below:Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter FFO per share is pegged at 33 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderHost Hotels boasts a portfolio of upscale hotels across lucrative markets in the United States. Also, the company is making concerted efforts to enhance its portfolio quality through strategic capital-recycling program. The company is making opportunistic acquisitions, as well as making strategic redevelopments to fortify its position in global vibrant markets. In addition, Host Hotels has a decent balance sheet and ample liquidity.However, the company anticipates third-quarter results to be weaker than the first half. This is because of the impact of holiday shift — the Jewish holidays moving back from October to September, and tough comps related to the Olympics in Brazil in the third quarter last year. As such, the company expects 21% of its total EBITDA for 2017 to be generated in the quarter under review. Further, supply growth in the company’s key markets remains a concern.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.27 billion, marking an estimated decline of 1.7% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Room Revenues is $883 million, denoting a decrease from $940 million reported in the prior quarter, while the Food and Beverage revenues estimate is pegged at $332 million which is also below $416 million reported in the previous quarter. Also, in a month’s time, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the third quarter moved down 2.9% to 33 cents, underlining analysts’ bearish sentiments.Nevertheless, Host Hotels’ shares have rallied 7.3% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 0.6%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Host Hotels will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

17,BXP,"Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, after the market closes. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are expected to experience solid year-over-year growth.Last quarter, this Jacksonville, FL-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) generated a positive surprise of 3.3%. Results were backed by robust growth in same-property net operating income (NOI).Further, the company has a solid surprise history. It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average surprise of 3.5%. This is depicted in the graph below.Regency Centers Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Regency Centers Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Regency Centers Corporation QuoteNote: All EPS numbers presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Positive Surprise is LikelyOur proven model shows that Regency has high chances of beating Q3estimates. This is because the company has the right combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Regency is +2.96%.Zacks Rank: Regency currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.However, the stock has lost 9.5% year to date, underperforming the 8.9% decline witnessed by the industry it belongs to.Factors That Might Impact Q3 ResultsRegency focuses on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers and neighborhood centers. Such centers are usually necessity driven and drive a dependable traffic. Also, the company’s solid experience in the retail real estate industry with well-known grocers as tenants and its preference of long-term leases over the short term ones will likely help it ride the growth trajectory in the to-be-reported quarter.Regency’s recent merger with Equity One helped the company in creating a high-quality portfolio of 429 properties which were mainly grocery anchored. In second quarter, the company realized $27 million of G&A synergies. In the third-quarter too, we anticipate this merger to drive robust growth in its rental rates and occupancy levels.With online retailers venturing into the grocery business, shift of sales from the brick and mortar space to online stores is emerging as a pressing concern. This is adversely affecting the retail tenants’ sales, leading them to reconsider their footprint and opt for store closures, thereby resulting in lesser demand for retail real estate space. In fact, amid this environment, same-property net operating income is estimated to be moderate in the third quarter.Regency’s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q3 FFO remained unchanged at 91 cents over the past month.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:EPR Properties (EPR  -  Free Report),slated to release third-quarter earnings on Nov 8, has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

18,BXP,"Rayonier Inc. (RYN  -  Free Report), a timberland real estate investment trust (REIT), is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, after market close. The company’s pro forma net income per share and revenues for the quarter are expected to decline year over year.Rayonier’s second-quarter 2017 pro forma net income per share came in at 20 cents, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents. Results highlighted encouraging performance in the New Zealand Timber, real estate and trading segment, primarily due to rise in sawtimber price, strong demand from China and favorable foreign exchange movements.Over the trailing four quarters, Rayonier beat estimates in three occasions and missed in the other, recording an average beat of 59.9%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Rayonier Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Rayonier Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Rayonier Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderRayonier’s portfolio of timberlands enjoys geographical diversity and is located in the productive timber-producing regions of the United States. Recent developments in the field of biogenetics and cloning have significantly benefited this timberland REIT’s business.The company is aimed at consistently monetizing higher and better uses (HBU) properties through rural land sales for enhancing its portfolio value. Additionally, the favorable demand-supply dynamics have reinforced the company’s pricing power.However, Rayonier faces cut-throat competition in the market from national and local players. Increasing rivalry from a variety of substitute products, like non-wood and engineered wood products, is expected to thwart its operating performance in the timber segment too. This might dent the company’s operating results from the timber segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.90 million for operating income from the overall timber segment reflects a steep decline from the prior-quarter figure of $35 million.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from the real estate segment is currently pegged at $4.4 million. This compares unfavorably with the year-ago quarter figure of $43.10 million.     In addition, Rayonier’s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter net income per share remained unchanged at 5 cents over the past month.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Rayonier will likely beat earnings estimates this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

19,BXP,"Affiliated Managers Group Inc. (AMG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 30. Its earnings and revenues are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues and a marginal decrease in expenses primarily drove results. Also, assets under management (AUM) growth remained strong.Moreover, the company boasts an impressive earning surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 1.9%.Also, activities of the company in the third quarter encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $3.36 per share has increased 1.2% over the last 30 days. The figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 11.4%.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $590.4 million. This indicates growth of 8.4% year over year.Driven by strong fundamentals and positive earnings surprises, shares of the company have gained 31.5% so far this year, outperforming the 25.9% growth of the industry it belongs to.Will the rally in stock price continue post Q3 earnings? It depends on the company’s ability to impress the market with an earnings beat and improved financials.According to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted if Affiliated Managers will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Affiliated Managers is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: Affiliated Managers has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a positive ESP is needed to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsAffiliated Managers holds an almost unbeaten track record of buying equity interests in asset management companies with strong performance-oriented products. The past equity investments should continue to give a boost to the company’s top line, driven by the excellent long-term performance of its affiliates.The company expects performance fees in the quarter to be in the range of 1-3 cents per share.Management expects the ratio of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to average AUM to be roughly 12.7 basis points (bps) for the quarter. Further, other economic items are projected to be around $1 million per quarter.On the cost front, management projects total interest expenses of around $21 million in the third quarter, down sequentially. Amortization expenses are projected to be $41 million, almost in line on a sequential basis.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Boston Properties, Inc.

20,BXP,"General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, before the market opens.Last quarter, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 14.3% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates in one occasion and met in the other three, the average positive surprise being 3.6%.Factors to ConsiderGGP Inc. has a solid portfolio of high-quality retail properties across attractive locations in the United States. Therefore, amid an improving economy, these retail properties have the capability to generate decent cash flows, given its cluster of renowned tenants.However, the retail real estate market has been crippling with issues like bankruptcies and downsizing of retailers. This is because mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences to online retail, resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon and reconsidering their footprint.These have emerged as serious concerns for retail REITs, as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably. Moreover, the choppy retail real estate market situation is also said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which mall landlords are finding unjustified.Given this, GGP Inc. has been making efforts to counter such pressure through various initiatives. However, implementation of such measures requires significant upfront costs, which might limit near-term growth in profit margins.Amid these, the company’s revenues are expected to record modest growth. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $565.6 million, reflecting projected growth of 2% from the year-ago period.For third-quarter 2017, the company estimates FFO per share in the range of 35-37 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 37 cents.However, GGP Inc.’s activities during the quarter could not gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged in a month’s time.GGP Inc.'s shares have lost 15.0% of its value in the past three months versus the 5.7% decline of its industry. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that GGP Inc. will likely beat FFO estimates this time around.

While the company’s funds from operations (FFO) per share are anticipated to be up year over year, revenues might decline.In the prior quarter, this Pasadena, CA-based urban office real estate investment trust (REIT), which primarily focuses on collaborative life science and technology campuses, delivered in-line FFO per share.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions, met in one and missed in the other, with an average beat of 0.35%.Alexandria’s shares have climbed 9.5% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 3.3%.Note: All EPS numbers presented here represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAlexandria focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for the life science and technology entities. These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit, and a limited supply of available space. This highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants, and will enable the company to enjoy steady rental revenues in the third quarter.The company follows the strategy of rotating capital from high-value assets, and the sale of non-core operating assets and non-strategic land parcels in order to finance pre-leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects. The near-term dilution impact of such moves is anticipated to weigh on its third-quarter earnings.In addition, Alexandria’s exposure to Canada and Asia through its subsidiaries makes it susceptible to currency fluctuation risks. In the to-be-reported quarter too, we expect unfavorable currency fluctuations to dent the company’s bottom-line performance.Also, over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the third quarter remained unchanged at $1.50, reflecting lack of any solid catalyst for being positive on the stock’s expected performance.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Alexandria will likely beat estimates this season.

Price and EPS Surprise | AvalonBay Communities, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAvalonBay is well-poised to grow on the back of a rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. Also, increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth, rising wages and a healthier balance sheet, promise strong prospects for this Arlington, VA-based REIT.Notably, per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), the U.S. apartment market reported stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter. However, the levels of rent growth have moderated from the previous years. For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6%, annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the country’s top 100 metros.AvalonBay is also likely to continue experiencing high occupancy. Although the pace of rental growth has slowed down from the bygone years, it is now likely to achieve stability.However, there is presence of elevated supply in quite a few of the company’s markets. Hence, any robust growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain restricted in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Further, delay in construction activities in the development portfolio is anticipated to affect the company’s lease-up net operating income in the near term.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $538.5 million, denoting an expected increase of 4.3% year over year.Additionally, prior to third-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising overt optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at $2.26, over the past month.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AvalonBay is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

23,BXP,"The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) — a retail real estate investment trust (REIT) — is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, after the market closes. While its funds from operations (FFO) per share are anticipated to be up year over year, revenues might record a decline.Last quarter, the company reported FFO per share of 98 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.3%.Over the trailing four quarters, Macerich beat estimates in three occasions and posted in-line results in the other, generating an average positive beat of 2.17%.Macerich Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Macerich Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Macerich Company (The) QuoteHowever, the stock has lost 20% year to date, underperforming the 6.3% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.Note: All EPS numbers presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Factors That Might Influence Q3 ResultsMacerich enjoys a portfolio of premium malls in vibrant U.S. markets. The presence of a number of well-capitalized retailers on its roster has enabled the company to maintain a stable source of rent for the past few quarters. Additionally, Macerich’s omni-channel distribution model, steadily rising demand, along with its tempered supply and aggressive capital-recycling program, augur well for growth.However, rising consumer purchases through the Internet has emerged as a pressing concern for this retail REIT. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures. Also, retailers not able to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Subsequently, the company’s revenues from minimum rent will likely experience a marginal fall as compared to the prior quarter. The company realizes minimum rents on a straight-line basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter minimum rental revenues is currently pegged at $151 million. This indicates a 1.3% decline on a year-over-year basis.  Percentage rents, which is realized when tenants' sales targets have been met, is also anticipated to witness a steep year-over-year decline due to the tepid retail environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 million reflects a 33.6% plunge as compared to the prior-year quarter.   Macerich’s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q3 FFO remained unchanged at 98 cents over the past month.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Macerich will likely beat estimates this season.

24,BXP,"UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, after the market closes.Last quarter, this Denver, CO-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered in-line result with respect to funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results reflect growth in revenues from same-store and stabilized, non-mature communities.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion and met estimates in the other three, the average beat being nearly 0.6%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteFor the third quarter, the company projects FFO per share in the range of 46-47 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 47 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for UDR prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderUDR boasts a vast experience in the residential real estate market. The company has a superior portfolio in targeted U.S. markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation. These are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter.Specifically, the company is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographic trends. There is steady demand for rental apartments from both new millennial households and empty nesters. Along with this, the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments.In fact, according to a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the U.S. apartment market recorded stable rent growth, while occupancy remained encouraging in the third quarter. However, these growth levels have moderated from the earlier years. For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the nation’s top 100 metros.However, we remain apprehensive about UDR’s performance as the company has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail a landlord’s ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption. As such, concession levels are likely to remain at the higher end, while pricing power of UDR is expected to remain limited in the quarter.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $250.1 million, denoting estimated growth of 2.8% year over year.Also, prior to the third-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter under review remained unchanged at 47 cents over the past two months.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that UDR will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for UDR is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 47 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: UDR’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 26, has an Earnings ESP of +1.19% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

26,BXP,"Boston Properties, Inc. (BXP  -  Free Report) is likely to beat expectations in the third quarter. The company is scheduled to release its quarterly numbers on Nov 1, after the market closes.Last quarter, this REIT, which mainly owns and develops Class A office real estates in the United States, delivered better-than-expected performance in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share, witnessing a positive surprise of 3.09%. Results indicated an improvement in portfolio revenues, as well as development and management services revenues. However, Boston Properties has a mixed surprise history. In fact, the company exceeded estimates in two occasions for as many misses, over the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 0.93%.

The company’s solid tenant and industry base, including several bellwethers, ensure steady rental revenue growth. Over the past five years, it recorded annual revenue growth rate of 8.17%. This trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter as well.Notably, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm, CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate declined to 12.9% in the third quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.In fact, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, healthy growth in demand for office spaces is likely to have continued in the company’s markets in the quarter under review.

29,BXP,"Leading international wireless tower operator, American Tower Corp (AMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Oct 31, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.35%. Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.91%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayAmerican Tower continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 5G networks. Next-generation 4G LTE, 5G networks and increased usage of smartphones and tablets are driving demand for tower leasing. Additionally, the company’s increased investments in Asia are paying off. These benefits are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results. Further, we believe that the company’s tower buyouts in emerging markets and long-term tower leases with major wireless carriers should drive top line and lend it a competitive edge over rivals. American Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of its organic core revenue growth.We are also impressed with American Tower’s efforts to reward stockholders with a quarterly cash distribution of 66 cents per share of the company’s common stock. The distribution was paid on Oct 17 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Sep 29.However, American Tower has a substantially leveraged balance sheet with around $17,509.9 million of outstanding long-term debt in the last reported quarter. Such high debt levels may impede sufficient cash flow generation, which is rerquired to meet future debt obligations.High-customer concentration is likely to have an adverse impact on the company’s top line. Expansion in the global market increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks. Stiff competition, integration risks and rising operating expenses are other headwinds. Additionally, the company’s upcoming results face threats from emerging technologies like Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Also, American Tower competes fiercely with tower operators like Crown Castle International Corp (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp (SBAC  -  Free Report).We believe that such headwinds have led to the company’s disappointing price performance. Over the past three months, the stock has declined 0.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 1.7%.  A Closer View on Certain Important MetricsAmerican Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of its organic core revenue growth. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will generate $295 million from Asia, $165 million from EMEA, $293 million from Latin America and $904 million from the United States. Meanwhile, total international revenues are estimated at $753 million.As of Sep 30, the company is projected to own 1,48,047 towers, with 39,843 towers in the domestic market and 1,07,911 towers internationally.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that American Tower is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

30,BXP,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after the market closes.Last quarter, this commercial real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.7%. Results were backed by improved operational performance from increased occupancy and rental-rate growth.The company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being nearly 5.9%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Realty Corporation QuoteFurther, Duke Realty’s shares have climbed 8.6% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 4.8%.Note: All EPS numbers presented here represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors That Might Influence Q3 ResultsIn recent years, Duke Realty has made strategic efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. This augurs well because the industrial-asset category has been grabbing attention as it is experiencing high demand, with the economy and job market displaying signs of recovery and the manufacturing environment remaining healthy.Furthermore, higher demand from e-commerce customers, third-party logistic providers and traditional warehousing customers also resulted in high demand for distribution centers. Given Duke Realty’s solid capacity to offer modern, bulk distribution properties, the company remains well poised to capitalize on this trend in the third quarter as well.Moreover, Duke Realty is making concerted efforts to lower its suburban office assets and turn into a leading domestic pure-play industrial REIT. Subsequently, in the second quarter, the company generated $2.45 billion in proceeds by selling its medical office building (MOB) portfolio for $2.8 billion. This residual transaction is likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.While such streamlining efforts are strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. In fact, such short-term impact will likely drag the company’s quarterly results.Over the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations (FFO) per share for the quarter to be reported remained unchanged at 29 cents, reflecting lack of any solid catalyst. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Duke Realty will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

31,BXP,"The Minutes from the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which clearly signal a December rate hike, might keep investors in the REIT space worried. The Fed’s anticipation that the factors leading to a slowdown in inflation will eventually subside further enhances the chances of a rate hike.However, it won’t be prudent to brood too much on a rate hike. Rather, the focus should be on the expected Q3 financial results of REITs based on the fundamentals of asset categories to which they cater to. Here, we will tell you why:Forget Fed MovesNo doubt, for REITs, which depend on debt for their business and pay high and consistent dividend, a higher rate affects the present value of future cash flows. Therefore, asset valuation, including bond coupons and stock dividends, experiences a decline. But a rise in rates also lugs along scope for increasing future cash flows.In fact, any decision by the Fed to increase rate mirrors growth in the domestic economy and the central bank’s confidence in the recovery. When economic growth picks up and inflation rises, prices of real estate generally increase. Consequently, rent and occupancy of properties go up. As such, REIT’s earnings, cash flow and dividend get a boost.Focus on Underlying Asset StrengthsIn fact, with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery, a number of asset categories displayed strength in third-quarter 2017. Take for example the industrial asset category that has grabbed attention on the back of robust demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment.Moreover, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets. Despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm, CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate declined to 12.9% in the third quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.Also, the U.S. apartment market reported stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter, per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report). For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the country’s top 100 metros.Pick Stocks Poised to Beat in Q3However, not all REITs from these asset categories are poised to excel. Therefore, in addition to focusing on REITs that have healthy underlying asset category fundamentals, investing in those that are yet to release their numbers and poised to beat expectations can be far more rewarding because an earnings beat essentially serves as a catalyst and raises investors’ confidence in a stock.Nevertheless, choosing the right stock could be quite difficult unless one knows the proper method. To make the task simple, we rely on the Zacks methodology, which takes into account a favorable rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, denotes the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that for stocks with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Here are five REITs that have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat when they release third-quarter results:Prologis Inc.

32,BXP,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, after the closing bell.In the prior quarter, this NY-based real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 7.14% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results reflected robust same-store occupancy rate in the New York portfolio. However, this was offset by a decline in same-store occupancy and same-store earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the Washington D.C. portfolio.Moreover, Vornado has a disappointing earnings surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion and missed in the other three, witnessing an average negative surprise of 5.8%. This is depicted in the graph below:Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise  Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Vornado Realty Trust QuoteYear to date, shares of Vornado have underperformed the industry. While the company’s shares have plunged 29.4%, the industry recorded growth of 2.3%.Note: All EPS numbers presented here represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderVornado has been actively repositioning its portfolio. In line with this, the company has been involved in opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures, along with business spin-offs. Though such efforts to streamline its business are commendable, the dilutive effects of these moves cannot be avoided either.Subsequently, we anticipate a fall in the company’s total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the third quarter is currently pegged at $528 million. This reflects a decline of 15.7% as compared with the previous quarter.Further, the company’s management and leasing fees are expected to witness a decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.09 million indicates a sharp drop of 36.8% from the prior quarter.  In addition, over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2017 FFO per share decreased 12.2%, reflecting analysts’ bearish sentiments.Nonetheless, Vornado’s wholly owned subsidiary, Building Maintenance Services (BMS), is expected to realize higher cleaning fees for its cleaning, engineering and security services. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BMS cleaning fees of $21.4 million reflects a 0.7% increase from the prior quarter.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predicts a FFO beat for Vornado this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Vornado is -16.67%.Zacks Rank: Vornado has a Zacks Rank #3. This increases the predictive power of ESP.

33,BXP,"PS Business Parks, Inc. (PSB  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO) of $1.54 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Moreover, the figure came in 7.7% higher than $1.43 recorded in the prior-year quarter. The rise stemmed from higher net operating income (NOI), reduced general and administrative expenses, and savings from lower preferred distributions.Rental income came in at around $100.5 million, marking 3.2% growth from the year-ago figure. Additionally, the figure outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $99.4 million.PS Business Parks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  PS Business Parks, Inc.

As a result, Same Park NOI climbed 5% year over year, mainly on the back of improving rental rates.Annualized Same Park realized rent per square foot rose 4.6% year over year to $15.32. Same Park weighted average occupancy in the quarter was 94%, down 10 basis points (bps) year over year.  LiquidityPS Business Parks exited third-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of 132.7 million, higher than the prior-year end tally of $128.6 million.Dividend UpdateOn Oct 23, the company announced a regular quarterly dividend of 85 cents per share, same as the previous payout. The dividend is payable on Dec 28 to shareholders of record as of Dec 13, 2017.ConclusionWe are encouraged by the better-than-expected FFO performance of PS Business Parks. The company’s solid liquidity, and a portfolio diversified across various locations and price points augur well for long-term growth. Furthermore, healthy fundamentals in the multi-tenant flex, office and industrial asset categories are anticipated to drive growth, while portfolio-repositioning strategies will likely help the company emerge stronger.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is currently pegged at $3.38.Our ViewpointImproving operating performance reflects brighter prospects for the company, going forward. Highwoods is making diligent efforts to expand its footprint in high-growth markets, and enhance the portfolio quality through prudent asset acquisitions and disposals. Furthermore, the company’s dispositions are anticipated to have miniscule impact on its revenues.Its focus on high-quality office assets in best business districts (BBDs) bode well. With the recovery in the economy and labor markets, Highwoods will likely experience healthy demand for office space. Nonetheless, Highwoods faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, as well as other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from its tenants. This restricts the company’s ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors.Highwoods currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

35,BXP,"Healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 27, before the market opens. The company’s funds from operations (FFO) and revenues are anticipated to be up year over year.Last quarter, this Chicago, IL-based healthcare REIT delivered a positive surprise of 0.95%. Results reflected growth in same-store cash net operating income (NOI) across triple net-leased portfolio, senior housing operating portfolio and medical office building portfolio.Further, Ventas posted an average positive surprise of 0.99% over the trailing four quarters, surpassing estimates twice and posting in-line results in the other occasions. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Ventas, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Ventas, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ventas, Inc. QuoteHowever, Ventas’ shares have remained flat year to date, underperforming 4.8% growth registered by the industry.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Ventas has a high chance of beating Q3 estimates. This is because the company has the right combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Ventas is +0.13%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise.Zacks Rank: Ventas currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3Factors That Might Influence Q3 ResultsVentas is anticipated to benefit in the to-be-reported quarter from increasing healthcare spending and aging population. In fact, according to the Census Bureau, the number of citizens with more than 85 years of age is estimated to reach 8.7 million by 2030.In addition, Ventas is focusing on achieving an optimum mix of healthcare real estate assets. The company has made sound efforts to expand its portfolio in the medical office life science real estate market. Such investments will likely help the company capitalize on the growing health-care-driven research and development, supported by top-tier research universities in the third quarter. Also, Ventas is aggressively shedding its skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) portfolio. In the third quarter, the company completed the first phase of disposal of 36 SNFs. Since SNFs are becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to changes in medical billing procedure, companies are reducing exposure to this asset class. Following this sale, Ventas will be able to bring down its net operating income (NOI) from SNFs to just 1% of its aggregate NOI. Hence, such moves are anticipated to support the company’s operating margins in the quarter under review.  Nonetheless, oversupply in some markets has burdened the performance of Ventas’s senior housing assets. Since this curtails the landlords’ pricing power and limits growth in occupancy level, we expect the prevalent oversupply situation to impact the company’s third-quarter numbers.However, there is lack of any positive catalyst to become overtly positive on the stock. Therefore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04 remained unchanged over the past two months.  Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 26, has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% and a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

36,BXP,"Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc. (PDM  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has leased around 450,000 square feet in third-quarter 2017. The company also closed two dispositions in the quarter. This included the sale of one of its largest assets — Two Independence Square in Washington D.C. which operates as NASA headquarters — to Hana Asset Management.A couple of notable third-quarter new lease deals included a 19,530-square-foot, 12-year lease through 2030 with WithumSmith+Brown PC at SunTrust Center in downtown Orlando, FL, and a 14,472-square-foot, 7+ year lease through 2025 with Robinhood Markets, Inc. at 500 TownPark in Lake Mary, FL. Moreover, FCA US LLC went for lease renewal at the 210,000-square-foot building at 1075 West Entrance in Auburn Hills, MI, through 2024. This building is fully leased to FCA US.The third-quarter leasing activity reflects steady demand for the company’s properties. In fact, per the company’s executive vice-president of Real Estate Operations “third quarter leasing results reflect steady activity, highlighted by a large lease renewal with a valued international automobile manufacturing tenant.""Also, in addition to the disposition of Two Independence Square which served as NASA headquarters to Hana Asset Management for approximately $360 million, the company completed the sale of its 8560 Upland Drive property in Englewood, CO, to Hendricks Commercial Properties for $17.6 million.The NASA headquarters building disposition helped the company trim its exposure to the Southwest submarket in Washington, lower overall market exposure to Washington and strengthen its balance sheet through debt reduction. Further, the sale of the 8560 Upland Drive property in Englewood enabled Piedmont to depart from the Denver office market.Piedmont is engaged in acquisition, ownership, management and development of high-quality Class A office properties located across major U.S. markets. The continued transactional activity indicates its success in selling non-strategic assets and redeploying the proceeds into targeted submarkets.Notably, the U.S. office market remained upbeat with the vacancy rate declining to 12.9% in the third quarter amid growth in office-using jobs, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm, CBRE Group Inc. . In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low. This is likely to benefit the office REITs like Piedmont, Boston Properties, Inc. (BXP  -  Free Report), Highwoods Properties, Inc.

Results reflect growth in net operating income (“NOI”) from existing, acquired and newly developed operating communities. However, the company experienced a rise in interest expense.Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates in one occasion and missed in the other three. This resulted in an average negative surprise of 0.84%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise.Zacks Rank: AvalonBay’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season.What's Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?During the first-quarter 2017 earnings release, AvalonBay announced its FFO per share guidance for second-quarter 2017. AvalonBay estimated FFO per share in the range of $2.18–$2.24 and core FFO per share in the band of $2.07–$2.13. Later, the company noted that it anticipates total rental revenue of established communities for second-quarter 2017 to grow 2.5–2.6% over the prior-year period.Notably, AvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of a rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. Moreover, increasing consumer confidence, on the back of job growth, rising wages, and a healthier balance sheet, promise strong prospects for the company.Additionally, defying concerns about supply in the market, the residential real estate market is back with a bang, driven by robust demand levels. Per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP), the second-quarter demand level of 175,645 apartments across the nation marked one-third increase from the level witnessed a year ago. This helped occupancy to remain high at 95.0% as of mid-year and led to stabilization in the annual pace of rent growth, which came in at 3.6%, close to 3.7% growth experienced in the first quarter. Notably, job formation and checked move-outs for buying homes acted as the catalyst.   Amid these, AvalonBay is likely to continue experiencing high occupancy. Although pace of rental growth has slowed down from the previous years, it is now likely to achieve stability.Also, over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter FFO per share inched up 0.5% to 2.14, reflecting analysts’ optimism on the stock.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:CyrusOne Inc.

Lesser general and administrative costs, lower interest expense and other expenses also contributed to higher funds from operations.

Rental rates on renewals contracted 50 basis points (bps) from the expiring lease rates compared to the previous quarter. Rents on new lease improved to 1% from a 1% decline witnessed in the previous quarter.As of Jun 30, 2017, Aimco held cash and restricted cash on hand of $49.1 million. Moreover, the estimated fair market value of the company’s unencumbered apartment communities came in at $1.8 billion.Further, at the end of the quarter, Aimco’s outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility were $246 million and available capacity was $343 million, after considering $11 million of letters of credit backed by the facility.Portfolio ActivityDuring the quarter, Aimco invested $47 million in redevelopment and development. The company increased its revenue per apartment home by 7% to $2,038. Additionally, it enhanced the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio. Specifically, the percentage of A, B and C+ home came in at 53%, 33% and 14% in second-quarter 2017 compared with 50%, 37% and 13% , recorded respectively in the year-ago quarter.     GuidanceFor third-quarter 2017, Aimco provided pro forma FFO per share guidance in the band of 60–64.

This marks a 9% year-over-year increase. The dividend will be paid on Aug 31 to stockholders of record as of Aug 18, 2017.Bottom LineAimco has a solid portfolio, diversified in terms of geography and price point. Furthermore, the company has been revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and greater-than-expected growth.  Its efforts to reduce costs resulted in significant growth in Same Store NOI.Other than improvement in Same Store NOI, Aimco’s new construction and redevelopment activities also contributed to its bottom line.However, of late, Aimco has been witnessing sluggish rent growth in certain locations due to competition from new supply. The company’s elaborate construction project plans, along with planned capital replacement spending, remain key concerns. Moreover, even if the divestitures and its exit from the Asset Management business pay off in the long run, the company’s near-term adverse effects on earnings cannot be bypassed.Aimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

40,BXP,"Affiliated Managers Group Inc. (AMG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 31. Its earnings and revenues are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Assets under management (AUM) witnessed growth. However, marginally lower revenues along with elevated expenses were the headwinds.Affiliated Managers boasts an impressive earning surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.6%.The positive earnings surprises have supported a 23.1% year-to-date rally of the stock versus the 21.9% growth of the industry it belongs to.Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post Q2 earnings? It depends on the company’s ability to impress the market with an earnings beat and improved financials.According to our proven model, chances of Affiliated Managers beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Affiliated Managers is -0.31%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $3.23 is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.24.Zacks Rank: Affiliated Managers has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a positive ESP is needed to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsAffiliated Managers holds an almost unbeaten track record of buying equity interests in asset management companies with strong performance-oriented products. The past equity investments should continue boosting the company’s top line, driven by the excellent long-term performance of its affiliates.Management expects the ratio of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to average AUM in the range of 12.8–13.1 basis points (bps) for the quarter. Further, other economic items are projected to be around $1 million per quarter.On the cost front, management projects total interest expenses of around $22 million in the second quarter, almost unchanged sequentially. Also, amortization expenses are projected to be $38 million, almost in line on a sequential basis.However, activities of the company in the second quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained stable over the last seven days.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Boston Properties, Inc.

42,BXP,"Houston, TX-based office REIT Parkway, Inc.  announced that its merger with an affiliate of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) has been considered and approved by the company’s stockholders.In a special meeting, 85.58% of outstanding common shares and shares of limited voting stock voted in favor of the proposed merger. This class of common and voting stock consisted 99.68% of the total votes cast at the meeting.On Jun 30, Parkway announced that it has struck a definitive agreement to be acquired by CPPIB for $1.2 billion.Per the agreement, Parkway’s shareholders will receive $23.05 per share, comprising $19.05 per share merger consideration and a $4 special dividend. The share price consideration denotes a premium of around 14.3%, when compared to Parkway's 30-day volume weighted average price ended Jun 29, 2017. (Read more: Parkway to be Acquired by Canada Pension Plan for $1.2B)The company also announced a special cash dividend of $4 per share of common stock. The dividend will be paid to shareholders of record as of Oct 9, 2017. However, the payment is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions to the closing of the merger.   The deal, which is conditioned upon customary closing norms, is expected to close on or around Oct 12, 2017.Notably, Parkway enjoys ownership of the largest office portfolio in Houston. Positioned in favorable areas of Greenway, Galleria and Westchase submarkets of Houston, this portfolio consists of five Class A assets, comprising 19 buildings, and aggregates around 8.7 rentable square feet of space. This portfolio was 87.6% leased as of Mar 31, 2017, and its tenants came from a broad mix of industries, including financial services, technology and commodities businesses.However, the company has been facing a challenging time amid the lackluster energy market which has crippled the Houston office market. Nonetheless, the U.S. office vacancy rate remained steady at 13% in the second quarter amid balanced demand-supply, according to a CBRE Group report. In around half of the U.S. office markets, vacancy recorded a decline and the national office vacancy rate is hovering close to its post-recession low.Additionally, corporate profits are up and business confidence has recovered. Going forward, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, demand for office space is expected to shoot up. This will drive growth for office real estate investment trusts like Piedmont Office Realty Trust (PDM  -  Free Report), Cousin Properties Incorporated (CUZ  -  Free Report) and Boston Properties, Inc. (BXP  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

43,BXP,"Boston Properties Inc’s (BXP  -  Free Report) efforts to concentrate its portfolio around a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets helped the company achieve an annual compounded revenue growth rate of 8.17% over the last five years. However, the geographic concentration of the company’s assets makes it susceptible to economic downturns.Although the company has been witnessing subpar demand for its office space, we anticipate a healthy increase in demand due to economic improvement and recovery in the job market. This is because, as the economy revives, business grows, and therefore corporate sectors seek expansion, renting more space to accommodate the increased workforce. Specifically, growth in demand for office space continues to be fueled by the technology and life science businesses.The company’s tenant roster includes several industry bellwethers such as the U.S. Government, Biogen, Citibank, Bank of America and Wellington Management. With such a diversified tenant and industry base, the company remains well poised to record steady rental revenue growth in the near term.Boston Properties has been enhancing its portfolio quality through a repositioning program by acquisitions, divestitures and development of properties in core markets. In fact, in July 2016, it obtained a 49.8% stake in the Colorado Center in Santa Monica, CA, for a gross price of roughly $511.1 million. This buyout marked the company’s foray into the expanding Westside Los Angeles market.Beyond acquisitions, the company has also been pursuing active monetization of its assets. For this, it focuses on the disposition of its non-core assets. The company’s target for dispositions in 2017 remains around $200 million. Its consistent efforts to shed assets and recycle the proceeds in desired markets are anticipated to benefit Boston Properties over the long run.Moreover, the company has registered a five-year annual dividend growth rate of 4.87%. Given its decent financial position and low payout ratio compared to the industry average, we anticipate this trend to continue.However, Boston Properties has extensive development plans which increase its operational risks by exposing the company to escalating construction costs, entitlement delays and lease-up risks. In fact, at the end of second-quarter 2017, its development pipeline comprised eight new projects and two redevelopments, aggregating 4.7 million square feet.Additionally, growth in supply of office space in the market remains a concern because higher supply curtails the landlord’s capability to demand more rents. There is also a trend of increased concessions in some of the markets.Further, hike in interest rate is a concern for Boston Properties. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company, which would affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate, and lower dividend payouts as well.The stock has lost 3.8% year to date, underperforming 3.9% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to. Boston Properties currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Getty Realty Corporation (GTY  -  Free Report), Seritage Growth Properties  and Communications Sales & Leasing, Inc. (UNIT  -  Free Report).While Getty Realty and Seritage sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Communications Sales & Leasing carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Over the past 30 days, Getty Realty’s full-year 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share estimates climbed 7.8% to $1.94.Seritage’s full-year 2017 FFO per share estimates inched up 0.5% to $2.01 in the past month.Communications Sales & Leasing’s full-year 2017 FFO per share estimates moved up 14.4% to $2.54 over the same time frame.Note: All EPS numbers presented in this write up represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.

Results indicated an improvement in portfolio revenues, and development and management services revenues. Deferring certain expenses from this quarter to the second half of the year also benefited the results.Total revenue during the quarter increased 5.4% year over year to $657 million. The figure also comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $630.93 million. The increase was primarily supported by higher rental revenues.

The range is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55.    Our ViewpointBoston Properties is well poised for growth, backed by properties located in select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets, diversified tenant and industry base. Also, with economic improvement and recovery in job market, healthy growth in demand for office spaces is expected, in turn, strengthening the company’s growth opportunities.  However, several big companies are choosing to resize their businesses and contain costs, which are leading to lower demand for office space. In addition, there is growth in supply of office space in the market and this remains a concern because higher supply usually leads to lesser absorption and curtails the landlord’s capability to demand more rents.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

45,BXP,"Rayonier Inc. (RYN  -  Free Report) — a timberland real estate investment trust (REIT) — is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2, after market closes. While the company’s funds from operations (“FFO”) per share for the quarter are anticipated to improve year over year, revenues might see a decline.Currently, the company’s second-quarter 2017 earnings estimate per share is pegged at 11 cents. Rayonier’s first-quarter 2017 pro forma net income per share came in at 5 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents.Over the trailing four quarters, Rayonier beat estimates in three occasions and missed in the other, recording an average beat of 72.8%. The graph below depicts this surprise history: Rayonier Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Rayonier Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Rayonier Inc. QuoteFactors to Influence Q2 ResultsRayonier’s portfolio of timberlands enjoys geographical diversity and is located in the productive timber-producing regions of the U.S. Recent developments in the field of biogenetics and cloning have significantly benefited this timberland REIT’s business.  The company is aimed at consistently monetizing higher and better uses (HBU) properties through rural land sales for raising the value of its portfolio. Additionally, the favorable demand-supply dynamics has enhanced the company’s pricing power.However, Rayonier faces cut-throat competition in the market from national and local players. Increasing rivalry from a variety of substitute products, like non-wood and engineered wood products only add to its woes. The company is subject to foreign exchange fluctuations because a number of its segments export products outside the nation.Timberland REITs have to comply with strict regulatory requirements compared with other industries. These laws and regulations, which are subject to frequent changes, adversely affect Rayonier’s business. Further, due to the very nature of the properties, timberland REITs are required to follow eco-friendly mandates in their trade.In addition, Rayonier’s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q2 FFO remained unchanged at 11 cents over the last 60 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Rayonier will likely beat earning estimates this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents, which translates into an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Rayonier’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) reduces the predictive power of ESP.However, the stock has gained 9% year to date, outperforming 11.4% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:CyrusOne Inc.

46,BXP,"Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Aug 2.Last quarter, this retail real estate investment trust (“REIT”) delivered a positive surprise of 1.40% with respect to funds from operations (“FFO”) per share. Results reflect growth in revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates on three occasions and missed in the other period. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 0.53%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company.Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS Surprise  Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Federal Realty Investment Trust QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.However, Federal Realty’s shares have descended 6.5% year to date, against the industry’s loss of 4.2%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFederal Realty’s portfolio of premium retail assets – mainly situated in the major coastal markets from Washington, D.C. to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles – along with a diverse tenant base, positions it well for decent growth.Particularly, amid a fast changing retail environment, the company is making concerted efforts to reposition, redevelop and re-merchandise its portfolio. This includes an upgrade of the tenant mix. Such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term. However, their short-term adverse impact on occupancy and net operating income cannot be bypassed.Moreover, mall traffic continues to dwindle amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences, with non-store sales rising considerably. This has led to significant store closures and retailers’ bankruptcy, thereby adversely marring demand for retail real estate space. This choppy retail real estate environment is anticipated to adversely affect the company’s performance in Q2.Hence, prior to the second-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company’s business activities and prospects.

47,BXP,"Boston Properties, Inc. (BXP  -  Free Report) is expected to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, after the market closes.Last quarter, this REIT, which mainly owns and develops Class A office real estates in the U.S., delivered lower-than-expected performance in terms of funds from operations (“FFO”) per share, witnessing a negative surprise of 1.33%. The company experienced a fall in rental revenues in the quarter.Nevertheless, Boston Properties has a mixed surprise history. In fact, the company exceeded estimates in two occasions for as many misses, over the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 0.70%. This is depicted in the graph below:Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Properties, Inc. QuoteBoston Properties lost 5.2% of its value, year to date, versus 3.4% growth of its industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Boston Properties is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) to beat estimates, and Public Storage has the right mix.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.63 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62, is +0.62%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise.Zacks Rank: Boston Properties’ Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season.What's Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Boston Properties’ assets are primarily concentrated in select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets. The company’s solid tenant and industry base, including several bellwethers, ensure steady rental revenue growth. Over the past five years, it recorded annual revenue growth rate of 8.17%. This trend is likely to have continued in the second quarter as well.Notably, the U.S. office vacancy rate remained steady at 13% in the second quarter amid a balanced demand-supply environment, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm – CBRE Group Inc. (CBG). In around half of the U.S. office markets, vacancy recorded a decline and the national office vacancy rate is hovering close to its post-recession low.In fact, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, healthy growth in demand for office spaces is likely to have continued in the company’s markets in the quarter under review. Particularly, growth in demand for office space is anticipated to have been fueled by technology and life sciences businesses in the to-be-reported quarter.The company projects second-quarter FFO per share in the range of $1.61–$1.63.Amid these, reflecting analysts’ bullishness on the stock, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter FFO per share inched up 0.6% to $1.62 over the last 30 days.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:CyrusOne Inc. (CONE  -  Free Report), likely to release earnings on Aug 2, has an Earnings ESP of +2.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc.

48,BXP,"DDR Corp. (DDR  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share of 30 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. However, the number declined 3 cents from the prior-year quarter.Dilutive effect of deleveraging generated through sale of assets was primarily responsible for the decline in FFO.This real estate investment trust (REIT) posted revenues of $227.4 million for the second quarter, marginally missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $228 million. The figure also came in lower than $245.8 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.DDR Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  DDR Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DDR Corp. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Quarter in DetailDDR signed 258 new and renewal leases for 1.9 million square feet of space during the quarter. On a pro rata basis and including Puerto Rico, the company generated new leasing spreads of 10% and renewal leasing spreads of 5.7% for the quarter. Also, same-store net operating income (NOI), including Puerto Rico, edged down 0.1% year over year on a pro rata basis.As of Jun 30, 2017, the company’s portfolio was 93.7% leased, down 240 basis points from the prior-year quarter end. Annualized base rent per occupied square foot increased 7.8% on a pro rata basis to $16.09 as of Jun 30, 2017, from $14.92 at the end of the year-ago quarter.During the reported quarter, DDR completed its strategic planning and portfolio review process timely. Consequently, the company realized $28.1 million of impairment charges on two undeveloped land parcels and a shopping centre. It also sold two Puerto Rico based shopping centers for $57.3 million. Nine shopping centers in the U.S. were sold for an aggregate price of $149.2 million, of which DDR’s share totaled $137.5 million.DDR exited the second quarter with $414.1 million in cash compared with $30.4 million as of Dec 31, 2016.2017 Outlook Remains UnchangedThe company’s expectation regarding its same-store NOI growth rate remained constant in the range of -1.5–0.0%.Bottom LineDDR deleveraged its balance sheet and stretched the average debt maturity period by selling off assets and gaining access to capital markets. This resulted in asset sale and loan repayment proceeds of $237.5 million, aggregating to $225.7 million. Recovering from large scale tenant bankruptcy, the company displayed strong financial results and efficient operational execution.However, declining same-store net operating income growth, fall in occupancy and the dilutive effects of divestitures cannot be ignored. Also, rate hike and competition from other retailers, such as e-commerce and catalogs, add to its woes.Currently, DDR carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

The company reported the same FFO a year ago.Total revenue for the quarter was $297 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues also comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $292 million.Adjusted revenues came in at $292.8 million, up 2% from the prior-year quarter.At the end of the quarter, pro rata occupancy came in at 95.5%, reflecting a sequential increase of 20 basis points (bps).Same-property net operating income (NOI) inched up 0.3% year over year. Pro rata rental-rate leasing spreads grew 10.5%, with rental rates for new leases and renewals/options, increasing 17% and 7.8%, respectively.Kimco Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kimco Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kimco Realty Corporation QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Balance Sheet PositionKimco exited second-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of around $143.1 million, up from $142.5 million at year-end 2016.The company also received $23.7 million as cash distribution from its investment in Albertsons LLC.Portfolio ActivityDuring the quarter, the company announced acquisitions of a parcel for $700 million. Kimco share of the purchase price was $340 million. The parcel located in Augusta, GA, is adjacent to the company’s Augusta Exchange shopping center.On the other hand, its second-quarter sales aggregated $155.8 million, with Kimco’s share of sale price $128.1 million.

The company projects FFO as adjusted per share in the $1.50–$1.54 band. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 is currently pegged at $1.52.Notably, the company estimates the U.S. portfolio occupancy to be in the range of 95.8–96.2%, same-property NOI (including redevelopments) to grow 2–3%, operating property acquisitions of $300–$400 million and dispositions of $300–$400 million.Dividend UpdateKimco’s board of directors announced a quarterly cash dividend of 27 cents. The dividend will be paid on Oct 16 to shareholders of record as of Oct 4, 2017.Our ViewpointThe company remains on track with its strategic 2020 Vision, which envisages the disposal of non strategic assets and ownership of premium assets in major metro markets in the U.S. This is reflected in its portfolio restructuring activities in the quarter. With premium properties in high-income and high-growth areas, Kimco is well poised for growth.However, we note that mall traffic continues to decline owing to a change in shopping patterns. Online purchases have taken precedence over in-store purchase. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures. Further, retailers not being able to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies. This has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs like Kimco, as this trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably.Kimco currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereThe stock has lost 21.5% year to date, underperforming the 3.8% decline of the industry it belongs to.We now look forward to the earnings releases of other REITs like Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust (RPT  -  Free Report), Boston Properties, Inc.

50,BXP,"Highwoods Properties Inc. (HIW  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) of 90 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. This also compares favorably with the year-ago number of 82 cents.Results reflect robust growth in same-property net operating income (NOI) and strong leasing metrics.Total revenue for the quarter increased 6.2% year over year to $177 million.

QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Quarter in DetailHighwoods leased 575,000 square feet of second-generation office space during the quarter. Same property cash NOI rose 5.3% year over year.The company announced development projects worth $99 million, which is 77% pre-leased. Also, the company put in place $208 million development in service, which is 96% leased.As of Jun 30, 2017, Highwoods had $13.3 million of cash and cash equivalents compared with $49.5 million as of Dec 31, 2016.2017 OutlookHighwoods revised its 2017 FFO per share guidance range to $3.33–$3.38 from the previous range of $3.29–$3.40. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is currently pegged at $3.37.Our ViewpointImproving operating performance reflects bright prospects for the company. Highwood is making concerted efforts to expand its footprint in high-growth markets and enhance portfolio quality through strategic asset allocation and disposal.It is particularly focusing on high-quality office assets in best business districts (BBDs). The company’s diverse portfolio with top tenants in its roster and a robust balance sheet bode well for growth.  However, Highwoods faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, as well as other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from its tenants. This restricts the company’s ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors. It has significant exposure to office assets and interest-rate fluctuations. Huge development pipeline adds to operational risks.Highwoods currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

51,BXP,"Welltower Inc.  is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results, before the market opens on Jul 28. Its funds from operations (“FFO”) per share and revenues might see a year-over-year decline.Last quarter, this healthcare real estate investment trust (“REIT”) delivered an in-line performance. The company also recorded adjusted senior housing operating same-store net operating income (NOI) growth of 1.9% year over year.Over the trailing four quarters, Welltower posted in-line FFO in one occasion and beat estimates in the other three, recording an average positive surprise of 0.9%. The graph below depicts this surprise history: Welltower Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Welltower Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Welltower Inc. QuoteIn addition, year to date, Welltower’s stock has outperformed the industry it belongs to. While the company’s shares gained 9.3%, the industry rallied 4.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsWelltower’s efforts to enhance its healthcare real estate portfolio quality through prudent asset allocation and disposal, along with its diversified portfolio, are anticipated to boost its performance in the quarter to be reported. Additionally, rising senior citizen population will likely prove conducive to growth.The company establishes business relationships with experienced healthcare management companies or operators who lease its properties on a long-term basis, cushioning it from short-term market shocks. Also, the healthcare sector is relatively immune to macroeconomic headwinds faced by the office, retail and apartment companies, in turn, offering stability to Welltower amid market volatility.However, interest rate hike remains a concern for Welltower due to its high exposure to long-term leased assets. Any rise in rates escalates the cost of financing acquisitions, investment and development activity expenses, and lowers the amount that third parties would be ready to pay for the company’s assets at disposal.In addition, increased deliveries in certain markets are likely to adversely affect the company's pricing power and occupancy. Further, intense competition from national and local healthcare operators curtails the company’s power to significantly improve its top line and ink deals at attractive rates.As part of its portfolio-repositioning efforts, Welltower has been aggressively disposing its assets and acquiring new ones. Though such efforts are commendable, the earnings dilutive effects and upfront costs involved cannot be bypassed.Furthermore, Welltower’s activities during the quarter failed to gain adequate analyst confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations for the second quarter edged down 0.94% over the last 60 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Welltower will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.
