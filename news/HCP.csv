0,HCP,"2016 has been a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde year for real estate investment trusts. A pleasant first half of the year turned into a nasty second half as interest rate jitters fueled selling in the sector.Starting in late July, IBD's property REIT group, long known as a safe-haven play, pulled back nearly 16%, putting the sector pretty much in bear-market territory.
"
1,HCP,"But don't give up on REITs just yet. The group, known for the stocks' hefty dividend yields, has bounced up 8% from its Nov. 11 low, and analysts and fund managers point toward an improving economy as a catalyst in coming quarters.
"
2,HCP,"An individual investor might ask: Why would I want to invest in REITs to generate income in a higher interest-rate environment?
"
3,HCP,"It's a valid question because higher interest rates raise debt-financing costs, and REITs are known for carrying debt due to their acquisitive nature.
"
4,HCP,"Special Report: Dividend And Income Investing
"
5,HCP,"Ask investment professionals the question and you get this answer: REITs can do quite well in a rising interest rate environment, so long as rates are going up as a result of a strengthening economy. That seems to be the case now.
"
6,HCP,"Edward Mui, a Morningstar equity research analyst specializing in REITs, still likes the fundamental outlook for REITs, particularly in areas like health care properties, shopping centers and apartments.
"
7,HCP,"According to Mui, senior housing REITs still have an aging population working in their favor, and a shift toward private pay sources insulates them from potential changes to the Affordable Care Act as a result of Donald Trump's presidential win. He follows names like HCP Inc. (HCP), Welltower (HCN) and Ventas (VTR). All three boast annualized dividend yields of around 5%. They're all more than 20% off recent 52-week highs.
"
8,HCP,"Several senior housing REITs have been mainstays in IBD's Dividend Leaders screen in recent weeks, including Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH) and Sabra Health Care (SBRA).
"
9,HCP,"You can find IBD's lists of Dividend Leaders, REIT Leaders and Utilities Leaders, which highlight companies with steady and growing dividends as well as ready profit growth, at the Investors.com under Stock Lists/IBD Data Tables and also in the IBD Weekly print edition on the Income  Investor page.
"
10,HCP,"In the apartment space, Mui follows Equity Residential (EQR) and AvalonBay (AVB). Both REITs have big presences in coastal and gateway cities like Boston, New York, Seattle, San Francisco and Southern California. Equity Residential has a more urban focus. AvalonBay is more known for its suburban developments.
"
11,HCP,"""A wave of new apartment supply has hit the market recently, driven by underlying secular demand from millennials,"" said Mui. ""They've been pushing back decisions like buying a house, and that's a trend that's likely to continue.""

12,HCP,"John Snowden has a third of Resource Real Estate Diversifed Income Fund in REITS.
"
13,HCP,"John Snowden, portfolio manager at Resource Real Estate Diversified Income Fund (RREDX), has a third of his fund invested in REITs, another third in real estate credit and the final third in real estate private equity. The fund's objective is to provide a 6% annual return to shareholders with more modest capital appreciation of 2-3%.
"
14,HCP,"Snowden's fund is an interval fund with around $200 million under management. Interval funds have been around for four to five years and have been growing in popularity due to low volatility. Rather than provide daily liquidity like a normal mutual fund, the fund offers quarterly liquidity.
"
15,HCP,"""By giving up a little liquidity, we're able to invest more in the private markets where we can generate excess returns because of longer time horizons and less volatility,"" said Snowden.
"
16,HCP,"Snowden attended the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts's REITWorld conference last month in Arizona. He says the general consensus among management he talked to was that business is still strong and the outlook over the next 12 months is positive.
"
17,HCP,"At the end of the third quarter, Snowden's top-weighted REIT holdings included Communications Sales & Leasing (CSAL), Blackstone Mortgage Trust (BXMT) and New Residential Investment (NRZ). The latter two offer big yields of 8% and 12%, respectively. But keep in mind that such lofty yields generally come with higher risk.
"
18,HCP,"Calvin Schnure expects to see continued fundamental strength in the REIT sector.
"
19,HCP,"Calvin Schnure, senior vice president of research and economic analysis at NAREIT, noted that the current situation for REITs is similar to 2004 when the Fed embarked on a series of rate hikes. Rates had been low for a long period of time, inflation was contained and the Fed was ready to normalize rates. REITs initially weakened but eventually outperformed the S&P 500 in double-digit terms over the subsequent two to three years of rate hikes by the Fed.
"
20,HCP,"As for REITs' ability to outperform in 2017, Schnure noted that while there's some uncertainty about how President-elect Trump's policies will unfold, it shouldn't affect underlying strong fundamentals in the sector.
"
21,HCP,"""The commercial real estate expansion cycle should continue for some time, there are no signs of overbuilding and the U.S. economy doesn't look vulnerable. All the ingredients are in place for a good year ahead,"" he said.
"
22,HCP,"Schnure also points toward reasonable valuations in the REIT sector. ""The price-to-FFO ratio is in the lower half of what the range has been for the past half-decade. This is not an overvalued sector at all,"" he said.
"
23,HCP,"Schnure also pointed out a recent NAREIT-sponsored study by Wilshire Associates regarding income-oriented retirement planning. Research from Wilshire Funds Management based on portfolio optimizations using 40 years of investment return data through 2015 showed that adding high income-generating assets like REITs to a traditional retirement portfolio could boost income returns by nearly 40%, while providing similar total returns and no increase in risk.
"
24,HCP,"IBD'S TAKE:
"
25,HCP,"Many property REITs in IBD's database are trying to put in a bottom after modest pullbacks, but others are showing resilience and holding near highs, with compelling charts.
"
26,HCP,"Savvy income investors should look for renewed signs of accumulation, or institutional buying, in the group. During the week ended Nov. 11, the group reversed higher, rising 1%. Volume was heavy, and it closed in the upper half of its  weekly range. That was a sign of support from institutional buyers. The group still has some potential resistance (selling pressure) to work through, so more weekly price gains on above-average volume would help the group's cause.
"
27,HCP,"Here's a look at two REITs in healthy technical setups at the moment:
"
28,HCP,"EastGroup Properties (EGP) recently had an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A as it works on the right side of a cup-shaped base with a 76.10 buy point
"
29,HCP,"Meanwhile, health care REIT CareTrust (CTRE) is near the top of 14-week, cup-shaped base with a 15.97 buy point.

"
33,HCP,"Stocks booked broad losses Wednesday after the Federal Reserve finally pulled the trigger on its second rate hike in a decade, and guided expectations to three more increases in the coming year.The S&P 500 fell 0.8%. The Dow slipped 0.6%, while the Nasdaq shed 0.5%. Small caps tumbled hard, sending the Russell 2000 down 1.2%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in higher than Tuesday's level. Nasdaq volume fell slightly.Markets hunkered down ahead of the 2 p.m. ET announcement, then turned sharply lower after 2:15. The downside also received an assist from oil prices, which veered 4% lower on news that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production in November.That sent ExxonMobil (XOM) down 1.9%, the worst loss among Dow stocks. Energy issues took four of the five worst losses among S&P 500 listings.But at the bottom of the S&P 500 heap was Universal Health Services (UHS). The hospital operator dived 8% in huge trade after Raymond James downgraded the stock to market perform, from outperform. The report cited Sen. Chuck Grassley's request for an update on a federal investigation of the company.Hospital peers Tenet HealthCare (THC) and HCP (HCP) dropped more than 4% each.Nvidia (NVDA) easily topped the Nasdaq 100, ending up 6% after an upgrade to buy, from hold, by Evercore ISI Group. The note also placed a 120 price target on the IBD 50 stock.  Shares remain just below Thursday's high, and extend from an early November rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) popped 3% after Oppenheimer upgraded shares to outperform from neutral, with a target price of 80.

"
34,HCP,"While exchange traded funds are ideal for producing short- and long-term investment gains, many ETFs can be deployed to generate steady income from stock dividends and bond interest.ETF investment strategies for generating income fall into five main categories:The highest yielding U.S. bond ETF tracked by Morningstar Inc. right now is SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK). Its 12- month yield sits near 6%. It's followed by First Trust Tactical High Yield (HYLS) yielding 5.6% and SPDR Short-Term High Yield Bond ETF (SJNK) yielding 5.5%.But seeing a fat yield on an ETF can be misleading. A big payout doesn't mean as much if the fund's total return is slipping. JNK has returned 11.31% year to date and an average annual 2.53% the past three years. That compares with 7.16% and 4.13% for HYLS and 10.8% and 1.64% for SJNK.Ranked by three-year returns, the top performer is Pimco 25+ Year Zero Coupon U.S. Treasury (ZROZ), up an average annual 18.39% the past three years and 20.44% year to date, and yielding just over 2%. It is followed by Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury (EDV), up 17.1% and 18.6% over the respective periods, and yielding 2.4%. Next is iShares 20 Year Treasury Bond, at 11.8% and 13.1%, and yielding 2.2%.Junk bonds and long-duration Treasury bonds are subject to bouts of heightened volatility, which investors looking for income often seek to avoid. So they're better off using ETFs that track these kinds of bonds as part of a diversified portfolio that contains steadier bonds.The benchmark for diversified bond portfolios is the Barclays Aggregate Bond index, which is made up of a broad array of investment-grade bonds. The index is tracked by iShares Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG), which has $190 billion in assets. It's up 5% year to date and an average annual 3.96% the past three years. It yields 2.3%.Those who prefer bonds need to be aware that anticipated interest-rate hikes could affect potential returns.In general, bond ETFs with higher durations will be more negatively impacted than those with shorter durations as expectations increase for higher rates. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of bond price to changes in interest rates. Duration is tied to a bond's maturity, or the date at which the bond's principal is repaid to lenders. Investors can check an ETF's website for the average duration.For example, if rates rise, a long-term ETF such as iShares 20 Year Treasury (TLT) incurs more interest rate risk than iShares 3-7 Year Treasury (IEI), notes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF Research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.""In short, if rates trend higher over time, returns for bond ETFs will be negatively impacted, but not equally,"" he said. ""However, one rate hike by the Fed should not be that impactful.""The highest yielding ETFs can bring big payouts, but if the quality of their holdings declines, the total return could be sapped by declining prices in unfavorable markets. The top yielding dividend stock ETF is Global X SuperDividend Alternatives (ALTY), paying out 8.2% of its stock price annually. It's a small, young ETF with just $3 million in assets and without a three-year record. It's up almost 19% this year.Its older and bigger sibling, $807.4 million Global X SuperDividend (SDIV), yields 6.7% and has gained 12% this year and an average annual 11.27% the past three years.High-yield stock investors tend to prefer stocks whose declines are about over. In that way investors can reap big payouts for each dollar invested with the hopes of capital appreciation as the business turns around. Not all ETFs screens for stocks in this way. One that does is Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (DIV). Its index methodology screens for stocks that have exhibited low betas relative to the S&P 500 in an effort to produce low-volatility of returns. It's up 9% this year and has risen an average annual 6.8% the past three years. Top holdings include Cone Midstream Partners (CNNX) and Invesco Mortgage Capital (IVR).At the other end of the spectrum, lower yielding ETFs invest in companies that have a long history of increasing dividends. Only top quality companies can increase payouts year after year, and they tend to be in big demand by investors looking for steady capital appreciation. Their stock prices rarely get whacked to the point where they have big yields.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index. It holds 185 stocks, each of which has grown dividends annually for 10 years or more. It yields 2.1% vs. SPDR S&P 500's (SPY) 2%. Top holdings include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT) and Pepsi (PEP)ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) holds 50 stocks, a smaller list that reflects a higher barrier to entry -- each holding has raised dividends every year for 25 years or more. It yields 1.8%. Top holdings include Cintas (CTAS), W.W. Grainger (GWW) and S&P Global (SPGI).SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), which invests in dividend aristocrats from the S&P Composite 1500, has jumped 15% year to date. It yields 2.4%. Top holdings include property REIT HCP (HCP), People's United Financial (PBCT) and Caterpillar (CAT).Safe to say, MLPs are best left to the pros who know when to get in or out, or how to use them as portfolio diversifiers.Morningstar tracks 20 REIT ETFs. The top-performing one year to date is Global X SuperDividend REIT (SRET). It's up 27.4% this year and yields about 8%, the third-highest. The index it tracks, the Solactive Global SuperDividend REIT index, invests in 30 of the highest dividend-yielding REITs in the world with the least amount of volatility.Nearly all of the $33 million ETF's assets are invested in North America. Top holdings include mortgage REITs Annaly Capital Management (NLY), which yields 10.1%, and Chimera Investment (CIM), yielding nearly 12%, as well as property REIT Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH) yielding 6.6%. The REIT was launched in March 2015.The biggest REIT ETF is $35.59 billion Vanguard REIT (VNQ). It's up 14% year to date and yields 3.3%. Its top holdings along with their year-to-date price performance include Simon Property (SPG), up 12%, Public Storage[ticker symb=PSA] down 7%, and Prologis (PLD) up 30%. They all yield about 3%.Convertible bonds are bonds that can be exchanged for a set number of the issuing company's common stock. They tend to carry lower interest than normal corporate bonds but have the potential for greater price appreciation.The top performing ETF in this area year to date is $471 million VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials (PFXF). It's up 12% and yields 5.6%. The largest is $17.86 billion iShares U.S. Preferred Stock (PFF). It's up 3.8% this year and yields 5.74%.RELATED:The Latest ETF News

Year over year, the index is up 5.3%.New home sales popped in May to an annualized rate of 546,000, according to the Commerce Department. That was up from April's (upwardly revised) 534,000 pace, well above consensus expectations of 525,000 and the strongest number since Feb. 2008.A bit less rosy was the preliminary June manufacturing estimate from researcher Markit. Its Purchasing Managers Manufacturing Index was at 53.4, down from May's 53.8 number and below forecasts for an increase to 54.2. The number points to a third month of slowing activity and is the gauge's weakest gain in 18 months.In stocks, it was a good morning for Florida-based companies.Darden Restaurants (DRI) rose 3% to lead the S&P 500 by a wide margin. The Orlando-based owner of the Olive Garden, Red Lobster and other chains reported healthy fiscal fourth-quarter results and announced plans to slice off a portion of its real estate assets into a separate real estate investment trust. The stock popped to a new high, paring some gains but holding just above a cup-base buy point of 70.48.Citrix Systems (CTXS) pecked out a 2% gain, the best increase among Nasdaq 100 stocks. The Fort Lauderdale-headquartered software developer is still in buying range, 4% above a 69.33 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Among leaders, most of the IBD 50 list posted modest gains and losses — with a couple of dramatic exceptions.Ambarella (AMBA) led the list with a 9% rebound. The stock tumbled 21% Monday, following a short-seller's report on Friday that questioned the stock's valuation. The stock remains extended after a mid-May rebound from 10-week support and is well above its 10-week moving average.At the bottom of the group, burger joint Sonic (SONC) dived 11% in massive trade. Fiscal third quarter sales and profits met consensus expectations, but full-year earnings guidance didn't. The sell-off stopped at a test of the stock's 10-week moving average, seriously damaging efforts to shape a three-month cup base.

The increase may hurt health care real estate investment trusts (REITs) and companies including Brookdale Senior Living (BKD) of Brentwood, Tenn., which is buying competitor Emeritus (ESC) for about $1.4 billion to become the biggest owner of senior properties, Green Street says.

101,HCP,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) is rumored to be selling the company’s 22 Brookdale-managed senior housing properties for $428 million to New York firm — Apollo Global Management LLC (APO  -  Free Report) — per a Bloomberg news. Earlier this June, the company announced that it has entered into definitive deals for selling those 22 properties, having 2,781 units, to an institutional investor.This healthcare REIT has been selling several of its senior housing assets in a bid to improve the quality of the company’s senior housing portfolio, strengthen balance sheet and lower the Brookdale Senior Living Inc. operator concentration.  Particularly, HCP has reaped $332 million of proceeds through completion of the disposition of its residual investment in the RIDEA II senior housing joint venture (JV) to an investor group led by Columbia Pacific Advisors, LLC. Notably, this JV owned 49 communities and 46 of those were managed by Brookdale. Moreover, HCP completed the sale of six assets to Brookdale for $275 million. This was done through disposition of one asset in January and five in April. Last year, HCP also accomplished the sale of a portfolio of 64 triple-net assets leased to Brookdale to affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate Partners VIII L.P., for $1.125 billion.Further, this March, the company announced the transition of management of a portfolio of 24 HCP-owned senior housing communities from Brookdale to Atria Senior Living, Inc., and has already transitioned 18 of those.These efforts are expected to benefit HCP’s senior housing portfolio in a number of ways. Specifically, the operator diversification of the portfolio will improve and the revamped portfolio will have stronger demographics, while the company’s balance sheet is likely to strengthen with the sale proceeds.On the other hand, HCP is focused on making opportunistic acquisitions to enhance its overall portfolio mix. The company acquired Hayden Research Campus in the Boston life-science market in December 2017 and is experiencing strong leasing velocity. Moreover, in March 2018, the company acquired development rights at Hayden for $21 million and its planned 214,000-square-foot Class A development is expected to improve the company’s scale in this leading life-science market.Also, the company started the Phase I of Sierra Point, which marks its next key life-science development in the South San Francisco market. In fact, increasing longevity of the aging U.S. population, along with biopharma drug development growth opportunities, has promoted life science and medical-market fundamentals, and this trend will likely continue in the upcoming years, giving significant impetus for growth to HCP.Over time, with the diligent measures, the company aims at having more than half of its business comprising specialty office segments of medical office and life science, and lower senior housing concentration to around 40%.HCP currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

102,HCP,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) has undertaken portfolio-repositioning measures in a bid to improve the quality of its senior housing portfolio and lower the concentration of Brookdale Senior Living Inc. Earlier in this month, HCP provided an update about such efforts and it seems right on track to achieve its target.In fact, over time, with diligent measures, the company aims at having more than half of its business comprising specialty office segments of medical office and life science, and lower senior housing concentration to around 40%. The focus on having a diversified private pay portfolio is likely to drive long-term growth.Nevertheless, the softness in the seniors housing market fundamentals amid new supply is anticipated to thwart the company’s pricing power. Further, the hike in interest rate and stiff competition remain concerns for the company.Per its recent update, HCP has reaped $332 million of proceeds through the completion of the disposition of its residual investment in the RIDEA II senior housing joint venture (JV) to an investor group led by Columbia Pacific Advisors, LLC. Notably, this JV owned 49 communities and 46 of them were managed by Brookdale.Regarding Brookdale 25 asset sales, the company has already accomplished the disposition of five communities for $32 million and is under contract to sell another 15 communities for $98 million. The remaining five assets are expected to be either sold or transitioned this year too.Further, HCP is focused on making acquisitions to enhance its overall portfolio mix. The company acquired Hayden Research Campus in the Boston life-science market in December 2017 and is experiencing strong leasing velocity. Moreover, in March 2018, the company acquired development rights at Hayden for $21 million and its planned 214,000-square-foot Class A development is expected to improve the company’s scale in this leading life science market. Also, the company started Phase I of Sierra Point, which marks its next key life-science development in the South San Francisco market.In fact, increasing longevity of the aging U.S. population, along with growth opportunities related to biopharma drug development, have promoted life science and medical-market fundamentals. The trend is expected to continue in the upcoming years, giving significant impetus for growth to HCP.Moreover, national healthcare expenditure is expected to rise in the future and as senior citizens constitute the major customer base of healthcare services – they end up spending more on healthcare services compared with the average population. Hence, with an expectation of rising senior citizens’ population in the years ahead, we believe that HCP has a strong upside potential, being well poised to capitalize on this expenditure trend of senior citizens on healthcare services.However, softness in the seniors housing fundamentals is likely to continue in the upcoming quarters, amid rise in new supply in the market. This is anticipated to adversely affect the company’s pricing power and occupancy level. In addition, the cut-throat competitive market makes it more challenging for the company to increase its rent and occupancy level. The competition also makes it hard to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities to meet the company’s objectives.Moreover, the company is currently focusing on lowering its Brookdale-portfolio concentration. The move involves strategic efforts, including selling of considerable part of its portfolio and using the proceeds in debt repayment. Although such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the dilutive impact on earnings in the near term from the sale of assets is unavoidable.Amid these, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed its industry over the past six months, declining 7.4% against the industry’s decline of 2.4%. Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the same space include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), LaSalle Hotel Properties (LHO  -  Free Report) and Terreno Realty Corporation (TRNO  -  Free Report).

Subject to customary closing norms and regulatory license transfer nods, this deal is likely to be completed by the third quarter.Further, the company opted for transition of management of a portfolio of 24 HCP-owned senior housing communities from Brookdale to Atria Senior Living, Inc., and has already transitioned 18 of those. Another community has been transitioned to existing operating partner — Sonata Senior Living. For the rest 21 Brookdale-managed communities, the company is settling deals to transition to other operators and opting for sale of select assets.These efforts are expected to benefit HCP’s senior housing portfolio in a number of ways. Specifically, the operator diversification of the portfolio will improve as the company is targeting to lower Brookdale exposure to 16% of overall portfolio income from 34% in fourth-quarter 2016.  The revamped portfolio will have stronger demographics, while the company’s balance sheet is likely to strengthen with the sale proceeds.In fact, over time, with the diligent measures, the company aims at having more than half of its business comprising specialty office segments of medical office and life science, and lower senior housing concentration to around 40%. The focus on having a diversified private pay portfolio is likely to drive long-term growth.HCP currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Though there was growth of 0.4% in life-science cash NOI, 0.5% increase in senior-housing triple-net and 1.6% rise in the Medical office portfolio, the positives were offset by 6.4% decrease in senior-housing operating portfolio (SHOP) cash NOI.During the quarter under review, HCP completed the sale of six assets, totaling $275 million to Brookdale Senior Living.In March 2018, the company announced the transition of management for 24 senior-housing communities owned by HCP from Brookdale to Atria Senior Living.

105,HCP,"Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report), better known as Aimco, reported first-quarter 2018 pro forma funds from operations (FFO) of 60 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure indicates a 3% increase from the year-ago quarter tally of 58 cents.Results displayed growth in property net operating income (NOI), supported by same-store properties, and lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition communities. However, these positives were partially offset by lower NOI from apartment sales in 2017 and 2018.In the reported quarter, total revenues of $247.7 million comfortably outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $243.7 million. In addition, the reported figure came in marginally higher than the prior-year quarter tally of $246.5 million.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues (before utility reimbursements) increased 2.6% year over year to $144.9 million while expenses (net of utility reimbursements) increased 2.1% from the prior-year quarter to $38.9 million. Consequently, same-store NOI climbed 2.7% to $106 million on a year-over-year basis.Same-store average daily occupancy expanded 30 basis point (bps) year over year to 96.3%. Rental rates on new leases were up 0.4% whereas rental rates on renewal leases were up 4.9% from the expiring lease rates.As of Mar 31, 2018, Aimco had cash and restricted cash on hand of $91 million. Moreover, the estimated fair market value of the company’s unencumbered apartment communities was around $2 billion.Further, at the end of the quarter under review, Aimco’s outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility were $79 million and available capacity was $509 million, after considering $12 million of letters of credit, backed by the facility.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Aimco invested $47 million in redevelopment and development.In addition, Aimco is revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth.Through these efforts, the company increased its revenues per apartment home by 7% to $2,052. Additionally, it enhanced the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio. Specifically, the percentage of A, B and C+ home was 49%, 35% and 16%, respectively, in first-quarter 2018 compared with 51%, 35% and 14% recorded in the year-ago quarter. GuidanceFor full-year 2018, the company updated its pro forma FFO per share guidance to $2.39-$2.49 from $2.42-$2.52 provided earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $2.48.For second-quarter 2018, Aimco provided pro forma FFO per share guidance of 57-61 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 62 cents.The company projects same-store NOI growth to be in the range of 1.70-3.10% and revenue growth in the range of 2.10-3.10%.DividendOn May 2, Aimco announced a quarterly cash dividend of 38 cents per share of Class A Common Stock for the first quarter. This marks a 6% year-over-year increase. The dividend will be paid on May 31 to stockholders of record as of May 18, 2018.Bottom LineAimco’s efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non-strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions are likely to drive long-term growth. In addition to this, the company has a solid portfolio, diversified both in terms of geography and price point. This is likely to help meet the rise in demand for apartment properties efficiently.However, the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be bypassed in the near term. Also, new supply in various markets is anticipated to dampen the company’s rent growth and new lease pricing ability. Hike in interest rate adds to its woes.Apartment Investment and Management Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Apartment Investment and Management Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Apartment Investment and Management Company QuoteAimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, the figure compared unfavorably with the year-ago number of $492.2 million.Behind the HeadlinesHCP experienced 0.2% year-over-year decline in the three-month cash SPP NOI.

108,HCP,"Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report) — commonly known as Aimco — is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 7, after the market closes. While funds from operations (FFO) per share will likely increase on a year-over-year basis, revenues are expected to decline.In the last reported quarter, this Denver, CO-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) met the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO.Results displayed growth in same-store property NOI and lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition communities. However, these positives were partially offset by loss of income from apartment sales in 2016.Aimco has a mixed earnings surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions and reported in-line numbers on the other two. Overall, the stock witnessed an average positive surprise of 0.82%. This is depicted in the chart below:Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and EPS Surprise Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and EPS Surprise | Apartment Investment and Management Company QuoteShares of Aimco have outperformed the industry. While the company’s shares have lost 7.4%, the industry has witnessed a decline of 8% over the last six months.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsPer the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the national apartment market moderated in first-quarter 2018, with occupancy shrinking slightly and rent growth slowing down. Nevertheless, the first quarter marked a slow-leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand.Going by statistics, the annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in the first quarter. This marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% in March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy.Furthermore, Aimco has a diversified portfolio, both in terms of geography and price point. This is likely to aid the company to meet the increase in demand for apartment properties from echo boomers — children of the baby-boomer generation — in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, Aimco has been making concerted efforts to revamp its portfolio through property sales and by reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth.While such streamlining efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. In fact, such short-term impact is likely to drag the company’s quarterly results.Further, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of the company’s markets. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates and adversely affect revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is a lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at 60 cents. This indicates a 3.5% increase year over year. For the first quarter, management projects pro-forma FFO per share in the band of 57-61 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $243.7 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 1.1%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Aimco has the right combination of the two key ingredients —positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the first quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Aimco has an Earnings ESP of +0.24%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: Aimco carries a Zacks Rank #3.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:HCP Inc.

110,HCP,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are expected to have registered declines, on year-over-year basis.In the last-reported quarter, this Irvine, CA-based healthcare REIT delivered a positive surprise of 2.13%, in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected growth in three-month same-property portfolio (SPP) cash net operating income (NOI).The company has an impressive surprise history. In fact, over the trailing four quarters, this REIT exceeded estimates in each occasion, generating an average positive surprise of 3.72%. This is depicted in the graph below.HCP, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HCP, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | HCP, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up, prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderHCP enjoys a diversified, well-balanced portfolio in the healthcare sector. In the to-be-reported quarter, the company is likely to have gained from rising healthcare spending and a growing aging population. Importantly, strategic divestitures, in a bid to lower its Brookdale-portfolio concentration, are anticipated to have driven the company’s Q1 performance.Subsequently, rental and related revenues are likely to have recorded sequential growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $261 million indicates growth of 2.3% as compared to the prior quarter. Further, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues from medical office are expected to inch up 0.8% to $121 million as compared with the prior-quarter tally.Furthermore, during the Jan-Mar quarter, HCP made progress with the sale and transition of 36 senior housing operating assets and 32 triple-net leased communities, operated by Brookdale. During the quarter, 24 senior living communities, owned by HCP, announced shifting their operator from Brookdale Senior Living to Atria Senior Living. This move will considerably decrease Brookdale’s concentration in HCP’s portfolio, increase lease coverage of their remaining triple-net assets leased to Brookdale, improve the diversification of tenants in the portfolio, and enhance credit profile and balance sheet.Notably, senior living providers have been facing operational and financial challenging times, thanks to the fall in private-pay healthcare, low margins and heavy government control. Amid these, a reduction in Brookdale’s concentration — which is one of the largest senior living providers — bodes well.  In its life-science segment, we estimate occupancy to have been stable as compared to the previous quarter, while revenues are anticipated to be down 2% to $95 million sequentially.The company remained focused on balance-sheet restructuring in the first quarter. Specifically, it reduced its mezzanine loan investments by selling a loan, secured by interests in skilled nursing and long-term healthcare portfolio, Tandem, to Fundamental Advisors LP, for $112 million.HCP’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q1 FFO remained unchanged at 46 cents in a month’s time. Further, it indicates a 9.8% decline year over year.A Surprise in Store?Our proven model shows that HCP has the right combination of the two key ingredients —positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the first quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for HCP is +0.22%.Zacks Rank: HCP carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to come up with a positive surprise this time around:Amanda Hoffer Properties (AHH  -  Free Report), slated to release first-quarter results on May 1, has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

111,HCP,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on May 2.In the last-reported quarter, this Bethesda, MD-based lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of around 7.7%, with respect to funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results highlighted margin improvement through better productivity.The company has a decent surprise history. In fact, over the preceding four quarters, the company posted surprises in three occasions, with an average beat of 6.8%. This is depicted in the graph below: Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors That Might Impact Q1 ResultsHost Hotels boasts a portfolio of upscale hotels across potential markets in the United States. Also, the company is making concerted efforts to enhance its portfolio quality through strategic capital-recycling program. The lodging REIT has been making well-planned redevelopments to fortify its position in vibrant markets.Moreover, the company is enhancing its portfolio with strategic assets like the three Hyatt-managed hotels, while monetizing a considerable part of real estate in Washington D.C. and lowering its exposure in New York.Host Hotels also has a decent balance sheet and ample liquidity. The company’s Q1 performance is expected to display improvement in productivity at many of its hotels.However, though supply growth has been sluggish in the past, it has gathered momentum, of late. In fact, growth is expected to remain elevated in 2018, particularly in markets where the company has exposure.Moreover, in the fourth-quarter 2017 conference call, management had stated that the company’s performance is likely to be the weakest in first-quarter 2018. This is due to tough comparisons resulting from inauguration and Women's March in D.C. last year as well as Easter weekend beginning on Mar 30 this year.Notably, the company usually reaps 23-24% of its total EBITDA in the Jan-Mar quarter. In addition to this, dilutive impact of asset sales cannot be bypassed. Also, rate hike is another key concern for this REIT.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.32 billion, indicating an expected decline of 1.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Room Revenues is pegged at $824 million, down from $847 million reported in the prior quarter.

113,HCP,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) is likely to benefit from a diversified high-quality health care real estate portfolio, rising healthcare spending and aging population. Further, the company has resorted to strategic divestitures and is also lowering its Brookdale-portfolio concentration. Recently, in sync with its efforts, the company announced the shift in its operator for 24 senior-living communities owned by them, from Brookdale to Atria Senior Living.However, the softness in the seniors housing fundamentals amid new supply is anticipated to thwart the company’s pricing power. Also, the hike in interest rate and stiff competition remain concerns for HCP.Notably, in February, HCP reported fourth-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) as adjusted of 48 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. Results reflected a 1.2% increase in the three-month same-property portfolio cash net operating income.HCP has exposure to all types of facilities in the healthcare sector and has a well-balanced and diversified portfolio. The diverse product mix of the company allows it to explore available opportunities in various areas, based on individual market dynamics.Further, the company is focused on making opportunistic acquisitions and strategic dispositions to enhance its overall portfolio mix. During the fourth quarter, HCP announced $424 million of acquisitions. Notably, HCP completed the previously-announced $228-million acquisition of the Hayden Research Campus in the Boston life-science market. It also acquired 11 off-campus medical-office buildings for $151 million. Also, the company started Phase I of Sierra Point, marking its next key life-science development in the South San Francisco market.In addition, recently HCP shifted the operator of 24 senior living communities owned by them, from Brookdale Senior Living to Atria Senior Living. The transition is scheduled to start from this month and is likely to be accomplished by September 2018. The company has been continually trying to reduce its exposure to Brookdale as it has been facing operational and financial challenges for the past few years.Once it is completed, the dealings will benefit HCP in a number of ways. It will considerably decrease Brookdale’s concentration, increase lease coverage of their remaining triple-net assets leased to Brookdale, improve the diversification of tenants in the portfolio and enhance credit profile and balance sheet.Nevertheless, softness in the senior housing fundamentals is likely to continue in the upcoming quarters amid rising supply in the market. This is anticipated to adversely affect the company’s pricing power and occupancy level. In addition, the cut-throat competitive market makes it more challenging for HCP to increase its revenues as well as identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet its objectives.Additionally, the company is currently focusing on lowering its Brookdale-portfolio concentration. The move involves a number of strategic efforts including selling of considerable part of its portfolio and using the proceeds in debt repayment. Although such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the dilutive impact on earnings in the near term from the sale of assets is unavoidable.Amid these, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company underperformed its industry over the past three months, plunging 14.3% as against the industry’s loss of 10.8%. Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same industry include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

121,HCP,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) is slated to report its fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Feb 13, before the opening bell. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are expected to experience a decline on year-over-year basis.Last quarter, this Irvine, CA-based healthcare REIT delivered a positive surprise of 4.35% in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected growth in three-month same-property portfolio cash net operating income (NOI).The company has a decent surprise history. In fact, over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded estimates in each occasion, generating an average positive surprise of 4.1%. This is depicted in the graph below.HCP, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HCP, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | HCP, Inc. QuoteHowever, HCP’s shares have lost 22.1% of its value over the past six months, underperforming the 8.7% decline recorded by the industry it belongs to.Let’s see how things are shaping up, prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderHCP enjoys a diversified, well-balanced portfolio in the healthcare sector. In the to-be-reported quarter, the company is likely to gain from rising healthcare spending and a growing aging population. Importantly, strategic investments, tie-ups and acquisitions are anticipated to drive decent cash flows.Subsequently, rental and related revenues are likely to record sequential growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $271 million indicates growth of 1.9% as compared to the prior quarter. However, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues from life science and medical office will remain stable compared with the prior quarter tally of $90 million and $120 million, respectively.The company also remains on track with its deleveraging plan and its balance sheet is likely to reflect that. However, as part of such efforts, it significantly disposed of non-core assets. While such moves are a strategic fit for the long term, the company cannot bypass the dilutive impact on earnings in the near term from huge asset dispositions.Moreover, growth might be hindered by cut-throat competition in HCP’s markets. In addition, there is an increased supply in senior housing category. As this curtails landlords’ pricing power and limits growth in occupancy level, the prevalent oversupply situation is expected to impact the company’s third-quarter numbers.HCP’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q4 FFO has remained constant at 47 cents in a month’s time. Further, it indicates a decline of 20.3% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $456.2 million, indicating a year-over-year drop of 15.5%.For full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $1.86 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 12.7%. The consensus estimate for FFO per share is $1.94, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 29.2%. Management expects core FFO per share in the range of $1.92-$1.96.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that HCP will likely beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

122,HCP,"Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share of 68 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents. Total operating revenues of around $192.8 million for the quarter also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $173.0 million.On a year-over-year basis, the company’s FFO per share climbed from 41 cents per share recorded in the year-earlier quarter, while total operating revenues increased 13.6% year over year.During the reported quarter, Liberty Property accomplished lease deals for 6.1 million square feet of space. As of Dec 31, 2017, occupancy at the company’s in-service portfolio, spanning 102 million square feet, expanded 100 basis points (bps) sequentially to 96.9%.For full-year 2017, FFO per share came in at $2.59, up 9.3% from the prior-year tally of $2.37. This was backed by 1.3% year-over-year growth in total revenues to nearly $719.8 million.Amid these, shares of Liberty Property inched up 1.8% to $39.63 during regular trading session on Feb 6.Quarter in DetailLiberty Property’s industrial portfolio, spanning 94.2 million square feet, enjoyed occupancy of 97.0% at the end of the quarter, marking an expansion of 70 bps from the prior quarter. Industrial rents escalated 14.8% on renewal and replacement leases signed during the quarter. The office portfolio, comprising 7.4 million square feet of space, had occupancy of 95.6%, up 460 bps from the previous quarter. Office rents were up 22.2% on renewal and replacement leases.Same-store properties’ operating income increased 5.1% year over year on a cash basis and straight-line basis. Additionally, same-store operating income for the industrial portfolio climbed 4.6% on a cash and straight-line basis. Same-store operating income for office portfolio ascended 8.0% on a cash basis and 7.9% on a straight-line basis.Portfolio ActivityDuring the fourth quarter, Liberty enhanced its positions in California, Georgia and New Jersey through acquisition of four 100% leased buildings, aggregating 1.4 million square feet of space for $195.1 million.On the other hand, Liberty sold four properties aggregating around 2.1 million square feet of space and 64 acres of land for $325.3 million during the quarter.The company brought into service six wholly-owned development properties, having 960,000 square feet of leasable space and 80.5% occupied as of the end of the quarter, for a total investment of $78.8 million. Further, Liberty commenced development of two wholly-owned properties during the quarter, aggregating 705,000 square feet of leasable space, at an estimated investment of $44.4 million.Balance Sheet PositionLiberty Property exited fourth-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of around $11.9 million, down from $43.6 million recorded at the end of the prior year.Notably, during the reported quarter, the company closed on credit facilities totaling up to $830 million outstanding at any one time as well as a delayed draw term-loan facility aggregating up to $100 million.OutlookLiberty Property provided its guidance for 2018 and projects FFO per share in the range of $2.53-$2.65. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.61.Further, the company’s full-year 2018 FFO per share projection is backed by same-store operating income for the industrial portfolio’s estimated growth of 3-4% on a straight line and 4-5% on a cash basis.Also, the company expects asset sales in the $600-$800 million band and acquisitions in the range of $400-$600 million.Our TakeThe better-than-expected performance of Liberty Property in the fourth quarter is encouraging. Notably, the company is gradually shifting its focus toward industrial properties due to favorable demand supply conditions. The company plans to fund investments in industrial assets through proceeds from dispositions of office properties. While such efforts are a strategic fit for long-term growth, the near-term dilution effect of such moves on earnings is unavoidable.Moreover, supply of industrial real estates is likely to increase in the upcoming quarters and adversely affect the growth tempo of this real estate market. Also, rate hike remains a concern. Nevertheless, its premium quality industrial properties, situated in key locations, have the capacity to drive long-term growth by leveraging on the e-commerce boom and supply-chain strategy transformations.Currently, Liberty Property carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

It also surpassed the full-year Zacks Consensus Estimate of $988.1 million. Growth in revenues for the quarter and the year was due to the rise in revenue from same-store communities and stabilized, non-mature communities.Inside the HeadlinesDuring the quarter, same-store revenues increased 3.1% year over year while same-store expenses increased 2.9%. Consequently, same-store net operating income (NOI) rose 3.1% year over year. However, the company’s same-store physical occupancy remained flat at 96.8%. The fourth-quarter annualized-rate of turnover contracted 40 basis points from the prior-year period to 41.2%.At the end of the fourth quarter, UDR’s development pipeline aggregated $864.5 million at its pro-rata ownership interest.

Further, in order to strengthen operational platform, the company recently transitioned the management of a portfolio of senior housing communities to Eclipse Senior Living.However, elevated supply of seniors housing assets in certain markets is likely to moderate rent and occupancy growth in the near-term. Further, the company is exposed to concentration risks since majority of its revenues are generated from a few tenants. Further, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company. This is because it has substantial exposure to long-term leased assets. These restrict the company’s scope to drive top-line growth.Ventas, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ventas, Inc.

The company projects 2018 FFO per share in the range of $3.72-$3.86. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.78.The full-year FFO per share guidance is backed by assumptions of comparable center NOI growth of about 2-3% for the year. Also, the guidance does not include any future costs that may be incurred related to shareowner activism.Our ViewpointThe company’s performance is anticipated to be adversely affected by the choppy retail real estate environment. In fact, with a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences and growing online purchases, mall traffic continues to suffer. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures. This is expected to impact demand for retail space at Taubman’s shopping centers. Also, hike in interest rates and unfavorable foreign-currency movements increase its risks.Nonetheless, the company’s solid retail portfolio, high-quality retailers and diligent restructuring initiatives have the capacity to support its growth in the long term.Taubman Centers, Inc.

Same-property cash NOI climbed 2.2% year over year.During the reported quarter, the company sold non-core assets worth $45 million.The company also amended its term loan and unsecured revolving credit facility.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is currently pegged at $3.47.Our ViewpointImproving operating performance reflects brighter prospects for the company. Highwoods is making diligent efforts to expand its footprint in high-growth markets and enhance the portfolio quality through prudent asset acquisitions and disposals. Furthermore, the company’s dispositions are anticipated to have a minuscule impact on its revenues.Its focus on high-quality office assets in best business districts (BBDs) bodes well. With the recovery of the economy and labor markets, Highwoods will likely experience healthy demand for office space. Nonetheless, Highwoods faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, as well as other commercial real estates, including sublease space available from its tenants. This restricts the company’s ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors. Moreover, the company’s assets are concentrated in a few markets, which makes it vulnerable to the economic and political doldrums prevalent in the area.Highwoods Properties, Inc.

Also, the company’s merger with Equity One has elevated the former’s position in the retail real estate market and offered a host of opportunities to drive long-term growth.However, Regency incurred merger-related costs, which impacted its bottom line.

129,HCP,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) — a healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) — reported third-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) as adjusted of 48 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. Comparable FFO as adjusted in the prior-year quarter was 50 cents per share.Results were driven by growth in the three-month same property portfolio (SPP) cash net operating income (NOI). Also, the company raised its 2017 FFO as adjusted guidance range.Moreover, HCP generated revenues of $454.0 million, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $450.4 million. However, it compared unfavorably with the year-ago tally of $530.6 million.Notably, HCP announced that it has entered into transactions that offer a way to lower the company’s Brookdale concentration to around 15.7%. The company would sell residual 40% investment in RIDEA II to Columbia Pacific Advisors. Further, HCP also announced coming back to the Boston life-science market with $228 million acquisition of the Hayden Research Campus.HCP, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  HCP, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | HCP, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Behind the HeadlinesHCP attained year-over-year three-month cash SPP NOI growth of 3.2%. Results were supported by 5.3% increase in Senior housing operating portfolio (SHOP) cash NOI, 4.0% growth in Life science, 2.7% uptick in Senior housing triple-net and 2.5% rise in Medical office portfolio.During the third quarter, HCP announced $113 million of additional acquisitions. This brought its year-to-date announced acquisitions and developments to $447 million. Further, the company sold two triple-net senior housing assets leased to Brookdale for $15 million. At the quarter end, HCP’s development pipeline aggregated $870 million.

It ended the quarter with $1.5 billion of liquidity from a combination of cash and availability under its $2.0-billion credit facility.2017 OutlookHCP raised its 2017 FFO as adjusted guidance range and expects it to be in the band of $1.92-$1.96 per share, denoting 2 cents per share increase at the mid-point. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.92.In addition, the company reaffirmed aggregate 2017 SPP cash NOI growth guidance in the range of 2.5-3.5%.ConclusionWe believe HCP is well poised to benefit from its diversified portfolio, rise in healthcare spending and an aging population over the long run. Strategic divestitures, efforts to lower the Brookdale portfolio concentration and focus on deleveraging augur well for long-term growth. However, rise in interest rates and cut-throat competition are major concerns. Also, dilutive impact on earnings in the near term from sale of assets is unavoidable.HCP currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

130,HCP,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, before the opening bell.Last quarter, this Irvine, CA-based healthcare REIT delivered a positive surprise of 2.13% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results reflected growth in three-month same-property portfolio cash net operating income (NOI).The company has a decent surprise history. In fact, over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded estimates in each occasion, generating an average positive surprise of 3.3%. This is depicted in the graph below.HCP, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  HCP, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | HCP, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.However, HCP’s shares have lost 14.3% of its value, year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 2.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderHCP enjoys a diversified, well-balanced portfolio in the healthcare sector. In the to-be-reported quarter, the company is likely to gain from rising healthcare spending and a growing aging population. Importantly, strategic investments, tie-ups and acquisitions are anticipated to drive decent cash flows.The company also remains on track with its deleveraging plan and its balance sheet is likely to reflect that. However, as part of such efforts, it significantly disposed non-core assets. While such moves are a strategic fit for the long term, the company cannot bypass the dilutive impact on earnings in the near term from huge asset dispositions.Moreover, growth might be hindered by cut-throat competition in HCP’s markets. In addition, there is increased supply in senior housing category. As this curtails landlords’ pricing power and limits growth in occupancy level, the prevalent oversupply situation is expected to impact the company’s third-quarter numbers.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $450.4 million, marking an estimated plunge of 31.2% year over year.Also, HCP’s performance during the quarter was inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved down 2.1% to 46 cents in two months’ time.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that HCP will likely beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.22%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: HCP has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).While a positive ESP is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise, its combination with a Sell-rated rank leaves our prediction inconclusive.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Nov 1, has an Earnings ESP of +2.96% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc.

131,HCP,"Cousins Properties Incorporated (CUZ  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share of 15 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure compared unfavorably with 22 cents recorded in the year-ago period.The quarter witnessed considerable improvement in rental property revenues, which aided results to quite an extent. However, elevating expenses were a headwind. Amid these, shares of Cousin Properties edged down 0.76% to $9.10 during regular trading session on Oct 26.Total revenues for the quarter came in at $113.2 million, marginally surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $112.8 million. The figure also came in higher than $48.7 million reported in the prior-year period. Additionally, rental property revenues rose to $336.1 million as compared with $138.4 million in the year-ago quarter.Quarter in DetailCousins Properties leased or renewed 334,905 square feet of office space in the quarter. Same-property net operating income (NOI), on a cash basis, rose 2% year over year. Moreover, second-generation net rent per square foot (cash basis) increased 7.3%.Total costs and expenses came in at $103.7 million, flaring up significantly from the prior-year quarter.Cousins Properties exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $62.2 million, as against $35.7 million recorded as of Dec 31, 2016.2017 OutlookCousins Properties raised its 2017 FFO per share guidance to the range of 60-62 cents per share from the previous guidance of 58-63 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year is currently pegged at 61 cents.The company narrowed its current-year net income guidance to the band of 46-48 cents per share from 43-48 cents.It also increased its projection for fee and other income to the $19-$21 million range. Also, the company raised its estimates for general and administrative costs to the range of $27-$29 million.In ConclusionCousins Properties’ diversified portfolio, presence of high-end tenants in its roster, and opportunistic investments in best sub-markets will likely help the company keep the impressive growth momentum alive. Further, the company’s investments in high growth markets are anticipated to boost its leasing metrics.Nonetheless, heightening competition, high dependence on office portfolio and further hike in interest rates remain key concerns.Currently, Cousins Properties has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

132,HCP,"Irvine, CA-based healthcare REIT — HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) — aims for net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the low-to-mid six-time range and a financial leverage in the 43-44% band, by the end of 2017.As part of such efforts, during first-quarter 2017, HCP sold $1.8 billion of non-core assets. This included the completion of the sale of 64 triple-net assets leased to Brookdale for $1.125 billion, and the RIDEA II transaction for $480 million net. Using proceeds from the Brookdale transactions and other dispositions, the company repaid $1.1 billion of debt during the first quarter. This also helped the company lower its Brookdale concentration.In addition, in sync with the company’s strategy to exit mezzanine debt investments, in late June, the company’s HC-One loan was repaid in full. Further, on Jul 31, HCP entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Tandem debt investment for $197 million. Importantly, Tandem indicates the company’s residual, highly leveraged mezzanine debt investment and its last pure skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) exposure.Notably, amid healthcare reforms, though senior housing, medical-office buildings and hospitals have been able to reap solid top-line growth in recent years, SNFs are becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the change in medical billing procedure. Moreover, such moves strengthen the company’s balance sheet. The company also has no major debt maturities until 2019.In addition, early in August, HCP reported second-quarter 2017 funds from operations (“FFO”) as adjusted of 48 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. Results reflected growth in three-month same-property portfolio cash net operating income (NOI).This healthcare REIT is poised to gain from its diverse and high-quality portfolio, amid rising healthcare spending and an aging population. HCP has exposure to all types of facilities. The diverse product mix of the company enables it to explore the opportunities available in various areas, based on individual market dynamics.However, intense competition, rising supply and hike in interest rate remain concerns. In fact, softness in the senior housing fundamentals is likely to continue in the upcoming quarters amid rise in new supply in the market. This is expected to adversely affect the company’s pricing power and occupancy level.Furthermore, though the company opted for huge asset dispositions and remains on track with its deleveraging plan, it cannot bypass the dilutive impact on earnings from sale of assets.Year to date, shares of HCP have declined 2.6%, underperforming 2.9% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to. However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s estimates for FFO per share for third-quarter 2017 remained unchanged over the past seven days.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Communications Sales & Leasing, Inc. (UNIT  -  Free Report), InfraREIT Inc. (HIFR  -  Free Report) and PS Business Parks Inc. (PSB  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

140,HCP,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, before the opening bell.Last quarter, this Irvine, CA-based healthcare REIT delivered a positive surprise of 6.25% in terms of funds from operations (“FFO”) per share. Results reflected growth in three-month same-property portfolio cash net operating income (“NOI”).The company has a decent surprise history. In fact, over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded estimates in each occasion, generating an average positive surprise of 4.22%. This is depicted in the graph below.HCP, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  HCP, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | HCP, Inc. QuoteHCP’s shares have gained 6.7% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 3.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderHCP has a diversified, well-balanced portfolio in the healthcare sector. The company is likely to benefit in the to-be-reported quarter from rising healthcare spending and a growing aging population. Further, strategic investments, tie-ups and acquisitions are anticipated to drive decent cash flows. Also, the sale of 64 Brookdale Communities to affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate Partners VIII L.P in the first half of 2017 helped it reduce the Brookdale concentration and the company remains on track with its deleveraging plan.However, growth might be hindered by cut-throat competition in the company’s markets. In addition, there is increased supply in senior housing category that is expected to lead to softness in this market fundamental. In addition, it cannot bypass the dilutive impact on earnings in the near term from huge asset dispositions.Overall, HCP’s performance during the quarter was inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 47 cents over the last 60 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that HCP will likely beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for HCP is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 47 cents matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: HCP’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:CyrusOne Inc. (CONE  -  Free Report), likely to release earnings on Aug 2, has an Earnings ESP of +2.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc.

The figure also came in a penny higher than the year-ago quarter tally. Results reflect improved property performance and accretive investments.Further, the company posted revenues of $895.5 million which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $869.4 million. The figure compared favorably with the year-ago number of $867.1 million.For the third quarter, same-store cash net operating income (NOI) growth for total portfolio (1,045 assets) climbed 2.1% year over year. Segment wise, same-store cash NOI for the triple net leased portfolio grew 3.8%, seniors housing operating portfolio inched up 0.6% and medical office building portfolio rose 1.5%.Quarter in DetailDuring the third quarter, Ventas funded investments of around $80 million. This included $67 million of funding for its share of development and redevelopment projects for projects presently in progress.Furthermore, the company disposed properties and obtained final repayments on loans receivable for proceeds of $650 million.LiquidityAt present, the company enjoys liquidity with $2.9 billion of available borrowing capacity and $100 million of cash on hand.2017 OutlookVentas updated its outlook and estimates 2017 normalized FFO per share in the range of $4.13-$4.16. The mid-point of the guidance remained unchanged from the prior guidance as the Kindred skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) sale offsets improved property performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.17. The company anticipates same-store cash NOI growth of 2-2.5% in 2017.Our TakeWe are encouraged with the in-line performance of Ventas in the third quarter. We believe the company’s adequate size and scale would help it capitalize on opportunities such as increasing healthcare spending and aging population.Also, university-based life science real estate is a new zone of investment which has grabbed attention and Ventas has already committed substantial amount to this segment.  The company acquired a 262,000-square-foot class-A life science building, which is currently 82% occupied. Such investments will likely offer scope to capitalize on growing health-care-driven research and development.In addition to this, sale of the SNFs enabled the company to realize around $570 million in sale proceeds. Also, the transaction lowered the company’s exposure to this particular healthcare real estate category which is becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the change in medical billing procedure.However, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company, considering its substantial exposure to long-term leased assets.Currently, Ventas carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
