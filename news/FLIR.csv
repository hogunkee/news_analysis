0,FLIR,"Boeing stock broke out to buy range Friday, leading aerospace and defense stocks for your investing portfolio watch list. Elsewhere in the space, aerospace and defense stocks with more commercial exposure are holding up and trading near highs while those with more military exposure are still struggling.Like Boeing (BA), Hexcel Corp (HXL) is also in buy range, while Textron (TXT) and Flir Systems (FLIR) are slightly extended from buy range and Heico (HEI) is well extended from its last proper base, but near an add-on entry.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and General Dynamics (GD) are each 12% below their highs. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) are 9% and 8% off their highs, respectively.Boeing stock rose 2% Friday. The low-volume breakout puts the 2017's top-performing Dow Jones component above a handle buy point of 348.67. But investors may want to focus on the conventional entry of 371.70, ten cents above the stock's all-time high.

25,FLIR,"Weak earnings from Apple (AAPL) fueled selling in the Nasdaq Wednesday, but the weakness wasn't as pronounced in the S&P 500.At the close, the Nasdaq composite lost 0.6% as it seeks support at its 50-day moving average again. The S&P 500 dropped 0.2%, and small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.9%. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2%, helped by strength in Boeing (BA) and Nike (NKE). Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in slightly higher than Tuesday's levels.Wednesday's after-hours sessions served up plenty of earnings winners, including Tesla Motors (TSLA), up 6%, ServiceNow (NOW), up 4%, and VMware (VMW), up 2%.Oil prices reversed lower despite a government report that showed U.S. crude stockpiles unexpectedly decreased last week. December West Texas intermediate crude fell 78 cents, or 1.6%, to settle at $49.18 a barrel.Weakness in Nasdaq 100 bellwether Apple weighed on sentiment as shares gapped down and lost 2%.IBD'S TAKE: Give Apple credit. It's still holding above its 50-day moving average amid mixed analyst commentary around its Q4 results.Boeing (BA) led a rally in aerospace and defense stocks. Other big gainers in the group included Flir Systems (FLIR) and TransDigm Group (TDG). Earnings reports were the catalysts for Boeing and Flir Systems. Boeing jumped nearly 5% to 145.54. It cleared a base with a 139.55 buy point. Flir surged 10% while TransDigm added 1%.Wall Street also didn't like reports from Edwards Lifesciences (EW), Chipotle (CMG) and GrubHub (GRUB) as losses ranged from 9% to 17%.Edwards reported its second-straight quarter of 20%+ earnings and sales growth, but sales missed expectations. Earnings and sales came up short at Chipotle. GrubHub beat handily on earnings and sales, but a 19% rise in active customers disappointed.Trucking stocks outperformed as strong earnings from small cap Saia (SAIA) gave the group a lift.

"
26,FLIR,"Boeing (BA) said Wednesday there's a ""realistic possibility"" it will launch a new midsize plane and a longer version of its 737 Max, as the aerospace giant seeks to counter gains from Airbus' (EADSY) A321neo.Management said on a conference call that a new mid-market plane could be delivered in the 2024-2025 timeframe, while a stretched 737 Max could be ready by the end of the decade.Boeing has been mulling a new midsize plane or a longer 737 to fill the gap created by 757 production stopped, but hasn't said before it would do both. The latest comments come as the company has had to lay off employees due in part to Airbus gaining market share, as the A321neo has helped airlines open up new routes.Boeing also said the production rate on the current-generation 777 likely won't go down by more than 1-2 planes a month, adding that it would take ""offsetting actions"" to limit the impact on margins of any further rate cuts.Sales of the 777 have been slowing as customers prefer to wait for the upcoming next-generation 777X, but the company is trying to maintain a certain level of current-generation 777 production to ensure a smooth transition to the 777X on its assembly lines.Boeing shares jumped 4.7% to close at 145.54 on the stock market today, clearing a 139.55 buy point from a flat base and hitting the highest level of the year. Aerospace supplier TransDigm (TDG) rose 1.1% to 271.08, topping a 269.31 entry point.
"
27,FLIR,"IBD's TAKE: Foreign commercial sales are key to keeping the 777 line in production, but the aerospace giant is also chasing foreign military sales as looks to score a major fighter jet deal with India. Boeing's core Q3 EPS rose 11.5% to $2.81, excluding a 70-cent per-share tax benefit, above views for $2.60. Revenue fell 8% to $23.9 billion but topped forecasts for $23.64 billion. Revenue from its commercial airplanes division fell 4% to $16.97 billion on lower planned delivery volume. Boeing preannounced a 5.5% decline in commercial deliveries. Defense revenue fell 10% to $7.5 billion on fewer C-17 deliveries and lower F-15 volume.During the quarter, the Air Force signed two contracts with Boeing for a total value of $2.8 billion to make 19 KC-46 tankers. Boeing had taken a charge on the tanker in the last two quarters amid repeated delays and cost overruns.Boeing now plans to deliver 745 to 750 commercial airplanes this year, up from its prior outlook of 740 to 745 planes. It also raised its full-year EPS outlook to $6.80-$7 from an earlier outlook of $6.10-$6.30, but that just adds the 70-cent per-share tax benefit. Analysts see $6.34.Boeing's European rival Airbus reported a 21% drop in quarterly earnings Wednesday, falling short of analyst views due to supplier issues with its A350. Airbus's U.S.-traded shares climbed 3.4% to 15.02.But the company said problems with engines that it uses from United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney are ""largely over."" United Tech shares dipped 0.4% to 101.01.""For the remaining months of the year we remain totally focused on deliveries to achieve our earnings and cash guidance,"" CEO Tom Enders said in a release.Airbus said it would deliver over 208 planes by the end of the year, and deliveries of the A350 will nearly double.At its helicopter unit, Airbus saw a slowdown in commercial sales.In a positive day for defense contractors, Northrop Grumman (NOC) broke out of a flat base, gapping above the 224.22 buy point. The company raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance Wednesday after reporting third-quarter results above analyst expectations.Other big gainers in the group included Flir Systems (FLIR), which shot up 10%, and TransDigm Group (TDG), which broke out past the 269.41 buy point of a flat base. Earnings reports were the catalysts for Boeing and Flir Systems. Weapons electronics company L3 Communications (LLL) rose only 0.5% but volume was heavy.RELATED: Lockheed Martin Soars On Outlook; Next F-35 Contract Seen SplitBoeing To 'Wait And See' If Qatar Order Can Prevent 777 Output CutBoeing's Cash Flow Called Strong, But A320 Line Seen As Major Threat 
"
28,FLIR,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 wowed crowds at the Farnborough Airshow in the U.K. last month, streaking across the sky, hovering in midair and even flying backward. Weeks later, the Air Force declared its version of the F-35 combat ready. Despite ongoing concerns about its development, the stealth fighter continues to reach key milestones, and production will hit full speed in a few years.Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, has locked down the other key piece of the Pentagon's combat aircraft upgrade cycle, winning the B-21 contract last year to build replacements for Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s.With the $400 billion F-35 and $80 billion B-21 contracts in hand, Lockheed and Northrop would appear to have established air superiority. But there are hundreds of billions of Pentagon aerospace dollars still up for grabs, and demand overseas for high-tech missiles is on the rise, meaning Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing can make more money and boost their shares as the new weapons stay in service for decades.""The general view at the moment is that investors prefer the longer horizon of a defense portfolio,"" said Howard Rubel, Jefferies managing director in equity research. ""If you look at the viability of Northrop or Raytheon today, there is enough turmoil that defense will continue to grow at a faster rate than the overall economy.""And Lockheed's expected organic growth of 4% through 2018 tops the 2.8% pace for the overall defense sector, Goldman Sachs said Wednesday, citing the F-35 program's size. Growth at Northrop, Raytheon and Flir Systems (FLIR), however, could outpace Lockheed's, Goldman added.Lockheed shares fell 1.65% Friday and are up 12.6% so far this year. Northrop dipped 0.7% but has seen a 12% climb in 2016. Raytheon has run 13% higher, while Boeing has lost 8.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed shares have eased below buy range, Northrop is 5.5% below an entry point, while Raytheon is above buying territory. While Boeing has been a drag on the Aerospace/Defense group, the pure-play defense stocks have helped lift the industry group to No. 66 out of the 197 IBD tracks, and they also have been boosting their dividends.Boeing, however, is entering a transition period in its defense unit, which lost the B-21 bid with partner Lockheed. As production of its F-15 Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet eventually winds down, Boeing -- whose 100-year history includes icons like the B-17 Flying Fortress and the P-51 Mustang -- faces the prospect of no longer making fighters or bombers.In July, Boeing's top defense executive said that the aerospace giant would shift its focus from new fighter jets to maintenance services on existing aircraft, new helicopters, satellites, space programs, and selling more military versions of its passenger jets. But Boeing said that decision wasn't based on one contract loss.""No one competition is going to drive that. It's a matter of managing the investment portfolio that we have with the opportunity and campaigns that we want to go after and win,"" Steve Nordlund, Boeing's vice president for strategy for defense, space and security, said in an interview.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon and other defense contractors are turning their sights to U.S. nuclear missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.Late last month, the Air Force released requests for proposals for a Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system, and a Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missile to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles.The GBSD's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years (though an independent Pentagon cost assessment found that estimate is too low). The LRSO's cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion. Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed are expected to bid on the two contracts, and initial contracts are expected to be awarded next year.Boeing officials were bullish in a recent interview with IBD that they would win the award for the GBSD, based on past work in the field.""We are confident the Air Force can rely on us, given our proven commitment,"" said Rich Choppa, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing's defense unit. ""We are just as committed to developing a new system as we were back in 1958 when we developed the Minuteman system that stood the test of time.""Other potential prime contractors for the Minuteman upgrade include Lockheed and Northrop. Some 37 other contractors are bidding on subcontractor work.The issue of ""helicopter money"" isn't limited to central banks. But unlike the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan, the Pentagon isn't contemplating a massive dump of cash from hovering helicopters. Instead, the Pentagon is preparing a massive dump of cash onto makers of helicopters.While less sexy than fighter jets and supersonic missiles, the U.S. military's fleet of helicopters is also due for an upgrade. The Army is looking to replace its Black Hawk helicopters as heavy use in Afghanistan and Iraq have worn them out faster than expected. Textron's (TXT) Bell division is competing against a Boeing-Sikorsky team.The Army is also looking at replacements for its Boeing AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook as well as its Bell OH-58 Kiowa. Providing helicopters to take the places of all four aircraft will be worth an estimated $100 billion. The Pentagon is expected to seek official proposals in 2019, followed by a contract award in 2020.""We feel very strong about our military helicopter position in the market place and the capabilities we would provide customers,"" Boeing's Nordlund said.Lockheed has spent heavily in helicopters, acquiring Sikorsky from United Technologies (UTX) last year for $9 billion and is looking to recoup its investment.Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop are all competing for another major Pentagon contract: the Air Force's $8 billion-$10 billion T-X trainer jet, which will be used to train F-22 and F-35 pilots and has potential for massive overseas sales to international customers like the U.K., Italy and others who are buying the F-35.Raytheon is on an industry team that includes Finmeccanica and CAE. Lockheed has partnered with Korea Aerospace Industries. Boeing and Saab are bidding together, and Northrop is leading a coalition that includes BAE Systems and L-3 Communications (LLL). The competition is expected to be fierce, and a contract award is expected late next year.On Lockheed's Q2 conference call, CEO Marillyn Hewson called its upgraded T-50A, which completed its first test flight in South Korea in June, ""a very good offering. It's an excellent solution. It's low risk.""Boeing has kept its design under wraps, only releasing concept art of the nose of a jet, though more details are expected next month. Pictures of a Northrop prototype in Mojave, Calif., leaked out earlier this week and appeared to share some similarities with the Air Force's current trainer jet, the T-38, which is also made by Northrop.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop and privately held General Atomics are the likely bidders for the Navy's aerial-refueling drone, the MQ-25A Stingray.The program has been scaled back from its original inception, which envisioned a drone that would perform strike and surveillance missions.The Navy is still working on the requirements for the tanker drone, but stealth won't be on that list, Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker told reporters earlier this month. The service plans to issue a formal request for proposals in the second half of next year and award a contract in 2018.Derrick Maple, unmanned systems analyst at IHS Markit, estimates that development, production and support costs could reach $6 billion.As missiles become more advanced, foreign governments are increasingly looking to them to boost defenses amid deepening global tensions.Last year, Raytheon booked a $2 billion order from Saudi Arabia for its Patriot missile and air defense system. South Korea and Japan are also paying Raytheon to upgrade their Patriot systems as the missile threat from North Korea looms. And by year's end, the Polish government is expected to finalize a Patriot deal that is estimated at $5.5 billion amid rising friction with Russia.Raytheon is also working with Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems on revamping the Iron Dome defense system for its bid for the U.S. Army's Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 as protection against missiles and drones, among other threats.Raytheon isn't alone in the missile-defense market. Lockheed's THAAD system will be stationed in South Korea by late 2017. Lockheed and partner MBDA, a European defense giant, are bidding on a $4.5 billion German missile-defense deal that could be wrapped up later this year.And while U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has greatly diminished over the last decade, the war against ISIS is boosting demand for munitions. Berenberg analysts said earlier this year that they expect sales of Lockheed's Hellfire missiles and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles to climb 7%-8% this year on ""restocking activities in the U.S. and export demand.""Geopolitical strains should continue spurring more spending. In addition to the Islamic State in the Middle East, Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Russia flexing its muscles in Eastern Europe, disputes with China in the East China Sea are leading Japan to develop a land-to-sea missile system of its own. Top U.S. defense contractors may get involved.""The thing with these top-tier contractors, they have a lot of capabilities they can apply to various product areas that they want to invest in,"" Jefferies analyst Rubel said.RELATED:Lockheed F-35 'On A Path Toward Failing To Deliver' Full CapabilityNavy To Modernize Boeing Super Hornets To Fly With Lockheed F-35Boeing May Extend F/A-18 Work On Kuwait, Navy OrdersAir Force Touts Combat-Ready F-35 As 'Deterrent To Adversaries' 
"
29,FLIR,"The Air Force has said its version of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 is ready to be sent into battle, but the Pentagon's top weapons tester warned full combat capabilities are ""at a substantial risk"" of missing deadlines.""In fact the program is actually not on a path toward success but instead on a path toward failing to deliver"" the aircraft's full capabilities, ""for which the Department is paying almost $400 billion by the scheduled end"" of its development in 2018, Michael Gilmore, the Defense Department's director of operational testing, said in an Aug. 9 memo obtained by Bloomberg News.The Air Force declared initial combat capability on Aug. 2 but the fighter won't have its full war-fighting complement, including the ability to fire its 25 mm Gatling gun, until its 3F software upgrade next year.And the fighter is expected to reach full operational capability in the 2021-2022 time frame. But the memo puts these timelines in doubt as issues with software and other systems continue.The program ""is running out of time and money to complete the planned flight testing and implement the required fixes and modifications,"" the memo said according to the Bloomberg report. ""Flight testing is making progress but has fallen far behind the planned rate.""Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the F-35 program office, told Bloomberg in an e-mail that ""there were absolutely no surprises"" in the memo and ""all of the issues mentioned are well-known.""Lockheed shares fell 0.65% to 248.12 on the stock market today. The stock fell as low as 244.80 in the morning, briefly undercutting the 245.47 buy point that Lockheed cleared at the end of June. Lockheed slid 1.75% on Tuesday, closing below its 50-day moving average for the first time in six months.Despite the developmental issues, the F-35 program will drive long-term growth for Lockheed. On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs said the F-35 will allow Lockheed's revenue to grow faster than the overall industry though its programs outside the fighter won't be substantial growth drivers.Goldman said only Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major subcontractor on the F-35, Raytheon (RTN) and FLIR Systems (FLIR) will grow faster than Lockheed.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed, Northrop and other defense giants have come out of bases and moved into or near buy range. Learn how to read the different types of bases and other chart patterns at IBD University. Northrop shares fell 0.2% to 214, off intraday lows. The stock had been trading up and down from its 50-day line in recent weeks, but sank 1.7% Tuesday to its lowest level since June 28. Northrop is losing sight of a 218.94 buy point after breaking out of a flat base in June.Raytheon fell 0.1% to 141.07. The company broke out of a flat base in April and has been trading above its buy range since late July.RELATED: Lockheed Martin Stock Fails To Defend Key Support Line

42,FLIR,"Advances in artificial intelligence and robotics potentially leading to a robot apocalypse have been a popular theme in Hollywood this year. Already we've seen ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" ""Chappie"" and ""Ex Machina"" entertain audiences with the idea of a machine uprising.Next up is ""Terminator Genisys"" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Emilia Clarke. The latest in the ""Terminator"" robot apocalypse movie series opens in U.S. theaters on Wednesday.Beyond the entertainment industry, British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and tech industry icons Bill Gates and Elon Musk have expressed worries about the dangers of AI.If the robot apocalypse is coming, the seeds of our destruction likely have already been planted. What follows is a look — mostly tongue-in-cheek — at the publicly traded companies that could play a part in the robot destruction of the human race.All of these companies are working on technologies that will benefit mankind, including smarter computers, self-driving cars and disaster response robots. But what if our robot friends suddenly decided they didn't want to serve us anymore?IBM (IBM) has been linked to the robopocalypse in the minds of the general public since ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The classic 1968 science-fiction film featured a murderous AI computer called HAL 9000. Many people have conjectured that the name HAL was based on a one-letter shift from the name IBM.Fast-forward to today, and IBM is a leader in artificial intelligence with its Watson computer system.After defeating puny humans on the TV game show ""Jeopardy"" in 2011, Watson has tackled bigger problems in fields such as health care and oil and gas production.In January 2014, IBM created a new business unit around Watson. Around that time, IBM CEO Virginia Rometty said she wanted Watson to generate $10 billion in annual revenue within 10 years.Internet search leader Google (GOOGL) has taken a keen interest in robotics, acquiring a number of companies in the emerging field. But it's been secretive about its plans.This month, Google-owned Boston Dynamics supplied Atlas humanoid robots to six competitors in the DARPA Robotics Challenge. One took the second-place prize of $1 million after completing a simulated disaster response scenario. Looking like Terminator's bulkier cousin, the Atlas robot stands 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 345 pounds.For the DARPA contest, the Atlas robot drove a car, exited it and walked through a course performing such tasks as opening a door, turning a valve, cutting a hole in the wall and climbing a set of stairs. Those tasks will come in handy for responding to disasters like saving a crippled nuclear power plant. They also would be useful for chasing down and killing humans.Boston Dynamics is known for its scary, fast-moving, quadrupedal robots like BigDog and Cheetah, developed for the U.S. military.In addition, Google is working on self-driving cars. For the robot apocalypse to happen, bots will have to move fast and travel great distances to exterminate mankind.E-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) has deployed an army of 15,000 robots in its warehouses to retrieve shelves full of products and bring them to fulfillment workers. It also is exploring the use of robotic arms that can pick and pack items.Plus, Amazon is experimenting with aerial drones that it hopes can one day deliver packages within minutes to your doorstep. The Amazon Prime Air drone project was announced in late 2013 and has been slowed by government regulatory hurdles.Don't go thinking drones are harmless flying machines. Ask singer Enrique Iglesias. In May, a quadcopter filming his concert in Tijuana, Mexico, slashed some of his fingers. He had to undergo reconstructive hand surgery.In December, a mistletoe drone at a TGI Friday's restaurant cut someone's nose and chin.Now drones have a taste for blood.Bedford, Mass.-based iRobot (IRBT) is best known for home robots like the Roomba vacuum cleaner. It also makes virtual-presence robots that let people tour facilities and meet face to face with others over great distances.It also makes rovers for defense and law enforcement customers. These robots conduct reconnaissance, check out unsafe buildings, and assist in bomb detection and disposal. About 5,000 such robots from iRobot are in the field. They are performing dangerous missions and keeping human soldiers and police out of harm's way.IRobot's biggest military bot is the 710 Kobra. It weighs 500 pounds and can reach as high as 11.5 feet. With its tanklike tracks, it can reach speeds of up to 8 miles per hour, can easily climb stairs and fit through doorways and aisles.It's not hard to imagine that someday robots will be armed to take out enemy combatants via remote control. One step away from robot domination.Apple (AAPL) introduced its intelligent personal assistant Siri in October 2011. The female-voiced computer program can answer spoken questions, make recommendations and perform tasks like setting your alarm clock.Apple has continued to improve the usefulness and accuracy of Siri.

Given advancements in AI, I wouldn't want to get her too upset.When the history of the robot apocalypse is written, after John Connor or whoever defeats our robot overlords, historians may look to blame drone manufacturers.Unmanned aerial vehicles like the Predator combat drones built by General Atomics, a privately held defense contractor in San Diego, have been critical to the U.S. war on terrorist groups in the Middle East. Other U.S. drone makers include Boeing (BA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).These lethal drones are under human control from remote terminals. But if they become sentient, look out.If robots are ever going to be able to effectively hunt down humans, they're going to need good machine vision.Perhaps they'll use technology developed by Mobileye (MBLY).

43,FLIR,"Those cool action videos of surfers, snowboarders and rock climbers come courtesy of GoPro's popular wearable cameras — and a company called Ambarella.Ambarella (AMBA) might not be a household name, but its chips process the high-definition, high-resolution video in the popular GoPro (GPRO) cameras.And the chipmaker has a lot more action in mind than relying solely on the trendy cameras. Its sights are set on a wealth of other opportunities.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Ambarella is targeting its video-capturing and image-processing chips to the growing home monitor and professional security camera market. The company also is after applications for car dashboards and rear-view mirrors, and cameras mounted on drones and quadcopters.""Ambarella differentiates itself by enabling high-quality video and efficient compression of that video, while using the lowest possible amount of power,"" Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy told IBD. ""These three capabilities can continue to expand video applications into many untapped markets.""Its chips support 4K ultrahigh-definition video at 30 frames per second, three years ahead of the competition.""'Left Fairly Convinced'At Ambarella's analyst meeting in September, Cassidy says attendees saw opportunities for Ambarella beyond its role as the exclusive video processor supplier for San Mateo, Calif.-based GoPro.""Many investors started the meetings rather skeptical of Ambarella's market opportunities but left fairly convinced the company is poised to outgrow the video market,"" Cassidy said.Ambarella CEO Fermi Wang discussed growth markets in a conference call with analysts on Sept. 4. He cited potential in home monitoring and professional security camera applications enabled by cloud-based video storage, as well as remote viewing via smartphones and tablets.Another growth area is wearable police cameras, Wang says, because Ambarella's chip technology provides high-definition recording with clear images even in low-light conditions, and enables low-power operation to extend battery life.""These (police) security cameras support continuous video recording of events, offering protection and documentation for both the police and the public,"" Wang said at the time.Wang looks for the U.S. wearable camera market to expand as the cameras are employed by fire departments, security guards and other emergency responders.Sales of wearable sports cameras are increasing at an annual rate of 59%, according to market tracker Juniper Research.It forecasts industry sales of $19 billion in 2018, up from just $1.4 billion in 2012.Wang says he met GoPro CEO Nick Woodman five years ago at the Consumer Electronics Show. Ambarella and GoPro have worked on cameras that can withstand the elements, absorb impact and run for hours while capturing vivid video in many operating modes.GoPro 25%-30% Of RevenueBut while Ambarella benefits from GoPro's top market position, deriving such a large portion of business from one customer poses a risk, said David Williams, an analyst with Ascendiant Capital Markets.Williams estimates GoPro accounted for 25%-30%, or $11.75 million to $14.1 million, of the $47 million in revenue Ambarella generated in its fiscal Q2 ended July 31.Williams and other analysts see growth for Ambarella in the auto segment and in high-definition broadcasting, because the 10-year-old company's compression chips help broadcasters transmit their programs worldwide.Wang says its latest chips enable a new generation of dashboard cameras that capture high-quality images even at night, and with Wi-Fi. Such improvements allow users to connect, stream live and record footage directly to mobile devices to view instantly or share.Ambarella's technology has a ""surround view"" capability that lets it stitch together video from cameras on both sides of a car, resulting in a high-definition ""aerial"" view, Cassidy says.In March, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued new regulations requiring all vehicles weighing less than 10,000 pounds to be equipped with rear visibility cameras by May 2018.In Korea, car camera manufacturer Thinkware has introduced video cameras that record via the windshield and rear windows, using Ambarella chips.""We can see this application in early stages for developing driver assistance in lane mergers, spaces between vehicles, etc.,"" Cassidy said.In the security market, analog cameras connected to co-axial cables are being replaced with digital cameras, which encode video inside the camera and transmit it over a network. Ambarella technology enables video to be compressed 30% or more than earlier chips, speeding transmission. It also requires 30% less storage, 30% less processing power and 30% less bandwidth for transmission than earlier chips, Cassidy says.As businesses, government agencies, airports and consumers add security cameras to networks, Ambarella's compression technology will help facilitate the process of transmitting and analyzing the video, Cassidy says.About 45% of Ambarella's business is now in IP security cameras, he says, making that market ""a bigger growth engine than GoPro.""""We are estimating 40% year-over-year growth for Ambarella's IP security revenue,"" Cassidy said.At a trade show in April in Las Vegas, IP security camera and thermal image supplier Flir Systems (FLIR) introduced 31 new camera models with Ambarella's chips.Surveillance camera maker Hikvision rolled out panoramic security cameras at the conference that can be mounted in walls or ceilings to provide a 360-degree or 180-degree field of view. And global security camera manufacturer Lorex introduced its Little Link portable, high-definition Wi-Fi video baby monitor. Hikvision and Lorex use Ambarella chips.Research firm IHS estimates the total available market for commercial IP security cameras at 60 million units and rising 30% a year.In another market, consumer drones typically fly at more than 20 miles per hour.At that speed, and adding in the height, video cameras must be capable of the high resolutions that Ambarella's chips deliver, Cassidy says.""We believe commercial applications for drones will expand and become the new high-end market for Ambarella's video processors,"" Cassidy said. ""We are now including drone-related revenue in our fiscal year 2016 estimates.""

44,FLIR,"Ambarella stock rose Wednesday after the video-camera chipmaker late Tuesday posted fiscal first-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations and gave an in-line current-quarter sales outlook. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Ambarella (AMBA) earned 25 cents per share excluding items on sales of $40.9 million for the quarter ended April 30. Year-over-year growth was 19% for EPS and 21% for sales.

"
371,FLIR,"Now, more than ever, you should be disciplined in your investing.
"
372,FLIR,"Recent market volatility is all the more reason to make sure you follow your buy and sell rules. Even minor deviations from the rules can result in big losses and missed gains.
"
373,FLIR,"Let's start with what's most applicable.
"
374,FLIR,"When the market is in a correction, don't buy stocks. Remember, three out of four growth stocks follow the general market's direction.
"
375,FLIR,"When the market gets back to a confirmed rally, start investing with caution.
"
376,FLIR,"Not every market follow-through results in a new uptrend. But it's OK to tiptoe into the market with small positions, adding to them as the stock and the market prove themselves.
"
377,FLIR,"But this ""pyramiding"" investing is only as good as the initial buy. That's why you want to make sure you're buying as close as possible to the proper buy point and never chase extended stocks  those more than 5% past their buy points.
"
378,FLIR,"Also, focus on stocks with superior sales and earnings growth, other strong fundamentals and institutional sponsorship.
"
379,FLIR,"Don't be tempted by ex-winners that have plummeted to seductively low prices.
"
380,FLIR,"Look for strong volume on breakouts, at least 50% above average.
"
381,FLIR,"If you do find a strong stock  once the market is healthy  remember that it's important to hold a stock if it climbs 20% in one to three weeks after it breaks out.
"
382,FLIR,"Lately, getting a stock that makes any significant gains has been a challenge. So knowing how to sell a stock to minimize losses is essential.
"
383,FLIR,"A key principle: Never take a loss greater than 7% or 8% from the price at which you buy a stock.
"
384,FLIR,"Historical studies have shown that winning stocks basically never correct more than 8% from their proper buy point.
"
385,FLIR,"Once a stock gives you a reason to sell it, do so. Don't wait and allow losses to grow. The more a stock falls, the greater gain it needs just to get back to break-even.
"
386,FLIR,"If you do sell your stock, don't hesitate to get back into it if the chart presents another buying opportunity. Many quality stocks will often have a shakeout and then run up, receding to the 10-week moving average and rallying from there.
"
387,FLIR,"If that happens, you don't want to miss out.
"
388,FLIR,"Flir Systems (FLIR) offers an example of how following buy and sell rules keeps you on the right track.
"
389,FLIR,"The maker of thermal-imaging equipment set up in a cup-with-handle base starting last November.
"
390,FLIR,"The stock broke past the 31.97 buy point in high volume. 1 At this point, the market was in a confirmed uptrend.
"
391,FLIR,"The stock was up 20% from its buy point by May 2. That was longer than the rapid, three-week advance that indicates a stock has a longer run ahead of it. Still, it was a prudent profit to take at that point.
"
392,FLIR,"Flir had not given any sell signals, so it was also OK to continue holding.
"
393,FLIR,"The first sell signal came as it pierced its 50-day moving average 3. It was a serious sell-off, despite a good price recovery.

But it's OK to tiptoe into the market with small positions, adding to them as the stock and the market prove themselves.But this ""pyramiding"" investing is only as good as the initial buy. That's why you want to make sure you're buying as close as possible to the proper buy point and never chase extended stocks  those more than 5% past their buy points.Also, focus on stocks with superior sales and earnings growth, other strong fundamentals and institutional sponsorship.Don't be tempted by ex-winners that have plummeted to seductively low prices.Look for strong volume on breakouts, at least 50% above average.If you do find a strong stock  once the market is healthy  remember that it's important to hold a stock if it climbs 20% in one to three weeks after it breaks out.Lately, getting a stock that makes any significant gains has been a challenge. So knowing how to sell a stock to minimize losses is essential.A key principle: Never take a loss greater than 7% or 8% from the price at which you buy a stock.Historical studies have shown that winning stocks basically never correct more than 8% from their proper buy point.Once a stock gives you a reason to sell it, do so. Don't wait and allow losses to grow. The more a stock falls, the greater gain it needs just to get back to break-even.If you do sell your stock, don't hesitate to get back into it if the chart presents another buying opportunity. Many quality stocks will often have a shakeout and then run up, receding to the 10-week moving average and rallying from there.If that happens, you don't want to miss out.Flir Systems (FLIR) offers an example of how following buy and sell rules keeps you on the right track.The maker of thermal-imaging equipment set up in a cup-with-handle base starting last November.The stock broke past the 31.97 buy point in high volume. 1 At this point, the market was in a confirmed uptrend.The stock was up 20% from its buy point by May 2. That was longer than the rapid, three-week advance that indicates a stock has a longer run ahead of it. Still, it was a prudent profit to take at that point.Flir had not given any sell signals, so it was also OK to continue holding.The first sell signal came as it pierced its 50-day moving average 3. It was a serious sell-off, despite a good price recovery.Still, Flir got shoved back below the 50-day line 4 and couldn't rally back. It was a smart time to sell.

640,FLIR,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15, before the market opens.While the company’s stable financial position is expected to drive fourth-quarter results, doubt remains whether its Newport News segment will continue to remain on a growth trajectory.Last quarter, this military shipbuilder delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17.63%.Let’s discuss the factors influencing Huntington Ingalls’ quarterly results, in brief.Stable Financials – A Key CatalystA stable financial position backed by a strong cash generation capacity enables Huntington Ingalls to follow a disciplined capital spending program. In addition, the company focuses on maximizing shareholder value, through both share repurchases and increased dividend payouts. In November 2017, the company raised quarterly dividend to 72 cents per share, up 20% from the previous payout. Management, along with the dividend hike, increased the company’s share repurchase program from $1.2 billion to $2.2 billion. During the first nine months of 2017, Huntington Ingalls repurchased common stock worth $152 million. These moves show the company’s confidence in consistent free cash flow generation.Notably, the company’s net cash from operating activities at the end of third-quarter 2017 was $380 million, while its free cash flow was $5 million. Considering, the dividend hike as well as raised share repurchase program announced by management during the fourth quarter, we expect the company’s upcoming results to show similar solid financial stability as well.Will Newport News Segment Continue to Tread on Growth Path? Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News is the nation's sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. This division, which generates more than 50% of the company’s total revenues, has been underperforming for the last few years. Interestingly, in the third quarter, this segment’s top line rebounded and registered year-over-year growth of 7.7%. However, as per management, the macro trend at Newport News is that it is on the front end of a bunch of new programs across all its product lines. The team is currently engaged in the transition on its aircraft carrier and submarines programs. So there remains a cause of concern because it may take time for demand to wind up for these new programs, which in turn may dent the segment’s top line in the near term. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus estimate of revenues for Newport News unit stands at $1,053 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting an annual decline of 5.9%.Dearth of Order in Q4: A Killjoy? A steady inflow of orders from Pentagon has always provided an impetus to Huntington Ingalls’ results. However, in the fourth quarter the company did not win any notable contract. Nevertheless, considering solid contributions from Camber acquisition along with robust sales volume, overall sales growth for Huntington Ingalls’ fourth quarter remains positive. Notably, our consensus estimate for revenues is estimated at $2.01 billion, implying a 4.3% year-over-year increase.Moreover, the corporate-friendly tax reform adopted by the U.S. government will most likely boost the company’s earnings that will get reflected in the yet-to-be reported quarter’s results.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

Moreover, revenues from the Security segment advanced 16.5% over the prior-year quarter to $65.7 million.FLIR Systems' order backlog for the coming 12 months is pegged at around $709 million as of Sep 30, 2017, reflecting a solid year-over-year increase of 10.1%.Adjusted operating income came in at $101.1 million, compared with $89 million in the prior-year quarter. Sturdy top-line growth drove the rise in income.FLIR Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise FLIR Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | FLIR Systems, Inc. QuoteLiquidity & Cash FlowAs of Sep 30, 2017, the company's cash and cash equivalents were $437 million, compared with $677.7 million as of Sep 30, 2016. Long-term debt was $420.4 million, down from $501.9 million at Dec 31, 2016.Cash flow generated from operating activities in the quarter came in at $104.1 million, significantly up from $88.8 million in the prior-year quarter.OutlookConcurrent with the third quarter earnings release, FLIR Systems tweaked guidance for 2017. The company now projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.83-$1.88, compared with its prior guidance of $1.81-$1.91 per share. Moreover, the company reiterated revenue guidance in the range of $1.78 billion to $1.83 billion.Our TakeFLIR Systems’ diverse portfolio has been a staple growth driver, helping it offset weaknesses associated with any one market. The company’s restructuring efforts in the past five years have allowed it to streamline business operations and optimize growth. Key metrics like revenues, operating income, operating margin and adjusted EPS have materially benefited from such actions. We anticipate this trend to continue in the upcoming quarters as well.However, the fact remains that strong competition from various big and small industry players remains a threat to the company’s financials. Identification of new applications for thermal imaging depending on customer needs, along with development of commercial quantities at reasonable costs, remains a primary challenge for all companies operating in this sector.FLIR Systems currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same space include AeroVironment, Inc.

Its products are used in a wide variety of applications in commercial, industrial and government markets, both international and domestic.

644,FLIR,"The Q3 earnings season is in full swing with 87 S&P 500 members having reported their quarterly results as of Oct 20. So far, the results reflect a positive and reassuring view of corporate earnings, which will most likely get strengthened as we move in the thick of the reporting cycle.Notably, 24.7% of the index’s total market cap have reported results. While annual earnings have improved 9.4%, revenues increased 7.3%. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 71.3%, while that for top line was 70.1%, as of Oct 20.Coming to the Aerospace-Defense industry, we saw Textron Inc. (TXT) kick-starting the Q3 earnings season last week with better-than-expected quarterly numbers. Several other majors in this space are slated to report third-quarter results this week.Notably, projections for the Aerospace sector (one of the 16 Zacks sector), which constitutes the Aerospace-Defense industry, hint at a mixed quarter, when compared to the overall Q3 forecast for the S&P 500 cohort. The sector’s earnings are likely to decline 12.9% on 5.3% higher revenues; while earnings for S&P 500 members are likely to rise 2.6% on 5% higher revenues. For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Preview.Interestingly, defense stocks in the third quarter reached new-all-time highs multiple times, courtesy of the varied supportive defense policy initiatives adopted by President Trump. In particular, the favorable budgetary amendments made by the U.S. government, like the passing of the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 million, have boosted growth prospects of defense stocks. A steady flow of contracts from Pentagon to ‘rebuild’ the U.S. Army also provided an impetus to the stocks. With Trump strongly opposing the budget sequestration imposed by his predecessor, defense stocks are surely to gain notable traction in coming days.With more than 700 companies (180 S&P 500 members) slated to report their results this week, let’s find out where the following defense stocks stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Oct 25.The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) solid deliveries of commercial aircraft are expected to primarily drive the company’s growth in the third quarter. Notably, its commercial deliveries showed a 7.4% annual improvement. Also a solid inflow of contracts for varied defense product offerings from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies will boost its quarterly sales.Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter sales growth is pegged at $24.06 billion, reflecting year-over-year increase of 0.7%.Moreover, thanks to the huge number of commercial orders that the company won, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has predicted higher operating numbers for the third quarter. Commercial Airplanes segment’s operating profit is now expected to be $1,756 million, up 10% year over year.Meanwhile, our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Boeing this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, Boeing lacks the right combination. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Boeing presently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third quarter sales is $7.9 billion, reflecting 2.1% year-over-year growth.In particular, the company won a number of contracts in relation to its submarines. Being one of the top-notch submarine contractors in the nation, such contracts are expected to bolster the company’s Marine Systems segment’s growth. Evidently, our consensus estimate for the Marine Systems’ sales stands at $2,068 million, up 0.2% annually.However, Aerospace segment’s sales growth in the second half of the year might be dented owing to unfavorable margins improvement. Our consensus estimate for the segment is pegged at $2,039 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 9.2%.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively shows that General Dynamics is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.01%.General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation QuoteNorthrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) Aerospace Systems segment that fetch almost half of its sales, is a primary contributor to its quarterly growth.Notably, increased demand as well as deliveries of manned aircraft mainly boosts this segment’s sales. In the third quarter, the company won a number of contracts from the Pentagon. Impressively, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aerospace Systems segment stands at $2,928 million, reflecting annual growth of 12.9%.Segment-wise, Mission Systems business unit has been benefiting from the cost-reduction initiatives. We expect the third-quarter results to reflect strong sales growth for this unit. Evidently, our consensus estimate for sales for Mission Systems unit is $1,156 million, reflecting annual growth of 1%.On the flip side, increased unallocated corporate expenses and effective tax rate dented the company’s second-quarter earnings growth. Anticipating similar expenses to linger, our consensus estimate for Northrop Grumman’s earnings of $2.92 per share reflects 3.2% annual decline.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively shows that Northrop Grumman is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is becausethe company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of -1.93%. Its Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.87, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92 (read more: Will Aerospace Unit Drive Northrop's Q3 Earnings?).Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation QuoteFLIR Systems, Inc.’s (FLIR  -  Free Report) diverse portfolio has been a major growth driver, helping it offset weaknesses associated with any one market.

We expect this trend to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.In addition, impressive traction of FLIR Systems’ products, featuring the Lepton thermal microcamera core, is anticipated to boost the top line significantly. Also strategic acquisitions are likely to boost the company’s inorganic growth. Previously completed acquisitions, including Armasight, DVTEL and Dynamics, are expected to boost the company’s top-line performance.Our proven model shows that FLIR Systems is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

(FLIR  -  Free Report) recently clinched a firm-fixed-price order worth $74.7 million to deliver TacFLIR surveillance cameras in support of the U.S. Army EO/IR-Force Protection (FP) program. The program offers enhanced perimeter security and force protection for U.S. troops stationed across the world.Per the order, the U.S. Army will purchase the systems through Army Contracting Command, Redstone. Under the same program, FLIR Systemshad secured an $8.8-million contract in third-quarter 2017, which required it to deliver other FLIR Ranger radars.  As part of this program, the company has delivered more than a thousand of these EO/IR sensors to the U.S. Army, including a variety of systems. The recent award substantiates its proven ability to rapidly deploy its technology for critical missions, as well as validates the effectiveness of its commercially developed, military qualified approach.The systems will be manufactured in Wilsonville, OR, with deliveries commencing in 2017 and scheduled to be completed in a year.FLIR Systems recently streamlined its operating structure to leverage its vertical integration as well as focus on core markets. The company has realigned six of its segments, namely OEM & Emerging Markets, Surveillance, Instruments, Security, Detection and Maritime into three units. The new segments will be called Government & Defense, Industrial and Commercial.Restructuring activities undertaken by the company since 2013 have helped the company reap synergies and drive profitable growth, combating headwinds like currency fluctuations and tough market conditions.Quarter to date, FLIR Systems’ shares have returned 5.4%, outperforming the industry’s average gain of 2.6%. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s solid execution and streamlined business have helped it drive improvements in backlog, margins, and net income, in recent times.We believe strategic restructuring activities and solid backlog levels indicate the company’s resiliency, which will enable it to sail through difficult economic times and drive growth. It should be noted that brokers are on the sidelines for the stock as its earnings estimates remained unchanged over the month. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 also remained steady at $1.85 over the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Engility Holdings, Inc.

647,FLIR,"Designer and manufacturer of thermal imaging systems, FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report) managed to impress investors with second-quarter 2017 results, wherein its earnings beat estimates by 2.4%. Buoyed by positive industry trends and solid operational execution, the company expects to continue its earnings momentum on the back of complementary acquisitions and steady market traction of its recently launched products.We believe, a phenomenal performance by the company’s OEM & Emerging Markets segment as well as its Surveillance and Instruments segments bode well for growth for rest of the fiscal year. Moreover, the company enjoys a robust foothold in an expanding electronics market and has several growth drivers working in its favor.Read on to find out the key factors which make the company an attractive proposition for investors right now.Factors at Play FLIR Systems’ core strength in providing reliable and effective imaging along with threat-detection technologies has been bolstering growth momentum. Over the past couple of quarters, the company’s “Commercially-Developed, Military Qualified” (“CDMQ”) model has been quite popular in government and military markets, which has enabled it to combat softness in cyclical spending associated with government markets. The company is likely bolster the prospects of its government business further using the model, consequently adding to its strength.FLIR Systems’ diverse portfolio has been a consistent growth driver, helping it mitigate weaknesses associated with any particular market. Over the past few years, the company’s solid execution and restructuring efforts have enabled it to streamline business operations and optimize growth. Key metrics like revenues, operating income, operating margin and adjusted earnings per share have considerably benefited from such actions. We expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters as well.Moreover, FLIR Systems’ strong commitment towards introduction of innovative products to expand customer base and enhance foothold in new markets is expected to boost the top line significantly. Since the launch of Lepton technology, the company has seen a compound annual growth rate of 58% in total unit volumes. Going forward, we expect steady market traction of its newly launched products to help the company drive revenue growth in the respective segments. In addition, FLIR Systems’ keen eye for strategic acquisitions is expected to be conducive to inorganic growth. Its previously completed acquisitions including Armasight, DVTEL and Dynamics has strengthened presence in recreational, military weapon sights and scopes markets as well as full-spectrum end-to-end security system.HeadwindsHowever, FLIR System’s financials have been hurting from waning consumer spending and capital investments over the past few quarters. Strong competition from various big and small sector players including the likes of Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. (SPR  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) remain a threat to FLIR System’s profitability. Sluggish economic growth in many of its key markets is also expected to add to its challenges.Further, the company’s primary markets remain quite volatile. Multiple factors like timing, number and size of orders, variations in the volume, and shipments of orders pose significant risks for the company and are beyond its control. Further, the company’s operating margins are exposed to multiple seasonal fluctuations including contracting by the U. S. government and certain foreign governments, volatility of funding by customers and tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration.Considering growth drivers and the risks that the company faces, we believe its focus on business streamlining along with positive trends in certain business areas offer FLIR System modest growth opportunities.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The favorable combination of FLIR Systems Zacks Rank #3 and +2.44% ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Growth Factors in this Past QuarterFLIR Systems’ diverse portfolio has been a staple growth driver, helping it offset weaknesses associated with any one market. The company’s restructuring efforts over the past five years have allowed it to streamline business operations and optimize growth. Key metrics like revenues, operating income, operating margin and adjusted EPS have materially benefitted from such actions. We expect this trend to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.In addition, impressive traction of FLIR Systems’ products, featuring the Lepton® thermal microcamera core, is expected to boost the top line significantly. Since the launch of Lepton technology, the company has seen a 58% compound annual growth rate in total unit volumes. Products launched during the first quarter – including X6900sc SLS, X8500sc SLS cameras and upgraded version of FLIR M-series thermal cameras – are expected to ramp up sales for the quarter under review.Moreover, FLIR Systems’ keen eye for strategic acquisitions is expected to be conducive to its inorganic growth. Previously completed acquisitions, including Armasight, DVTEL and Dynamics, are expected to boost top-line performance. In addition, the company’s diligent CDMQ model is likely to compound the sales of its government and military business. Using this model, FLIR Systems has been able to combat softness in cyclical spending associated with government markets.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:KLX Inc.

650,FLIR,"We issued an updated research report on defense major, L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report), on Jul 19, 2017. The company is a prime system contractor for aircraft modernization and maintenance; Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR) collection platforms; simulation and training; and government systems support services.In addition to its strong presence in the U.S. defense space, the company continues to enjoy a steady flow of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) contracts as well. In particular, L3 Technologies will be definitely benefited from a large addressable international market with sales directly to foreign allied governments and FMS agreements between the U.S. Government and foreign governments. In this line, the company secured new orders in Indonesia, Korea, China, South Africa, France, Japan and Kuwait during the first quarter of 2017.The company follows a disciplined divestment strategy to efficiently focus on its core operations. Toward this end, during the first quarter, it divested its CTC Aviation Jet Services Limited (Aviation Jet Services) business for approximately $1.3 million. The business provided non-core aircraft management and operational services as part of commercial training solutions based in the U.K. The company also sold out its Display Product Line for $7 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4 million for the company’s first-quarter results.L3 Technologies boasts a strong balance sheet that allows it to continue with its trend of consistent dividend hike. In this line, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 7.1% in the first quarter.Furthermore, the company’s stock has gained 20.2% in the last one year, outperforming the 17.4% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might have been driven by the strong growth that the company witnesses in the commercial aviation market. In particular, the continued recapitalization of fleets by the mature markets of North America and Europe must have boosted the company’s expansion.On the flip side, L3 Technologies has been witnessing weak performance in some of its product lines. The most worrying aspect of this is the downward trend in margins for service-related work due to competitive pressure.In fact, L3 Technologies faces stiff competition from other majors in the Aerospace sector like FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report), Arotech Corp. (ARTX  -  Free Report) and Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report).Zacks RankL3 Technologies currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

651,FLIR,"FLIR Systems Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Feb 14.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.3%. FLIR Systems has an average positive surprise of 1.3% in the trailing four quarters.We expect FLIR Systems to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that FLIR Systems has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: FLIR Systems has an Earnings ESP of +0.36%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.FLIR Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise FLIR Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | FLIR Systems, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected ResultsOver the past few quarters, FLIR Systems’ diverse business portfolio (in terms of geographies, products and markets) has remained a staple growth driver. Further, the company’s restructuring efforts in the past five years have helped it reap synergies and drive profitable growth, combating headwinds like currency fluctuations and tough market conditions. Solid execution along with streamlined business is helping the company drive solid improvements in backlog, adjusted gross margin, operating margin and net income. Going forward, we believe strategic restructuring activities and solid backlog levels will help it sail through difficult economic times and drive growth.Moreover, the company remains strongly committed toward introduction of innovative products to expand its customer base and enhance foothold in new markets. For instance, since the launch of Lepton technology, the company has seen a 58% compound annual growth rate in total unit volumes. Products launched during the last reported quarter, including, three thermal imaging-equipped test and measurement products, Lepton microcamera thermal core, Infrared Guided Measurement and FLIR FB-Series are anticipated to bolster sales for the upcoming quarter. This apart, the company’s diligent CDMQ model is expected to boost the sales of its government as well as military business.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Surveillance segment in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains high at $166 million compared with third-quarter revenues of $147 million. Revenues from Instruments segment are also anticipated to be high with estimate of $103 million compared with reported revenues of $91 million in the prior quarter. The company’s acquired businesses, including Point Grey, Armasight and Prox Dynamics are expected to contribute to fiscal fourth-quarter sales as well.However the fact remains that, poor economic conditions across the company’s key operating regions may hamper capital investment and consumer spending, consequently weighing on its profitability. Also, the company’s business remains prone to political uncertainty and currency volatility globally, adding to concerns.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Churchill Downs, Incorporated (CHDN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +29.03% and a Zacks Rank #1.

Revenues from the Instruments segment came in at $86.0 million, up 10% on a year-over-year basis.The Security segment’s revenues were down 22% to $49.7 million from the prior year, mainly attributable to a decline in Lorex-branded products. Also, Detection segment revenues shrunk 25% to $26.7 million, largely attributable to unfavorable timing of DR-SKO program shipments. Maritime segment revenues were flat year over year, totaling to $55.1 million.FLIR Systems' backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next 12 months came in at $645 million, reflecting an increase of 6% from the year-ago quarter figure .Adjusted operating income came in at $81.0 million compared with $70.1 million in the prior-year quarter.

654,FLIR,"Defense major L3 Technologies Inc.’s (LLL  -  Free Report) Communications Systems business segment recently clinched a contract for testing, inspecting and upgrading the Marines Corp AN/TSC-156C and the Army AN/TSC-156B/D terminals. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Aug 10, 2022.Valued at $48.8 million, the contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. Per the terms of the deal, work locations and funding will be determined with each order.AN/TSC-156C & AN/TSC-156B/D TerminalsBoth AN/TSC-156C & AN/TSC-156B/D are tactical satellite communications (satcom) terminal that operates in the super high frequency over commercial and military satellites. Through these terminals, the company aids in providing flexible, mobile, high capacity, extended-range communications connectivity using military and commercial satellite space segments.Our ViewL3 Technologies is a leading provider of a broad range of communication and electronic systems and products used on military and commercial platforms. Its Communications Systems segment offers airborne, space and surface data link terminals, ground stations, and transportable tactical SATCOM systems. This might enable the company to pose stiff competition to its peers like FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report), Arotech Corp (ARTX  -  Free Report) and Mikros Systems Corp. .With increasing prevalence of cyber attacks these days, strong and secured SATCOM systems are the need of the hour. U.S. being the largest digitally advanced country, is also the worst affected in terms of cyber crimes. This has pushed its focus toward strengthening its SATCOM communications even more in recent times. In this context, President Trump’s Fiscal 2017 appropriation budget request included funding worth $7.2 billion for operations and maintenance to address urgent readiness shortfalls across the joint force, including improvements in cyber intelligence capabilities.We believe, if this proposal gets approved, it will boost the revenues of defense contractors like L3 Technologies, which provides advanced communications solutions.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

657,FLIR,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, L3 Technologies delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.36%. It is worth noting that the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 10.46%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAmong the highlights of the second quarter, L-3 Technologies clinched multiple contracts for providing commercial aviation training, resourcing and simulation solutions in 2017. The deals were awarded by global commercial operators and airline partners. With a total value of more than $115 million, these contracts included delivery of airline pilot training programs, airline pilot resourcing, mid-level and classroom devices, and the sale of eight full flight simulators (FFS) to date this year.Moreover, on the international frontier, the company continues to expand its footprint in key markets, particularly the Middle East and Asia, by adding resources and personnel to address opportunities and better serve its customers. We expect its result in the to-be-reported quarter to duly reflect such initiatives.Overall for the second quarter, L3 Technologies expects sales to be roughly $2.7 billion, reflecting flat organic growth. Earnings per share is projected to lie in between $1.90-$2.00. Again, free cash outflow is anticipated in the range of 50 million–150 million. Moreover, management expects the company to witness higher margins of about 9%.On the flip side, L3 Technologies has been witnessing weak performance in some of its product lines. The noteworthy aspect of this is the downward trend in margins for service-related work due to competitive pressure, which might be reflected in second-quarters’ results.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects 8.11% year-over-year growth, the consensus for revenues is pegged at $2.70 billion, implying a 1.47% year-over-year improvement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that L3 Technologies will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: L3 Technologies has an Earnings ESP of -0.99%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.01, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: L3 Technologies carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc.

The year-over-year improvement can primarily be attributed to the company’s solid top-line performance.Inside the HeadlinesFLIR Systems’ revenues grew 8.1% year over year to $439.6 million. The top line also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $397.5 million. Strong growth across the company’s two of the three segments drove the overall top line.Segment-wise, revenues at the Industrial segment increased 10.3% year over year to $170.7 million. The improvement was driven by higher handheld thermal imager and camera core sales. At the Government and Defense segment revenues came in at $159.3 million, up 15.3% on a year-over-year basis. The uptick can be attributed to international deliveries. However, the Commercial segments’ revenues declined 3.7% to $109.6 million from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted operating income came in at $87.8 million compared with $69.6 million in the prior-year quarter. Healthy top-line improvement led to the rise in income.Liquidity & Cash FlowAs of Mar 31, 2018, the company's cash and cash equivalents were $452.1 million compared with $519.1 million as of Dec 31, 2017.

659,FLIR,"The defense space kick-started the Q1 earnings season with Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) releasing results on Apr 18. This multi-industry conglomerate’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  Today, sector behemoth Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results. In fact, majority of the defense giants are expected to release financial numbers this week.As of Apr 20, 87 S&P 500 index members reported their quarterly results, wherein earnings increased 25% on 10.7% higher revenues. The space’s earnings are anticipated to record an 18.3% increase on 7.7% higher revenues, while two of the 16 Zacks sectors are likely to suffer a decline in earnings. We expect to have a clear picture of the space’s performance by the end of this week as 178 of the index members are scheduled to release their quarterly figures.As of Apr 20, total Q1 earnings from the broader Aerospace sector are expected to increase 14.9% year over year on 4.6% higher revenues.  For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our Earnings Preview.Defense stocks remained on a growth trajectory in the first quarter, courtesy of fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal presented by President Trump. Of the total amount, $686.1 billion has been reserved as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting 5% real growth over the initial FY18 President’s budget and 10% real growth over the current Continuing Resolution (CR). A steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon also provided an impetus to the stocks. Moreover, growing international market for weaponries with several nations increasing their defense spending is also likely to fuel the industry’s growth.Let’s take a look at four defense majors—The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report)—all of which are scheduled to release Q1 results before the opening bell on Apr 25.Boeing delivered a positive earnings surprise of 64.95% in the last quarter. Notably, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 20.69%.Being the largest aircraft manufacturer and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Boeing enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both the Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy its varied product offerings. Markedly, the company received a number of orders for both commercial as well as military jets in the first quarter.Such steady inflow of contract wins will surely boost Boeing’s quarterly sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $22.2 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5.9%.During its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings call, Boeing announced that higher volumes will drive its bottom line in 2018. Though, the company’s overall deliveries declined, commercial deliveries remained high. With the commercial business constituting almost 60% of Boeing’s total revenues, we expect the unit to drive the company’s first-quarter earnings.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Impressively, Boeing constitutes that right combination.The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.70%.

The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.02%.Order flow form the Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States generally boost quarterly sales of defense bellwethers and General Dynamics is no exception.In sync with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $7.5 billion, reflecting 1.4% year-over-year growth.In the first quarter, General Dynamics offered to buy CSRA — an information technology provider — for $9.6 billion, including $2.8 billion of debt.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Dynamics’ first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.47 per share, marking 0.4% annual decline. This might have been caused by higher R&D expenses that management expects to incur across 2018.The current Earnings ESP for General Dynamics is -0.23%, while it carries a Zacks Rank #3.Therefore, our model does not show that the company is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter (read more: General Dynamics' Q1 Earnings: Is a Beat in the Offing?). General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation Quote Northrop Grumman delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.55% in the last quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 16.17%.The Aerospace Systems segment fetches almost half of Northrop Grumman’s sales and has traditionally been a primary contributor to its top-line growth. Notably, in the first quarter, the company received a number of contracts for this segment. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aerospace Systems segment is $3,131 million, reflecting annual growth of 16.1%.The company’s total sales growth has historically benefited from higher sales at the Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems segment. Cumulatively, this is likely to boost the company’s total sales growth for the first quarter. While lower corporate tax on account of the recent tax reform is likely to boost the company’s bottom line, Northrop Grumman is expected to incur notable expenses in regard to its Orbital ATK acquisition.The current Earnings ESP for Northrop Grumman is -0.99%, while it carries a Zacks Rank #2.

Moreover, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 3.59%.The company’s persistent focus on introduction of new products has enabled it to penetrate new markets and expand its customer base. Notably, since the launch of Lepton technology, FLIR Systems has witnessed solid compound annual growth rate in total unit volumes. We believe that steady market traction of the newly launched products should continue supplementing sales performance in the upcoming quarters as well.The Earnings ESP for FLIR Systems is +2.33%, while the company carries a Zacks Rank #3.

660,FLIR,"FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 58 cents per share, delivering a positive surprise of 3.6%.We expect FLIR Systems to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that FLIR Systems has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: FLIR Systems has an Earnings ESP of +2.33% as the Most Accurate estimate of 44 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.FLIR Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise FLIR Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | FLIR Systems, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Reasons Driving Better-Than-Expected ResultsFLIR Systems continues to benefit from its well-diversified business portfolio in terms of geographies, products and markets. Also, the company’s restructuring efforts over the past five years have helped it to combat headwinds like currency fluctuations and difficult market conditions. Moreover, the company’s robust execution and streamlined business have enabled it to drive solid improvements in backlog, adjusted gross margin, net income and earnings per share. We believe the company’s strategic restructuring activities and solid backlog levels will continue driving profitable growth.Also, the company’s core strength in providing reliable and effective imaging & threat-detection technologies is expected to bolster its performance in the quarter. Meanwhile, increased adoption of thermal imaging in a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from military to personal hand-held cameras and Smartphones, continue to fuel growth in this market. Moreover, FLIR Systems’ government and military business has been faring well over the past few quarters driven by its CDMQ model.Further, the company’s persistent focus on introduction of innovative products has enabled it to penetrate new markets and expand its customer base. Notably, since the launch of Lepton technology, FLIR Systems has witnessed solid compound annual growth rate in total unit volumes. We believe that steady market traction of the newly launched products should continue supplementing sales performance in the upcoming quarters as well. In the meantime, its recent acquisitions are acting as major profit churners. The previously completed buyouts are anticipated to boost top-line growth in the quarter under review.Despite these tailwinds, FLIR Systems’ gross margins remain vulnerable to a host of factors, including product mix changes and manufacturing cost absorption. Also, high manufacturing cost absorption is likely to restrict the company’s growth. Moreover, poor economic conditions across its key operating regions might hamper capital investment and consumer spending, thereby weighing on its profitability.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.91% and a Zacks Rank #2.

(LLL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.51% and a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.
