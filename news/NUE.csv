5,NUE,"A new threat by President Trump to apply 10% tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese imported goods put the U.S. stock market on a slicker path to a potential market correction on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average and the NYSE composite battled to stay above their key 50-day moving averages.Volume rose on both main exchanges vs. Monday, according to early data readings. That implied unusually heavy institutional selling.The Dow industrial average and the NYSE composite slid 1.1% and 0.6% in stocks today, respectively, but both rebounded off their session lows. The Dow industrial average, finishing at 24,700, is now down about 0.1% since Jan. 1.Those losses, however, were not as frightening as the sell-offs among China mainland indexes. Hong Kong's Hang Seng benchmark dropped 2.8% overnight  and cut its long-term 200-day moving average for the first time since December 2016. The Shanghai composite skidded 3.8% lower, hitting lows not seen since June 2016.Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) and other high-octane growth stocks that are leading the digital transformation of the global economy continued to flex strength.Netflix, the eighth largest company on the Nasdaq exchange by market cap, jumped 3.7% to a new high of 404.98 in brisk volume, 84% above its 50-day average. The big move helped the Nasdaq composite cut its early 1.4% drubbing to less than a 0.3% decline by day's end.Netflix joined IBD Leaderboard on Dec. 6, 2016, as the stock was forming a base next to a much larger set of bases. Then the stock broke out past a correct entry point at 129.39 in early January 2017. The stock has since advanced 208% and is currently extended from a proper buy point.At 7725, the Nasdaq holds a 12% year-to-date gain. The Nasdaq 100 also hustled off its intraday low, slipping just 0.3%. Both the Nasdaq composite and the Nasdaq 100 are trading less than 1% below their all-time highs.The S&P 500 chopped its early decline to 0.4% as strength in defensive stocks, including utilities, offset weakness in automaker, steel, construction and farming machinery, chemical and coal stocks. Biotech, movie, drug store chain and auto parts firms also rallied.The small-cap S&P 600 outperformed, losing just 0.1%. At 1044, the index is up 11.5% since Jan. 1.Also within IBD Leaderboard, at least three top-shelf retailers seem to be feeling less of an impact on the escalating tit for tat between the world's two largest economies.Discount and variety store chain Five Below (FIVE), premium yogawear retailer Lululemon (LULU) and online marketplace Etsy (ETSY) are all holding up well since their excellent breakouts in recent months.All three Leaderboard names show strong double-digit earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Etsy soared 28% last week on news that it's adding new services for sellers while also raising transaction fees.Etsy grew its top line by 19%, 21%, 24% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The Street expects Q2 revenue to jump 25% to $127.1 million and earnings to rise 150% to a nickel a share.

C stands for current earnings growth of 25% or more in the latest quarter. An acceleration in the rate of year-over-year growth? Even better. Institutional investors highly prize companies that are able to post bigger profit gains vs. recent quarters.Lululemon, a member of the IBD 50, still sees the majority of its revenue coming from North America. The Vancouver-based firm has posted EPS increases of 3%, 19%, 33% and 72% in the past four quarters. In other words, it's shown growth acceleration in the bottom line for three periods in a row.The Street sees earnings rising 26% to 49 cents a share in the July-ending fiscal second quarter.Financial payment, credit history and transactions-related firms are also holding up well. TransUnion (TRU), Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) are keeping their solid long-term uptrends intact. The former, also in IBD Leaderboard, reversed from mild losses to gain 0.6%.Square (SQ), the innovator in point of sale technology and financial services for small and medium businesses, doesn't seem to be perturbed by Trump's aggressive tariff policy. The San Francisco-based company dropped 4% in the early going before shaving the loss to less than 0.4%.At 65.94, the stock is holding on to a 15% gain past a 57.29 entry in a nine-week cup with handle.That base also shows elements of a double bottom, one of the eight key chart patterns that growth investors can use to time their market buys during a confirmed uptrend in the stock market.Wall Street forecasts Square increasing its earnings by 70% to 46 cents a share in 2018, then doing it again to 78 cents in 2019.No doubt, commodities are being targeted by Chinese government officials with less than six months to go before critical midyear U.S. elections take place in November.Nucor (NUE), the largest U.S. steelmaker by market value, dropped as much as 4% and flirted with its rising 50-day moving average before rebounding some to end at 65.47.The Charlotte, N.C., firm has been locked in a trading range of 59 to 70 since January. Yet the stock is also building a new base and stands just 7% below the 70.48 peak.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings vaulting 86% to $6.67 a share this year, then easing 7% to $6.18 in 2019. Sales growth has been powerful lately, rising 14%, 30%, 22%, 21%, 29% and 16% in the past six quarters.Tesla (TSLA) led the automakers down more than 4% as a group on a price-weighted basis. Autos finished worst among all 197 industry groups tracked by IBD each day.But Tesla, the electric vehicle pioneer, actually needed to catch its breath following strong gains the past three weeks.Shares closed down nearly 5% to 352.55 in heavy turnover. Watch to see if the 350 round number level offers a floor of support. Tesla also now has a nice air cushion above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages.For now, Tesla continues to work on a huge base that stretches all the way back to September 2017. In the week ended Sept. 15 that year, the stock broke out of an 11-week cup with handle at 370.10, but reversed sharply lower the next week. The negative action triggered the golden rule of investing — keep your losses small in every investment, preferably at 8% or less.In other financial markets, crude oil rallied amid some hopes that OPEC and Russia will agree to either no change in their production quotas or raise output only by a little. Investors will be watching the results of a Friday meeting closely.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell 3 basis points to 2.89%. Yields fall when bond prices rise.

7,NUE,"The Trump administration announced late Monday that it will extend steel and aluminum tariff exemptions for the European Union, Mexico, Canada and other allies for another month.Although the tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum were justified on national security grounds, President Donald Trump seems to have realized that the real national security threat relates to advanced technologies, not industrial metals.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other U.S. officials are heading to China this week for talks to avoid a trade war. But Beijing signaled that some things aren't open for discussion. China won't consider Trump's demand that Beijing offer a plan to shrink the trade deficit by $100 billion. Nor will it back off its Made in China 2025 agenda to achieve leadership in artificial intelligence, robotics and other cutting-edge technology, aided by $300 billion in funding from the Chinese government.Steel and aluminum shares such as U.S. Steel (X) and Alcoa (AA) initially surged as Trump signaled he opposed any exemptions to global tariffs of 25% for steel imports and 10% for aluminum. But shares reversed after Trump granted exemptions to countries responsible for more than half of imports.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSteelmaker Nucor (NUE), in announcing earnings on April 19 said that pricing had improved and predicted ""sustainable strength"" in steel markets. But Nucor management argued against the breadth of exemptions granted by Trump. ""We believe broad-based tariffs with few exceptions are needed to address the historic volume of unfairly traded imports and transshipping that is done to avoid trade duties,"" the company said in a statement.Aluminum stocks surged again the other week, but that was due to an unrelated Trump administration action. The Treasury Department slapped sanctions on United Company Rusal, the Russian aluminum giant. Earlier in April, the Treasury began implementing sanctions authorized by Congress last year to punish Russia for interfering in the 2016 election.Alcoa shares were the biggest beneficiary, but the gains didn't last long. Aluminum prices and Alcoa stock fell back after the Treasury Department said it won't enforce the sanctions for now.""The U.S. government is not targeting the hardworking people who depend on Rusal and its subsidiaries,"" Mnuchin said.

22,NUE,"U.S. stock indexes booked solid gains Wednesday afternoon, but biomed stocks dived on President-elect Donald Trump's vow to bring down drug prices.The Nasdaq advanced 0.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1% and 1.4%, respectively. The small cap Russell 2000 rose 0.5%. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.Medical stocks struggled after Trump said in a Time Magazine interview that he doesn't like ""what's happened with drug prices"" and would bring down prices. Trump made no mention of investment in research and development, which is never free. Companies such as Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) put 40% of revenue into research and development, while Big Cap 20 stock Incyte (INCY) put 63% of revenue into R&D last year. Without strong growth in revenue and profits, R&D budgets would shrink, and the odds of developing new drugs would also fade.High-end biomeds, which rely the most on R&D, led the retreat Wednesday with the group down about 4%.Meanwhile, for the rest of the market it was business as usual.Bank stocks, which have led the Trump rally, were little changed. The exchange-traded fund PowerShares KBW Bank (KBWB) inched up 0.7% to 47.05.

23,NUE,"The stock market loves to do the unexpected. Veterans on Wall Street call it a contrarian streak.Did you see the latest example of the market's psychological mischief? On the night of the Nov. 8 presidential election, fear consumed traders. At one point futures on the Dow Jones industrials index plunged 800 points. Yet by Friday, the index finished the week up 959 points, more than 5%.This past week, the popular blue-chip gauge refused to give back any of last week's rally. The Russell 2000, meanwhile, started the week with an upward surge of nearly 1.3%, after catapulting more than 10% higher last week. With less than an hour to go in Friday's trade, the popular small cap index was poised to gain another 2.4%.The S&P 500 closed down less than 1 point on Monday, but also looks to finish higher for the week. That's bullish action, considering that the large-cap benchmark climbed an astonishing 79 points, or 3.8%, last week.The NYSE composite also looks set to gain some additional ground for the week, following a 3.5% gain last week.Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) all struggled on Monday with losses of 2% to 3% each, yet the market cap-weighted Nasdaq composite finished down only 0.4% on Monday. Why? The Nasdaq is certainly dominated by large tech and consumer-oriented companies, but don't forget the thousands of other smaller firms in the fields of banking, retailing, manufacturing, biotechnology and commodities.Did you see solid gains in heavy volume by Airgain (AIRG) (now up 35% past 17.04 IPO base buy point), Cognex (CGNX) (extended 10% past a 53.55 flat base proper entry) and WingStop (WING) (building a new base since Aug. 15)? All of these Nasdaq-listed names rallied big for the week in rapid turnover.Such action is a hint that equity trading desks and large funds aren't finished buying yet, even after last week's big stock market bounce.Looking ahead, will the market do something even more unexpected?To be more specific, will four years of Donald Trump in the White House be just what the doctor ordered to keep the aging stock market rally going even with 7-1/2 years of gains already behind it? And could the rise in U.S. equities even accelerate?America and the world are still pondering the latest sea change in U.S. politics and governing. But the accompanying chart suggests that good times for long-suffering equity investors may be closer around the corner.Why? The market action since 2000 has been showing similar action to an earlier period: 1968 to 1987.For 14 long years from 1968 to 1982, the S&P 500 struggled to break free from a grinding trading range. Slow growth and high inflation kept it trapped in a series of bear markets, the worst of which cut the market in half in 1973-74.That all changed in 1982 when President Ronald Reagan slashed taxes and unleashed an 18-year super bull market.Jump to 2000. After extraordinary stock gains that ultimately ended in extreme excesses, it was time for another long period of consolidation. It took 13 years for the S&P 500 to completely break through to new high ground. But for the past two years, the stock market has been stuck in neutral.History doesn't precisely repeat itself, but as the late writer Mark Twain was once quoted as saying, it does rhyme. Today, if you overlay the current market with the earlier period on the chart, an interesting parallel emerges.

24,NUE,"Steel demand could jump 20% annually for five years under President-elect Donald Trump's plans to spend big on the nation's infrastructure, offering a reason to invest long-term in stocks like U.S. Steel (X) for the first time in a decade, Morgan Stanley said in a research note Monday.""While specificity and details are still scarce, we believe Trump's plans for infrastructure spending and trade protection, as two of the most digestible of his proposals, could be early in the queue,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Evan Kurtz said in a research note. ""These policies should benefit the U.S. steel industry by both adding to demand and curbing import supply.""The firm upgraded U.S. Steel and AK Steel (AKS) to overweight and iron ore miner Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF) to equal weight.U.S. Steel shot up 8% to 27.78 in the stock market today, closing just above a 27 .74 buy point in a cup-without-handle base. AK Steel leapt 10.4% and Cliffs Natural Resources 3.4%.Steel stocks have been on a tear ever since Trump vowed in his early Wednesday morning victory speech to ""fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals."" That speech was also absent of the combative tone that worried many people during Trump's campaign, helping pad the market's recent rally.While U.S. Steel and AK Steel ""have less direct sales to construction end markets, about 20% of flat-rolled products go into construction,"" Kurtz wrote.That, he said, ""should push up pricing across the entire flat-rolled product family regardless of the end market, and the higher fixed costs at X and AKS offer more leverage to an infrastructure cycle.""Kurtz also noted that Dan DiMicco, the former CEO of steel manufacturer Nucor (NUE), has been Trump's senior trade advisor. Kurtz said he wouldn't be surprised to see DiMicco become the U.S. trade representative.U.S. steel makers have long accused China of flooding the market with cheap steel, dragging prices lower and hurting U.S. steel companies. The U.S. has imposed steel dumping duties on China under President Obama.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks that might have anything to do with the roads, bridges and other key elements of America's infrastructure have taken off following Trump's election. That potential infrastructure spending, along with the prospect of tax cuts and less regulation, also has implications for banks. Trade — and whether it has decimated the U.S. economy and working class — was a central issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, from Trump and Democratic contender Bernie Sanders.While Trump's appeal to the nation's white, disenfranchised Rust Belt helped propel him to victory, Democratic rival Hillary Clinton criticized him for reportedly buying steel from Chinese companies for some real estate developments.RELATED:The Case For A Trump Bull Market — Tech Stocks Fall, But Small Caps, Banks RiseHillary Clinton Vs.

"
25,NUE,"Donald Trump's economic policies, uncertain as they are, have sent the stock market to new highs, but are the days of slow growth really over?While economists are boosting their GDP forecasts for 2017, they are by no means expecting a boom. And some are worried that the gains from tax cuts and more infrastructure spending may be relatively short-lived.Economists are hardly of one mind, and their views should be taken with an even bigger grain of salt than usual given that Trump and Republicans in Congress have yet to show their cards. Still, investors should understand the high degree of difficulty of the maneuver the incoming administration is about to undertake.Consider that the Ronald Reagan boom fueled by tax cuts and defense spending started when interest rates and unemployment had nowhere to go but down, whereas Federal Reserve economists now think the U.S. is close to full employment and the 10-year Treasury yield sank to a historic low of 1.34% in July. In other words, rates have nowhere to go but up and the jobless rate may not be able to fall much without increasing inflation pressure.The spike in interest rates since Trump's election — the 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.33% on Monday despite pulling back from last week's 16-month high — will cut total home sales (new and existing) by 5% from October's nine-year high over the next several months, wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.That can't be good news for big homebuilders like D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and Pulte Group (PHM), and the sector has been a laggard during the postelection stock market rally. Still, Shepherdson says, the economic impact of slower housing market activity will be modest for three reasons. The sector makes up a much smaller share of GDP than it did before the mortgage crisis. Further, retailers of building materials and appliances , such as Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD), will only feel the effect of the housing slowdown on a lagged basis, perhaps not until the spring of 2018.But the big reason that the economy won't sweat higher rates next year is the coming fiscal boost courtesy of Trump and the GOP Congress. While Shepherdson thinks tax cuts are more likely to pass than an infrastructure spending package, he notes that the Tax Policy Center's measure of Trump's corporate and individual income-tax cuts comes to $198 billion in fiscal 2017.""Even if half of that money is saved, the boost to GDP growth would be some 0.5 percentage point, more than offsetting the housing hit,"" Shepherdson wrote.Shepherdson said he's upped his GDP growth forecast to 3.25% in 2017. Yet, the election forecast also led to his ""sharply weaker forecast for the second half of 2018,"" because he expects the fiscal boost to lead to higher inflation.IBD'S TAKE: As markets reassess prospects for faster growth, stocks like Freeport-McMoRan, Nucor and Martin Marietta are consolidating postelection gains. Read The Big Picture every day to find out whether the rally has further to run. And check out IBD Leaderboard to look for insight on stock standouts.The big uncertainty is whether the tax cuts encourage a substantial increase in labor-force participation, as Trump's advisors expect. In that case, faster growth won't fuel an overshoot in inflation that leads the Federal Reserve to step up its pace of rate hikes.""We can't know what will happen to the labor market in the face of substantial fiscal stimulus,"" Shepherdson admits, but he's worried that companies will continue to have trouble finding workers who have the skills they need.Another possibility is that the GOP could create more slack in the labor market by changing work-reducing incentives, including the ObamaCare employer mandate to offer coverage to workers clocking 30 hours per week and the Obama administration overtime rule that a federal judge just put on hold.Shepherdson is hardly alone in worrying that a GOP burst of tax-cut and spending fuel is coming at a less-than-ideal time. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, in a Nov. 17 appearance before Congress, interpreted the bond-market reaction to Trump's election as factoring in the potential ""inflationary consequences"" from enacting a stimulus when the economy was ""relatively close to maximum employment.""Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research, figures that the Trump tax cuts and infrastructure spending worth $650 billion over two years could add up to 0.9 percentage point to annual GDP growth, though the same package could have had twice as much bang for the buck if enacted during a recession.A third big difference between the task facing Trump and the one that faced Reagan is that publicly held federal debt has more than doubled as a share of GDP. That raises the risk that Trump and the GOP Congress will fire their fiscal bullets, leading the economy to overheat, resulting in ""a deeper recession"" because there's less fiscal space to help revive growth several years down the line.It's unclear whether concerns about the budget will limit Trump's coming infrastructure spending package, which has led investors to snap up shares of copper producer Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and steel maker Nucor (NUE).Not everyone is so concerned about the timing of the coming fiscal expansion. In fact, the 35-nation Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development on Monday urged policymakers to seize ""a unique window of opportunity to make more active use of fiscal levers to boost growth and reduce inequality without compromising debt levels.""The group sees U.S. growth picking up to 2.3% in 2017 and 3% in 2018.Beyond the issue of timing, economists have big concerns over what steps Trump will take regarding immigration and trade. Moody's Analytics figures that deportations and a less-welcoming environment for unauthorized immigrants under Trump could reduce the labor force by 2.16 million workers. Since GDP growth equals the increase in hours worked plus productivity growth, that would be a negative.Trade is an even bigger wild card. The possibilities range from Trump using his bully pulpit to get Ford (F) and United Technologies (UTX) unit Carrier to keep work in the U.S. to a growth-killing trade war.The forecast from Jefferies & Co. economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons may be about as good as it gets for Republicans trying to protect or expand their majorities in the 2018 elections: GDP growth of around 3% in 2018, with a jobless rate of 4% and the personal consumption expenditures inflation at a manageable 2.5%.""Donald Trump's domestic fiscal policy proposals are pro-growth and will promote a stronger consumer sector (and) improved labor-market conditions for semiskilled and unskilled workers,"" they wrote. ""Reduced regulation will also free resources for more productive uses.""RELATED:What's Really Doable In Trump's First 100 Days?Trump Makes 'Progress' On Indiana Carrier Plant, Using Twitter Bully Pulpit

"
28,NUE,"There's a decent case to be made that investors' fear of Donald Trump winning the White House may turn out to be a good deal worse than the reality, at least in the intermediate term.Stock indexes crashed 5% overnight with odds for a December Federal Reserve hike tumbling. But after an initial modest sell-off at the open, the major averages have reversed for solid gains, with soaring bond yields.The overnight reaction to Trump looked like it may vindicate economists who predicted the market would fall up to 12% if Trump won. But once you consider Trump's near-term priorities and the challenges of working with Congress — even a GOP Congress restrained by a filibuster in the Senate — the agenda looks more market friendly than unfriendly.Priority one for Trump on the domestic front is likely to be revving up growth via infrastructure spending, cutting the corporate tax rate and offering multinationals the chance to repatriate overseas profits at a lower tax rate.He's talked about spending $1 trillion on infrastructure, double what Hillary Clinton proposed to spend, with both candidates talking up the potential of public-private partnerships.""With the focus on infrastructure, the basic resources sector is one of the best performers today,"" wrote Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research in London.Both Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) surged on the stock market today, suring 12% and 9%, respectively. Shares of gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) initially spiked as Trump's victory fueled a safe-haven bid with the dollar plunging. But as stocks and the dollar rebound, gold erased its big gains and Newmont traded 2% higher.IBD'S TAKE: Gold prices are rising sharply Wednesday. That will give a big boost to Newmont and other gold mining stocks, which are technical turning points.Biotech and drug stocks such as Pfizer (PFE) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) rallied on relief that Hillary Clinton will not be president and the Senate will remain in GOP hands. Clinton had vowed to crack on ""excessive"" price increases, notably on older treatments. She also likely would have pushed for the government to negotiate drug prices lower.Trump's victory means that regulatory relief for super-regional banks from Dodd-Frank regulations may go a step further than expected, paving the way for a round of acquisitions. It also may ease pressures on too-big-to-fail banks, which explains why Wells Fargo (WFC) popped 6% intraday, recovering from an overnight sell-off. Wells Fargo also may see less political pressure over its fradualent account scandal.""We expect a positive snapback move once investors digest the results and factor in a more favorable regulatory environment for the financial sector,"" wrote Brian Gardner, head of Washington research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Banks have been rising in part due to expectations for a Fed hike amid stronger wage growth and tighter labor markets. While the Fed may decide to pause before hiking if Trump's election does send financial shock waves around the globe, that's far from clear.""Expect an immediate market pullback, on fear, and then a pause,"" said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. ""Should Mr. Trump be able to reduce the uncertainty around what policies he intends to pursue, it is quite possible markets will recover as the economic fundamentals in the U.S. remain sound.""Trump is likely to kill President Obama's overtime rule that's due to take effect in December that guarantees time-and-a-half pay for salaried workers earning up to $47,476 — about twice the current level. Wal-Mart (WMT) already raised pay for assistant store managers to $48,500 from $45,000, effective September, to avoid being liable for overtime, but many employers have been slower to adopt the change as Congress aims to delay it. Some, like Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST), whose 717 Burger King locations make it the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) chain's largest franchisee, have said they'll effectively demote their managers and make them punch the clock.The ObamaCare employer mandate is likely history, meaning modest-wage employers would no longer be fined if they fail to offer health insurance to workers clocking at least 30 hours per week. Along with retailers, Trump may bring relief to restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD) that are being squeezed by competition and compensation hikes, contributing to a record gap between the cost of fast food and eating in.What are markets scared about? Trump's threats to impose tariffs on companies like Ford Motor (F) that send cars to the U.S. from Mexico, to walk away from Nafta and to crack down on unauthorized immigrants are why economists have said his agenda could hurt the economy.If Trump were to start his presidency by labeling China a currency manipulator and imposing tariffs, that could start a trade war, with China reciprocating by targeting the sales of Apple (AAPL), General Motors (GM) and Microsoft (MSFT). China, facing slower growth and an unsustainable build up in debt, could easily spark another bout of financial market turmoil as was seen this past January.How Trump proceeds on trade will be one of his most important early decisions. The good news is that Trump isn't campaigning anymore — and his was an especially insular campaign. Surrounded by pro-growth economic advisors and now in direct contact with top business leaders, Trump is likely to act deliberately, not rashly. That may mean opening up talks with both countries about how to move trade relations forward and setting out intermediate term goals to measure progress.This seems consistent with Trump's victory speech words: ""I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone — all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.""Trump seems unlikely to back down from his pledge to build a wall on the border with Mexico, but that, in and of itself, would have more of a symbolic than an economic effect. His rhetoric has shifted to cracking down on unauthorized immigrants who are violent criminals, and there may be fewer of those than he implies.RELATED:Drug Stocks Rally On Relief Clinton Didn't Win White HouseTrump Wins, But Fed Hike Still On: Treasury Yields, Bank Stocks SoarAT&T, Time Warner Fall After Trump Victory; Is Merger In Doubt?Overtime Rule Fallout: Fast Food Managers Told To Punch ClockFBI Reveals More Evidence That Stocks Will Fall If Trump Wins

That's the first year-over-year decline since 2011.Private construction spending fell 0.2% from August as a 1.0% drop in nonresidential spending offset a 0.5% rise in residential spending. In the past year, nonresidential spending has led the way, rising 4.1% vs. 0.9% for residential. Still, growth in private spending has been swamped by a 7.8% drop in public construction spending from a year ago.The ISM survey showed a pickup in production to 54.6 from 52.8, but there was less visibility into future production as the new orders index slipped 3 points to 52.1 and the gauge of order backlogs fell to 45.5 from 49.5. Readings above 50 signal expansion, while those south of 50 suggest contraction.On a positive note, the employment index rose to 52.9 from 49.7.While the overall ISM was only modestly above the 50 neutral level, a sixth rise in seven months is somewhat encouraging after weak overseas growth and a retrenchment in the oil patch led to a manufacturing contraction in the second half of 2015 and early this year.Even as health care and housing costs push up services inflation, plodding growth in the industrial side of the economy gives the Federal Reserve more leeway to leave interest rates low for longer, because factory slack limits pricing power. The Federal Reserve began a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday.Ford Motor (F) said last week that it would idle some plants or run fewer shifts to avoid a backup in inventories if U.S. auto sales slow in 2017, as it expects. This week, it was cutting one of three shifts at its F-150 pickup truck plant in Kansas City, Mo.Ford said late Monday that it won't release October U.S. sales later this week due to a Monday fire, knocking out power for data systems at its Dearborn, Mich., plant. Ford is expected to report that its sales in October fell 10.9% from a year ago, according to Edmunds' auto-information service.Still, overall U.S. sales are expected to match the highest level of the year, coming in at a 17.8 million-unit annual rate, though that would be another year-over-year decline.General Motors (GM) reported sales slipped 1.7% from a year earlier, but that was much better than the 6.3% drop expected by Edmunds.IBD'S TAKE: While the Federal Reserve is virtually certain to hike interest rates in December, the strengthening dollar may lead policymakers to spring another kind of surprise to avoid a repeat of what happened after the hike in December 2015.Several industrial companies have lowered their earnings guidance in recent weeks. Steel maker Nucor (NUE) said on Oct. 20 that profitability will ""decrease notably"" in the fourth quarter, not entirely due to regular seasonality. Nucor said its end markets are a mixed bag, with automotive remaining strong, but energy, heavy equipment and agricultural markets are still weak.The ISM survey showed that 10 of 18 manufacturing industries reported growth. Among survey respondents, positive comments came from the chemical sector, computer and electronics, fabricated metals, plastics and rubber — along with food, beverage and tobacco. Negative comments came from primary metals, where it was noted that production was down 20%, and transportation equipment.General Electric (GE) said on Oct. 21 that its comparable industrial orders fell 6% during the third quarter, though its digital and software orders rose 11%.United Technologies (UTX), Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM) all offered earnings outlooks below analyst estimates when they reported last week.One positive in the third-quarter GDP report released on Friday was a 10% rise in exports, the biggest since the fourth quarter of 2013. But that trend is unlikely to continue after the surge in the dollar vs. other currencies in October.RELATED:GM, Fiat Chrysler U.S. Sales Fall Less Then Feared; Ford DelayedNucor, Steel Dynamics Profit From Fewer ImportsGM, Caterpillar Fall Below Buy Points As Industrial Giants Guide Low

31,NUE,"When it comes to the direction of interest rates, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's words may be more important than Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's.While Yellen's testimony to Congress on Thursday morning will be closely scrutinized, the big news on Wednesday was that GOP leaders in the Senate have ruled out the idea of killing the filibuster, which generally means that 60 votes will be required to move legislation.Republicans do have another trick — actually two tricks — up their sleeves to move legislation to cut taxes and replace ObamaCare. They can use the same reconciliation technique used by President Obama to pass ObamaCare in 2010, and the GOP has signaled that it intends to do so twice. Yet that legislative vehicle will require changes in taxes and spending to be budget neutral, at worst.The upshot is that there's a limit to the amount of fiscal stimulus that President-elect Trump will be able to deliver, and the need for budget neutrality may draw out the legislative process, since that means there will be winners and losers. On top of that, the spike in Treasury yields since Trump's surprise win could have a dampening effect on the housing market and auto sales, which may have already peaked.IBD'S TAKE: Janet Yellen signaled Thursday that Fed rate hikes are coming soon, but not fast and furious.Even so, shares of General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), a Trump campaign punching bag for its plans to shift small-vehicle production to Mexico, have moved slightly higher since the election. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) and other bank stocks, especially regional banks, have flown on both the prospect of widening yield spreads lifting net interest margins, as well as on expectations of a lighter regulatory touch in a Trump administration.Still, the lack of near-term catalysts suggests the sell-off in Treasuries, with the 10-year yield rising nearly a full percentage point from the historic low seen in July, may have run its course for now. That's not to say there will necessarily be a substantial pull-back. Average hourly wage growth has accelerated and is now up an annualized 3.1% over the past six months, as companies like Starbucks (SBUX) and Panera Bread (PNRA) have been hiking pay as they compete for the best talent. The labor market is getting tight and wage pressures are beginning to feed through to higher inflation.On the other hand, the rise in the dollar also is a negative for U.S. growth. Meanwhile, there is enough uncertainty overseas, including a big constitutional referendum in Italy next month, that Treasuries may continue to see safe-haven buying.While an infrastructure package could deliver a boost, the plan to emphasize public-private partnerships may slow the funding of shovel-ready projects. Nucor (NUE), Steel Dynamics (STLD) and U.S. Steel (X) have been among the biggest stock-market winners since Trump's election. Steel makers would benefit from a big boost in infrastructure spending, as well as from Trump protectionist moves.RELATED:3 Reasons Why Wage Growth Is About To Take OffSteel Stocks Soar As Trump Seen Fueling 20% Annual Demand GrowthBofA, JPMorgan, Other Bank Stock Charts Look Great Despite Pullback

32,NUE,"Fewer steel imports from China helped increase steel prices in the third quarter, lifting sales at leading steel makers Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD).Still, uneven demand in their U.S. markets as the economy plods ahead led to a mixed reaction on Wall Street, where shares opened lower in a volatile trading session.The steel group was among the market's leading industry groups in late spring and early summer, but is now building a base after a run-up fueled by an Obama administration crackdown on Chinese imports. In May, the Commerce Department boosted tariffs on Chinese cold-rolled steel to 522%.Nucor shares were off 0.4% to 47.84 on the stock market today and are near the bottom of a deep consolidation zone. Steel Dynamics shares held onto gains after an initial sell-off, rising 3.6% to 26.16, within 7% of the stock's 8-year-high set on July 18.Meanwhile, other smaller industry players Reliance Steel & Aluminum (RS) and Valmont Industries (VMI) saw their stocks sink after the steel fabricators missed earnings estimates amid weakness in some of their key markets.U.S. Steel (X), which is due to report earnings on Nov. 2, and AK Steel (AKS), which reports on Oct. 25, both saw their shares rise by more than 6%, but still remain in the lower part of their consolidation zones.IBD'S TAKE: Highly cyclical, old-line industries like steel don't generally offer the strong, steady profit growth of the biggest stock market winners. Yet, the hot and cold performance of Steel Dynamics and Nucor shares over the past year validates the investment-timing strategies IBD teaches its readers, waiting until stocks reach a buy point after a sound basing pattern, taking profits and protecting from downside risk. For a primer, visit IBD University.Profit came in at 84 cents a share, up from 71 cents a year ago but below estimates of 95 cents due to lower profit margins at its steel mills.Sales rose 2% from a year ago to $4.29 billion, though below analyst estimates of $4.51 billion. Although average selling prices rose 11% from the second quarter and 2% from a year ago, shipments to outside customers were down 9% from the second quarter and flat from a year ago at 5.889 million tons.""The flat-rolled trade cases are having a positive impact as steel imports are down approximately 20% this year compared to last year,"" Nucor said. Still, it noted that ""market conditions for our plate and bar mills continue to be challenging due to high levels of imports.""Nucor's end markets are a mixed bag, with automotive remaining strong, but energy, heavy equipment and agricultural markets still weak. A quick lift isn't expected: The company said that profitability will ""decrease notably"" in the fourth quarter, partly due to regular seasonality.Profit more than doubled to 65 cents a share from 25 cents a year ago, meeting estimates. Revenue rose 7.7% to $2.1 billion, inching past expectations.Results were helped by a 20% year-over-year decline in imports of flat roll steel and low customer inventory levels, the company said. But it noted that, ""late in the third quarter, customers were hesitant to make purchases ahead of an anticipated scrap price decrease and as a result September steel shipments were lower than anticipated.""Management was relatively upbeat about the outlook, saying that even though the U.S. automotive market may come off its peak in 2017, overall automotive steel consumption will be steady thanks to Mexico growing production. The company also anticipates more growth in the construction section, especially for larger, public sector infrastructure projects, and a possible pickup in the energy sector.Reliance Steel missed estimates for third-quarter earnings by a little but offered fourth-quarter guidance that was way below the consensus.Third-quarter profit of $1.25 rose 7.8% from a year ago but missed estimates by 6 cents. Reliance offered fourth-quarter guidance of 65-75 cents a share vs. the consensus of $1.02.Sales fell 4.4% from a year ago to $2.19 billion. Average selling prices, though up 4.4% from the second quarter, were still below year-ago levels.Citing ""increased uncertainty"" in the market, along with normal seasonality, the company said shipments would fall 5% to 7% from the third quarter, while pricing would fall 1% to 3%.Valmont earning $1.48 per share, up from $1.39 a year ago but below estimates of $1.50. Sales fell 3.5% from a year ago to $610.2 million, below estimates of $628 million.The company said the weakness was focused in international utility markets and weaker coatings demand in North America.RELATED:Steel Makers Strengthen On China Duties; Auto, Construction Demand

33,NUE,"Mining stocks have been getting battered, so how is the iShares MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers (PICK) ETF holding up so well?The exchange traded fund is trying to break out from a base with a 11.68 buy point. Shares have stalled around that price. But, remarkably, they've hardly moved while the sector has faltered amid a plunge in gold and silver prices the past couple of weeks.How? The ETF has been spared damage because it specifically excludes gold and silver miners. Those are precisely the stocks in the sector that have suffered the most. IBD's gold and silver mining industry group is down about 25% from its Aug. 12 high and the weakest of six mining and metals groups since then. The gold and silver group ranked No. 51 out of 197 groups Thursday, down swiftly from No. 17 three weeks ago. Six weeks ago, it was the No. 2 group.In contrast, the specialty alloys group is near this year's highs and performing much better. The metal processing and fabrication group also is near highs, as is metal ores.Three of the largest U.S.-traded holdings in iShares Global Metals & Mining are in the ores group: BHP Billiton (BHP), Rio Tinto (RIO) and Alcoa (AA). BHP Billiton is at 52-week highs after finding support at its 50-day moving average. Tio Tinto is trying to break out past 33.87 entry. Alcoa is trending higher and forming a base with a potential buy point at 33.01.Among other major holdings, Anglo-American's and Glencore's London-traded shares (about 3% and 6% of the ETF, respectively) are near 52-week highs too.The portfolio does have its dogs, including Nucor (NUE). The Charlotte, N.C.-based steel-maker is been slumping since it peaked in mid-July.While avoiding the volatile gold and silver stocks, the ETF invests mainly in diversified mining and metals companies. It specifically seeks companies involved in the extraction or production of diversified metals, in aluminum or steel production, and in the mining of metals and minerals.The fund has weathered the gold sell-off better than the rival SPDR S&P Metals & Mining (XME) ETF, which is down about 12% from a peak in August. About 20% of the SPDR fund is invested in gold and silver companies, but it has also been hurt by steel stocks, which make up half the portfolio. IBD's steel producers group has collapsed to No. 130 from No. 14 six weeks ago. Despite that, SPDR Metals & Mining still has the better year-to-date performance, up about 70% in 2016. IShares Global Mining & Metals is up nearly 40%.

35,NUE,"It took eight months for U.S. steel prices to plunge 16% last year -- dropping to $382 a ton in December for hot-rolled band steel, down from $457 in April 2015.The other shoe dropped the following month, when IBD's Steel-Producers and Steel-Specialty Alloys groups fell to their lowest levels since March 2009.But that was then, and this is now. The resilient material made by forging iron ore with various alloys began rebounding early this year and is currently priced at about $616 a ton, a 61% increase from the December low, according to SteelBenchmarker.China is now a tailwind for the U.S. steel industry, or at least it is no longer such a heavy headwind. Meanwhile, aerospace industry demand for steel, especially specialty products, is rising, and auto production remains at high levels. Construction is strong in both residential and commercial real estate.""Global steel prices will remain subdued due to a persistent steel oversupply over the coming quarters,"" the market tracker said in a July 1 report. ""From 2017 onward, steel prices will gradually edge higher as the global surplus will narrow due to Chinese supply cutbacks.""Still, there are a number of companies worth watching. Steel Dynamics (STLD), the top-rated U.S.-based steel maker in the 17-company IBD Steel Producers group, and specialty steel makers such as Allegheny Technologies (ATI) and Carpenter Technology (CRS) are forging a rally this year.Mainstream companies like Steel Dynamics sell standard steel in a variety of forms. Specialty firms combine iron with alloys to make specific varieties such as stainless steel, titanium steel and other variants.Steel makers have cut costs. Employment in the broader metals industry has fallen from a near-term peak of 402,600 in January 2015 to 375,500 in July 2016, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show.As steel prices continue to rise, companies will likely begin rehiring, but that may not happen until next year, according to a BMI Research report.China buys the lion's share of the world's metals to make the appliances and electronics it ships globally, as well as for its own infrastructure build-out. As its economy has decelerated and begun to shift from manufacturing to consumers and services, China is buying fewer commodities, driving prices down.Dan Greenfield, vice president of investor relations and corporate communications at Allegheny Technologies, said China last year began looking to sell its metals on the global market at a steep discount to cut its excess inventory.""The Chinese subsidized their steel industry"" to keep prices low, said Greenfield. ""Stainless steel business, for example, has been really bad because of an unprecedented amount of imports from China in 2015 that took the base price way down.""China's government has called for cutting capacity at state-owned steel giants, but with little apparent success.""China's economic planning agency said the country should quicken the pace of capacity reductions in steel,"" the Aug. 16 Reuters Oil Report said, adding, ""China's steel capacity cuts in the first seven months of the year are behind schedule,"" amounting to just 47% of the target for 2016.China's companies have sold their excess output on the world market at low prices. The U.S. government -- and domestic steel industry -- says China is illegally dumping. In March, the Commerce Department issued preliminary duties of 265.79% on imports of cold-rolled steel from China. A final ruling is expected by end of this year.""Since the start of the year, China data have been stronger than expected. They have had some stimulus that helped propel the demand side, and that's helped push metals prices along,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Terry told IBD.Stocks of Steel Dynamics and others in IBD's Steel Producers group collectively saw a powerful 119% gain from a Jan. 20 low to a July 18 high when they began consolidating. The group is ranked a lofty 9 on IBD's list of 197 industries, up from a dismal 139 rank six months ago. Steel Dynamics, which was recently featured in the IBD Stock Spotlight, has $7.3 billion annual sales. It makes flat-rolled, structural, bar and rail steel for automotive, construction and other markets. It's extended after clearing a 22.67 cup-with-handle base buy point.Last quarter, its sales grew after shrinking four quarters in a row. The turnaround in earnings has been even more profound: After reporting year-over-year declines in earnings per share of 29%, 34% and 75% in the respective last three quarters of 2015, Steel Dynamics reported a 53% surge in first-quarter earnings, followed by a 164% bump up in the second quarter. Consensus is for a 184% pop this quarter.Chief Executive Mark Millett told analysts on Steel Dynamics' second-quarter earnings call on July 19 that the macroeconomic environment has improved.""Reduced imports, idling of domestic capacity and relatively higher global pricing, along with steady demand and rebalanced supply chain inventory, have created a positive pricing and volume environment for flat-roll (steel) products,"" Millett said.S&P Capital IQ analyst Matthew Miller has a ""strong buy"" rating on Steel Dynamics with a 31 target, citing favorable end-market demand from construction, as well as from the automotive industry, which produced a record 17.47 million vehicles last year. Shares ended trading Monday up 1.1% to 24.89 in the stock market today.Allegheny Technologies and Carpenter are the highest-rated U.S. companies in the eight-company Steel-Specialty Alloys group, ranked 37th on IBD's industries list. Stocks in that group have collectively risen 72% since Jan. 20.S&P Capital's Miller prefers steel makers that are specializing.""We have favored those companies that have had a strategy to get away from commodity prices, turning to high-value products tied to the aerospace and auto markets,"" Miller told IBD. ""We expect 2016 to begin a long period of secular growth"" for specialty metals. With annual revenue of $3.14 billion, Allegheny Technologies makes specialty alloys used in aerospace, which account for 50% of its revenue, as well as autos and other industries.Allegheny's recovery is in sight. Although it's expected to report a seventh straight period of lower earnings this quarter, Wall Street projects a 4 cent profit in the fourth quarter, reversing from a 56 cent loss the same quarter last year.""Aerospace looks like a pretty solid market for Allegheny, based on the (jetliner) build rate scheduled to the end of this decade,"" said Allegheny's Greenfield.Miller has a buy rating on Allegheny with a 20 price target.Allegheny is forming a cup-with-handle base with an 18.77 buy point and got close to it Monday. Shares broke out more than 11% to reach 18.50, up more than 160% from the 7.08 low reached on Jan. 20.Carpenter Technology makes specialty metals including titanium alloys, stainless steels and alloy steels for the aerospace, transportation, medical and energy markets among others. The smallest of the trio with $1.81 billion annual revenue, Carpenter is seeking support just below a 38.26 conventional entry point.The Reading, Pa.-based company has only posted one quarter of profit growth in the last three years, and that was a year ago. That's about to change. Consensus is for earnings to grow 8% a share this quarter, accelerating to 25% and then a 62% jump. Shares were up nearly 4% to 37.88 on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Steel makers weathered a very rough period in 2015 and early this year. They are emerging amid improved global and U.S. macroeconomic factors, putting companies like Steel Dynamics in the Stock Spotlight.Other notable industry players include Europe's Arcelor Mittal (MT) -- the world's biggest steel company, with $57.7 billion in yearly revenue -- and No. 1 U.S. steel maker Nucor (NUE) with $15.6 billion annual sales. Arcelor Mittal shares are consolidating at 10-month highs. Nucor has retreated significantly from its mid-July peak, falling below its 50-day moving average.Top-rated Steel-Producers stock is Luxembourg-based Ternium (TX), with $7.1 billion a year revenue. Ternium has a 91 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 91% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth. Ternium shares are pulling back toward their 50-day line after hitting a near-two-year high on Aug. 9.RELATED:Stocks Stay On Bullish Track; Specialty Steel StrongIndexes Mark Fresh Closing Highs; Steel Stocks Among LeadersCarpenter Technology And Peers Are On Rebound Trail.

39,NUE,"Industrial production fell in May, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday, as the central bank wraps up a two-day meeting on monetary policy.Output fell 0.4% in May vs. analyst views for a 0.1% drop. Manufacturing activity also slid 0.4%, defying forecasts for a 0.1% gain. Production of autos and related parts tumbled 4.2%, the sharpest drop since January 2014. Auto output has been a big boost for U.S. manufacturing amid energy and global head-winds.General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) reported May U.S. sales fell vs. a year earlier amid growing concerns that domestic demand was plateauing after soaring in recent years.On the upside, mining output, which includes oil drilling, edged up 0.2%, the first increase since August. But oil drilling and servicing still fell 7.9%. Still, other data suggest that the U.S. energy sector may be stabilizing after crashing with oil prices. If the energy sector starts to pick up, that could filter down to related manufacturing industries.Earlier, the New York Fed's Empire State manufacturing index unexpectedly turned positive in June.

Year over year, prices rose 5.4%, also beating views.Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) gave up less than 1% after last week's nearly 12% surge in huge volume. The fast-growing retailer has made a strong gain since its November 2014 breakout from a long base at 121.53. Last week it posted a 39% jump in Q1 earnings per share as revenue rose 24% to a Q1 record $1.07 billion.Sina, a key source of web content for a gigantic base of Chinese-language internet users, rose 4% to 53.40, so the stock is within buy range from the 51.90 handle buy point. The 11% slide in the week ended May 13 proves how volatile this mid-cap play can be. Revenue growth slowed in Q1 to 8% vs. gains of 14%, 14% and 21% in the prior three quarter, and Sina posted a net loss of 4 cents a share in Q1. However, the Street sees Q2 profit rebounding 150% to 15 cents a share.Workday (WDAY), an expert in HR management software, rose nearly 0.8% to 76.57. It's slated to report fiscal Q1 results today after the close. The Street is expecting a loss of 2 cents per share despite revenue growing 35% to $338.7 million. Workday has created a long double-bottom base with an 85.77 buy point but has also encountered stiff resistance near the 80 price level.Steel stocks gained ground after the U.S. Commerce Department late last week jacked anti-dumping tariffs on corrosion-resistant steel products imported from China, India, South Korea, Italy and Taiwan, with China seeing extra duty of up to 450%.U.S. Steel (X) gained more than 3% to 14.84 but is still deep within a bottoming base. In a bottoming base, a stock has made an extremely deep decline, usually 50% to 80% or more off its high, but is starting to show signs of bottoming out while forming a base that presents an opportunity for stock to break out to 52-week highs. Numerous bottoming bases formed within the tech sector in the aftermath of the 2000-2002 dot-com crash.Nucor (NUE) gained 1% to 48.99. It's just 4% off a 52-week high and has formed a long cup with handle with a 51.20 buy point.As seen in the latest Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend, which means an investor may buy breakouts of high-quality growth stocks at proper buy points with a reasonable amount of risk.Do you know if your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

77,NUE,"They heard the blast in the Serengeti,
"
78,NUE,"Willie's portfolio is now confetti.In bad times, risks sometimes come into play. Earnings shrink, making payouts questionable. If earnings shrink enough, then dividend increases end. If earnings worsen further, the dividend is cut. And if things really head south, the dividend is eliminated.Of course, an investor can always sell before trouble emerges. However, that's easier said than done. By the time a sell rule applies, much of the paper gains will have vanished. Timing a bad investment is more difficult than timing a good investment.A good investment doesn't require perfect execution in order to make money. A longer climb gives the investor more opportunities to leave with a gain.Stocks with only a high yield going for them aren't necessarily guaranteed to rise, which means that investors will have to play them that much better. So dividend investors will sleep more soundly if they don't focus too much on yield.What, then, should they focus on?A stock's liquidity, dividend growth rate and dividend stability are worth considering. Such an approach isn't absolutely safe (what is?), but it decreases the odds of getting burned badly.The screen above, run on Sept. 1, shows liquid stocks with good dividend growth rates and dividend stability ratings. IBD's daily Income Investor column has recently covered some of them.Another way to keep a conservative bent on a portfolio is to buy stocks in the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrat list. These are stocks that have increased their dividend payouts for 25 consecutive years.The Aristocrats list is well-balanced. Its 52 constituents represent ten sectors. (Sometimes chasers of high yields end up invested in only a few sectors, which increases risk. Normal sector rotation can create havoc for such investors.)As of Aug. 31, sector exposure in the Dividend Aristocrats broke down like this: consumer staples, 25% (results are rounded); industrials, 15%; health care, 13%; financials, 13%; materials, 12%; consumer discretionary, 12%; energy, 4%; utilities, 2%; telecom, 2%; and information technology, 2%.The Aristocrats list includes stocks such as food distributor Sysco (SYY), utility Consolidated Edison (ED), home improvement store Lowe's (LOW), steel producer Nucor (NUE) and cleaning products firm Clorox (CLX).

84,NUE,"Last week, it seemed plausible that Wall Street's extremely negative reaction to President Trump's planned tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports might get him to reconsider.X But the stock market rebound has reportedly given Trump an extra shot of confidence in the wisdom of his plan, even if the stock rally may owe itself at least partly to hopes that he'll water down his plan or that the GOP-controlled Congress might ride to the rescue and block the White House from starting a trade war.""A person close to the White House said that the president was itching to impose tariffs, and that Monday's stock market rebound had reassured Mr. Trump that he was in the right,"" the New York Times reported.In early trading on the stock market today, it looked like Wall Street might further solidify Trump's intentions. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index added onto Monday's gains, while the Nasdaq composite surged higher.The early-session tone may have been helped by a report that Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn has invited corporations opposed to the tariffs to the White House on Thursday to make the strongest possible case against them.IBD'S TAKE: The sell-off triggered by President Trump's tariff plan has changed the outlook for the stock market, The Big Picture column explained on Thursday.

85,NUE,"As the broad stock market feels the pressure of President Trump's plan to impose 25% tariffs on all steel imports, even some steel stocks wobbled Friday on the stock market today.X Shares of U.S. Steel (X) fell 1.35% to 45.39 — off session lows of 43.22 — after BofA/Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock to neutral from buy, while bumping up its price target to 50 from 47.The downgrade reflects both the recent appreciation of the stock, which surged 5.8% on Thursday to a multi-year high and has a 97 Relative Strength rating from IBD, meaning it has outperformed 97% of all stocks over the past 12 months.Yet BofA/Merrill analyst Timna Tanners also sees reasons why the tariffs might not pack the punch that Trump expects, as well as some other reasons that the earnings lift will be restrained.IBD'S TAKE: The sell-off triggered by President Trump's tariff plan has changed the outlook for the stock market, The Big Picture column explained on Thursday. Now that stock market volatility has returned, it's more important than ever to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Tannners seems to question the sustainability of the tariffs, saying she expects steel prices to come down in 2019 due, in part, to World Trade Organization challenges. Further, she expects demand for domestically produced steel to be curbed as more steel content is imported via finished goods, rather than as unfinished steel, to get around the Trump tax.In the near-term, the benefit will be limited because prices are locked in by contracts. Tanners also expects increased domestic capacity by 2019 — which Trump would certainly celebrate — to hold down prices. All that, in her view, makes U.S. Steel shares ""vulnerable"" after their strong run.Other steel stocks reversed higher for modest gains as the S&P 500 index turned higher: AK Steel (AKS) rose 0.7% while Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) gained 0.5%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Trump Tariff Sell-Off Triggers New OutlookTrump Says 'Trade Wars Are Good,' Doubling Down On Tariff MoveFed Inflation Gauge Stays Tame, But Here's 6 Reasons Why Investors Are NervousWhat Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?Amazon Vs.

87,NUE,"President Trump will indefinitely delay imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but other countries could face tariffs within 15 days.X Trump explained his policy Thursday afternoon before a signing ceremony, saying that other countries will be invited to negotiate exemptions from import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum.Trump said he was acting to stop ""an assault on our country"" in the form of cheap, imported industrial metal, calling it ""not merely an economic disaster, but a national security disaster.""He claimed that his policy is already paying dividends, with U.S. Steel (X) and Century Aluminum (CENX) both announcing increased capacity and hiring.Trump said that in the next 15 days his administration will decide which countries will face tariffs and to what extent, based on ""who's treating us fairly,"" not just in regard to trade but also military relationships.Wall Street seemed relieved about the clarification with regard to Mexico and Canada. America's Nafta partners account for 25% of U.S. steel imports but are also major export markets for U.S.-made steel.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all strengthened to close modestly higher on the stock market today.

88,NUE,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowWhile tariffs could raise U.S. manufacturing costs for companies like Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Boeing (BA), the bigger concern is that they would spark a tit-for-tat retaliation. Boeing and GM shares turned higher on Thursday afternoon, while Ford was off 0.2%.Still, the sense of relief on Wall Street is far from complete. The European Union has threatened to retaliate if Trump moves forward with the tariffs, targeting companies like Harley-Davidson (HOG).Steel and aluminum tariffs aren't the only trade concern likely to occupy Wall Street in the months to come. The White House is also reportedly mulling wide-ranging tariffs on Chinese imports to punish Beijing for permitting rampant theft of U.S. intellectual property.The Trump administration is asking China to propose actions that would shrink the bilateral trade deficit by $100 billion.Trump has tried to provide reassurance that the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs would be largely benign, saying it would be done in a ""loving"" way and inviting key trading partners to negotiate an alternative to his proposed trade prescription.On Thursday he went further, talking about the flexible approach he would take in setting or adjusting the 25% and 10% rates on a country-by-country basis. ""I'll have a right to go up or go down depending on the country, and I'll have a right to drop out countries or add countries.""Yet there's more than a little danger that Trump is miscalculating. The environment for negotiating may turn poisonous if he enacts tariffs that trading partners see as unjustified and a danger to a global trading system which has depended on respect for World Trade Organization rules.Trump's steel tariffs are seen as an affront by most U.S. trading partners because the bulk of steel industry overcapacity comes from China, yet China itself would barely be touched, at least directly, by the 25% tax since it accounts for just 2% of U.S. steel imports.Trump seems to be using the threat of steel tariffs as leverage to undo other perceived inequities with trading partners that contribute to the high U.S. trade deficit. Yet the whole effort undermines the justification for his tariffs — that the U.S. will impose them because a glut of steel and aluminum imports poses a danger to national security.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Agrees To Meet Kim Jong Un; Stock Futures RiseThese Three Dow Jones Stocks Are Near Buy Points As 2 FANGs Make Bullish MoveThe Big Picture: This Is The Real News For InvestorsHere Are 10 Chip Stocks Breaking Out, Hitting New Highs Or Setting UpWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce And Epam Have In Common?

89,NUE,"Shares of Harley-Davidson (HOG) skidded close to a two-year low on Tuesday after it warned of a potentially significant hit to sales if it gets caught in the middle of a trade war.X European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker named Harley-Davidson motorcycles as a likely target for retaliation by the European Union if President Trump follows through on his plan to impose tariffs of 25% on U.S. steel imports and 10% on aluminum.On the stock market today, Harley shares closed down 2% but had come off session lows.Harley is hardly the only company in the line of fire. Like Harley, Boeing (BA) stands to face both higher metals costs due to Trump tariffs and, of greater concern, potential harm on the sales front if governments take out their frustrations with Trump on Boeing.Boeing shares slipped 1.1% on Tuesday, while European rival Airbus (EADSY) rose 0.9%.Meanwhile, steel stocks bounced back after a bout of selling early Tuesday to turn in mixed results. U.S. Steel (X) was off 0.5% and Steel Dynamics (STLD) 0.7%, Nucor (NUE) 0.1% while AK Steel (AKS) rose 0.7%.Financial markets appear to be in a holding pattern as investors try to figure out what Trump will do.Harley-Davidson is seen as an especially juicy target for reprisals because it has a factory in House Speaker Paul Ryan's Wisconsin district, though the EU had the motorcycle maker in its sights back in 2003, before President George W. Bush lifted steel tariffs after 18 months to avert trade repercussions. Ryan hardly had an international profile back then.IBD'S TAKE: The sell-off triggered by President Trump's tariff plan has changed the outlook for the stock market, The Big Picture column explained on Thursday. Now that stock market volatility has returned, it's more important than ever to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. There's some logic in ramping up the pressure on Ryan. The pro-trade Republican already has come out against the Trump tariffs, and GOP members of Congress are quietly discussing what they might do to block Trump if he proceeds. Realistically, mustering a veto-proof majority to stop Trump might be impossible. But U.S. trade partners may want to drive a wedge between Trump and Congress so that he has less political capital to strike back once they retaliate.Europe accounts for about 16% of Harley sales, but the EU may not be the only country looking at the Milwaukee-based company as a potent target. Canadian trade experts also are discussing a likelihood that Ottawa would target Harley-Davidson if Trump won't exempt its Nafta partner from steel tariffs.Canada is the biggest exporter of steel to the U.S., yet it's also easily the biggest importer of steel from the U.S. Trump has tweeted that  Mexico and Canada can escape his tariffs only if they sign on to a ""new & fair Nafta agreement,"" but talks on revamping the deal haven't progressed very far.Canada makes up about 5% of Harley-Davidson's sales, while Mexico accounts for a smaller fraction. Mexico also is reportedly looking for politically sensitive ways to undercut support for Trump's tariffs, and it would be no surprise if it looks to Milwaukee.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Top Financial Stocks Just Carved This 'Super-Growth' PatternWhy Air Force Is Rushing To Fly A Sixth-Generation Fighter JetTrump Tariffs: These Stocks Could Be Hurt The MostFed Inflation Gauge Stays Tame, But Here's 6 Reasons Why Investors Are NervousAmazon Vs.

Yet Canada is also, far and away, the largest export market for U.S. steelmakers. Through the first three quarters of 2017, the U.S. ran a relatively minor trade deficit with Canada of about a half-million metric tons, according to Department of Commerce data.Mexico, although it's the No. 4 source of U.S. imports of steel, actually imported more steel from the U.S. than it sent here through the first three quarters of 2017.On the other hand, China, which the Commerce Department characterizes as by far the worst offender, accounting for about half of global steel overcapacity, only provides about 2% of U.S. imports, so it won't feel much direct impact from a 25% tariff.In other words, it's hard to imagine a clumsier, more ham-handed way of seeking to redress unfair trade practices than a 25% tariff on global steel imports. The collateral damage may include workers from Ford (F) and General Motors (GM), along with American car buyers and — if the Dow Jones industrial average's 420-point dive on Thursday is any indication — U.S. stock investors.By the time foreign trade partners hit back with reprisals, the tariffs may boomerang on Harley-Davidson (HOG), Jack Daniels and soybean farmers, and the list may get a lot longer.All of that could mean lost jobs in other industries and higher costs for consumers on a wide range of goods.""You'll have protection for a long time,"" President Trump on Thursday told executives of U.S. Steel (X) and Nucor (NUE), among others, saying he'll make 25% steel tariffs and 10% aluminum tariffs official next week.Shares of U.S. Steel rose nearly 6%, Steel Dynamics (STLD) 4%, Nucor 3% and AK Steel (AKS) 10% in Thursday trading on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: The sell-off triggered by President Trump's tariff plan has changed the outlook for the stock market, The Big Picture column explained on Thursday. Now that stock market volatility has returned, it's more important than ever to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Despite reported divisions in the White House over the wisdom of major tariffs, Trump appeared determined to stick to his guns. The import tariffs — easily his most far-reaching protectionist trade measures — were recommended by the Commerce Department, which cited national security concerns to justify support of U.S. steel and aluminum producers with high tariffs on imports.National security concerns haven't been used to justify the imposition of tariffs for decades. There's little reason to think that the action would comply with World Trade Organization rules, though that doesn't appear to worry Trump. President George W. Bush backed down about 18 months after imposing steel tariffs in 2002, just as European nations were getting ready to launch trade reprisals. This time, foreign trade partners are unlikely to hesitate for long because they've been preparing for Trump to follow through on his America First rhetoric.Commerce recommended global tariffs of 24% on steel imports and 7.7% on aluminum, along with a range of other options aimed at bringing capacity utilization in the two domestic industries up to 80%.Trump apparently bumped up the recommendation to a 25% steel tariff because he liked the round number. At least for now, Trump appears to be insisting on no exceptions to the tariffs, which threatens to create a crisis situation with Canada and Mexico, and likely other nations as well.Other top steel exporters to the U.S. include Brazil, South Korea, Russia, Turkey, Japan, Germany and Taiwan.The Commerce Department had provided Trump with an alternative approach that would have shielded both Canada and Mexico. That option would have levied a 53% tariff on a select group of countries, including Brazil, South Korea, Russia, Turkey, India, Vietnam, China, Thailand, South Africa, Egypt, Malaysia and Costa Rica. Those countries, the Commerce Department notes, account for just 4% of steel exports from the U.S.Defense Secretary James Mattis in February raised concern about the ""negative impact on our key allies,"" advising that ""target tariffs are more preferable than a global quota or global tariff.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Trump Tariff Sell-Off Triggers New OutlookInvestors Suddenly Realize Trump's New Agenda Isn't Market FriendlyFed Inflation Gauge Stays Tame, But Here's 6 Reasons Why Investors Are NervousWhat Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?Amazon Vs.

92,NUE,"President Trump said on Thursday that he'll sign a measure next week imposing tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports. That gave steel and aluminum stocks a boost, but the S&P 500 index and other major averages retreated.X Despite reported divisions in the White House over the wisdom of major tariffs, which could spark retaliation by trading partners, Trump appeared determined to stick to his guns.

93,NUE,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 were solidly higher Monday morning.Look for Trump stocks U.S. Steel (X), Nucor (NUE), Steel Dynamics (STLD), AK Steel (AKS) and aluminum maker Alcoa (AA) to rally Monday on reports that President Trump backs high steel and aluminum tariffs on imports. Meanwhile, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) kicks off a big week for top-rated software earnings and cybersecurity news.The major averages rallied strongly on Friday, finishing the week positive after several weak closes. The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones retook their 50-day moving averages while the Nasdaq composite snapped a four-session losing streak.Treasury yields and Fed rate hike expectations remain a key factor. The 10-year yield hit a fresh four-year high of 2.95% Wednesday intraday after Fed minutes from the Jan. 30-31 showed that policymakers expected faster economic growth than before. But yields pulled back below 2.9% by the end of the week as Fed officials and a Fed report allayed concerns of more than three rate hikes in 2018. The 10-year yield dipped again Monday morning, while the U.S. dollar weakened.New Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testifies before Congress on Tuesday and Thursday.S&P 500 futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value. Dow Jones futures climbed 0.8%. Nasdaq 100 futures were nearly 0.5% above fair value.President Trump favors imposing a 24% duty on all steel imports, according to multiple reports that began coming out late Friday. That would adopt the harshest option suggested to him by the Commerce Department last month. He also favors up to 10% tariff on all foreign aluminum shipments to America, even more than the top Commerce recommendation.But steel and aluminum stocks rallied late Friday. U.S. Steel rose 4.3%, Nucor 2.3%, Steel Dynamics 1.4% and AK Steel 4.8%, while Alcoa edged up 0.9%. U.S. Steel was up 4.1% and AK Steel 3.8% early Monday. The other stocks were not yet active.U.S. Steel, Nucor and Steel Dynamics are all close to highs while Alcoa is modestly off its peak. AK Steel is still in a long downtrend.Keep in mind that the White House said Friday that Trump has made no decision yet. If he doesn't impose new tariffs, or sets them lower than reports suggest, these Trump stocks could face a Trump slump.Steelmakers were among the early Trump stocks after Donald Trump won the presidency. They were seen as triple winners from his policies: tax cuts, infrastructure spending and support for protectionist measures. But after a late 2016 spike, steel plays such as U.S. Steel, Nucor and leading ETF VanEck Vectors Steel (SLX) began to move sideways or slump as the Trump administration didn't move aggressively on trade or infrastructure.

94,NUE,"Shares in U.S. aluminum and steel companies from Alcoa (AA) to Nucor (NUE) surged, at least briefly, after the U.S. Commerce Department recommended that President Donald Trump impose a range of restrictions on imports from tariffs to quotas.X In a briefing with reporters on Friday over the results of his department's investigation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross proposed a 24% global tariff on steel shipments coming into the U.S. and a 7.7% duty on aluminum imports. Trump has the latitude to choose between these types of options or even enter talks with producers to find solutions.The recommendations pushed up Century Aluminum (CENX) nearly 10% on the stock market today, while Alcoa rose just 0.7% after initially soaring. Aluminum on the London Metal Exchange rose as much as 2.4% in London. Among steelmakers, Nucor (NUE) the largest American producer, climbed almost 3.9% after previously rising 6%, the biggest intraday increase since November 2016. U.S. Steel (X) advanced 10%, the most since November.Trump instructed the Commerce Department last year to probe whether imports of steel and aluminum represent a threat to U.S. national security. The investigation took place under the seldom-used Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross last month submitted his department's final reports to Trump on steel and aluminum. The president now has until about mid-April to decide on any potential action.Imposing tariffs on such widely used commodities may trigger retaliatory measures from China, the world's biggest producer of steel and aluminum. It could also inflate manufacturing and consumer prices in the U.S., and inflame tensions with allies such as Japan, India, Germany and Canada. Group of 20 economies have pushed back against the threat of steel tariffs, warning such a move could set off a trade war.Ross also outlined the following alternatives for the president to consider:Trump is facing resistance to tariffs from lawmakers in his own party. At a meeting this week at the White House, at least seven Republican lawmakers argued against any action that might set off a tit-for-tat response from China or other countries.Trump said the U.S. steel and aluminum industries ""are being decimated by dumping and from many countries."" The administration is now considering ""all options, and part of the options would be tariffs,"" he told lawmakers at the meeting. Such measures would encourage steel and aluminum producers to come back to the U.S., he said. Some companies in the steel industry, as well as unions such as United Steelworkers, have been pushing the president to come down hard on imports.Speculation about possible U.S. action has roiled the metals industry. Imports of steel increasing last year on anticipation that new tariffs would elevate costs.

95,NUE,"Stocks are trying to rebound after investors backed away from the market on breaking news that a federal grand jury indicted 13 Russian nationals on charges of interfering with the 2016 U.S. elections. The Nasdaq suffered the biggest blow during afternoon trading but edged higher within minutes left in the session.The premier index of growth companies also still looks poised for a strong weekly advance, up at least 5%, following drops of 3.5% and 5.1% in the prior two weeks.X On Wednesday, the Nasdaq composite sparked the confirmation of a potential new market uptrend by rising 1.9% in higher volume vs. the prior session. The solid rally came on Day 4 of a new rally attempt after the leading U.S. equities index got trampled by sellers and fell 11.7% from its all-time perch of 7505.On Friday, the Nasdaq slipped about 0.1% after rising as much as 0.6%.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both edged nearly 0.4% higher with roughly an hour to go before the close.Small caps, which lagged their big-cap brethren in 2017, outperformed on Friday. The Russell 2000 gained nearly 0.6%.At 1544, the popular small-cap index is now back in the black in 2018, up almost 0.6% year to date.At least six of the 30 components within the Dow industrials rose 1 point or more, including consumer spending and medical names Walt Disney (DIS), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Home Depot (HD).Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) slumped 5% to 17.65, dashing hopes of a possible rebound back above the 50-day moving average this week. But a strong weekly advance suggests that GBTC is beginning to form a new deep base. A rally back above the 50-day line would be bullish, but it would not be a proper buy point yet.The reason: GBTC had fallen more than 70% from its December peak. A correction that deep often indicates that the potential for new sell-offs is high. When a highflying stock or ETF rebounds in price, it's vulnerable to the overhead supply of potential sellers who bought on the way down and are looking to cut their losses.Elsewhere, steel companies, homebuilders, long-term medical care, medical services and pollution control firms paced the upside with gains of 1.5% or more.Nucor (NUE) has trampolined higher since testing the 60 level on Feb. 5. The return back above the 50-day moving average is also bullish. The U.S. steelmaker rallied more than 5% on Friday to 68.67 in volume running more than 40% above the 50-day average.Note on an IBD daily chart how it's easy to see when turnover is higher than normal. Just compare the volume bar for any trading session with the line that goes across the volume bars. That line is the 50-day moving average, which shows the average amount of shares traded per day in the past 50 sessions.A stock that rises back above the 50-day moving average, or the 10-week line on a weekly chart, in above-normal turnover is flashing bullish action. Why? It indicates that mutual funds, hedge funds, pension plans, corporate treasury divisions, insurers and the like are accumulating shares.Nucor has experienced stiff upside resistance at the 70 level. The stock has traded between 51 and 68 over the past 14 months. A potential new base could form.Charlotte, N.C.-based Nucor grew fourth-quarter earnings 91% vs. a year ago to 65 cents a share on a 29% jump in revenue to $5.09 billion.U.S. Steel (X) retook a 40.06 buy point in a cup with handle that began in February 2017. The handle formed over five trading sessions from Jan. 16 to 22, and a handle must be at least five trading days long.RELATED:This Is When The Stock Market Outlook ChangedWhich Way Is The Stock Market Headed Now?

Netflix also topped Q1 EPS and sales figures and guided higher for those metrics in Q2. Q1 subscriber numbers benefited from new original content such as science-fiction series ""Altered Carbon"" and fresh seasons of comic-book series ""Marvel's Jessica Jones"" and comedy ""Grace and Frankie."" Shares shot up to a record high.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) cut its sales outlook for the rest of the year, largely on softer smartphone demand, slamming chip stocks and Apple (AAPL). Taiwan Semi is the world's largest contract chipmaker and counts Apple, Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) among its customers. Meanwhile, chip-gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and ASML Holding (ASML) pressured semiconductor stocks a day earlier with weak outlooks.

Alcoa expects full-year adjusted EBITDA of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, up from the $2.6 billion-$2.8 billion range offered in January. It expects industry supply shortages this year after Trump administration sanctions on United Co. Rusal imposed this month barred banned U.S. entities from doing business with the Russian aluminum giant.Top steel makers Steel Dynamics (STLD) and Nucor (NUE) both edged past first-quarter earnings estimates and issued moderately positive comments about the outlook, with Nucor expecting ""sustainable strength"" in steel markets.

98,NUE,"President Trump defended a ""higher price"" for steel that would come from the imposition of tariffs or quotas in a Tuesday meeting with members of Congress.X Several lawmakers warned that higher steel prices could be a negative for the economy, and others warned of reciprocal tariffs from trade partners, and Trump may take such concerns into account. Yet steel stocks rallied on expectations that more protection against import competition is on the way.Shares of U.S. Steel (X) rose 5.1%, AK Steel (AKS) 7%, Steel Dynamics (STLD) 4.3% and Nucor (NUE) 1.75% on the stock market today.  Steel Dynamics is the No. 2-rated stock by IBD Stock Checkup in the Steel-Producers industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock-price trends. The No. 1 stock is ArcelorMittal (MT), which is based in Luxembourg and has operations around the world, including in Europe, India, Brazil and the U.S. Shares of ArcelorMittal rose 4.7%.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — when the Dow Jones industrial average was still within 2% of its record high — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow.

99,NUE,"President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which roiled the stock market less than three weeks ago, now look like a much smaller deal after big new exemptions were granted on Thursday, just before they were set to take effect.Yet dramatically shrinking metal tariffs were an afterthought on Thursday, as Trump made China the central front in his trade war and fear of retaliation against U.S. multinationals sent the stock market tumbling anew. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite tumbled well over 2% Thursday on Trump's confrontational trade policy. The major averages sold off into the close on the stock market today, with the S&P 500 losing 2.1%.China is showing maximum restraint for now. Overnight, Beijing said it would impose 25% tariffs on just $3 billion worth of U.S. goods, including pork, fruit, wine, steel pipe and recycled aluminum. That compares to Trump's proposed tariffs on Chinese robotics, aerospace, biopharma and other goods that could amount to about $15 billion — 25% on roughly $60 billion worth of imports. Even Trump's tariffs look modest in comparison to the $375 billion U.S. goods trade deficit with China and the $60 billion in tariffs that were floated.A day after the stock market tumble, investors initially exhibited relief Friday that the near-term consequences may be limited, but the major averages turned mixed. Dow Jones components Boeing (BA) closed up 0.4%, while Caterpillar (CAT) fell 1.8%. Both fell more than 5% on Thursday.China did not lay out any measures that would negatively affect Boeing and Caterpillar, but they could be at risk if Beijing decides to step up its retaliatory measures.China's U.S. ambassador told Bloomberg that Beijing could scale back Treasury purchases in response.Investor relief over China's measured response may be limited because Trump's tariffs to punish Beijing for intellectual property theft likely mark the beginning of a fractious era for China-U.S. economic and geopolitical relations, which can't help but pose significant risks for U.S. multinationals.Trump said Thursday that the tariffs were just the ""first of many"" actions to reduce the U.S.-China deficit. China's U.S. ambassador said that his country is ""not afraid"" to fight a trade war.The Trump administration is targeting products that are key to Beijing's Made in China 2025 initiative aimed at achieving global technology leadership. Tariffs are expected to go hand-in-hand with investment restrictions that blunt China's ability to acquire American technology. China, for its part, is saying that U.S. accusations of IP theft are without merit.The unstated rationale of Trump's actions are pretty clear: The U.S. wants to maintain technological — and military — leadership over China, and that goal has to take precedence over economic cooperation when the two come in conflict. At the announcement of the tariffs, Trump's plan got an endorsement from Marillyn Hewson, CEO of Lockheed Martin (LMT). Lockheed's F-35 uses stealth technology that lets it evade detection. Shares of Lockheed rose 3% on Friday.The Trump administration appears to have made a sudden realization that launching a trade war with global trading partners over steel and aluminum would hamper Washington's efforts to contain the growing threat posed by China.The 25% steel and 10% aluminum tariffs were set to take effect on Friday, but the Trump administration clarified late Thursday that countries representing more than half of U.S. steel imports would receive exemptions through May 1. Exempted countries include European Union members, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Brazil, Australia and Argentina. After May 1, Trump could decide to permanently exempt those nations based on the status of talks.Steel stocks fell hard on Thursday after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer telegraphed the change in policy. On Thursday, shares of U.S. Steel (X) sank 11% to levels last seen before Trump ramped up his steel tariff talk in mid-February. Steel Dynamics (STLD) fell 7.5%, Nucor (NUE) 6.5% and AK Steel (AKS) 8.7%. Steel stocks extended losses Friday.The Obama administration has been a target of some criticism for an inadequate response to IP theft. Yet it did have a plan for maintaining a sphere of influence in East Asia and Southeast Asia, expanding markets for U.S. multinationals and providing stronger IP protections: the controversial Trans Pacific Partnership. Dropping out of that pact was among the first acts of Trump's presidency, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said in recent weeks that the U.S. could seek to rejoin the pact.Trump, by contrast, has been focused on bringing more U.S. intellectual property back home, through corporate tax cuts. But U.S. multinationals can't hope to serve global markets only from American shores. China, meanwhile, is laser-focused on deepening economic integration with economies throughout Asia through its 21st Century Silk Road initiative. The more the U.S. distances itself from trading partners, the easier it will be for China to emerge unscathed from a trade war.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Can You Spot Major Stock Market Tops?

100,NUE,"Steel stocks were whipsawed on the stock market today, initially pointing higher amid better-than-expected earnings from Nucor (NUE) and AK Steel (AKS), then taking a dive that was even deeper than the broad stock market indexes.X Stocks that had been steel-sector laggards for most of 2017, but which have caught fire lately, led the way lower. AK Steel sank 13%, while U.S. Steel (X) fell 6.2%. Meanwhile, Nucor lost 3.2% and Steel Dynamics (STLD) shed 1.1%. Steel Dynamics is ranked No. 1 by IBD Stock Checkup in the Steel-Producers industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Steel Dynamics has already reported quarterly results, while U.S. Steel will do so Wednesday evening.Among other economically sensitive commodity groups, metal miners and oil-and-gas producers also exhibited weakness on Tuesday. Southern Copper (SCCO) lost 3.1%, falling to its lowest level of 2018, even though copper prices have been holding firm, not far off their multiyear highs.Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM) lost 1.4%, falling for a second day amid a modest pullback in oil prices from multiyear highs. Volatility in oil and gas stocks shouldn't be surprising as some industry analysts predict that ramped-up production sparked by higher oil prices could create an oversupply situation. Exxon Mobil and fellow Dow industrials energy stock Chevron (CVX) both report on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: With volatility returning to the stock market, it's more important than ever to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the prevailing market trend, which lets investors know when they can be aggressive and when they should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Enthusiasm for steel stocks may have gotten a little ahead of itself amid two price hikes announced in January — including one on Monday — by AK Steel for its carbon flat-rolled steel products. Steel companies have said that their end markets are headed in the right direction and that excess supply has been moderating after a surge in steel imports in the first half of 2017. Still, AK Steel and Nucor both said they're being negatively impacted by imports. Nucor credited the Trump administration with making steady progress in handling trade cases, but said the ""process is still slower than we believe is appropriate.""President Trump may discuss steel tariffs at his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening.Nucor earned 65 cents a share in the fourth quarter, a dime ahead of estimates and up 51% from a year ago. Meanwhile, revenue rose 29% to $5.09 billion vs. expectations of $4.83 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Nucor was a bit vague on the outlook, saying EPS in Q1 should top Q4 results without the benefit of tax reform, while analysts are expecting EPS of $1.17 a share. Nucor noted that higher scrap prices and weather-related interruptions will be headwinds.AK Steel reported a smaller-than-expected loss of 6 cents per share vs. the 14-cent loss expected.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why Trump's State Of The Union Might Move Markets Up — Or DownFear Of Amazon Health Care Disruption Clashes With This RealityStocks Fall As Market Shows 3 Signs It May Be Ready For A BreakGrubhub, Redhat Lead These Three IBD 50 Stocks In Buy RangeHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

101,NUE,"In the first big split between the Republican-led Congress and President Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan and GOP members of the House Ways and Means Committee have come out in opposition to the proposed tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports.X While opposition is one thing, the Washington Post reported that congressional Republicans are privately talking about ""other options"" to keep Trump from risking a trade war if the White House doesn't reconsider, raising the possibility of legislation.It's far from clear whether a veto-proof majority to handcuff Trump on trade could be assembled, given that some Democrats praised last week's tariff announcement and that party lines on trade have increasingly blurred. It's possible that the odds of bucking Trump would improve if his trade measures clearly backfire. Yet the potential for a congressional intervention may have helped ease concerns on Wall Street about the impending imposition of tariffs. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also turned overnight losses into solid gains on the stock market today.Steel stocks — which surged on Thursday, when Trump sprung his surprise announcement amid White House infighting over the idea — were mostly lower Monday. U.S. Steel (X) was off 1.4%, Steel Dynamics (STLD) 2.1% and AK Steel (AKS) 1.85%. Nucor (NUE) fell 1 cent.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

Start NowMeanwhile, stocks that are vulnerable to Trump's trade agenda came under pressure early Monday, then cut losses or gained ground as the trading session progressed. Trump had set the tone for a weak open by tweeting that he's willing to exempt Mexico and Canada from the import tariffs — but only after a ""new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed.""In afternoon trading among companies that are big users of steel and aluminum, Ford (F) rose 1.7%, General Motors (GM) 0.8% and Boeing (BA) 2.6%. Kansas City Southern Railway (KSU), which has an extensive network in Mexico, was off 2 cents.IBD'S TAKE: The sell-off triggered by President Trump's tariff plan has changed the outlook for the stock market, The Big Picture column explained on Thursday. Now that stock market volatility has returned, it's more important than ever to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Ryan's office said he was ""extremely worried about the consequences"" of the proposed tariffs. His district includes a factory where Harley-Davidson (HOG) produces motorcycles that have been highlighted by European Union officials as among their likely targets for retaliation if Trump follows through.Trump dismissed the emerging opposition to his policy on Monday, saying ""We're not backing down,"" and adding that he doesn't expect a trade war to ensue.Reading between the lines, Trump is expecting other countries to put up with the tariffs because they have more to lose than the U.S. That's in keeping with his Friday tweet: ""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win.""These 4 Stocks Near Buy Points Are Showing Strong Relative Strength Trump Tariffs: These Stocks Could Be Hurt The Most Fed Inflation Gauge Stays Tame, But Here's 6 Reasons Why Investors Are NervousWhat Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?Amazon Vs.

103,NUE,"Major indexes felt investors' chill over news that Gary Cohn is leaving his White House role as chief economic advisor, but the Nasdaq composite continues to prove that it is the index to beat in 2018. However, as seen in recent sessions, the U.S. equity markets continue to show rapid seesawing action as well.X Due to a recent spate of heavy distribution, or pronounced institutional profit-taking, from Feb. 20 to March 1 in both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, IBD's current outlook continues to stand at ""Uptrend under pressure.""At 3 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq shaved its mild losses and is trying to hold above the breakeven level, up 0.1%, despite having multiple large-cap and megacap companies that do business overseas. But in the wake of continued uncertainty over the possibility of trade spats between the U.S. and China, the rest of Asia, and Europe, clearly the selling has been more focused on industrial companies.The Dow Jones industrial average, down at one point 1.4%, has cut its losses to around 0.7%. During session lows, at least half of the 30 components sank 1 point or more. IBM (IBM) was the sole stock within the Dow Industrials to rise 1 point or more.The S&P 500 slid nearly 0.8%, then cut the loss to less than 0.4% with an hour to go in Wednesday's session. At 2707, the large-cap benchmark has shaved its year-to-date gain to 1.6%.The Nasdaq is up 6.7% since Jan. 1.The Russell 2000 gained 0.7% as small caps outperformed. Perhaps institutional investors hold a general view that a budding trade war that focuses on tariffs on select products would hurt larger multinational companies more than smaller firms that sell primarily in the domestic market.The S&P SmallCap 600 is up 0.6%, and at 955 is now up 2% since Jan. 1.While steel stocks are emerging as a new leading sector thanks to strong gains by the likes of United States Steel (X), Steel Dynamics (STLD) and Nucor (NUE), the software, consumer and China sectors of the market continue to do well.Alibaba (BABA), Weibo (WB) and TAL Education (TAL) continue to show nice long-term uptrends and high relative strength. (See a detailed analysis of TAL's chart action near the bottom of this article.)Alibaba, a big winner in 2017, continues to a long trend of higher highs and higher lows. Notice on a daily chart how the Chinese and international facilitator of e-commerce and mobile payments had sold off in line with the early February correction that took the Nasdaq down nearly 12% from its perch. Yet Alibaba, hitting a 2018 year-to-date low of 168.88, did not undercut the Dec. 5 near-term low of 164.25. That's bullish.Plus, Alibaba has been weaving above and below its still-rising 50-day moving average. Such action indicates that the stock is trying to form a new base that could serve as a launching pad for a new breakout and a new run to price highs.When a stock breaks out and hits new highs, everyone in the market is happy, except for short sellers.Alibaba broke out of an eight-week cup with handle at 192.59 on Jan. 24, rallied 7%, then got reeled back into the belly of that chart pattern. So, a new base that potentially forms would technically serve as a base next to a base.Autodesk (ADSK) gapped up on very strong results and gave a rosy outlook based on success with its transition into a ""software as a service"" business model. Adobe Systems (ADBE) has already shown it's succeeded by selling its products online and giving users flexible subscription-based offerings.Both Autodesk and Adobe are members of IBD Leaderboard, which currently shows nine names on its Leaders list. Each of those Leaders has an annotated daily and weekly chart to help users find the right time to buy and the best time to sell to lock in gains and minimize losses.Autodesk jumped past a 131.20 buy point in a three-month base that can be viewed as a double bottom.

The leader in for-profit education for China's fast-growing middle class inched up on Wednesday, but more importantly, the large-cap consumer spending play continues to hold near a 36.26 buy point in a new four-month cuplike base.TAL, which has a relatively limited float of 182 million shares, has performed exceptionally well since it initially cleared a 12-week perfect cup with handle at 13.07 on Jan. 19, 2017 (adjusted for a 6-1 stock split later in the year). On that day, the stock vaulted 7.4% in very heavy volume and sprinted past the highest price within the downward-slanting handle within the base. Add 10 cents to a handle's high to find the exact buy point.To see that exact breakout, MarketSmith offers excellent easy-to-use historical charts that allow users to go back decades in time.On the day of TAL's January 2017 breakout, the correct buy point was 77.93, a dime above the handle's high, before the big stock split. In the handle portion of the base, TAL fell just 5% to 74.06. The handle indicates the final shakeout of remaining uncommitted shareholders before fresh new institutional demand comes in to lift the stock and spur the breakout to new highs.Since that breakout, TAL has advanced 200%.Over the same time period, the S&P 500 has gained as much as 27%, excluding dividends.TAL grew its revenue 39%, 38%, 43% and 68% over the past four years. In the fiscal year 2017 ended in February that year, the top line was $1.04 billion, hitting the billion-dollar level for the first time.The Street sees earnings rising 14% to 32 cents a share in FY 2018 (which just ended in February), then leaping another 62% to 52 cents in FY 2019 on revenue increases of 63% to $1.7 billion and 52% to $2.59 billion, respectively.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures slumped 2.3% to $61.14 a barrel despite reports that weekly U.S. crude oil inventories came in higher than expected at 2.4 million barrels, suggesting continued strong domestic output. In the prior week, inventories were higher at 3.0 million barrels.Bond traders have been conducting relatively quiet trading, at least from the view of U.S. Treasury long bonds. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood at 2.88%, relatively unchanged for the past two sessions and seven basis points below the year-to-date peak of 2.95%.The CME Fed Watch tool for analyzing fed funds futures currently shows no significant change in the probability that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates four times by December. The probability that the fed funds rate will hit a 2.25%-2.5% target range is 34%. This means the majority of bond traders see just three increases of a quarter point each for 2018, with the first one coming up after the Fed holds a two-day meeting on interest rate policy on March 20-21.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on top growth stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and other financial markets.)RELATED:Hot IPO LeadersDo You Know How To Spot This Money-Making Bullish Stock Chart Pattern?Stocks Near A Buy ZoneWill More Hot Growth Stocks Begin Forming This Key Pattern?Autodesk Shines After Its Q4 Results

The Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.1%.Volume in the stock market today rose on both major exchanges vs. the same time in the previous session.Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell faced the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m. ET after addressing the House on Tuesday. The stock market lost more than 1% Tuesday in apparent reaction to Powell's suggestion that there might be four rate hikes this year. In December, the Fed hinted at three rate increases.The question leading into Powell's testimony Thursday was whether Powell would stand firm on his Tuesday comments or try to soften the message.After his prepared remarks, Powell told the Senate that, ""Nothing ... suggests to me that wage inflation is at a point of acceleration."" The stock market appeared to initially react positively to that remark but eventually turned wobbly.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportAmong IBD's 197 industry groups, steel makers and specialty alloy stocks led the pack. Steel stocks working on bases and closing in on potential buy points include: Nucor (NUE), which rose 2% in strong volume; Tenaris (TS), which popped 2% in huge volume; and Carpenter Technology (CRS), which added almost 1% in moderately higher volume.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) managed a small gain in the morning even as the markets weakened. But the gain didn't increase as the market staged its positive reversal. Apple is working on its third weekly gain in a row in a nearly six-week long consolidation.Apple has at least four things going for it: a lower corporate tax rate that went into effect Jan. 1; cash and cash equivalents that reached $268.9 billion, as of year-end 2017; a lead in wearables; and a chart that reset Apple's base count during the recent 12% correction in the S&P 500.As a stock rises, it pauses to consolidate. Breakouts from the first two consolidations are more likely to work than those from later-stage patterns. When a pattern undercuts the previous pattern's low, the base count is rest at one, which is what Apple did.Apple's pile of cash leaves it well-positioned to raise its dividend. Apple usually announces dividend increases in late April.First-time jobless claims rolled in at 210,000, which was 7% fewer than the lowest estimate in the range and almost 9% below the Street's consensus view.Personal income for January rose 0.4%, edging above the consensus estimate of 0.3%. Consumer spending inched up 0.2%, in line with expectations.The PMI Manufacturing Index for February was pegged at 55.3, below the lowest estimate in the range (55.4). But the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing gauge for February came in at 60.8, above both the consensus view for 58.6 and the highest estimate in the range, 59.5.Construction spending for January missed the mark. The consensus estimate was 0.3% but the reading was flat.RELATED:Trump And Tariffs: What Is Likely To Happen?Apple Grabs The Lead In Wearable DevicesBest Buy Jumps On Beat And GuidanceGap-Up Moves And The Art Of The Breakout

Apple is now Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKA) second-largest holding, according to Buffett's annual letter released Saturday.Steel stocks rallied again after Bloomberg reported that President Trump is considering a 24% tariff on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports. Steel Dynamics (STLD), Nucor (NUE), U.S. Steel (X) and AK Steel (AKS) were all higher in the early going.Of the four, Nucor has the healthiest chart.

108,NUE,"So far this year, cyclical industries such as oil suppliers, fertilizer, transport and steelmakers are leading IBD's 197 industry stock groups. That reflects confidence in the U.S. and global economy as well as benefits from the Trump tax cuts. The corporate tax cuts are likely to benefit energy and other old-economy sectors more than tech giants that can more easily avoid taxes.X While 2018 has barely gotten started, most of these groups have been top performers over the past several weeks. Investors need to be watching for sector rotations so they are always focusing on the leading groups and stocks.Many of the stocks in these groups are either extended from breakouts (FedEx (FDX), U.S. Steel (X)) or still recovering from long downtrends (Schlumberger (SLB)). But a few, including steelmaker Nucor (NUE) and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM), are in or near buy range.S&P 500 futures rose 0.25% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.3%. Dow futures advanced 0.2%.The Chemicals-Agriculture group has soared 13% so far in 2018. This includes fertilizer makers such as CF Industries (CF).But Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile, which makes specialty fertilizers, is also now seen as a lithium play. Sociedad Química y Minera has a 63.90 buy point, closing Wednesday at 61.81. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is lagging somewhat after a strong three-month uptrend to late September.Mining giant Rio Tinto (RIO) reportedly has dropped out of the bidding for a 32% SQM stake owned by Nutrien (NTR), Bloomberg reported late Wednesday, citing sources. Fertilizer giant Nutrien, formed from the merger of Potash Corp. and Agrium, agreed to sell the SQM holdings to win regulatory approval.Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) is now viewed as an indirect legal marijuana play.This group is up 8.7% this year. Group giants include Schlumberger and Halliburton (HAL). Crude oil prices have risen to three-year highs above $63 a barrel in the U.S. But oil services stocks were slower to rebound than many shale producers as customers remained reluctant to step up spending. Both Schlumberger  and Halliburton on working on the right side of long, deep consolidations.This related energy group has climbed 8% in 2018. Notable members include Baker Hughes, a General Electric Co. (BHGE).This small group, dominated by FedEx and UPS (UPS), has rallied 8% as well. FedEx and UPS stocks are extended.Steelmakers have climbed 7.9% this year. Steel stocks were among the big immediate winners after President Trump's election, but then made little headway for most of 2017 before moving higher in Q4. U.S. Steel and Steel Dynamics (STLD) are extended, but Nucor is just in range from a 66.10 entry in a consolidation going back nearly 10 months.

But the index erased early gains to fall modestly with less than an hour left in Tuesday's post-holiday session.X At one point, the Nasdaq gained nearly 0.8%, then retreated to a 0.4% loss. With less than a half hour to go, the leading index is down just 0.1% after sprinting 5.3% higher last week.Among IBD's 197 industry groups and subgroups, three of the top four performers on Tuesday hailed from the semiconductor sector and were each up 1.5% to 2.1%.

This would be the Nasdaq's second straight loss.Google site operator Alphabet (GOOGL) outperformed the market and rose 0.4% to 1099.30 in below average turnover. The stock hoisted itself back above the key 50-day moving average intraday, though Alphabet was fighting to close above that level. The support line flattened out some, but is still in a long-term upward trajectory.A rising 50-day moving average is bullish. Even more bullish is when a stock pulls ahead of its 50-day line. This hints at healthy demand by the institutional set.At 1,105, Alphabet is up 4.9% since Jan. 1.

Full-year profit is seen rising 16% to $41.47 a share in 2018.Keep in mind that many of the top growth companies do a good job of managing analysts' expectations, giving the management a chance to under-promise and over-deliver.Steel companies are emerging as a hot new industry group for 2018.South Korea's Posco (PKX), along with Nucor (NUE), U.S. Steel (X) and global steel maker ArcelorMittal (MT) all have mild gains since Jan. 1.Posco is testing institutional buying support near the 10-week moving average for the second time since it cleared a shallow cup with handle at 76.32 during the week ended Dec. 1. A cup with handle typically shows a minimum decline from high to low of 12%. The handle should show a smaller correction than the cup base itself, and in most cases is confined to a drop of just 8% to 12%.To find Posco's correct buy point, add 10 cents to the highest price within the handle, or the intraday high of 76.22.One flaw with Posco's shallow cup with handle? The midpoint of the handle, 72.31, was slightly lower than the cup's midpoint of 72.47. Thus, a chart reader could also interpret the entire pattern as simply a well-constructed flat base, which shows mostly sideways price action and a decline of no more than 15% from head to toe. In this perspective, the correct buy point for Posco would have been 77.86, or 10 cents above the left-side high. Posco thrust above that flat-base entry with a high-volume rush of buying on Dec. 8.Meanwhile, Olympic Steel (ZEUS) cleared a 25.34 buy point in a long, deep cup with handle before reversing. Shares are still up nearly 1% to 24.70. Volume is running more than 100% above the 50-day average.Highland Hills, Ohio-based Olympic Steel is expected to report it earned 11 cents a share in the fourth quarter of last year, capping earnings of $1.25 a share for the full year. Wall Street sees 2018 profit leaping 56% to $1.95 a share.The stock, part of the metal product distribution industry group, has a 75 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, and a positive rating of B- for Accumulation/Distribution on a scale of A (heavy net fund buying over the past 13 weeks) to E (heavy net selling).Elsewhere, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rallied 11% as its bullish rebound continues. Watch to see if the closed-end fund that tracks the price of the popular digital currency can retake its 50-day moving average, a critical step in forming the right side of a potential but flawed new base.GBTC had gone on a climax run in December after a fantastic breakout past 10.93 in a deep cup with handle on Nov. 22. In a climax run, a stock or ETF goes nearly vertical after rising sharply in price for months, and such action signifies a last gasp of desperate buying by traders ahead of a major top. However, some stocks have been able to recover from a climax run and set up a new breakout. But it takes a lot of time.In other markets, U.S. near-term crude oil futures rose 0.4% to $61.79 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond held steady at 2.89%, still below its early 2014 peak of 3.04%.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, business and financial markets.)RELATED:When Did Nvidia Show Up In This Top Growth Stock Screen In IBD?Hot Growth Stocks Leading The Market Today: A Peek Inside IBD 50 How Does Your Stock Weigh Against Its Peers?

Citi analyst Alexander Hacking wrote that the impact on imports will be minimal in the near term, because imports from Vietnam have tumbled over the past year.

116,NUE,"Mexico and Canada are flatly rejecting the Trump administration's demand to transform Nafta by shifting a lot more auto production to the U.S., and the White House refuses to back down, despite the objections of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Automotive Policy Council, representing General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).XSo are we really headed for a disruptive breakup of one of the world's biggest free-trade zones?While trade negotiators from the three nations unsurprisingly agreed on Tuesday to extend their talks into early 2018, expect things to go right up to — but not past — the breaking point, based on the way all White House decision-making has proceeded.Trump's top four rules for a presidential deal are becoming obvious.Right now, Trump is getting exactly the Nafta headlines he wants. Probably the only thing better, in his view, would be a much bigger news story that he's declaring that Mexico and Canada have six months to reach a deal, or else the U.S. will walk away from Nafta.If there isn't sufficient movement in the talks, and there probably won't be, it's a pretty good bet that at some point next year, Trump will inform Congress that he intends to back out of the trade agreement within six months. In fact, Trump weighed giving that ultimatum last spring, before deciding to head to the bargaining table.  Throwing down the gauntlet in 2018 may deliver political benefits in the midterm elections.Trump decertified the Iran nuclear deal earlier this month, without actually withdrawing from the agreement. The prime effect, other than to serve as another data point casting doubt on the ability of the U.S. to stand by international agreements, was to take the onus off Trump to periodically attest that the deal was in the interest of the U.S.Trump's rejection of a deal to curb steel imports from China over the summer offers the closest parallel to the Nafta negotiation. The takeaway: Trump would rather have no deal than one that appears to give away too much.Trump spent the early months of his presidency talking about imposing tariffs on steel imports and directing the Commerce Department to conduct an investigation into whether national security justified such tariffs. But the effort ran into a wall of resistance among steel purchasers as well as international trading partners.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average ended just below 23,000 on Tuesday, up nearly 1,100 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. The problem was that China is the main source of steel overproduction, but it accounts for only a tiny slice of U.S. imports. Tariffs aimed at Chinese steel would have little impact, but broad steel tariffs would unfairly target producers from other nations that were playing by the rules.Eventually, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross brought Trump a deal: China would cut steel overcapacity by 150 million tons by 2022, according to the Financial Times. But Trump rejected the deal because he preferred a solution that included tariffs, not just quotas. Steel makers such as Nucor (NUE) have been pleading for more tariffs, but the question isn't expected to come back up before tax reform is complete.Trump's decision in early September to end President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals that protects so-called ""Dreamers"" from deportation avoided a headline he didn't want. Republican state attorneys general were ready to challenge the program in court unless the Trump administration confirmed that it wouldn't defend DACA.But the move threatened to unleash chaos once Dreamers became unable to renew their two-year visas beginning in early 2018. Trump quickly signaled that he would sign legislation that preserves DACA in exchange for border security funding, even though Democrats are unlikely to agree to funding for a wall.Assuming Congress can reach a deal to extend DACA, Trump will surely take credit for any additional border security and for prodding the legislative branch to act, rather than relying on executive action, as Obama did.Likewise, Trump reportedly basked in the positive media coverage that followed his deal with top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to extend the debt ceiling and fund the government for a mere three months.After vowing in recent days to kill ObamaCare cost-sharing subsidies paid to insurers to shrink deductibles and medical bills for low-income policyholders, Trump criticized the subsidies for making insurers ""rich"" and said that his actions would force Congress to reach a deal to provide better health care coverage.On Tuesday, after Sens. Lamar Alexander, a Republican, and Patty Murray, a Democrat, announced a legislative agreement to extend the subsidies for two years and give states more flexibility to opt out of Affordable Care Act regulations, Trump quickly signaled his support.When faced with a potentially destabilizing deadline, as may happen in the Nafta negotiations, Trump finds a way to pivot, take the best deal he can get after all of his cards are played, and declare that the outcome is really positive.RELATED:Insurers Have This Escape Hatch As Trump Kills ObamaCare SubsidiesSteel Maker Cites 'Slow' Trump Help For Earnings WarningHere's How You Know Markets See Trump's Shutdown, Nafta Threats As Fake NewsTrump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman SachsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see where your stocks' industry groups rate, and whether they get a green, yellow or red light from IBD. Here's a good place to start if you're looking for stocks either at or near a buy point.The company also highlighted tepid demand for steel plate, after an earlier boost from inventory restocking, and unplanned outages at its Louisiana facility.Management noted ""slow but steady"" progress by the Trump administration in prosecuting unfair trade cases thanks to ""overwhelming evidence that our foreign competitors receive support from illegal subsidies.""Still, Nucor said that imports continue to negatively impact the U.S. steel industry, noting that through the first eight months of 2017, finished steel imports accounted for an estimated 28% share of the U.S. market and have increased an estimated 16.5% compared with the same period last year.President Trump initially raised hopes that the Commerce Department would impose import tariffs on steel, justified by a finding that steel imports harm national security. But amid pressure from trading partners and steel buyers, the idea has been put on the back burner.Earlier this week, Citi upgraded Nucor to buy, citing valuation and capacity reductions in China. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley downgraded both Nucor and Steel Dynamics to equal weight, citing higher scrap pricing and weaker demand from the automotive and nonresidential construction sectors. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's Piyush Sood said market conditions were more favorable for U.S. Steel.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHere's How You Know Markets See Trump's Shutdown, Nafta Threats As Fake NewsNucor Becomes Second Steelmaker To Miss Earnings Views In 2 Days

118,NUE,"Mining stocks such as Australian giant BHP Billiton (BHP) are surging Friday on the release of strong Chinese import data, even as the longer-term picture of demand remains mixed. U.S. Steel (X) and other U.S.-traded steel charged higher as well on the Chinese numbers, but also on the growing scandal regarding Kobe Steel's data cheating.XChina in September imported more than 100 million tons of iron ore, a roughly 16% gain month over month, the new data showed.The data's release comes as China approaches a steel-production drawdown for the winter season, and makes moves to curb its production capacity and push its steel mills, coal mines and iron ore mines into profitable territory.""I think people were maybe under the assumption that iron procurement would start to fall, and that's really not what we're seeing,"" Cowen analyst Novid Rassouli said. ""But it's unclear what's the driver — if you're having demand being pulled forward in front of these production cuts.""BHP Billiton jumped 2.8% in the stock market today as Brazilian miner Vale (VALE) rose 6%, both retaking their 50-day moving averages. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) advanced 1.65%. Rio Tinto (RIO) popped 4% to a two-year high.U.S. Steel, meanwhile, shot up 7% to 27.36, moving back toward its 200-day moving average. Europe-based steel giant ArcelorMittal (MT) popped 8.4% to 29.36, a two-year high, breaking out of a 27.71 cup-with-handle buy point.  Nucor (NUE) rose 1.55% and AK Steel (AKS) 5.65%.Kobe Steel said its data cheating may have gone beyond Japan to some 500 customers. Boeing (BA) used falsely certified Kobe Steel on some planes, according to Reuters.""The Kobe Steel crisis is definitely helping other steel producers,"" Wunderlich Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said, according to a Reuters report.Rassouli said that if any major supplier were removed from the market, rivals would naturally benefit. But he cautioned that it was still too early to tell how Kobe Steel might be affected.Meanwhile, the Trump administration reportedly wants to add steel to the Nafta tracing list and require more of a vehicle be produced in America, moves that could burden the auto industry but potentially help U.S. steel makers.The SPDR Metals & Mining (XME) exchange traded fund climbed 1.3%.China's attempts to cut down on pollution have also led to more demand for higher-quality iron ore, potentially benefiting Vale, Rio and BHP.""An increased focus on pollution control in China has led to stronger demand for high-grade, low-impurity iron ore fines, lump and pellets and weaker demand for low-grade, high-impurity ores,"" Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina wrote in a research note dated Thursday.He added: ""We believe this flight to quality in iron ore is structural, and producers of high-grade fines (especially Vale), lump (Rio, BHP and Anglo) and pellets (Vale) will benefit from higher price premiums on average in the future than they have realized in the past.""Clarkson Plateau Securities analyst Jeremy Sussman, who covers mining stocks like BHP and Vale, said that he sees solid demand for bulk commodities for the next 12 to 18 months or so, with some bumps every now and then.""There'll be some fits and starts,"" he said. ""You'll see commodity demand decline a bit during the winter season.""LaFemina said he was still bullish on the space over the next six-plus months, citing supply constraints and upbeat global demand.Lee McMillan, a Clarkson analyst who covers U.S. Steel and ArcelorMittal, said that much of the stronger sentiment toward China is driven by supply. He also cited some steel production curbs that came more quickly than expected in Tangshan, one of China's steelmaking hubs, a looming trade-case deadline against Vietnam, and China's attempts to clamp down on illegal capacity.Rassouli said he hadn't seen a huge shift in macroeconomic demand that would indicate any kind of surge. Gauging commodity demand, based on the new import data, can also be difficult.""It's hard to say exactly what it is, just because it's just this big headline number, and it's unclear exactly what's going on underneath,"" Rassouli said.RELATED:Boeing Reportedly Used Faulty Kobe Steel; FAA Inspecting Airbus EnginesSteel Maker Cites 'Slow' Trump Help For Earnings WarningFreeport Bends To Indonesia Will To Keep Mining Copper, GoldStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

120,NUE,"In a campaign post-mortem after Donald Trump's election, one-time campaign manager Corey Lewandowski famously said that the media took his stump speeches ""too literally."" The same can't be said of financial markets, which have learned not to make that same mistake when President Trump goes off script and reverts to campaign mode, as he's been doing seemingly every other day lately.XWednesday news headlines after Trump's Tuesday night speech in Arizona said that markets were rattled by his threat to abandon Nafta and shut down the government if Congress won't fund a wall on the border. It would be more accurate to say that markets were calm in the face of threats that investors see as low-probability outcomes.The surest sign of investor equanimity is in the dollar-peso exchange rate. The peso plunged vs. the dollar after Trump's election, right up until the point that he took office, but the peso has been rallying ever since. This week, despite a modest dip on Wednesday, the peso is unchanged and close to its highest point in a year.The contentious trade policy that Trump promised in his stemwinders has been mostly a no-show. The peso strength comes as U.S., Mexican and Canadian negotiators just finished their initial talks stemming from Trump's demand to improve the trade agreement. In April, Trump said he was all set to put in motion an exit from NAFTA, when phone calls from the leaders of Canada and Mexico convinced him to instead to try and work out their differences.Those countries dismissed Trump's latest threat — ""we'll end up probably terminating NAFTA at some point"" — as a negotiating tactic. It remains unclear whether the Trump administration can achieve its goals including a substantially narrower trade deficit with Mexico via negotiation, but business groups have warned of serious economic disruption from exiting the agreement.After months of setting the stage for new tariffs based on the Commerce Department's national security-related investigation of steel imports, the Trump administration had a sudden change of heart in the face of threats of retaliation from U.S. trading partners.""Wait till you see what I'm going to do for steel and your steel companies,"" Trump said in a June speech, pledging action ""very soon."" But a decision on tariffs has been put on the back burner.The steel industry was expected to thrive under Trump thanks to tariffs and a big infrastructure push, but Nucor (NUE), Steel Dynamics (STLD) and U.S. Steel (X) have been stock market laggards. The Steel-Producers industry group is ranked No. 162 of 197 industry groups by IBD based on stock performance.IBD'S TAKE: On Tuesday, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Tuesday's speech wasn't the first time Trump has threatened to shut down the government if Congress wouldn't fund his border wall. The same thing happened in April, but the White House quickly relented and the funding bill Trump signed excluding resources for a border wall. Expect a repeat, assuming that any bill to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling requires Democratic votes, as it almost certainly will.""By whipping up his base over a border wall and threatening a government shutdown over funding for the wall,"" Trump will make it harder for some Republican lawmakers to vote for a budget to keep the government open for business, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Washington analysts Brian Gardner and Michael Michaud wrote. Still, they see less than 50% odds of a shutdown this fall.RELATED:Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereTrump Touts Market Prowess As Trump Stocks Erase Post-Election Gains

125,NUE,"Here's one of the biggest problems with President Trump taking credit for the Dow Jones industrial average's rise close to 22,000, as he did on Tuesday.X""Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!"" Trump tweeted.While there's no question that Trump has presided over a great period for the stock market, many of the so-called Trump stocks that were supposed to thrive on his watch have been laggards, such as Vulcan Materials (VMC), U.S. Steel (X) and Goldman Sachs (GS).At the same time, what might be called non-Trump stocks, have done pretty nicely. If there was any group for which Trump's election looked like a setback, it was the solar power industry. Yet IBD's Energy-Solar industry group ranks No. 1 among 197 industry groups based on stock performance. Since Trump announced his plan to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, stocks like First Solar (FSLR) and SunPower (SPWR) have been surging. (SunPower crashed 19% Wednesday on weak revenue guidance. First Solar, which reported strong results last week, dipped 2% but held onto most of its recent gains.)IBD'S TAKE: The No. 1 ranked insurer in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group isn't Dow stalwart UnitedHealth Group, which exited most ObamaCare markets early in 2017, but an insurer whose prospects are closely tied to the fate of the Affordable Care Act. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see which insurer is setting the pace, based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance.The latest Trump stock to divee was Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), a supplier of concrete, asphalt and other building materials that stood to benefit from Trump's trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. On Tuesday, Martin Marietta came up 10 cents shy of earnings estimates and shares tumbled 6.4%, closing below where they finished on Nov. 9.Vulcan Materials, the nation's largest supplier of construction aggregates, fell 3.2% on Tuesday to close below its Election Day, Nov. 8 level. Vulcan Materials did rebound 3.3% on the stock market today despite reporting its own weak earnings.Infrastructure plans have been on the back burner while Trump prioritized the seemingly failed effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare.The steel sector was supposed to soar on Trump steel tariffs that looked like a sure bet, but no longer look so certain after pushback from foreign trading partners. Trump told the Wall Street Journal last week that action to curtail steel imports may wait until after tax reform and infrastructure. U.S. Steel briefly surged on positive earnings news last week, but was quickly undercut by the disappointment over tariffs. U.S. Steel and Nucor (NUE) both closed lower on Tuesday than they did on Nov. 9.Bank stocks were supposed to be another triple-threat group under Trump, poised to gain from regulatory relief, tax cuts and rising interest rates prompted in part by Trump's big fiscal plans. Here the record is somewhat better. Regulators did sign off on bigger capital return plans for big banks that passed their stress tests. But Wall Street has been scaling back expectations for corporate-tax cuts and the Federal Reserve has tabled its rate-hiking plans as inflation pressures fail to materialize. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares surged in the weeks after Trump's election, but they've been Dow laggards since the start of 2017, with Goldman down 5% and JPMorgan up 8%, compared to the Dow's 11% gain and the Nasdaq's 18%.Many banks have reported weak trading revenue in early 2017, but Goldman reported a stunning 40% plunge in fixed income, commodity and currency trading revenue in the second quarter.While bank stocks have been mostly range-bound in recent months, Morgan Stanley (MS) has cleared a buy point and Bank of America (BAC) is near a buy zone above 25.21. But even those two bank leaders have slightly lagged the general market over the past four months.The expectations were that Trump would fuel growth and the Fed would be more proactive about raising interest rates, but with doubts creeping higher about the scope and timing of any fiscal fuel, some economists have marked down their growth expectations. The International Monetary Fund said last week that it now expects GDP growth of 2.1% this year and next, down from prior forecasts of 2.3% growth this year and 2.5% in 2018.RELATED:The Fed Just Gave A Green Light To Wall StreetSolar Stocks Shine As South Miami Passes Groundbreaking LawWhy There's No Trump Bump For Infrastructure StocksCheck Out These 4 Energy Plays Near Buy Zones

Nucor (NUE) slid 0.5% after climbing as much as 1.5%. Meanwhile, Europe-based Arcelor Mittal (MT) rose 1.7%.President Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have whipped up expectations for a quick conclusion to the Trump administration investigation into whether steel imports are hurting national security, signaling that there's little doubt about how they'll rule.Early in the session, investors scooped up steel stocks after the news site Axios reported that Trump and a few key advisors made clear at a White House meeting this week that they're ""hell-bent on imposing tariffs — potentially in the 20% range — on steel, and likely other imports.""Cowen analyst Novid Rassouli said on Thursday that the government was expected to rule by Friday, and he predicted a significant potential rise in prices for hot-rolled coil steel. He noted that AK Steel and U.S. Steel could move to the upside after the decision.But on Thursday, the White House began to suggest that the tariff decision will be delayed. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that it might not come until after a mid-July summit of the leading global economies, known as the Group of 20.Late Friday, Bloomberg reported that Trump hasn't yet made up his mind about whether to impose tariffs, though there was no indication that he had given up the idea.A surprising amount of pushback — not just from steel purchasers and their representatives in Congress — but even from within the Trump administration. Reuters reported on Friday afternoon that the threat of Trump steel tariffs was sparking trade retaliation threats from the European Union, which sees the national security rationale as unwarranted.One potential outcome is that the tariffs will be smaller than expected. Earlier this month, Ross said that a combination of a tariff and quota would protect domestic steel producers while also protecting steel fabricators that are consumers of foreign steel from excessive price increases.If the intent is to penalize China, which produces about half of global steel production but accounts for a slim share of U.S. imports, it's not clear how much impact the tariffs would have. That's why other countries fear that the tariffs may be more broad-based.IBD'S TAKE: IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" on Tuesday, a signal to investors to exercise extra caution in buying stocks and to take some money off the table to deploy when the turbulence subsides.

133,NUE,"U.S. steelmakers rallied on Monday as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross confirmed that President Donald Trump intends to take ""bold action"" to address national-security risks presented by steel imports.Nucor (NUE), U.S. Steel (X) and AK Steel (AKS) all rose the most in at least a week as Ross indicated in an interview with Bloomberg Television that Trump is inclined to take major steps to protect the industry. Ross said later on Monday that he expects studies into steel and aluminum imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to be released this month.""Then the question will be what does the president do with the recommendations,"" he said. ""The president being the president, I don't think he'll dilly-dally.""Nucor, U.S. Steel and AK Steel rose 1.6%, 3.2% and 4.8% on the stock market today. All are trading below their 200-day moving averages.White House officials are said to be divided over how far to go in pressing the case that steel imports undermine the nation's ability to build equipment such as planes and submarines. Administration officials are debating raising tariffs on imported steel or opting for a hybrid model that would require buyers to pay an additional duty on foreign-made steel once a quota is reached, according to industry representatives with knowledge of the discussions. Ross has said a hybrid model would mute the inflationary impact.On Monday, Ross said options include tariffs and so-called tariff-rate quotas. He said the 232 provision gives the U.S. tools that are less dependent on geography and specific products than filing individual trade cases that have failed to address the ""systemic problems"" in the industry.""The dumping of steel from one country into another makes the second country have excess capacity, which they then dump, and then the country they dump into continues the saga,"" Ross said.The Commerce investigation comes after the Obama administration handed down a series of anti-dumping measures that have helped curtail cheap Chinese shipments and boosted prices and profit for domestic steelmakers. Buyers of metal are concerned that more protection will drive up their costs.Ross suggested the steel investigation will more broadly examine how steel imports can contribute to risks in the wider economy, not just to national security threats. The report will address issues in the context of national security under ""a broad definition, including strong reference to the needs of the economy,"" Ross said.

135,NUE,"Steelmaker Nucor (NUE) warned on Thursday of a second-quarter earnings miss, citing aggressive competition, pressure from steel imports, and softer-than-expected nonresidential construction activity.Nucor now sees earnings of $1.00-$1.05 per share vs. consensus estimates of $1.22, according to Zacks. Analysts' EPS estimates ranged from 99 cents to $1.46 on the high side.Shares of Nucor tanked 7.6% to 54.62 on the stock market today, hitting pre-election levels, with steel industry competitors also dragged down by the news. Steel Dynamics (STLD) tumbled 5.1%, U.S. Steel (X) 1.55% and AK Steel (AKS)  2.6%.Steel producers were among the worst-performing industry groups even as the broad market pointed lower, with the S&P 500 index down 0.2%. Auto manufacturers, who are key customers for steel, were also among the laggards, as falling used-car prices pressure sales at General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and their competitors.

Read IBD's The Big Picture to find out whether the market uptrend that's under pressure remains intact.Nucor said that ""aggressive competition"" was making market conditions for hot-rolled sheet products ""more challenging than we expected."" It said nonresidential construction trends remain positive, but not as robust as expected. Meanwhile, finished-steel imports are up 14% year to date and now account for 26% of the market.Nucor noted a host of recently completed and ongoing trade-enforcement cases involving steel that it expects to ""provide positive results as they work their way through the legal process over the next several months.""In addition, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last week that the Trump administration is very close to wrapping up its investigation into whether steel imports constitute a threat to national security.Ross said a combination of a tariff and quota would protect domestic steel producers while also protecting steel fabricators that are consumers of foreign steel.Meanwhile, Axiom Capital analyst Gordon Johnson reiterated a ""sell"" rating on U.S. Steel after meeting with management.

136,NUE,"While U.S. Steel (X) has a long way to go in its recovery from a steep sell-off, Steel Dynamics (STLD), as well as Nucor (NUE), are trying to forge new breakouts.Like the Dow Jones industrial average, all three of these steel producers showed resilience Friday as the Nasdaq and S&P 500, as well as leading stocks like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), sold off.Based on Thursday's action, Steel Dynamics earned a big upgrade to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating, from 65 to 79.

137,NUE,"Steel stocks got some of their old Trump magic back for a day, as one of the best-performing groups in the month after the November election, led the market on Thursday.As Washington was transfixed by ex-FBI Director James Comey's testimony, Wall Street was fired up by word from the Trump administration that it's getting ready to tilt the balance of trade more in favor of U.S. steel producers.Investors picked beaten-down shares of AK Steel (AKS) out of the scrap heap, as it led the way with a 5.5% advance on the stock market today. Steel Dynamics (STLD) climbed 5.2%, US Steel (X) 4.7% and Nucor (NUE) 3.4%.The steel rally was sparked by the tag-team of President Trump, speaking Wednesday afternoon in Cincinnati, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, appearing before a Senate panel on Thursday. Still, investors may have felt some sense of relief that Comey's testimony wasn't more damaging.Trump, while touting his still-developing plan for a $1 trillion infrastructure boost, added that ""steel folks are going to be very happy"" with coming actions to stop the dumping of foreign steel.On Thursday, Ross said that the Trump administration is very close to wrapping up its investigation into whether imports of steel are hurting national security, which could pave the way for protectionist measures under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.There doesn't seem to be much doubt about the outcome, with Ross calling steel imports ""a genuine national security issue"" and laying out possible recommendations for stemming the flow. Ross said a combination of a tariff and quota would protect domestic steel producers while also protecting steel fabricators that are consumers of foreign steel.""The overall impact on inflation, were that to be the route, should be relatively modest,"" Ross said.Meanwhile, cement and asphalt makers, which have much to gain from Trump's infrastructure plans, finally got a boost on day four of the White House's big infrastructure week. Vulcan Materials (VMC) gained 1.3%, Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) 2%, and Summit Materials (SUM) 2.1%.RELATED:Trump Turbocharged Thursday's Top-Performing Stock Group Steel Stock With 258% Growth Is Testing Its Mettle U.S. Steel Is In Full Meltdown After Stunning Loss

141,NUE,"XU.S. Steel (X) plunged early Wednesday, after the steel giant reported a surprise first-quarter loss late Tuesday. The news sent several other steel stocks lower, including Steel Dynamics (STLD), Nucor (NUE) and AK Steel (AKS).U.S. Steel reported an adjusted loss of 83 cents a share, defying views for 34-cent gain. Sales came in at $2.725 billion vs. estimates for $2.928 billion. For the full year, the company expects EPS of $1.50, less than half of Wall Street's target for $3.05. It expects adjusted EBITDA of -$1.1 billion.The steel giant is speeding up investment to expand capacity after curbing spending in recent years amid cheap Chinese steel. That means higher costs and limited ability to take advantage of higher prices now.Shares of U.S. Steel plunged 27% to 22.78 on the stock market today, crashing below their 200-day moving average for the first time since March 2016.

143,NUE,"While notable hedge fund firms such as David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, Dan Loeb's Third Point and David Tepper's Appaloosa Management trimmed or exited their Apple (AAPL) stake in the first quarter, one famously skittish tech investor made a massive grab for the iPhone maker — and reaped impressive returns.Here are some of the best and worst calls in Q1 by high-profile investors and hedge funds, as disclosed by their latest 13F filings. Rank-and-file investors closely track this regulatory data to get a sense of where the ""smart money"" is being put to work in the stock market.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) loaded up on Apple in the first quarter, swelling its stake in the tech titan by more than 125% vs. the previous quarter to a total of 129.4 million shares. Shares of Apple have continued to sizzle in the second quarter of 2017, adding 8.8% through May 15 to take year-to-date gains to 35.5%.By comparison, the S&P 500 has gained roughly 2% so far in Q2 and 8% year to date, while the Dow Jones industrial average is up roughly 2% and 7% over the respective periods. And that's with Apple as the biggest weighting in both indexes.Buffett described Apple's resonance with customers as ""amazing"" in a recent CNBC interview. He also said Berkshire used its knowledge of the furniture business to evaluate Apple's worth and its edge over rivals.Apple shares edged down 0.15% to 155.47, their straight modest decline.Another move that paid off for Buffett, who is known to prize more established companies with an ""economic moat"" or durable competitive advantage: avoiding the flash and dazzle of one hot IPO.Snapchat owner Snap (SNAP) was snubbed by Buffett but scooped up by Third Point, Appaloosa and George Soros' Soros Fund Management, to their cost. Snap stock has lost 8% in Q2 and sits 17% below its closing price of 24.48 on March 2, when it made its highly anticipated stock market debut.Still, the hedge funds snapping up the stock may view it as an investment with solid long-term potential.Snap rose 0.1% to 20.76 after big gains the prior two sessions from last Thursday's post-IPO lows.In one of its biggest and best Q1 moves, Soros hiked its position in Facebook (FB) by more than 80% last quarter. The social networking leader has advanced 6% in the second quarter to date, building on a win streak that has seen the stock climb by more than 30% year to date.Soros Fund Management also upped its Goldman Sachs (GS) position by about 40% to 86,000 shares, with less luck.Goldman Sachs has slid a further 2% since the start of April, taking 2017's losses to nearly 6%. The S&P financial sector is flat so far in Q2 and up a mere 2.5% year to date, lagging the broad S&P 500.Soros' hedge fund may be buying the dip in financial stocks, anticipating a resumption in their five-year rally should improving economic conditions keep the Fed's tightening plans on pace.Facebook fell 0.3% to 149.78 as it consolidates tightly. Goldman rose 02.% to 225.60, still below its 50-day line.In Q1, Berkshire offloaded shares of International Business Machines (IBM), the seventh largest Dow component, and 21st Century Fox (FOX), which has been hit hard by scandals, in a big way.Dumping those stocks has buoyed Berkshire's investment portfolio. Shares of both companies are well off their recent 52-week highs. So far in Q2, IBM has tumbled 12% and Fox 13%, extending their hobbled run year to date.IBM rose 1.4%, adding to Monday's gains after tumbling sharply. Fox slid 1.4% extending its sell-off.In Q1, Berkshire grew its American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) stakes significantly, maintained a position in United Airlines (UAL) and pared back Delta Air Lines (DAL).Those have been smart moves overall. Airline stocks have soared since the end of March despite adverse publicity, with some firms reporting that traffic growth has outpaced capacity increases.American and United are more than 10% higher in Q2; Southwest and Delta are up nearly 8%.United rose 1.4%, still in buy range. Southwest climbed 0.4% and American 0.6%, just below entry points. Delta was flat.Appaloosa's huge bet on an American industrial renaissance in Q1 hasn't paid off so far, but that could change. Most analysts remain bullish on the outlook for the industrials and materials sectors. Infrastructure spending under President Trump and China's One Road, One Belt project are two potential catalysts for companies in these sectors, including steel stocks.In Q2 so far, AK Steel (AKS) and Nucor (NUE) — Appaloosa's new buys from last quarter — are both in the red, down roughly 21% and 4% respectively. ArcelorMittal (MT), a position in the hedge fund that grew more than 400% in size, has given up 10% over the same period.AK Steel fell 0.5%, Nucor rose 0.3% on Tuesday. ArcelorMittal climbed 2.7%.In Q1, Third Point opened stakes in Parsley Energy (PE), Halcon Resources (HK) and Enerplus (ERF). The hedge fund may be of the view that the energy sector is oversold and could be due for a bounce in the medium term. Sector earnings and oil prices are highly correlated — and West Texas crude prices averaged $52 a barrel in the first quarter, up more than 50% year over year, following an OPEC-led deal on output cuts.In the near term, however, oil prices and energy stocks have been under pressure.Halcon has given up nearly 12% in the second quarter, extending 2017 losses to 27%. Parsely and Enerplus haven't fared much better this quarter, down 0.8% and up 0.8% respectively.Parsley sank 1.3%, Halcon 3.7% and Enerplus 0.5% on Tuesday.RELATED:Buffett's Berkshire Stays Away From Snap, But Not These FundsBuffett, Soros Moves Keep Delta, American In Holding PatternWhat Will Berkshire Filing Show As Loeb Cuts Facebook, Apple Stakes?Why Buffett Still Isn't Sure If He'd Buy Amazon, Alphabet Stock Now

144,NUE,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) hiked its stake in Apple (AAPL) by more than 125% to 129.4 million shares in the first quarter, and made modest changes to its airlines holdings while avoiding Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP), which went public in March.Meanwhile, Soros Fund Management bought 1.7 million shares of Snap, joining David Tepper's Appaloosa Management and Dan Loeb's Third Point. Soros also dissolved his firm's positions in Amazon.com (AMZN) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and added to its stake in Facebook (FB), according to filings late Monday.David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital trimmed its Apple holdings to 4.2 million shares from 6.1 million in Q4, while more than quadrupling its stake in General Motors (GM) to 55 million shares from 13 million.In Q1, Berkshire grew its American Airlines (AAL) stake to 49.3 million shares, up 8.4% vs. the previous quarter, and its investment in Southwest Airlines (LUV) to 47.7 million, up 10.4%. It trimmed its position in Delta to 55 million shares, down 8.3%, while keeping its holdings in United Airlines (UAL) steady at 28.9 million.The regulatory filing confirmed news from early May that Berkshire's Buffett busily dumped tech giant IBM (IBM) in Q1. It had 64.6 million shares left at quarter-end, down 20%. (Even IBM Retirement Fund's unloaded 70,000 shares of IBM, leaving it with 12,451 IBM shares in Q1, according to the fund's 13F filing on May 10.)Meanwhile, the conglomerate's massive long-term stakes in Coca-Cola (KO), American Express (AXP) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) were left basically unchanged.Buffett had already said Berkshire more than doubled its Apple holdings in Q1, giving it a 2.5% stake in the iPhone maker's outstanding shares. Berkshire initiated a position in Apple, worth $1.1 billion, in Q1 2016 and doubled down on Apple as the year progressed.By contrast, Appaloosa Management slashed its stake in 2017's best-performing Dow component Apple by a third, to 300,000 shares, and trimmed Facebook by 12.6%, to 1.9 million shares in Q1, according to filings from Friday. The company also scooped up 100,000 shares of Snap, which tanked 17.5% last week on a dismal debut earnings reports following its March IPO.Similarly, Third Point exited its 1.85 million-share stake in Apple during Q1, while buying 2.25 million shares of Snap.Shares of Berkshire closed up 0.3% at 163.76 on the stock market today. Apple dipped 0.3%, down from Friday's fresh record high, and Snap rallied 8.4%, after last week's plunge. Facebook eased 0.1%, and IBM added 0.7%.Among Appaloosa's other notable moves, the fund entirely liquidated its massive stakes in two troubled stocks: chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) and retailer J.C. Penney (JCP).Appaloosa added a 1.6 million-share stake in Symantec (SYMC), which was leading a cybersecurity stock rally Monday on the heels of a global ransomware attack. Appaloosa also raised its Western Digital (WDC) stake by 16.1% to 1.3 million shares.But the hedge fund's biggest bet seems to be on an American industrial renaissance. It opened positions of roughly half a million shares each in AK Steel (AKS) and Nucor (NUE), while upping ArcelorMittal (MT) by more than 410%, to nearly 5 million shares.Other hefty new positions included Bank of America (BAC) and CBS (CBS) (8.8 million and 1.0 million shares, respectively).Third Point's other moves include adding to positions in T-Mobile (TMUS), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).The fund closed a small stake in Goldman Sachs (GS), and reduced holdings in Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Late Friday, Trian Fund Management also disclosed bigger positions in General Electric (GE) and Procter & Gamble (PG) and a smaller stake in DuPont (DD).RELATED:What Will Berkshire Filing Show As Loeb Cuts Facebook, Apple Stakes?Why Buffett Still Isn't Sure If He'd Buy Amazon, Alphabet Stock Now

145,NUE,"The stock market rally cooled off a bit as investors examined a President Trump plan to cut taxes. The Dow Jones industrial average, fresh from rising nearly 1.1% on both the first two days of the current trading week, sank 0.1% in late trading Wednesday. market today.The Nasdaq composite, NYSE composite and S&P 500 also edged a tad lower. Volume was mildly higher on the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday and slightly lower on the Nasdaq. The 30-component Dow Jones industrial average, at 20,974, is now up 6.1% year to date. That trails the Nasdaq's 12% gain, but is ahead of the Russell 2000, which rallied 0.6% late Wednesday but trails with a 4.5% gain since Jan. 1.In the 30-stock Dow, at least three names gained 1 point or more, including Travelers (TRV) and United Technologies (UTX). The latter, up more than 8% past a 109.52 cup-with-handle breakout point, reported thin gains in Q1 earnings and revenue.Go to a weekly chart of United Tech, and you'll see that the stock can also be seen as still forming an aircraft carrier-sized saucer base stretching to its February 2015 peak of 124.45.From that perspective, one could argue that another handle formed on this extremely long base with an additional buy point of 114.54, 10 cents above the March 1 intraday high.United Tech CEO Gregory Hayes noted that all four main businesses saw top-line growth, driven by 3 percentage points of organic growth and 1 point of net acquisition growth, offset by a 1% drop related to currency flows. Otis brand elevator and related equipment orders rose 11% excluding China.Amid the selling carnage seen in U.S. Steel (X) shares following its poor quarterly revenue, the steel sector actually does not look so bad when viewed through the prism of U.S. Steel's more highly rated rivals, Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD).Both of these stocks rebounded sharply off intraday lows and kept their heads above the 50-day moving average. This is key, as IBD research of the best stock market winners over the past century shows that a true market leader trades above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages ahead of a possible breakout from a well-formed historical chart pattern, including the cup-with-handle, the double-bottom and the flat base.Nucor, up 2% to 62.15, is less than 9% below a recent high of 68 and is building a new base. The RS Rating of 71 is below the ideal minimum of 80 on a scale of 1 to 99, but it's moved up from 51 just two weeks ago.Last week, Nucor posted a 304% leap in first-quarter earnings to $1.13 a share, its biggest year-over-year increase in more than four years, as revenue accelerated 30% higher to $4.82 billion. Nucor's after-tax margin soared to 7.5% vs. 2.4% in the year-ago quarter.Steel Dynamics on April 19 posted a fifth quarter in a row of excellent profit growth, with EPS rising 215% to 82 cents on a 36% gain on the top line to $2.37 billion. That was the highest quarterly sales since the fourth quarter of 2014. Steel Dynamics is fashioning a new base that shows many jagged edges — one of the telltale signs of investing in commodity-linked companies. In many cases, the right time to buy such a stock is not at the primary breakout but possibly during the first pullback following the breakout.Elsewhere in the market, keep an eye on top names in the gaming industry. IBD's Leisure-Gaming group has trampolined up to 24th from 80th six weeks ago, as seen in IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups based on six-month relative price performance.Watch for Las Vegas Sands' (LVS) first-quarter results after the market close on Wednesday. The Street sees earnings rising 38% to 62 cents a share, which would be the best bottom-line result since a 78% jump in the third quarter of 2013.The stock, up 1.5% on Wednesday in strong turnover, is fashioning the right side of a potential new saucer base with a 63.38 high. For now, the base shows a 63.48 entry.Sands' arch rival Wynn Resorts (WYNN) saw a 3.5% drop in Q1 revenue from its Macau-related business. That was offset by a 6% rise in revenue from its Las Vegas casino hotels.Wynn shows a better RS Rating than Sands at 85 vs. 64, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. Meanwhile, eight other companies in the gaming group boast an RS rating of 90 or higher and trade at least 10 a share.

146,NUE,"XSteel stocks got off to a hot start on Thursday on the strength of earnings reports and a promising publicity blitz from the White House.Nucor (NUE) reported solid earnings before the open after Steel Dynamics (STLD) reported results after Wednesday's close. Meanwhile, steel industry CEOs met with President Trump, who signed an executive order asking for a quick investigation into whether imports of steel are hurting national security.The order would potentially pave the way for protectionist measures under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.Nucor gapped up 4.7%, and Steel Dynamics jumped 6.8% on the stock market today. Meanwhile, U.S. Steel (X) surged 7.35%, and AK Steel (AKS) added 8.6%.Both Nucor and Steel Dynamics had preannounced strong earnings in mid-March, so investors may have cared less about Q1 results than about the positive things both companies had to say about business trends early in Q2.IBD'S TAKE: Even as the stock market uptrend is under pressure, Starbucks just broke above a four-month trading range. Current market conditions call for investors to exercise extra caution when buying stocks and being quick to limit downside losses. Make sure to read IBD's The Big Picture everyday to stay on top of the market's trend.Nucor earned $1.11 per share, within its preannounced range of $1.10-$1.15 and up from 27 cents a year ago. Revenue of $4.82 billion was up 22% and topped estimates of $4.63 billion.Steel Dynamics earned 82 cents a share, above the guidance of 77 to 81 cents issued on March 17 and up from 26 cents a year ago. Revenue jumped 36% to $2.37 billion vs. estimates of $2.21 billion.Nucor said it expects sequential improvement in earnings as higher contract prices take effect and improved weather lifts nonresidential construction.The company noted trade cases involving cut-to-length plate, steel concrete reinforcing bar (rebar) and steel wire rod are in progress and are ""helping to stop the flood of dumped and subsidized products from foreign producers.""Steel Dynamics expects steady North American automotive steel consumption and growth in the construction sector, especially for larger, public sector infrastructure projects. It also noted strengthening in energy sector demand.In late February, Nucor, Steel Dynamics and U.S. Steel all appeared headed for their second breakout since President Trump's surprise election win, but the stocks retreated below their 50-day lines amid growing doubts about his big infrastructure and tax cut plans.RELATED:Stocks Rally On Earnings; Starbucks Breaks Out; Why Apple Is On The MoveSteel Stocks Rise Amid Commerce Department's Dumping FindingsSteel, Mining Stocks Face Unusual Element Of Technical StressA Second Top Steel Maker In 2 Days Just Gave Blowout Earnings Guidance

147,NUE,"Shares of mining and steelmaker stocks are tumbling Wednesday as the price of iron ore suffered its worst one-day loss in more than a year amid concerns about waning Chinese demand and doubts about President Trump's infrastructure plans and other pro-growth initiatives. U.S. Steel (X) suffered its worst one-day loss in 11 months.The benchmark 62% iron ore index sank 8.5% to $68.04 per tonne, according to Metal Bulletin, its biggest decline since March 2016. The 58% premium index is down 3.7% to $59.61 per tonne.Miners Vale (VALE) sank 4.6% in the stock market today. BHP Billiton (BHP) retreated 4.7% a day after retaking its 50-day moving average. Rio Tinto (RIO) lost 5.2% and Teck Resources (TECK) 5.5%.U.S. Steel plunged 10% to 31.26, threatening to post its worst close since late November.Among other steel stocks, Nucor (NUE) fell 4.3% and Steel Dynamics (STLD) 3.8%.U.S. Steel, Nucor and Steel Dynamics were market leaders on Tuesday, but still closed the session below their 50-day lines.IBD's Steel-Producers rank 14th out of 197 groups tracked by IBD, but is the worst-performing industry so far today.IBD's TAKE: Steel stocks have benefited from talk of action on President Trump's infrastructure plans, as well as Commerce Department findings that steel producers from eight countries are dumping carbon and alloy steel plate imports in the U.S. But shares fell Monday on news that was a dud.IBD's Mining-Metal Ores group ranks 19th but was Wednesday's second-worst performer.RELATED:Why These 2 Mining Giants Are Standouts TodayFreeport-McMoRan Restarts Huge Mine; Rival Miners Dive

148,NUE,"President Trump reportedly plans to sign an executive order targeting ""unfair"" product dumping in the U.S. by foreign competitors, with steel and aluminum among the expected areas of focus.Axios called the news ""potentially explosive,"" but it didn't do much to excite steel stock investors. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite eked out wafer-thin gains on the stock market today, but steel stocks were in the red.Nucor (NUE) lost 1.1%, U.S. Steel (X) 0.4%, Steel Dynamics (STLD) 1.4% and AK Steel (AKS), whose shares have been volatile amid takeover chatter, tumbled 8%. Aluminum giant Alcoa (AA) slid 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market is at a potentially key turning point, with the current uptrend under pressure. The current trend means investors should take extra caution in buying stocks and be quick to cut losses. Make sure to read The Big Picture each day to see whether the underlying uptrend remains intact. Metal stocks initially soared after the election on expectations for more infrastructure spending, protectionist measures to curb steel imports and raise domestic steel prices, and a lower corporate tax rate.Apart from AK Steel, the stocks are moving sideways, forming constructive bases. But for now, at least, steel investors are awaiting a near-term catalyst, and the latest protectionist signals don't seem to be it.RELATED:Steel Stocks Rise Amid Commerce Department's Dumping FindingsA Second Top Steel Maker In 2 Days Just Gave Blowout Earnings GuidanceSteel Stocks Rebound On Trump Infrastructure Plans, M&A TalkChina's Chronic Smog Is A Breath Of Fresh Air For U.S. Steel Makers

150,NUE,"XAfter two days of strong gains, the stock market took a more reserved approach early Wednesday as it advanced with modest gains. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average moved up 0.1% each, while the Nasdaq inched slightly lower. More details about President Trump's tax-cut plan are expected this afternoon. Among the Dow industrials, Travelers (TRV)and United Technologies (UTX) rose 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively, in the stock market today.

Shares of the airplane maker are extended from a 160.17 flat-base entry, but are forming a new flat base with a potential 185.81 entry. Chipotle (CMG) continued its recent string of gains after exceeding the Street's Q1 earnings and revenue targets.

The stock broke out of a cup with handle with a 49.57 entry on Monday. Competitor Western Digital (WDC) dropped 2.9%, but remains about 3% above an 81.77 flat-base entry.U.S. Steel's (X) surprise Q1 loss late Tuesday caused its shares to plummet more than 25%, creating a brief ripple effect throughout the industry. Fellow steelmakers Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) fell in unison in early trading, but recovered to move slightly higher. Earnings releases were not particularly kind to leading growth stocks on Wednesday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Evercore Partners (EVR), PRA Health Sciences (PRAH), and Mercury Systems (MRCY) all fell after their quarterly earnings reports.Macom dropped 6.7%, triggering the 8%-loss-cutting sell signal from a 52.32 cup-with-handle entry.

154,NUE,"The market for nonresidential construction in the U.S. may be heading for a sharp improvement over the next year based on trends ranging from architectural billings to steel demand, even though recent activity presents a mixed picture.The latest government data show that nonresidential construction spending dipped in August from a month earlier. Year-over-year it rose, though, and economists point to certain metrics that portend a further lift in spending in 2015.The expected increase applies not only to sectors that have already seen a rise in spending, such as retail and office, but also to sectors that have been in a slump, including education and health care.A variety of stocks could benefit from an uptick in nonresidential construction. These range from commercial/industrial construction companies such as Fluor (FLR) and KBR (KBR) to suppliers of construction equipment like United Rentals (URI), Terex (TEX) and Manitowoc (MTW) and steel producers like Nucor (NUE).One of the metrics analysts and economists are watching is the Architectural Billings Index, a measure of design activity and future construction that has reached multiyear highs in recent months.Architects Show OptimismOn Oct. 22, the American Institute of Architects reported that the September score was 55.2, up from 53.0 the month before and 53.8 a year earlier. It was the second-highest reading in over seven years, just behind July's reading of 55.8. A score above 50 indicates an increase in billings. This typically leads to a rise in construction of nonresidential projects.Kermit Baker, the AIA's chief economist, says the third-quarter numbers ""are the strongest we've seen since before the downturn.""""Design activity is very highly correlated with construction activity,"" he told IBD, adding that it usually takes nine to 12 months to translate into land-clearing for construction.The lag means ""you might not see an immediate impact on steel demand,"" Morningstar steel-stocks analyst Andrew Lane told IBD. ""But it's another bullish indicator for the industry.""In its third-quarter earnings release, Charlotte, N.C.-based steel maker Nucor said its fabricated construction products businesses (rebar fabrication, joist and decking and pre-engineered metal buildings) spurred ""much stronger profits"" than in the second quarter.""This performance reflects improving conditions in the nonresidential construction markets,"" Nucor said, though those markets ""remain at historically low levels.""Most recent government nonresidential construction numbers show a market still struggling to find its footing after a prolonged downturn.Census Bureau data show that nonresidential construction spending in August fell 1.2% monthly but rose 6% vs. a year ago. September data are due Nov. 3.Seven of 16 nonresidential construction sectors saw spending rise in August. These included office, up 1.1% sequentially and 18.9% year-over-year; manufacturing, up 1.7% and 14.5%, respectively; and lodging, up 0.9% and 10.2%, respectively. Commercial construction, including retail, fell 3.1% on a monthly basis but rose 9.4% year-over-year.The uptick in office-related construction ""comes as no surprise,"" said Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, an industry trade group. That's because job growth ""has accelerated, particularly in office-type jobs"" such as professional services.""Over the past year we've seen solid growth in office space-related construction, measured in dollar volume,"" Basu told IBD.Houston, Seattle And San JoseHe calls Houston, Seattle and San Jose, Calif., ""standout performers"" in this segment, thanks mainly to growth in energy (Houston) and tech (Seattle, San Jose) industries. The retail sector has benefited from ""interaction between expanding consumer expenditures and the need to protect market share from online retailers,"" Basu said.""One way for shopping centers to compete with online retail is to improve the shopping experience and convince people to get off their computers and actually go out to shop,"" he added. ""So you see shopping centers investing in the construction of grocery stores or movie theaters to lure people in.""Among sectors that saw a slowdown in construction spending in August were health care, down 0.6% monthly and 6.6% year-over-year; and education, down 2% monthly but up 1.9% year-over-year. The numbers should improve in coming months, observers say.Why Education Is ImportantThe AIA's Baker notes that there have been four straight months of gains in institutional billings, a sector that is mostly made up of education and health care but also includes cultural, religious, correctional and sports facilities.""That was the sector that had not recovered much, but there's a lot more confidence that we will see an upturn in institutional next year,"" Baker said. ""We are encouraged that there have been four months of upturn, and that the numbers have been accelerating.""A rise in construction of education facilities would provide a particularly big boost to nonresidential construction because it's one of the industry's biggest sectors.Education was hit hard by the recession and housing crisis. As property values fell, so did property taxes that finance construction of public schools. But as property values go up there will be more money to spend on schools.Another trend that may help educational facility construction comes from colleges and universities.""Many universities are trying to improve the standard of living in the wake of lower enrollment,"" Basu said. ""This has led to plans to improve the quality of both on- and off-campus housing.""Meanwhile, the health care sector might see a rise in construction as hospital operators grow more comfortable with ObamaCare.""Hospitals took a time out on major construction because they wanted to see the impact of the Affordable Care Act,"" Basu said. ""One of the positive aspects of the ACA is that the level of uncompensated care has fallen. All other things being equal, this improves the finances at hospitals. And anything that improves the finances improves the construction outlook.""

"
211,NUE,"Steel stocks rebounded Tuesday after sliding Monday with the broader market on news of falling scrap prices. The catalyst may have been news reports that the White House is considering quicker action on President Trump's trillion-dollar national infrastructure plan.While markets were higher across the board, with the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all up modestly on the stock market today, Trump-related infrastructure stocks were outperforming.Among steel makers, Tenaris (TS) jumped 4.9%, AK Steel (AKS) rose 3.2%, Nucor (NUE) 1.2%, Steel Dynamics (STLD) 2.8% and U.S. Steel (X) 2.8%.Materials and construction equipment stocks also got a lift, with Vulcan Materials (VMC) up 1.9%, Martin Marietta (MLM) 1.4% and Caterpillar (CAT) 1.6%.The outsize gain for AK Steel, whose shares had sunk 36% from a multiyear high set in early January, came amid speculation that the slumping steel maker may be a takeover target.Last week, JPMorgan analyst Mike Gambardella raised his price targets on AK Steel, Nucor, Steel Dynamics and U.S. Steel amid expectations of stronger earnings growth and earnings preannouncements from Nucor and Steel Dynamics. His thesis: Steel-sheet imports are headed lower thanks to trade enforcement. Along with ""continued domestic producer supply discipline,"" that will help support steel prices in the U.S.But Morgan Stanley analyst Evan Kurtz said in Monday research note that East Coast steel-scrap prices had fallen $30 a ton, a negative sign for demand. IBD'S TAKE: The quick and sudden flop of RyanCare proved that President Trump knows how to cut losses. Expect him to do the same with deficit-neutral tax reform and quickly shift to old-fashioned, deficit-increasing tax cuts.M&A could be a positive for the entire sector if it reinforces supply discipline, and the Trump administration might be more amenable to steel industry mergers than the Obama administration.While prospects for Trump's infrastructure plan remain unclear, Axios reported that the White House is thinking about packaging its building program with tax cuts this year. There had been talk that infrastructure funding legislation could slip to 2018.RELATED:A Second Top Steel Maker In 2 Days Just Gave Blowout Earnings GuidanceThis Top Steel Stock Is Near A Buy Point On Huge Earnings GuidanceTrump's Big Speech Leaves Investors With Hope, Not Much Else

215,NUE,"XSteel Dynamics (STLD) became the second steel maker in two days to issue bullish earnings guidance after Nucor (NUE) also ramped up targets. But for the second straight day, other steel stocks didn't benefit.First-quarter earnings should be 77-81 cents per share, Steel Dynamics said Friday. Analysts had expected 66 cents. The company earned 26 cents a year earlier.Steel Dynamics also hiked its quarterly dividend by 11% to 15.5 cents per share.""The company continues to believe that current and anticipated macroeconomic and market conditions are in place to benefit the domestic steel industry in the coming year,"" Steel Dynamics said in a statement. ""The construction and automotive sectors remain strong, and the energy sector has begun to strengthen.""Steel Dynamics stock jumped 2.6% to 36.34 on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average. The stock, which has a potential buy point of 40.27, rose to 37.70 intraday.Nucor rose 0.2% to 64.72 but well off intraday highs of 65.83. It was the second straight day that Nucor briefly crossed a 65.50 buy point.On Thursday, Nucor forecast Q1 EPS of $1.10-$1.15, well above forecasts at the time for 83 cents. Nucor earned 22 cents a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters. Nucor shares rose 1.8% to 64.60 that day after rising intraday to 66.

216,NUE,"Nucor (NUE) sparked higher on Thursday after the steel maker forecast massive gains in first-quarter earnings-per-share, joining U.S. Steel (X) in offering a better outlook for market conditions. But Nucor's strong advance melted in the afternoon, while U.S. Steel and other rivals didn't join the advance.The IBD Leaderboard member rose 1.8% to 64.60 on the stock market today, fading into the close. Earlier, Nucor rose as high as 66, briefly clearing a 65.60 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. Nucor rose 4.5% on Wednesday, rebounding from its 50-day line.Nucor expects first-quarter EPS of $1.10 to $1.15, with the improvement from Q4 largely led by better results from its steel mills. Nucor earned 22 cents a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters. Analysts expected 83 cents per share during the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.""We are encouraged by the renewed growth in demand we are seeing in both the nonresidential construction and energy markets,"" Nucor said in a statement. ""The heavy equipment markets remain weak. The automotive markets remain strong.""IBD'S TAKE: Infrastructure plays have risen recently after President Trump vowed to spend ""big"" on things like roads and bridges, although stocks could slide if plans are delayed or altered as they make their way through Congress.Steel stocks surged following the election on the hopes that President Trump's infrastructure plans and economic protectionism would boost steel demand and prices.Nucor on Thursday noted that imports ""continue to impact the U.S. steel industry."" But it said recent trade cases ""are helping to stop the flood of dumped and subsidized products from foreign producers, and are making sure that we can compete on a level-playing field.""But for Thursday, at least, Nucor's forecast wasn't helping other steel plays, which had strong gains on Wednesday. U.S. Steel dipped 1% after surging 5.4% on Wednesday, rebounding off its 50-day line.Steel Dynamics (STLD) slipped 0.6%, reversing lower after retaking its 50-day line in the morning. Steel Dynamics rose 2.9% on Wednesday.Global steel giant ArcelorMittal (MT) lost 0.8% following Wednesday's 5.9% jump.Even as steel makers are reporting better results, U.S. Steel, in reporting fourth-quarter earnings in January, cautioned that the path ahead could be rough.""While we will benefit from improved market conditions, they continue to be volatile and we must remain focused on improving the things that we can control,"" U.S. Steel CEO Mario Longhi said in a statement at that time.RELATED:Donald Trump: A Man Of Steel?

217,NUE,"Stocks expanded their midday gains Wednesday after the Federal Reserve, as expected, hiked short-term interest rates by a quarter-point but hinted that it would continue to act prudently before engaging in further increases in the cost of money.Meanwhile, oil stocks got a much needed lift after getting slammed in recent days as crude oil futures rallied. West Texas Intermediate futures rose more than 2%, to $48.79 a barrel. Meanwhile, the metals, medical, heavy industrial and transport sectors also showed resilience.For instance, airline industry leader Southwest Air (LUV) is halting a seven-session losing streak and reversed off its lows, with a 2% gain, to 53.90, in fast turnover. Watch to see if the consumer- and business-spending play can climb back above its 50-day moving average. Shares are still up 8% year to date, better than the S&P 500's roughly 6% advance. Randgold Resources (GOLD) surged 3.3%, to 86.97, and is trying to retake its 50-day line. AngloGold Ashanti (AU) jumped 7.1%, to 10.54, but remains far depressed from its 52-week highs.Meanwhile, in the steel sector, Leaderboard name and industry top dog Nucor (NUE) rallied more than 3%, to 62.72, in low volume; watch to see if it can keep climbing and pierce through the top of its three-week handle with a 65.50 buy point.Nucor is seen growing Q1 profit by 230%, to 76 cents a share. Earnings have rebounded 28%, 43%, 144% and 63% vs. year-ago levels in the prior four quarters. A fifth sector, banking, is also regaining some lost ground; Bank of New York Mellon (BK) rose 0.6%, to 48.56, and is close to surpassing a 48.88 buy point within a nine-week cup-with-handle pattern.Small-cap issues are leading the stock market today with the Russell 2000 up 1.2%, vs. a 0.6% lift by the Nasdaq composite and 0.7% for the S&P 500.The Dow Jones industrials lagged, up 0.4%, but at least five of the 30 components rose at least 1 point or more, including Caterpillar (CAT), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and United Technologies (UTX).  J&J has cleared a 122.60 early buy point within its long saucer construction. The left-side high of 126.07 also offers an entry point at 10 cents above that price.J&J has now risen slightly more than 5% past the early buy point. Be sure not to chase breakout stocks more than 5% past the proper entry. The reason: often a stock will pull back and try to shake out weak holders as it test support at or near the proper entry. IBD founder Bill O'Neil's study of the greatest market winners found that rarely does a leading stock market winner fall more than 7%-8% below the proper buy point in a cup, double bottom, flat base or other bullish pattern before a stock charges to new highs.Notice how, on the weekly chart, in six straight prior up weeks, J&J rose in above-average turnover in five of those weeks. That bodes well for the diversified medical products giant as it indicates surging demand for shares by mutual funds, hedge funds, insurers, banks and the like. J&J's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is now a sprightly A-; the proprietary grade goes from E (heavy distribution) to A+ (heavy accumulation).J&J's 66 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 relects the big cap's long basing action and is sharply improved from as low as 26 just eight weeks ago. Among small and mid-cap names, focus on those with RS ratings of 80 or higher before they break out.Even with the move by the Fed to increase the fed funds rate to a 0.75%-1% target range, observers applauded the U.S. central bank's decision to maintain a careful and gradual approach to ""normalizing"" the bond markets.""The weaker dollar itself is a reflection of the Fed's policy path,"" Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, told IBD. ""Markets see the Fed keeping a lid on the dollar and providing a bid for U.S. exporters, commodities and emerging markets.""The U.S. dollar fell against both the euro and the Japanese yen.In the meantime, keep an eye out for the reaction by European equity markets on Wednesday's Dutch elections, which are being perceived as a test of Europeans' tolerance of immigrants, particularly from the Middle East. The Dutch elections could also have ramifications for the future of the eurozone. In June last year, Britons shocked the world by voting to leave the single-currency region.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Should You Sell These 7 Dow Industrials Components Now?How To Invest: Why The Base-On-Base Pattern Makes Money For InvestorsThe Top Market Sectors Today: See IBD's Smart Research Tables

On Tuesday, the Dow industrials slipped 0.1% to end a string of 12 straight gains, while the S&P 500 index dipped 0.3%, the Nasdaq composite 0.6% and the small-cap Russell 2000 1.5%.If Trump is right that the stock market's impressive rise since his election has been driven by his policies, then what he didn't say in his speech matters a whole lot more than anything he did say. (Some of Wednesday's early gains may reflect shifting views and Treasury yields regarding a possible Federal Reserve rate hike at the March 14-15 meeting.)He didn't say how he would pay for or when he would advance his trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, a potential boon to Caterpillar (CAT), steel makers like U.S. Steel (X) and Nucor (NUE), engineering and construction firms like Fluor (FLR) and construction aggregates suppliers like Vulcan Materials (VMC). Could last week's report that the plan will be delayed until 2018 be true? Not clear, but there's more reason to think so after Tuesday night.However, Nucor, U.S. Steel, Vulcan Materials, Caterpillar and Fluor were up 2%-3% in morning action.In any event, there appears to be a logjam of contentious issues blocking the road to more spending on highways and bridges. Trump managed to successfully turn the page after a rocky first five weeks in office in part because he stayed above the fray, declining to take any clear positions on the two issues that could largely determine whether his economic agenda rises or falls: ObamaCare and tax reform.Now he's about to enter a potentially hazardous stretch of his presidency in which he'll have to take firm policy stands that may divide his narrow governing majority in the Senate.On ObamaCare, the issue that Trump said must be addressed before tax reform, the clock is ticking for him to come up with a replacement that can unify Republicans, something that has proved impossible in the seven years since the law's passage. Humana (HUM) has already said it will exit the exchanges in 2018, while Aetna (AET) and Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) have one foot out the door, and Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH) won't commit to sticking around.Shares of UnitedHealth and other health insurers rose 1%-2% intraday.Come April, if Republicans haven't gotten their ducks in a row, insurers faced with setting premiums for 2018 will be in full panic mode and may start to pull the plug on their participation in the exchanges, leaving swaths of the country with no insurers for 2018.IBD'S TAKE: Despite growing doubts about the timing and size of President Trump's tax and spending stimulus plans, markets are pricing in higher odds of the Federal Reserve hiking rates again as early as this month. Tax reform doesn't look to be any easier. Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% or 20%, but the House proposal for doing so depends on raising $1 trillion with a 20% tax on imports that's being fought by Wal-Mart (WMT) and the entire retail sector. Now General Motors (GM) is calling the tax ""problematic,"" and a growing number of GOP senators oppose the idea.Trump stuck to vague generalities in his speech, saying, ""We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers.""Who would oppose that? It's only when he arrives at a plan to pay for it — if not with a border tax then by taking away valued corporate tax subsidies — that the effort will turn into a mud fight.Trump is off to a slow start in clarifying how he will put his economic agenda into action. That's not surprising, because his agenda tackles major problems that have long defied solutions, but it should make investors nervous, regardless of what Trump said last night.RELATED:

228,NUE,"Shares of U.S. Steel (X), AK Steel (AKS) and other American steel producers climbed Friday after the U.S. International Trade Commission voted to impose antidumping duties on steel imports from seven countries, a report said.The commission will impose duties on India, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine and Vietnam. But it exempted the Philippines and Thailand, Reuters said.U.S. steelmakers complained to federal officials in 2013 that cheap imports were driving down prices as imports of pipes used by the oil and natural gas industry surged on the shale oil fracking boom.The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) said this May that cheap steel imports were putting 500,000 U.S. jobs at risk.""The U.S. steel industry is facing its worst import crisis in more than a decade,"" the nonprofit think tank said, adding that in the aftermath of the Great Recession, ""the open and large U.S. market became the prime target for the massive excess supply stemming from this excess capacity.""The EPI estimated that global excess steel capacity had reached 500 million metric tons, more than twice the volume of excess capacity in the last steel import crisis, which followed the Asian financial crisis more than a decade ago.U.S. Steel shares were up 2.3% in midafternoon trading on the stock market today, Friday.The Pittsburgh-based steel producer has an 89 IBD Composite Rating, which means that its stock has outperformed 89% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.AK Steel has also seen strong growth recently as U.S. manufacturers continue to recover.

229,NUE,"Accountability often comes with a stigma: You're to blame if something goes wrong. That's not how it should work. It's about making sure that people follow up. ""It's really talking about, 'Can I count on you?'"" said Greg Bustin, a Dallas-based management consultant.Here's how to make sure that you can count on your staff.• Define. Set your firm's values so that staffers are clear about what's important. Then they'll know to always be honest, on time or helpful to customers. Bustin, who wrote the book ""Accountability: The Key to Driving a High-Performance Culture,"" worked with one company that valued integrity, but its meetings started 15 minutes late. ""You can't have values that you don't treat as values,"" he told IBD. ""That's where it all starts.""• Be clear. Tell people exactly what you expect from them. Doing so builds confidence in them, Bustin says, because they know what their goal is and how to get there. The leader's job is to set the expectations. ""It's really hard to hold someone accountable if they don't know what to do,"" he said.• Change your thoughts. Accountability is a way of thinking, says Linda Galindo, a Park City, Utah-based accountability expert who co-wrote ""Where Winners Live: Sell More, Earn More, Achieve More Through Personal Accountability.""Be accountable by taking ownership of the results before you start a task. You'll know that you're responsible for the outcome.• Take charge. You'll always have excuses. Maybe the weather slowed deliveries or your vendors fell behind, but it's still your job to get things done. Think ahead about what can fail; anticipate solutions before you need them. ""Take ownership for all of it, even if you can't control it,"" Galindo said.• Measure. Track your progress, Bustin says. Steel maker Nucor (NUE) stays on top of safety, quality and output metrics, and posts them so workers know where they stand in those areas. ""Tell people, 'We're not tracking to punish you; we're tracking so we can make better decisions,'"" Bustin said.• Set boundaries. You need rules for those who fail to perform up to snuff, Galindo says.If someone is late to a meeting, explain why punctuality is important and say that you'll trust him to make it promptly next time. Take action if it continues. That'll get others to sharpen up.""You absolutely want the culture to be such that people show up on time anyway,"" she said.• Be fair. When you have to dish out punishment, handle the task objectively. Even if your best salesperson is easily beating monthly goals, if he keeps getting reports in late, tell him that you'll reject them next time. If it keeps up, be prepared to let him leave.This approach includes managers. ""You want to get people to not compare themselves to others in how they're punished,"" Galindo said. Treating them all the same will help them avoid comparisons.• Reward. Nudge people toward being accountable for doing what they said by rewarding them. Nucor pays for performance with a system that shows its staff what success looks like, Bustin said: ""Then people understand, 'Here's what it means to me.'""• Find the payoff. Show others how important it is that they live up to what they say, Galindo says. Spell out how much their ability to be accountable adds to results.• Share the power. The boss needn't do all the enforcing. Peers can do it too, Bustin said: ""If someone is in position to hold a colleague accountable, that's a lot more powerful"" than a boss doing it.

Dow component Caterpillar closed 2% higher, U.S. Steel rallied 2.5%, Nucor (NUE) rose 2.3%, construction and engineering giant Fluor (FLR) added 2.2%, Vulcan Materials gained 3.1% and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) rose 2.9%.Caterpillar, U.S. Steel and other infrastructure stocks were big winners after the presidential election, but have been up and down in recent weeks, looking for clarity about what Trump will do, and when.IBD'S TAKE: A big boost in federal infrastructure spending would be huge for infrastructure stocks, but here's why construction industry CEOs are bullish about their outlook even if President Trump doesn't come through.""The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding,"" Trump said, though exactly what ""time"" he has in mind for legislation is unclear.

243,NUE,"Steel maker Nucor (NUE) is tentatively moving forward with plans for an automotive steel plant in Mexico as it awaits clarity on President Trump's promised tax cuts and threatened border taxes.""We still expect it to be in Mexico, but we'll watch that,"" Nucor CEO John Ferriola told analysts on Jan. 30 about the $270 million plant that his firm is scheduled to break ground on this summer with its joint-venture partner, Japanese steel maker JFE Holding. ""When and if something changes and we have some definitive direction that says that's not the place to put it, we do have options and we will work and will follow with one of those options.""Similarly, BMW and Toyota (TM) have said they'll follow through on plans for new factories in Mexico, and General Motors (GM) has said it won't alter its production plans despite getting heat from a Trump tweet over some of its Cruze hatchbacks being built south of the border. (Ford Motor (F) did cancel plans to build a Mexico plant, but that appears to reflect declining U.S. demand for small cars rather than Ford bending to Trump's will.)Chipmaker CTS Corp. (CTS) told analysts on Tuesday that it is on track to shift production from Elkhart, Ind., where about 230 workers are employed, to other ""best cost"" locations outside the U.S. by 2018.Other companies sticking to their plans include Caterpillar (CAT), which is shifting some jobs from Joliet, Ill., to Mexico, and Rexnord (RXN), which is closing an Indiana ball-bearings facility that employs 350 and shifting production to Mexico, according to a Wall Street Journal report.Trump, with the help of some tax incentives from Indiana, did manage to convince United Technologies (UTX) to keep open a Carrier air-conditioning plant slated for closure, saving about 800 of nearly 2,000 jobs that appeared to be headed to Mexico. But concerns over jeopardizing valuable defense contracts may have made United Tech especially open to a face-saving deal.The broader point is that Trump's plans to grow U.S. manufacturing employment look unlikely to gain traction while so much uncertainty remains about the tax carrots and sticks he wants to use to shift corporate incentives. The bully pulpit, by itself, can't accomplish much.IBD'S TAKE: The controversial GOP border-tax plan may be the only way President Trump can deliver a big corporate tax cut.It's not surprising that companies would move ahead with plans hatched prior to Trump's election. Yet there's risk that a drawn-out debate over tax reform, including a debate over the House proposal for a 20% border tax, could freeze future investment plans as companies wait for clarity.If questions grow over whether Trump can deliver on his promised corporate tax cut, the burst of economic enthusiasm now showing up in the Institute of Supply Management gauge of factory activity and other sentiment gauges could turn into a letdown.Even as the Dow Jones industrial average is holding above 20,000, the rise in gold prices to nearly a three-month high and the drop in the 10-year Treasury yield close to a two-month low are signs that big investors are hedging their bets over what Trump will be able to accomplish.RELATED:Why Tax Reform Could End In Tears For Trump And GOPTreasury Might Write Checks To Boeing Under GOP Tax Reform

244,NUE,"Steel makers, materials firms and other infrastructure-related stocks sold off Thursday on a report that President Trump could delay a big infrastructure spending bill until 2018.Trump has vowed huge spending on roads, airports and other projects, lifting the likes of U.S. Steel (X), Martin Marietta (MLM), BHP Billiton (BHP) and Dow industrials component Caterpillar (CAT), as well as copper and iron prices.But with a busy legislative agenda that includes corporate tax reform and ObamaCare repeal-and-replace, the Trump administration is mulling pushing infrastructure into 2018, Axios reported. One upside, GOP strategists say, is that debating the bill in the 2018 election year will make it easier to pass, as Democrats won't want to be seen opposing major projects and jobs in their districts and unions giving their support.Passing an infrastructure bill in 2018 would likely mean that spending starts in 2019, ramping up over time. That's a long time for companies and investors to wait for a payoff.U.S. Steel tumbled 7.85% on the stock market today, breaking below a recent buy point and approaching its 50-day line.

"
245,NUE,"Steel Dynamics is on a roll, thanks to renewed demand for steel and its plan for a transformational acquisition that would expand its presence in the southern U.S., bolster its production capacity and broaden its exposure to growth industries.The Fort Wayne, Ind.-based steel maker and metal recycler on July 21 said it would buy Mississippi-based Severstal Columbus from OAO Severstal in a $1.63 billion deal. If the cash acquisition closes late this year as planned, Steel Dynamics (STLD) says, its annual steel shipping capacity will increase by 40% in 2015, to 11 million tons. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings.The deal would provide Steel Dynamics a bigger presence in the lucrative energy and automotive industries, as the Severstal Columbus mill produces steel in demand by those sectors. Domestic oil and natural gas production has been strong in Texas and neighboring states in the South, analysts say, boosting demand for steel used to build equipment for that sector.Auto sales nationwide, meanwhile, have been solid in 2014. The annualized selling rate of 16.48 million autos in July represented a notable jump from 15.76 million a year earlier, according to Autodata, lifting demand for steel used to build cars and trucks.""Those two industries have been the main drivers of demand for domestic steel, so that should continue to drive growth"" for Steel Dynamics, said Andrew Lane, a Morningstar analyst who covers several steel producers.Steel Dynamics' stock is up about 25% since the trading day before the acquisition announcement. ""Investors welcomed the deal,"" Lane said, ""and I think it makes a lot of sense for them.""The acquisition aside, Steel Dynamics is on solid footing, Lane says. The company in July reported strong second-quarter results that reflected a broad recovery in domestic demand for steel and lower costs for raw materials used to produce steel, he says, both of which are favorable trends that are expected to continue.Steel Dynamics reported second-quarter net income of $72 million, or 31 cents per diluted share. It marked a rise in net income of $34 million from the first quarter, when results were hampered by harsh winter weather, and a jump of $43 million from a year earlier. Second-quarter net sales of $2.1 billion were up 13% and 15%, respectively, from the first quarter and from a year earlier. Raw material prices decreased, the company said, boosting operating income by $51 million from the first quarter, to $132 million.Demand RecoversCommercial demand for steel dried up in the wake of the 2007-08 financial crisis, as major construction and development projects were put on hold. This drove down prices for steel producers. At the same time, a surge in major construction projects in China, the world's largest consumer of steel, put upward pressure on the cost of raw materials globally, analysts say. This, in turn, hurt operating margins for U.S. steel producers, including Steel Dynamics.But as the U.S. economy has healed over the past couple years, the construction industry has gradually recovered, adding to demand for steel, Raymond James Chief Economist Scott Brown said in an interview. He said the domestic steel industry ""for the most part tracks alongside the overall economy, which has been growing, modestly, but growing.""Meanwhile, the Chinese economy has begun to slow and construction has started to shift from big commercial endeavors to smaller residential projects that require less steel there, lessening demand for raw materials in China and lowering costs for U.S. producers, Brown says.""So there is not that upward pressure on (costs) and I don't think there's an expectation for that to change soon,"" he said.Analysts on average forecast third-quarter earnings of 37 cents per share for Steel Dynamics, according to Thomson Reuters. The Street expects sales to again top $2 billion.During a call to discuss second-quarter results in July, Steel Dynamics CEO Mark Millett told analysts that the Severstal Columbus acquisition would not only ramp up production capacity and broaden exposure to surging industries, but the expansion into the South should also deepen Steel Dynamics' ties to industrial markets in Mexico, where he expects ""significant growth.""Millett also said the broad U.S. economic recovery is expected to continue, as is strength in the oil and auto sectors, driving continued steel consumption growth. In the second quarter, Millett said, ""all our reporting segments achieved meaningfully higher profitability compared to the first quarter, improving well beyond the bad weather impact experienced in that quarter. The meaningful improvement ... supports our continued optimism, as does the positive sentiment from our customers.""'Strengthening Trends' SeenThe company's director of investor relations, Marlene Owen, told IBD this week that Steel Dynamics' view of market conditions remains upbeat nearly two months into the third quarter. She said macro indicators of steel industry health, from construction spending to indexes that track planning of new projects, show ""strengthening trends.""Lane said the company's optimism is warranted, but he also said Steel Dynamics is burdened by one lingering headwind: a multiyear project at its Minnesota iron production facility that, to date, has failed to generate returns. The company has invested about $500 million in the facility, Lane estimates, in an effort to develop a cutting-edge production operation. Although the quality is up to par, he said, the quantity of the refined iron ore generated by the Minnesota project has ""fallen short of expectations.""Steel Dynamics said the negative impact of the Minnesota operation on earnings totaled about $18 million in the first half of 2014. Lane said the company hinted earlier in 2014 that it might scrap the project, but now plans to continue investing in it in hopes of fine-tuning operations and benefiting future earnings. Lane said he and many on Wall Street remain skeptical.The company said it anticipates losing money in Minnesota in the third quarter, though at a slower rate than in the first half of the year.""There remains this concern that they will continue to funnel money to this with no real results,"" Lane said. ""It's been a drain on earnings for many quarters. It's a major misstep for them.""That noted, the analyst added, Steel Dynamics has an ""excellent management team"" with a long track record of wise investments. The Minnesota project ""is really management's one black eye."" He called it a ""one-off"" problem that, while significant, is not enough to undercut the firm's strong overall growth and favorable outlook.Lane said Steel Dynamics posted an operating margin of 6.4% in the second quarter. By 2018, he expects it to expand to 11%, as steel sales and prices continue to rise and as Steel Dynamics integrates and capitalizes on its planned acquisition. With the much larger base it can spread out its fixed costs over greater production volumes to boost the margin and, by extension, profitability.It's ""a good story overall,"" he said.Steel Dynamics is the seventh-largest company by market cap among 20 in IBD's Steel-Producers industry group, after POSCO (PKX), Tenaris (TS), Arcelor Mittal (MT), Nucor (NUE), Gerdau (GGB) and Companhia Siderurgica (SID), and before United States Steel (X). The group is currently ranked No. 18 of 197 tracked.

246,NUE,"President Trump summoned some of America's most prominent corporate executives to the White House Thursday and told them he intends to put them to work restoring manufacturing jobs and U.S. dominance in trade.""They share our commitment to bring manufacturing back and to create jobs in this country,"" Trump said as he sat with the 24 business leaders, who included Dow Chemical (DOW) Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris, General Electric (GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt, Lockheed Martin (LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson, and Caterpillar (CAT) Chairman Doug Oberhelman.Trump used the public portion of the meeting to reiterate some of his campaign themes, blasting what he called ""unbelievably bad"" trade deals and singling out trade deficits with Mexico and China. He vowed to punish companies that move jobs outside the U.S. and promised to squeeze more money out of government contracts, citing his talks with Hewson, which he said cut the cost of Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet by more than $700 million.""She's tough, but it worked out well I think for everybody,"" Trump said of Hewson.Before meeting with Trump, the executives split into working groups to explore policy changes on topics such as taxes and trade, regulation, infrastructure and the future workforce. Joining them in the breakout sessions were administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence; Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin; and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Campbell Soup (CPB) CEO Denise Morrison, Harris Corp. (HRS) CEO Bill Brown, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) CEO Alex Gorsky and David Farr, CEO of Emerson Electric (EMR), were among those who took part in the working group sessions with administration officials, who also included budget director Mick Mulvaney.  In a meeting with Cohn and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, business leaders including Corning (GLW) CEO Wendell Weeks and Nucor (NUE) President John Ferriola discussed indexing gasoline taxes to provide more money for transportation projects.Thursday's meeting grew out of Trump's December announcement of an advisory panel on manufacturing.Dow Chemical's Liveris, who is leading the panel, said afterward that he and the other executives were ""very encouraged"" by the pro-business approach being taken by the administration.Taking part in a session on the workforce of the future, Liveris said there must be a ""systemic fix"" to address the shortage of workers prepared for jobs requiring skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.""We have supply-side issues today,"" he said, ""half a million open STEM jobs that we can't fill. We need to fill them with Americans.""He also said community colleges need to provide more vocational training for ""the noble trades,"" which had been a priority of the Obama administration.Lockheed's Hewson told reporters that Trump is ready to take quick action on streamlining rules for businesses. ""It's very important that we reduce regulations, that we eliminate those that are burdensome that are unnecessary,"" she said.Ahead of the meeting, Business Roundtable, the lobbying group for U.S. corporate executives, sent a letter to Cohn laying out 16 regulations of top concern to its members. The letter touches on everything from the Affordable Care Act to net neutrality to environmental regulations — but also hints at CEO concerns about the economic impacts of Trump immigration and trade policy.Topping the Business Roundtable list is a 2015 move by the Environmental Protection Agency to tighten national ambient air quality standards for ground-level ozone, as well as EPA limits on new coal-fired power plants and expanded jurisdiction over state waters. The list also includes overtime regulations; Dodd-Frank provisions including CEO pay ratio disclosure, conflict minerals disclosure rules and margin requirements for uncleared swaps; and employer reporting and tax requirements under the Affordable Care Act. In addition, the group is seeking expedited export controls and tightening eligibility and increasing exclusions for shareholder proposals.""While some of the listed regulations in isolation may not appear significant to growth, their cumulative effect has drained resources from innovation and job creation and directed them to non-value adding administrative and bureaucratic activities,"" said the letter, signed by Mark Costa, the chairman and CEO for Eastman Chemical (EMN) who leads Business Roundtable's smart regulation committee.At the same time, the letter said that as the administration ""considers new policies with regard to immigration or the expansion of 'Buy America' requirements, Business Roundtable stands ready to assist to prevent unintended consequences that would inhibit the ability for U.S. companies to drive economic growth and be globally competitive.""Trump has used previous meetings with companies to encourage corporate leaders to build their products in the U.S., offering tax breaks and lower regulation to bring down costs — and warning that he wants to raise tariffs on products produced overseas. The heads of labor organizations, automotive firms, national retail chains, drug companies, and airlines are all among the groups who have met with Trump in the West Wing in recent weeks.Neither Trump nor the CEOs indicated they had a detailed discussion of his plans to overhaul the tax code, which he has said he will deliver within weeks, or a border-adjustment tax proposal under consideration by House Republicans, which would shift the tax burden from exporters to importers.Republican leaders in the House, including Speaker Paul Ryan, argue a border-adjustment tax would benefit American manufacturing while providing revenue to make up for losses from reducing corporate tax rates. Several manufacturers, including Dow Chemical, are actively lobbying for the plan, which Trump has called ""too complicated."" Opponents, including net importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), oppose it and warn it will raise taxes on American consumers.

Earnings estimates were for 1 cent per share, an improvement on its 23-cent loss a year ago. Revenue, expected to rise 3.1% to $2.651 billion, came in at $2.650 billion.Management forecast earnings of $3.08 per share in 2017, assuming market conditions remain as they are. But the company expects conditions to improve, suggesting there could be upside. It's not clear if U.S. Steel's 2017 EPS outlook is comparable to analyst estimates of $1.86.""While we will benefit from improved market conditions, they continue to be volatile and we must remain focused on improving the things that we can control.""U.S. Steel shares were volatile in after-hours trading, jumping 5% then settling back to down fractionally. Shares slipped 0.9% to 32.71 in regular trading on the stock market today, continuing a modest downtrend since spiking to a two-year high in early December.Most steel stocks were lower.

Domestic steel producers stand to benefit from Trump's policies in three main ways: An infrastructure push could rev up demand; corporate tax cuts would deliver greater after-tax earnings; and punitive tariffs against Chinese steel imports could firm up pricing.After both stocks hit multiyear highs on Dec. 8, they pulled back and, at least until Nucor broke through support on Tuesday, have mostly moved sideways as investors await for clearer signs that Trump will be able to deliver tax cuts and a major infrastructure package.

Domestic steel producers stand to benefit from Trump's policies in three main ways: An infrastructure push could rev up demand; corporate tax cuts would deliver greater after-tax earnings; and punitive tariffs against Chinese steel imports could firm up pricing.Arconic (ARNC), a maker of engineered aluminum products for the auto, aerospace and construction sectors, also reports late Tuesday in the first earnings release since Alcoa (AA) split into two separate entities (Arconic and Alcoa), with the mining and smelting operations retaining the Alcoa name.Nucor's earnings out before the open on Tuesday are expected to show profit of 34 cents a share, down 26% from a year ago. Revenue is seen rising 9.5% to $3.785 billion.Nucor tamped down earnings expectations in December, citing weaker margins in its steel mills segment.U.S. Steel's earnings after the closing bell are expected to show a profit of 1 cent per share vs. a 23-cent loss a year ago. Revenue is expected to rise 3.1% to $2.651 billion.The company has been facing operational issues and has cited weak pricing in its tubular segment that serves the energy sector. But it offered some positive news last month, saying it will restart an iron ore plant in Keewatin, Minn., that has been idled since mid-2015 amid cheap imports.So far, steel company earnings have been kind of a mixed bag quarter. AK Steel (AKS) topped estimates but saw its stock sink on weak pricing guidance, while Steel Dynamics (STLD) met earnings estimates. The one standout has been Allegheny Technologies (ATI), which vaulted out of a 10-month trading range on January 24 after beating views.IBD'S TAKE: Check out where Nucor and U.S. Steel rank against other steel makers based on earnings, relative stock price strength, and see which company leads the pack with IBD's highest composite rating.On Jan. 18, steel stocks rebounded from 50-day lines after Trump's Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross signaled he would support additional tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum. But those gains quickly reversed. Steel stocks have had several sharp moves above and below the 50-day line, but most are tracking below that key level.Nucor slipped 1.5% to close at 60.10 on the stock market today. U.S. Steel lost 2.3% to finish at 33.Arconic results, stripped of Alcoa operations, are expected to show a profit of 13 cents a share in Q4, up 8%, on revenue of $3 billion, down 43%. Arconic retains a 20% stake in Alcoa and has seen the value of that holding surge as shares of Alcoa have surged on hopes for Trump stimulus, tax cuts and protection from Chinese imports.Several major investors are pushing to oust Arconic CEO Klaus Kleinfield, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, less than three months after the Alcoa split.Arconic shares fell 0.4% to close at 22.50. Alcoa was off 0.3% to 36.55.RELATED:AK, Allegheny Earnings Top, Steel Dynamics Meets; Steel Stocks Bend Both Ways Steel Stocks Trigger Buy Points As Wilbur Ross Signals China Tariffs

250,NUE,"The Dow Jones industrial average and other major indexes hit record highs as President Trump made more noises about tax reform, while Fed chief Janet Yellen took a slightly hawkish stance. Apple (AAPL) rose to an all-time best while fellow Dow stock Verizon Communications (VZ) returned to unlimited wireless plans. Kraft Heinz (KHC) is pursuing a mammoth deal for Unilever (UN). NetEase (NTES), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and NetApp (NTAP) rallied on earnings, while General Motors (GM) may sell its European unit Opel.The Dow industrials and Nasdaq composite rose 1.8% for the week, with the S&P 500 added 1.5%, all hitting new highs during the week. Apple was a key contributor to all the major indexes. Fed Chair Janet Yellen's somewhat hawkish tone didn't worry investors, but gave bond yields and bank stocks a boost.""Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise,"" Fed chief Janet Yellen told Congress, a shift from her 2016 tone emphasizing downside risks to the economy. Yellen, along with other Fed officials speaking during the week, raised the odds of a near-term hike slightly. Markets don't expect a March move but see a 50-50 move by May and a strong likelihood by June.  Yellen warned against repealing financial regulations passed after the credit crisis.Meanwhile, retail sales and inflation data were stronger than expected, while small-business optimism hit a fresh 12-year high and the Philly Fed manufacturing index shot up to its strongest reading since 1984.RELATED:Worries over intensified wireless competition pressured phone company stocks after Verizon Communications (VZ) reintroduced unlimited data plans nearly six years after removing them. Verizon sought an edge over T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) by offering high-definition video as part of unlimited data. T-Mobile quickly changed its offer to include HD video. Sprint cut its unlimited price to $50 a month or $90 for two users, including HD video. AT&T (T) opened unlimited wireless beyond DirecTV and U-verse customers. Analysts say industry consolidation could ease competition. Merger talks are expected to heat up when a government spectrum auctions ends, perhaps by late March.RELATED:T-Mobile (TMUS) on Feb. 14 reported Q4 profit and revenue that edged views. For 2017, it forecast branded postpaid subscriber additions of 2.9 million, below estimates. Analysts called the guidance conservative, though in any event T-Mobile will likely lead industry subscriber growth for the fourth year in a row in 2017. For the first time, T-Mobile provided free cash flow guidance. It forecast three-year FCF annual growth of 45% to 48%, or about $4.5 billion by 2019.Softbank is willing to give up control of its majority-owned Sprint to achieve a merger with T-Mobile, Reuters reported Friday. Sprint rose 3.3% on Friday and T-Mobile 5.5%, with AT&T and Verizon rising modestly that day.RELATED:Apple, the top Dow industrials stock in 2017, hit a record high of 136.27 on news reports related to its cash-return plans and the upcoming iPhone 8.

CFO Luca Maestri said Apple would look to boost dividends and buybacks if the U.S. cuts corporate tax rates, as expected under President Trump.RELATED:Kraft Heinz (KHC) signaled it will continue to pursue the European consumer and food products giant even though Unilever (UN) said the offer undervalued the company and sees no reason for further talks. A combination would be one of the largest of all time and create a global food giant. Kraft Heinz, which has been slashing costs to boost profit, shot up 10.6% Friday to a record high. Unilever leapt 15.3% to 48.79, also setting a record best. Snacks giant Mondelez (MDLZ) fell. Consumer products firms such as Kimberly-Clark (KMB) rallied.RELATED:President Trump on Wednesday met with CEOs from Target (TGT), Gap (GPS), AutoZone (AZO) and other retailers, saying he would cut regulations and encouraging them to expand in the U.S. Trump also said a ""massive"" tax plan was coming ""in the not-too-distant future."" Target, afterward, warned that a GOP plan for a border adjustment tax as part of corporate tax reform would force them to ""raise prices for American families on everyday essentials."" That subject came up during the meeting, although it was unclear how much of a focus it was.RELATED:Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) gobbled up shares of Apple (AAPL) in Q4, quadrupling its holdings, according to a regulatory filing. He also continued to fill up on Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL). David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital also boosted its stake in Apple. Appaloosa cut its stake in the iPhone maker but hiked its stake in Southwest (LUV). George Soros took stakes in Facebook (FB), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Delta, but dropped United. Activist investor Trian Fund Management built up a $3.5 billion position in Procter & Gamble (PG).RELATED:The Chinese mobile gaming giant late Wednesday reported Q4 earnings per American depositary receipt of $4.40 minus items on revenue of $1.74 billion, both well above the analyst consensus.

NetEase licenses many games from Activision Blizzard (ATVI), including ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Overwatch."" NetEase stock leapt 14% on Thursday to a record high after edging past a buy point earlier in the week.RELATED: In its fiscal Q2 ended Jan. 28, Cisco earned 57 cents per share minus items, flat from a year earlier but topping views by a penny. Revenue fell 2% to $11.58 billion, the fifth straight decline, but that beat expectations of $11.55 billion. Cisco's deferred revenue from software and subscriptions jumped 51% to $4 billion in fiscal Q2, a sign that its shift to software and services from its core business of selling network switches and routers is gaining momentum. Cisco shares rose 7%, hitting their best levels since November 2007.RELATED:Chip gear maker Applied Materials (AMAT) earned 67 cents a share ex items in its fiscal Q1, up 158% year over year, on sales of $3.28 billion, up 45%. Analysts expected 66 cents and $3.27 billion. It was Applied Materials' fourth straight quarter of accelerating sales and EPS growth.

Saudi Arabia had the biggest decline in output. U.S. crude stockpiles jumped by 9.5 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration, well above analyst estimates. But stocks at the Cushing, Okla., hub were down. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose yet again. Diamondback Energy (FANG) reported Q4 results above Wall Street views and raised its full-year production outlook and capital-spending target. Devon Energy (DVN) also reported Q4 results above expectations.RELATED:Peugeot's parent, PSA Group, said it was in talks with General Motors (GM) about potentially acquiring the U.S. automaker's Opel division, which also includes the British Vauxhall brand. The deal would give PSA Group a 16% market share in Europe, second only to Volkswagen (VLKAY). GM has had trouble turning a profit at the unit and had a tentative deal in 2009 to sell it to Canada's Magna.RELATED:One big health insurance merger, between Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), is dead, while the other, between Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI), broke out into a wrestling match. Federal judges blocked both deals earlier this year. Cigna sued Anthem for $13 billion in damages on top of a $1.85 billion breakup fee. But a judge blocked Cigna from ending the merger after Anthem countersued, arguing that Cigna has tried to sabotage the deal.Humana, which gets a $1 billion payment from Aetna for its trouble, moved on by announcing a stock buyback and saying it will exit the ObamaCare exchanges. Aetna's CEO said the ObamaCare exchanges are in a death spiral. And Molina Health (MOH) signaled it would likely exit the ObamaCare exchanges next year.UnitedHealth (UNH) tumbled 3.7% Friday on news that the Justice Department has joined a whistleblower suit accusing the health insurer of overcharging Medicare Advantage by hundreds of millions of dollars, possibly billions of dollars. Other health insurers, including Aetna and Humana also retreated Friday.RELATED:DOJ Accuses UnitedHealth Of Overcharging Medicare AdvantageSnap (SNAP), in an updated SEC filing, says it's looking to 200 million shares at a price range of 14 to 16 a share, raising roughly $3 billion. That would give it a valuation of $19.5 billion to $22.2 billion, below earlier reports that the Snapchat parent would seek $25 billion. Snapchat enjoys rapid revenue growth, but Facebook (FB) is successfully imitating Snapchat features, especially on its Instagram app.RELATED:U.S. Steel (X) flirted with a buy point during the week while Steel Dynamics (STLD) and Nucor (NUE) and aluminum maker Alcoa (AA) jumped on reports that China is considering sweeping production cuts to combat smog. Reuters reported that China could slash steel capacity by at least half and aluminum capacity by 30% in certain months.Cement and aggregates firms, like steel companies, are expected to benefit from President Trump's infrastructure push, as well as a multibillion-dollar wall on the border, but that won't help 2017 results much. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) on Tuesday missed fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates and gave a subdued 2017 outlook.RELATED:Las-Vegas-centric MGM Resorts International (MGM) turned profitable in Q4, reversing a year-earlier loss, but missed estimates, while revenue was in line.

251,NUE,"Steel stocks, which were big early winners following the election of Donald Trump, are suffering sharp losses Wednesday even as other infrastructure stocks helped push the Dow Jones industrial average over 20,000 for the first time and the other major averages to all-time highs.U.S. Steel (X), Nucor (NUE), Steel Dynamics (STLD) and AK Steel (AKS) are all losing sight of their 50-day moving averages intraday, an area that has acted as support in the last couple of weeks.  U.S. Steel fell 3.2% on the stock market today, though it finished off intraday lows. Nucor lost 2% and Steel Dynamics 6.6%. AK Steel plunged 4.8% after suffering a nasty reversal on Tuesday.AK Steel on Tuesday topped earnings estimates, but analysts noted a sluggish outlook for steel prices. Steel Dynamics late Tuesday met EPS views and topped on revenue. It wasn't immediately clear what upset STLD investors.Analysts were divided over whether AK Steel signaled bad news for U.S. Steel. Both U.S. Steel and Nucor report earnings on Jan. 31.IBD'S TAKE: President Trump authorized construction of a Mexican border wall on Wednesday. Caterpillar and several materials stocks are breaking out to buy points.On a positive note, Allegheny Technologies (ATI) fell 1.8% Wednesday, but that's after surging 31% on Tuesday to an 18-month high.

252,NUE,"AK Steel (AKS) and Allegheny Technologies (ATI) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday, with Steel Dynamics (STLD) set to release results after the closing bell. Allegheny Tech stock flew, lifting U.S. Steel (X) and Nucor (NUE). But AK Steel erased early gains in an ugly reversal.AK Steel earned 25 cents a share excluding various items, down 17% vs. a year earlier but easily beating views for 6 cents. Sales fell 8% to $1.4186 billion, just exceeding forecasts for $1.41245 billion. Steel prices rose 7% to $998 a ton on a better sales mix and better carbon steel spot pricing.But AK Steels sees steel prices little changed in Q1 vs. Q4.Specialty steel producer Allegheny lost 4 cents a share, but that was better than views for an 11-cent loss and last year's 56-cent loss. Revenue rose 8% to $796.1 million, below views for $803.62 million. Allegheny also was relatively bullish about 2017.IBD'S TAKE: While steel and materials stocks have been leaders of the postelection rally, the big-cap tech ""FANG+"" stocks are all at or near buy zones, with Amazon and Facebook trying to break out.President Trump Tuesday morning signed executive orders approving the Keystone XL and Dakota pipelines, with a stipulation that the pipes should be made using U.S. steel.Allegheny spiked 31% to 22.28, busting out of a base at 19.30 to an 18-month high.AK Steel shot up as high as 10.26, retaking its 50-day moving average, and putting the stock back in buy range. But shares abruptly reversed on the stock market today, closing down 6.6% to 8.68.Other stocks traded off intraday peaks. U.S. Steel climbed 1.3% to 33.22, off session highs of 34.94 and closing below its 50-day line. Nucor rose 1.4%, failing to hold its 50-day.

253,NUE,"VanEck Vectors Steel (SLX) ETF is near new highs, although it may have to rely on its best components to offset softness in some top steel stocks.The ETF is forming an attractive pattern, a cup-with-handle base with a potential buy point at 43.36. It is the second base since it bottomed in January of 2016, when much of the sector bottomed. Steel is a leading industry. IBD's steel producers and steel alloy industry groups are in the top 15 of 197 groups.Some top steel stocks had been trending lower, but they rallied Thursday, apparently on news that President Trump said he will introduce a ""phenomenal"" tax plan.Still, some charts have weakened. Tenaris (TS) gapped down Wednesday as it sank further below its 50-day moving average. Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) rebounded Thursday but remain below the 50-day moving average.However, much of the fund's strength comes not from steel producers but from miners of iron ore, the mineral that's purified and eventually turned into steel. Rio Tinto (RIO), Vale (VALE) and Vedanta (VEDL) have been on strong upward price trends for more than a year. They've surged roughly 95% to 350% from early 2016 lows.To the fund's benefit, those are some of the biggest of the 26 components, accounting for roughly one-third of the portfolio. It may also help shield the ETF from protectionist moves the U.S. government may take against foreign steel makers.In confirmation hearings, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the dumping of steel and aluminum will be tackled with tariffs. He was particularly critical of China's protectionist policies. Two-thirds of VanEck Vectors Steel's components are based outside the U.S., though none in China. All stocks in the ETF use U.S.-traded shares.Steel stocks started rallying in November with Trump's victory. He also has promised big spending on highways, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects that will need plenty of steel, whether foreign or domestic.Some steel stocks are forming bases, and breakouts could spark more gains for the ETF. Reliance Steel (RS), ArcelorMittal (MT), Posco (PKX), U.S. Steel (X) and Gerdau (GGB) are charts to watch.VanEck Vectors Steel had a superb 2016, soaring 95.8%. But like many commodity-based ETFs, it's had long periods of underperformance. Over a three-year period, the ETF is down 5.8%.The fund is based on the NYSE Arca Steel Index, described as a pure-play gauge in which all index members must have primary business in the steel industry.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

254,NUE,"For the first time since Wall Street began to focus on the GOP's border-tax plan, retailers joined the rest of the stock market in a broad rally on Thursday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite to record highs.After a strong day for retail on Wednesday, Dow component Wal-Mart (WMT) shares rose another 1.9% to 69.08 on Thursday, the highest close in more than a month. Dollar Tree (DLTR) surged 3.6%, Gap (GPS) added 2.8%, and Costco (COST) rose 2.6% to an all-time closing high. Dollar General (DG) raced ahead 3.5% to its highest close since Nov. 30 as its former CEO, Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., made waves with his forceful opposition to the border-tax plan. (Wal-Mart retreated 1.5% on Friday as retailers were mixed overall).Meanwhile, fell Dow component Nike (NKE) shares sprinted 2.7% Thursday, retaking its 200-day moving average for the first time since August. Nike added 1.7% on the stock market today to a fresh four-month high. As ex-CEO at Nike rival Reebok, Perdue also must be looking at the border-tax debate from the view of the footwear industry that does most of its manufacturing overseas.Yet even as hopes dimmed for the GOP House plan that would cut the corporate tax rate to 20%, funded by a 20% tax on imports, the broad market charged higher on the back of President Trump's comments to airline executives that he'll be announcing a ""phenomenal"" tax plan in the next two or three weeks.Goldman Sachs (GS) helped the Dow claim new heights, rising 1.6% Thursday and 0.5% Friday. Tesla (TSLA) cruised ahead 2.7% Thursday, as it breaks out of a long base, holding its gains Friday.Steel stocks were especially strong Thursday, with U.S. Steel (X) up 8.3%, Steel Dynamics (STLD) 5.7% and Nucor (NUE) 4.6%. All three stocks rose fractionally Friday.Yet assuming Perdue stands firm, the GOP can only afford to lose one more senator to keep the border tax alive. And Perdue didn't appear to leave much wiggle room to reverse his opinion: ""The clear effect of the proposed border adjust tax is an increase in consumer prices,"" he wrote in a letter to colleagues. ""This would hammer consumer confidence and lower overall demand, thus putting downward pressure on jobs.""IBD'S TAKE: Supporters of the border tax plan say that the dollar would rise by 20% vs. other currencies, meaning that it wouldn't harm either corporate profits or consumers. But it does pose a risk to U.S. investors holding shares of companies like Alibaba or international ETFs.The retail stock revival and record high for the major averages raise this question: If the border tax isn't going anywhere, what does Trump have up his sleeve? If the border tax dies, Wall Street analysts have largely concluded that corporate tax cuts would have to be scaled back in a big way to make it through reconciliation, a legislative maneuver that means the GOP can pass tax cuts with only a majority vote if the package is revenue neutral in year 11 and beyond.Without a border tax, some think the effort to cut corporate taxes could collapse. At best, the corporate tax rate might be cut to 25%, but even that might be out of reach.Yet a closer look suggests that investors didn't really get carried away with Trump's mystery tax plan. Even though advancing stocks led declines by roughly 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange, Raymond James strategist Jeffrey Saut noted that the percentage of volume going into advance stocks ""was among the lowest in history"" on days when the S&P 500 has hit a 52-week high and closed positive on the day.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseWhy Tax Reform Could End In Tears For Trump And GOP

Most are consolidating in a healthy fashion since peaking in early December.Steel stocks rallied on Wednesday after billionaire Wilbur Ross, Donald Trump's Commerce secretary nominee, told Congress that Chinese steel is sold overseas ""often at dumping prices,"" and signaled that more anti-dumping duties loom.""One of the things that we do need to pay very careful attention to is more tariff activity, the anti-dumping requirements that we should impose on the steel industry and on the aluminum industry as well,"" Ross said.RELATED:Steel Stocks Trigger Buy Points As Wilbur Ross Signals China Tariffs

257,NUE,"Shares of domestic steel makers U.S. Steel (X), Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) rallied Wednesday in bullish fashion after Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross signaled the incoming administration will levy more tariffs and anti-dumping duties on imported Chinese steel.Billionaire investor Ross said at Wednesday's Senate confirmation hearings that Chinese overcapacity is the biggest problem for the steel industry, with Chinese steel makers selling their wares overseas ""often at dumping prices.""""One of the things that we do need very careful attention to is more tariff activity, the anti-dumping requirements that we should impose on the steel industry and on the aluminum industry as well,"" he said.Ross added: ""China is the most protectionist country of very large countries. They have both very high tariff barriers and very high non-tariff trade barriers. So they talk much more about free trade than they actually practice.""The Obama administration has several times used anti-dumping duties vs. Chinese goods, including cold-rolled steel products. Last week, the administration filed a complaint with the WTO over Chinese aluminum production.President-elect Trump has long signaled his support for more protectionist policies, while campaigning on plans for a big infrastructure spending.Ross said Wednesday that the U.S. has ""monumental"" infrastructure needs.U.S. Steel, Steel Dynamics and Nucor all rallied on Ross' comments, rebounding from at or just below their 50-day moving averages, triggering buy points for all three stocks. U.S. Steel soared 8.5% on the stock market today, while Steel Dynamics jumped 4.7% and Nucor climbed 3.8%.Steel stocks soared for a month after the election on hopes for more protectionism and infrastructure spending under Trump. But they pulled back and consolidated starting in early December after both Nucor and Steel Dynamics warned on Q4 profit.IBD'S TAKE: Major steel makers all in buy ranges Wednesday as U.S. Steel, Nucor and Steel Dynamics all are bouncing off their 50-day moving averages. Steel Dynamics is leading the charge in the industry group with an IBD Composite Rating of 92 and a Relative Strength rating of 95.Separately, diversified mining giants BHP Billiton (BHP), Rio Tinto (RIO) and especially Vale (VALE) rallied intraday. BHP rose 0.8% and Rio about 2%, both climbing to their best levels since mid-2015. Vale shot up 4.5% to its best levels since late 2014 on reports it'll move to improve shareholder governance and perhaps merge the miner's common and preferred stock.RELATED:This Steel Firm Was Up 99% In 2016; How Well Can It Perform In 2017?Steel Dynamics Is Second Steel Maker To Warn On Profit In 2 Days

262,NUE,"The federal government is on track to run a cumulative budget deficit of $9.4 trillion over the coming decade, including $1.4 trillion in 2027, or 5.0% of GDP, new Congressional Budget Office projections indicate.Over the decade, public debt is projected to rise from 77% of GDP to 89%. The updated outlook underscores the challenge President Trump will face as he relies primarily on a narrow GOP majority in the Senate to slash taxes for businesses and individuals and undertake a major infrastructure push.That agenda has fueled the postelection stock market rally, lifting shares of materials companies like Nucor (NUE), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX) that would benefit from an infrastructure push. The prospect that companies will see their after-tax earnings boosted by tax cuts has been a boon to companies that do most of their business in the U.S., such as AT&T (T) and Jack in the Box (JACK).IBD'S TAKE: The ability of Republicans to dramatically cut the corporate tax rate may rest on a House GOP plan to impose a 20% tax on imports, which would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years. But the plan, which could hurt Wal-Mart and Apple, faces a bruising political fight.In the campaign, Trump promised not to cut Social Security and Medicare. Meanwhile, savings that the GOP hoped to derive by repealing ObamaCare now look somewhat doubtful. Three GOP senators have lined up behind a repeal-and-replacement of ObamaCare that looks to be just as expensive.Trump is already signaling plans to go after nondefense discretionary programs, including those of the Environmental Protection Agency, but Republican leaders are warning him that there are limited savings to be found outside of entitlement programs. Discretionary spending already has been curbed under a budget sequestration deal between the GOP Congress and President Obama.Trump's own budget director pick, Mick Mulvaney, said at Tuesday's Senate confirmation hearing that the $20 trillion national debt must be ""addressed sooner rather than later.""RELATED:Social Security Benefit Cuts In 2017 May Curb Trump's Plans

263,NUE,"Federal Reserve policymakers spent much of the past year bemoaning the slow pace of U.S. economic growth and worrying that it had become a chronic condition.But this year, the Fed will shift to the role of traffic cop, keeping its eyes on the radar gun out of concern that the economy will blow past its speed limit, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal fuel.Stock investors are loving the sudden shift to more dynamic growth, with financial stocks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) lifted by a steeper yield curve and steel stocks like Nucor (NUE) surging on prospects for an infrastructure-spending binge.Yet if Trump hits the gas in a low-speed zone, some economists have warned, the Fed might see little choice but to advance its timetable for hiking rates, the equivalent of issuing speeding tickets to slow down traffic. The positive scenario is one in which Trump's policies don't simply hit the fiscal accelerator but actually raise the speed limit, allowing the economy to grow faster without pushing inflation much above the Fed's comfort zone.While there's a pretty big disagreement among economists over which scenario is more likely, Wall Street doesn't have to worry too much about who's right at the moment. Yet the debate will take center stage starting in the second half of 2017 when Trump's fiscal policies are expected to begin ramping up.IBD'S TAKE: IBD recently examined a host of ways Wal-Mart is working to streamline its business, from using drones to manage inventories to its new ""Scan & Go"" app. For a closer look, read ""How Wal-Mart May Revive U.S. Productivity — And Its Own Fortunes.""The internal Fed debate will feature a board with two new appointments by Trump, filling slots that remain vacant because the Republican-led Senate blocked President Obama's nominees. While some expect that Trump appointees will be in the sound-money GOP mold, balancing out Obama's dovish appointees, there may be good reason not to expect them to shift policy in a hawkish direction. Trump's picks may be especially open to the possibility that his policies of deregulation and corporate tax cuts can help revive productivity growth, effectively raising the economy's speed limit. And by the end of the year, Trump likely will nominate his choice for Federal Reserve chairman, as Janet Yellen's term as Fed chief ends in February 2018.The key concern is that the U.S. economy may already be approaching full employment, meaning that wage and inflation pressures will intensify if the unemployment rate falls further.As Yellen put it in her post-meeting press conference on Dec. 14, ""I would say at this point that fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment.""To be sure, Trump's planned fiscal boost, eight years into the economic recovery and just as the deficit has renewed a worrisome and potentially long-term rise, has a meaningful risk that it could backfire.Yet in other respects, the timing of Trump's agenda for cutting corporate tax rates and spending more on infrastructure looks pretty good.One issue is that labor force participation remains depressed, especially among men of prime working age, 25-54. Meanwhile, the ranks of workers unable to find full-time work remain elevated and those working part-time by choice have soared by more than 2 million since the end of 2013. If Trump's policies can bring workers off the sidelines and turn part-timers into full-timers, the economy may be able to grow somewhat faster without an upsurge in wage growth and inflation.In fact, Obama's economic advisors have pushed an infrastructure spending boost as one way to increase labor force participation. Replacing ObamaCare also could make a difference, since that may have contributed to the elevated level of part-time work, both involuntary and by choice. One factor is the ObamaCare mandate requiring employers to offer coverage to workers clocking at least 30 hours per week. ObamaCare rules also encourage less work with big subsidy cliffs for those earning above certain income thresholds, especially 200% of the poverty level and 400% of poverty. Further, workers who don't have an offer of employer coverage, either because they're part-time or work at a smaller firm, may get much bigger health insurance subsidies than those who do.Yet, the construction sector is among those complaining the loudest about a lack of qualified workers, and Trump's still-unclear immigration policies could work against rising participation.Another possible effect of Trump's agenda could be a rebound in productivity growth, meaning employers wouldn't have to increase hiring as much to facilitate faster growth.Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer noted in an October speech that a broad measure of business-sector productivity growth has risen only 0.5% a year over the past five years vs. 1.25% over the past decade and 2% a year, on average, from 1976 to 2005.Slow productivity growth largely explains why Fed members' economic projections marked the long-run growth rate of the economy down to 1.8% in September from 2.0% in June, which was itself down from the 2.2% to 2.3% range seen in early 2014.At her latest press conference, Yellen said that improved productivity growth could come from ""policies that spur either private or public investment to enhance the quality of capital in the United States that workers have to work with; and policies that spur innovation or competition or the formation of new firms.""""So tax policies can have that effect,"" she added.Yet it's possible that Trump's agenda could increase labor force participation and improve productivity growth, but not enough to keep a tight labor market from overheating. In that case, interest rates would rise faster than expected, making borrowing more expensive, hurting the housing market and counteracting much of the hoped-for gains.""Perhaps the biggest risk next year is that the animal spirits unleashed by Trump's proposed policies, and then the implementation of his most stimulative policies, overheat the economy,"" wrote Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research.But he sees the ""most likely scenario"" as much more favorable, with technological innovation yielding productivity gains, a strengthening dollar helping to keep a lid on inflation, and deregulation acting as ""a powerful force of disinflation, as it has been in the past.""In this scenario, Yardeni sees the 10-year Treasury yield remaining under 3% next year as the S&P 500 rises to 2400-2500, as corporate and individual tax cuts boost earnings.RELATED:Top 10 Trends To Watch For 2017: From Trump To Apple's iPhone 8ISM Manufacturing Index Hits 2-Year High In December

265,NUE,"The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey index out Tuesday showed that the factory sector ended the year on a high note, rising to a two-year high of 54.7 from 53.2 in November.The reading came in above economists' consensus forecast of a slight rise to 53.6. Readings above the neutral level of 50 are consistent with an expanding manufacturing sector.The ISM report adds to the evidence that the economy has an extra spring in its step following the November elections. Still, neither the factory data nor even the jobs report on Friday is likely to alter expectations for Federal Reserve interest-rate policy to a substantial degree.Stock indexes got off to a strong start in 2017's opening session. The major averages initially spiked following the ISM report, but erased those added gains.Production and new orders indexes both saw strong gains, up 4.3 points to 60.3 and 7.2 points to 60.2, respectively. The employment index rose to 53.1 from 52.3.The industrial side of the economy has gotten support from auto sales, which likely dipped to a solid 17.4 million annual rate in December from November's 17.8 million, Kelly Blue Book said. General Motors (GM) is expected to grow its market share by one percentage point amid demand for its midsize Chevrolet Malibu. Auto sales data will be reported throughout the day on Wednesday.General Motors shares rose 1% in morning trade on the stock market today even after President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter (TWTR) on Tuesday to target the auto giant for importing some Chevy Cruze models from Mexico.Despite the improving economy, Kelly Blue Book expects 2017 auto sales to slip from 1% to 3%.Adding to the bullish economic news, construction spending rose 0.9% in November to an annualized $1.18 trillion, the best since April 2006.After hiking rates in December, policymakers are likely to take a pause with an eye on expansionary fiscal policies being crafted by the GOP Congress and President-elect Trump. Markets anticipate the next hike will come in June.Steel makers such as Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) are expected to get a lift from Trump's infrastructure plans, and perhaps various protectionist policies. On the other hand, a stronger dollar and higher interest rates will be a slight negative for U.S. producers. Because the real fiscal fuel won't hit until late 2017, IHS Global Insight is expecting 2.3% real GDP growth in 2017 and 2.6% in 2018.Nucor rose 0.3% and Steel Dynamics 1.1% after both gained more than 2% earlier.General Electric (GE) erased an early gain to trade down 0.5%.RELATED:Trump Threatens 'Big Border Tax' On GM, Which Fires Back

267,NUE,"Social Security benefits will be cut at the start of 2017 for everyone who has yet to turn 62.Those cuts will grow in each year to 2022, reaching 7% for everyone now 56 and under, as the official retirement age rises two months per year to 67.Those benefit cuts are part of the daunting math for Social Security and the federal budget that could cause speed bumps for, or perhaps even curb, President-elect Donald Trump's big fiscal plans.1) Once the retirement age rises to 67, Social Security's early retirement penalty will cut annual benefits by 30% for those who retire at 62, up from 25% today. The problem is that Social Security benefits aren't especially generous to begin with. Consider that people with career earnings equivalent to roughly $30,000 a year retiring today would receive just a poverty-level benefit for the rest of their lives if they faced a 30% early retirement hit.2) The Congressional Budget Office affirmed last week that Social Security's Trust Fund is on course to run out in 2029, which will end the program's authority to run cash deficits funded by new government debt. At that point, a massive 29% across-the-board benefit cut — affecting the disabled and retirees of all ages — would be needed to bring benefits in line with program revenue.3) If you take that 29% cut on top of a 30% early retirement penalty, those retiring at 62 would get just 50% of their current full-retirement benefit, essentially abandoning the idea of a Social Security safety net for early retirees.4) In January, the CBO will release updated budget projections that extend for an additional year, through fiscal 2027. That's likely to a show a Social Security cash shortfall of $450 billion in 2027 alone, part of an overall federal budget deficit well north of $1 trillion. At that point, the trust fund's demise will be just two years away, according to CBO projections.The take-away is that the day of reckoning for Social Security, which has always been comfortably off in the distance, now appears to be just around the corner. That could make the budget math for Trump's fiscal ambitions even more contentious.To be clear, Trump has been firmly against cutting Social Security benefits. Yet that raises the question of how the massive revenue gap will be filled, and that question creates one more potential snag for the coming push to rev up the economy.For investors enjoying the postelection rally, questions are mounting over whether a looming tussle over fiscal policy will limit Trump's fiscal fuel. If so, that could curb expectations for better growth and higher interest rates, which have been a positive for financial firms like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS). A more modest boost to infrastructure spending could limit the benefit to steel makers like Nucor (NUE). Corporate tax cuts that depend on $1 trillion in revenue from the House GOP border-tax adjustment could be a big negative for retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT).IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart is among the stocks that have sat out the Trump rally. Gains based on expectations of better economic growth and corporate tax cuts have given way to concerns that President-elect Trump will embrace the House GOP's border-adjustable tax that will effectively put a 20% tax on imports.The outcome of the fiscal debate will largely depend on internal GOP dynamics. Yet the potential flare-up of political heat over Social Security's future is a wild card that may depend on whether Democrats, who have long downplayed the retirement program's financing problems and, more recently, pushed for broad-based benefit increases, suddenly start to sound the alarm about its future. That about-face is hardly certain, but shifts in political power have been known to bring about such unexpected ideological swings.The benefit cuts coming in 2017 stem from a 1983 pact between President Reagan and the Democrat-led Congress to stave off an imminent Social Security financing crisis. They also sought to address Social Security's long-term funding gap by including a hike in the official retirement age from 65 to 67 in the far-off future.The retirement age rose from 65 to 66 in two-month increments from 2000 to 2005. Now, although the retirement age is set to rise again, Social Security faces a far more severe and permanent funding crisis. Yet that 1983 pact is pushing the limits of age-related reforms, because early retirement penalties are becoming so large that they are like a crack in Social Security's foundation.The early retirement penalties are intended to be an actuarially fair trade-off, allowing people to get a benefit that's smaller but runs for more years. But while it may be fair, that doesn't mean it won't hurt members of the working class who live long enough to deplete their savings.A number of GOP proposals to reform Social Security would further hike the official retirement age, while raising the earliest retirement age, now 62, in tandem. That approach would avoid further increases in penalties for retiring early. Instead of further eroding the benefit that seniors will rely on late in life, workers would face the penalty in their early 60s. Ideally, they would keep working longer so that they'd be able to spread their savings over fewer years of retirement.Yet a rise in the earliest retirement age would most affect those who have difficulty extending their careers and little savings to fall back on. Social Security Administration data show that about 30% of beneficiaries in their early 60s rely on the program for at least 80% of total income.RELATED:Don't Count On Clinton Or Trump To Fix Social Security

269,NUE,"At the end of 2015, the outlook for commodity prices wasn't rosy. Weak oil prices, a rising dollar and forecasts for uncertain economic recovery in China kept estimates for the year to low single digits.Among ETFs, that put the IShares MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers Fund (PICK) near the bottom of a brutal four-year decline. But the forecasts for commodity prices were wrong.As a result, MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers on Friday traded 52% higher for the year, and 95% above its January low.A host of factors — led by promises of reduced steel production in China — changed early in the year. Prices for iron ore, coal and other commodities ramped sharply higher. A four-week spike and sell-off in commodities and in mining stocks during April and early May raised fears of a bubble. But following a brief consolidation, prices simply stepped back into an uptrend.MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers' top holdings were positioned to take advantage of the cyclical turn. The funds very top positions are in diversified ore miners. Australia's BHP Billiton (BHP) holds a 9.3% weighting in the fund. U.K.-based Rio Tinto (RIO), and Glencore on the London Stock Exchange, weigh in at around 7% apiece.IBD'S TAKE: BHP Billiton ranks 11th in the Mining-Metal Ores group, based on key stock gauges, including earnings, sales and stock price performance. To see which stocks rank in the top four of the group, including a BHP Billiton sister company, check out IBD Stock Checkup.U.S. steelmaker Nucor (NUE) and Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal have weightings near 3%. Other names in the top 10 holdings include Arizona-based miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and South Korean steel maker Posco (PKX).For chart readers, MSCI Global has this year presented an exercise in frustration. The ETF peaked in April, then pulled back and consolidated below that high through the end of September.A two-week pullback from a Dec. 8 high has left the fund finding support at its 10-week moving average. If it holds that support and either rebounds or builds a base pattern, it could create a buy opportunity.A cut below that support — particularly a drop in heavy trade — would flash a sell signal to current shareholders.Going into 2017, a number of the factors that held commodities views down at the end of 2015 are still in place. The dollar is rising even more sharply, and China is now saying it is content if growth slips below the 6.5% mark that it originally targeted over the next four years.Rising oil prices and improving U.S. GDP growth offset those negatives to some degree. But BHP Billiton, in a statement in mid-October, said its oil and gas markets appeared set to improve over the next 12 to 18 months. Iron ore and metallurgical coal prices were ""stronger than expected,"" the statement said, but the company expected supply to continue to outgrow demand ""in the near term.""Barclays has forecast a broad-based recovery in commodities prices during 2017, based on improving demand. Consensus views place earnings growth for BHP at 47% in 2017, with estimates of 50% growth for Rio Tinto. Freeport-McMoRan is poised for a 407% earnings leap, as it continues making its way back from a loss of 13 cents per share in 2015.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

Revenue fell 3% to $737.55 million, but that was the smallest top-line decline in its 7-quarter retreat.Results: Revenue rose 4% to $727.8 million, above views. Worthington reported GAAP earnings of 72 cents, but that's not comparable to estimates for 83 cents. Worthington reported 3 cents in after-tax restructuring charges. Excluding that, Worthington earned 75 cents, which would appear to miss EPS views.Stock: Shares fell nearly 5% to 53.17 in after-hours trading following a regular-session gain of 0.9% to 55.75 on the stock market today. Worthington shot up nearly 20% in November, in part due to postelection gains on hopes for new infrastructure spending and stronger economic growth under a Trump administration.

272,NUE,"Steel Dynamics (STLD) issued weak fourth-quarter profit guidance Friday, a day after Nucor (NUE) gave its own warning.Steel Dynamics sees Q4 adjusted earnings of 40 cents to 44 cents per share, the midpoint below the 44 cents analysts forecast.The company said Q4 steel operations are expected to ""decrease significantly"" vs. Q3 on ""lower shipments and metal spread compression. But it also said flat roll steel selling values and customer order activity "" improved meaningfully"" in November and December and expects the trend to continue into 2017.On Thursday, Nucor said it sees Q4 EPS of 30 to 35 cents, down from 88 cents in Q3 and 46 cents a year ago. Analysts had expected 51 cents. But Nucor pared big early losses to close down 0.3%, though its was the stock's sixth straight retreat. Steel Dynamics, United States Steel (X) and AK Steel (AKS) also closed Thursday higher.But steel makers had a tougher time with a second straight warnings.Steel Dynamics shares fell 1.85% to 36.68 on the stock market today. Nucor shares were down 3.5%. U.S. Steel sank 3.2% to 34.70. AK Steel declined 1.8% to 10.38. Global steel giants ArcelorMittal (MT) retreated 3%.Steel companies' post-Donald Trump election rally has cooled over the past week. During the election, Trump touted plans to invest $1 trillion in infrastructure projects  that require massive amounts of steel. Morgan Stanley said this week that Trump's plans could boost domestic steel demand by 20%. Trump's protectionist instincts, notably in regard to China, also could boost U.S. steel makers.IBD'S TAKE: Steel makers aren't the only companies to see a Trump bump, the banking industry has also rallied after the election.Steel Dynamics said the sequential decline is ""due to lower margins in the steel mills segment"" but it is also bullish on 2017.RELATED: Steel Plays Surge To New Highs On Price Strength, Trump Pledges

273,NUE,"Two regional manufacturing gauges jumped in December, data showed Thursday, reflecting increased ""animal spirits"" for business and investors following President-elect Donald Trump's victory. Meanwhile, home builder sentiment skyrocketed to a boom-era levels despite rising mortgage rates. Consumer inflation jumped to a two-year high in November while weekly jobless claims fell.The Philadelphia Federal Reserve manufacturing index popped to a two-year high of 21.5 vs. 7.6 in November. The New York Fed's Empire State manufacturing index rose by 7.5 points to 9, the strongest since April.Looking ahead, the Philly Fed's outlook gauge nearly doubled to 52.6 from 29.3, hitting the highest since January 2015. The Empire State's future gauge was the best in nearly five years.Higher corporate sentiment could spur more hiring and investment, the latter of which has been poor throughout the current economic expansion.Separately, Markit's flash December reading for U.S. manufacturing nudged higher to a 21-month high.However, many industrial companies are struggling. Nucor (NUE) warned on Q4 profit Thursday morning, initially hitting other steel makers such as U.S. Steel (X) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) on the stock market today. But Nucor pared losses while U.S. Steel turned flat and Steel Dynamics closed higher. Steel stocks have been big postelection winners on hopes for tax cuts, infrastructure spending — and protectionism under a Trump administration.United Technologies (UTX) issued a cautious 2017 outlook late Wednesday, with shares down 1% on Thursday, after undercutting a recent buy point in the prior session.But machinery firm Nordson (NDSN) climbed 3.2% on Thursday after soaring to a record intraday high Wednesday on strong quarterly results.The National Association of Home Builders' Housing Market Index shot up by 7 points to 70, the highest since 2005, near the peak of the housing boom. Economists had expected 63. Readings over 50 signal confidence. Mortgage rates have soared to two-year highs following Trump's election on expectations for faster economic growth, higher inflation and more Federal Reserve hikes. But builders were cheered by the prospect that the real estate mogul will be in the White House.Shares of Toll Bros. (TOL), D.R. Horton (DHI) and LGI Homes (LGIH) initially rose but 0.6%, 2.1% and 3%, respectively.The consumer price index rose 0.2% in November, the Labor Department said. That's in line with views and follows October's 0.4% gain. It was the fourth straight monthly increase, with housing and gasoline fueling November's advance. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, climbed 0.2%.Year over year, consumer prices climbed 1.7%, the most in two years. Core inflation edged up to 2.2%.The Fed has a 2% inflation target, though it's favorite price gauge, the core PCE deflator, is still not at that level. Fed chief Janet Yellen and some policymakers have hinted at a willingness to let the economy run a little hot in the short run.But the Fed did raise rates on Wednesday and forecast three hikes in 2017.Jobless claims fell by 4,000 to a three-week-low 254,000 in the week ended Dec. 10, Labor said. That was in line with analyst estimates and near longtime lows.Claims have stayed below 300,000 for 93 straight weeks, the longest stretch since 1970.
"
274,NUE,"Federal Reserve policymakers, the air traffic controllers of the economy, are likely to signal clear running room for economic growth — and, by extension, the Trump stock-market rally — when they telegraph their views on Wednesday.A quarter-point rate hike, just the second interest-rate increase in a decade, is a mere formality at this point, with markets pricing in a 97% chance. What matters to markets is what the Fed has to say about the rate-hiking outlook for 2017 and beyond via Fed members' quarterly economic projections released along with the 2 p.m. ET policy statement and Chair Janet Yellen's post-meeting press conference.When Fed policymakers last detailed their economic projections in September, they signaled two more quarter-point rate hikes in the coming year and three additional hikes in 2018. Any indication that the Fed is getting antsy about inflation pressures and speeding up this timetable wouldn't go down well with markets. But there are some big reasons to doubt that policymakers will take such a hawkish turn right on the heels of the election.The Fed meeting comes as economic growth is on the upswing and the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index is at a 10-year high. Major stock indexes have surged to record highs amid hopes for President-elect Donald Trump's agenda of tax cuts, an infrastructure-spending binge and regulatory relief. Shares of industrial companies like Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and steel maker Nucor (NUE) have outperformed, as have financials like Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Yet there's still a great deal of uncertainty about what Republicans will be able to pass. With 52 GOP senators, Republicans will have to overcome a Democratic filibuster by passing tax legislation via reconciliation, which requires budget neutrality beyond 10 years.IBD'S TAKE: As the Trump agenda emerges, read IBD Leaderboard and The Big Picture each day to see how market leaders are performing, to find breakout candidates for your watch list, and to  get the best assessment of whether the stock market has more running room. Federal Reserve Board governors and regional bank presidents have continually lowered their economic projections over the past year, so a sudden hawkish shift could renew charges leveled by Trump during the campaign that policymakers had a political agenda all along.At her post-meeting press conference on Sept. 21, Yellen said, ""We found the economy has a bit more running room,"" thanks to more people being attracted into the labor force. While the November employment report showed the jobless rate falling to 4.6% from 4.9%, it's unlikely that the Fed will make too much of a single month's data point in the rather volatile household survey.Yellen has urged caution on raising rates for much of the past year, warning that the Fed has much more leeway to fight inflation than to stimulate the economy with its key interest rate still near zero.""Policymakers have been arguing for fiscal policy to take the baton to boost growth,"" wrote Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons. ""While fiscal policy appears to be on the way, the Fed will wait until fiscal plans have been implemented before altering the outlook for monetary policy in a meaningful way.""At least as far as the Fed is concerned, Trump is likely to get a honeymoon, but it may not be a long one, writes Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.""Chair Yellen will be able to dodge questions on the inflation risks posed by fiscal loosening at Wednesday's press conference, simply by pointing out that no legislation has yet been proposed, let alone passed,"" Shepherdson wrote. ""But the question will have to be addressed directly by the spring, at the latest.""For now, Yellen is likely to take the same tack as she did in her testimony to Congress the week after the election, gently advising members to take into account the concerning fiscal outlook when they formulate tax and spending policies.""With the debt-to-GDP ratio at around 77%, there's not a lot of fiscal space should a shock to the economy occur, an adverse shock that did require fiscal stimulus,"" she said.RELATED:As Trumponomics Cheers Wall Street, Economists FretWhat's Really Doable In Trump's First 100 Days?

278,NUE,"The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey index out Thursday showed a slightly faster pulse for the factory sector, rising to 53.2 from 51.9 in October and matching the high for the year.Economists had expected a slight rise to 52.3. The latest result matches June's reading. The index hasn't been higher since February 2015.The better-than-expected news came as automakers Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) reported better than expected sales in November.The ISM survey showed a pickup in production to 56.0 from 54.6. Readings above 50 signal expansion, while those south of 50 suggest contraction. On a less positive note, the employment index slipped to 52.3 from 52.9.The better tone of economic news, along with the jump in oil prices after OPEC's deal, pushed up the 10-year Treasury yield to 2.46%, the highest since mid-2015.Stocks were mixed after the ISM report, as rising oil prices lifted energy plays and the Dow, while weakness among Facebook (FB) and other big techs sent the Nasdaq lower.The Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates later this month. For now, investors still aren't too worried about the Fed having to hike rates too fast in 2017 to avoid an overheating.While auto sales were apparently boosted by discounts, the bullish consumer and investor mood since the election may have helped. Ford saw double-digit gains in SUV and pickup sales more than offset weakness in small-car sales.Better days for the industrial side of the economy are expected in 2017. Commodity prices have been on the rise and steelmakers such as Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) are expecting to get a lift from President-elect Trump's infrastructure plans, and perhaps various protectionist policies.

Short-term investors will sometimes sell if a stock violates that line after an advance from a breakout.Eagle Materials rose as much as 13% after an opening price gap up Nov. 9 but fell 2.6% Monday afternoon. The stock is trying to cross and hold above the 100 price level. The 100 price area could develop into a support or resistance level.Steel stocks were down, with several testing the 10-day lines. They included Nucor (NUE), Steel Dynamics (STLD) and United States Steel (X).Stocks have gotten extended, and many leaders are well above the traditional 50-day and 200-day lines. Individual investors may wish that leaders would come down and test the 50-day line to create follow-on buy areas, but wishes don't always come true.

Moreover, 58% of the fund is concentrated in steel companies.While most metal and mining stocks have been surging in November, the steel industry is setting the pace. IBD's steel producers industry group is up about 34% so far this month and the specialty alloys group is up more than 25%. By comparison, mining stocks are lagging. IBD's metal ores group is up about 20% in November and the gold and silver mining group is down more than 12%.Copper mining, which has been another hot industry as the metal rallies, comprises 5% of the fund's holdings. Gold makes up 9% and silver nearly 7%.Steel, one of the hardest alloys on the planet, finds itself in a favored market position since the Nov. 8 election. President-elect Donald Trump says he wants to boost spending on infrastructure projects, and steel will be needed to build and fix highways, bridges and airports. Trump also campaigned in support of trade tariffs, and steel mills may benefit from that too.Indeed, the main thrust of the steel rally came the day after the election.Chart readers would find plenty to like by reviewing the major holdings of the ETF, which is a popular vehicle for investing in that sector. (Its average daily volume is nearly 5 million shares a day.)Nucor (NUE) broke out the day after the election and is already extended from a 57.18 buy point. AK Steel Holding (AKS), the single largest piece of the fund, broke out the next day and is up more than 25% from its entry.

"
316,NUE,"Domestic oil output ""is more relevant to the reduction of imports of crude,"" Williams said. ""But it's improving our balance of trade.""The domestic energy production boom fueled by fracking and new discoveries is turning trade into a bigger boost for the economy.A sharp improvement in the petroleum trade balance helped shrink the overall deficit by 21% in December to $38.5 billion, the smallest in nearly three years, the Commerce Department said Friday.The trade data suggest Q4's gross domestic product will be revised to show an expansion vs. the initial 0.1% contraction.Petroleum exports rose 9% vs. November to a record $11.6 billion — up 1,056% from December 1999. Petroleum imports fell 11% to $30.3 billion and were down 21% from a year earlier, as greater U.S. energy output cut demand for foreign supplies.Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, also has unlocked more natural gas, which is now more attractive to U.S. industry as a cheap energy source and chemical feedstock.Cheap Energy EdgeThat, along with other factors like rising foreign wages, is spurring a return of some manufacturing back to the U.S. to further tilt trade to its advantage.Dow Chemical (DOW) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) are building chemical plants in the U.S. while Nucor (NUE) plans to make more steel here using natural gas. Potash (POT) is reopening an ammonia plant closed in 2003.""We're at a very interesting inflection point in the U.S. trade balance,"" said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica.In addition to the steel and chemical industries, cheap U.S. oil and natural gas will benefit a variety of other energy-intensive sectors, Dye added. He has even heard talk of ""reshoring"" toilet manufacturing, which requires a lot of heat to bake ceramics.The drilling process itself will be a long-term economic driver as well, even though the number of rigs has eased, Dye said. Extraction activity will continue to require steel and equipment, pro vide high-paying jobs and boost tax revenue for governments.Increased domestic oil production should keeping holding down imports too. In November, the International Energy Agency predicted fracking will help the U.S. become the world's top oil producer in the next several years before ceding the title again in 20 years.The IEA sees U.S. production of 10 million barrels per day in 2015 growing to 11.1 million in 2020. It expects output from current No. 1 Saudi Arabia to be 10.9 million barrels a day in 2015 but dip to 10.6 million by 2020.The agency forecasts U.S. output will drop again to 9.2 million bpd in 2035, with Saudi production rising to 12.3 million bpd.But the petroleum export boom has less to do with fracking and more to do with U.S. refineries, said James Williams, an energy analyst at WTRG Economics.U.S. laws generally bar domestic crude from being sold over seas. Refined products like diesel are fair game, and most crude that export-oriented U.S. refineries use is imported, he said.But those refineries are more efficient at processing heavy crude, which has been more prevalent in recent discoveries, than foreign rivals are, he said. That has made U.S. refined products increasingly competitive.For all of 2012, exports of fuel oil climbed 14% to $60.2 billion, and exports of other petroleum products rose 4% to $57 billion.Domestic oil output ""is more relevant to the reduction of imports of crude,"" Williams said.

It intends to use proceeds to repay borrowings and for general purposes.Meanwhile, U.S. Steel has beaten analysts' profit forecasts the last three quarters in a row, but its share price has bounced in a narrow range since May amid weakness in both the U.S. and European markets.Its stock has a lackluster IBD Composite Rating of 23 out of a best-possible 99.ArcelorMittal (MT), the world's largest steel producer, slid 0.5% Tuesday afternoon. The company said on Oct. 31 that it plans to cut its dividend to 20 cents a share in 2013, and finance chief Aditya Mittal said the industry is going through ""very challenging operating conditions,"" exacerbated by Europe's long-drawn-out debt crisis.Smaller but highly rated Mexican steel producer Grupo Simec (SIM) dropped 1%. And U.S. Steel's American rival Nucor (NUE), which also earlier warned it expects lower earnings this quarter, edged down a few cents.

671,NUE,"ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report) announced that it is supplying 770 tons of cryogenic steel plates for Shell’s new petrochemical complex that is presently under construction in Pennsylvania. The company produces CryElso 9Q 9% nickel plates through its subsidiary Industeel Creusot, France. The cryogenic steel will be used in the construction of the liquid gas storage units.Notably, the tough steel has the ability to withstand freezing temperatures as low as -160°C and the plates are delivered in 5-30 mm thickness. Moreover, Industeel is one of the top 9% Ni producers across the globe and its range of cryogenic steel is successfully meeting the technological specifications of Shell. The company said that it is well positioned to serve customers in the United States and is proud to be part of this project.Shell’s new petrochemicals complex will use ethane from shale-gas producers to produce 1.6 million metric tons of polyethylene per annum, which is used in making products such as sports equipment, food packaging, furniture and automotive components.ArcelorMittal, which is amongst the prominent steel producers along with Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and United States Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report), logged a net income of $1,039 million or $1.02 per share in fourth-quarter 2017, up from $403 million or 40 cents a year ago. The company’s adjusted earnings came in at 90 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents.According to ArcelorMittal, market conditions are favorable and demand environment remains positive along with healthy steel spreads. The company expects global apparent steel consumption to grow in the range of 1.5-2.5% in 2018.In the United States, the company sees apparent steel consumption growth of 1.5-2.5% in 2018, factoring in higher construction and machinery demand. The company also anticipates 1-2% growth in apparent steel consumption in Europe.Moreover, apparent steel consumption is forecasted to rise 6.5-7.5% in Brazil as the economy is expected to turnaround with improved consumer confidence as construction recovers. Apparent steel consumption in China increased 3.5% in 2017. It is expected to remain close to this level in 2018 as weakness in the real estate sector is likely to be partly offset by strong infrastructure and automotive end markets.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

673,NUE,"We issued an updated research report on Brazilian steelmaker, Gerdau S.A.  on Jan 15.  Strengthening business opportunities from exposure in various end markets, growing steel demand and efforts to dispose non-core assets and lower debt burden will prove advantageous for the company. However, headwinds related to rising costs, raw material supply and industry competition might restrict its growth momentum in the near term.Gerdau currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its market capitalization is approximately $7.9 billion.Market sentiments have been positive for Gerdau, with its American Depository Receipts yielding 30.5% return in the last three months. This gain is above 23.2% rally of the industry it belongs to, in the same period.Below we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring GerdauDomestic & International Steel Demand: We believe that rise in demand for steel will create solid business opportunities for Gerdau. On the domestic front, any investment by the government in infrastructural development will work to the company’s advantage.Per the World Steel Association report, the global steel consumption is predicted to grow 1.6% in 2018. Excluding the demand anticipated from China, steel consumption in the world is predicted to grow 3% in 2018.Business Diversification a Boon: Gerdau is well-poised to benefit from its diversified business structure that primarily includes crude steel (slabs, blooms, billets and flat steel) production and iron ore mining activities. Prime end markets served are construction, wind power, machinery and equipment, agricultural, highway, shipbuilding, and oil and gas.Furthermore, international diversity has played a major role in Gerdau’s profitability over time. The company operates in South America, North America, Europe and Asia. Notably, it derived nearly 32.4% of third-quarter 2017 net revenues from its Brazilian operations while around 51.4% came from North and South American business operations.We believe that such business diversification helps the company lower its risks by allocating investments in various financial instruments, industries and other categories.Inorganic Initiatives Drive Growth: Over time, Gerdau has been restructuring its business portfolio inorganically, aiming to strengthen its core and profitable businesses as well as lowering debt burdens. In this regard, the company divested its business unit — Premier Thermal Solutions, L.L.C. — to Z Capital Partners, L.L.C. in the first half of 2017. It also signed an agreement to sell its 100% stake in the Chilean steel assets in October.The company has continued its efforts in 2018 as well. On Jan 2, it agreed to sell some of its U.S. rebar operations to Commercial Metals Company. This deal will enable the company to concentrate on its other important operations in North America and help in lowering its debt burden.Factors Working Against GerdauPoor Valuation: On a P/E TTM basis, Gerdau seems overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 27.4x and 10.7x. Also, the stock is trading above the average of last three months P/E multiples of 20.7x. This makes us cautious on the stock.Increasing Costs and Huge Debt Levels: Gerdau is suffering from the risks of escalated costs. In the third quarter of 2017, the company’s cost of sales increased 11.1% year over year. Cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, were 89.7% versus 88% in the year-ago quarter. Rise in costs of sales led to year-over-year decline of 170 basis points in gross margin. We believe, if unchecked, rising costs can continue to hurt the company’s margins in the quarters ahead.Also, a high-debt level can lead to heightened financial obligations, posing serious threats to the company’s financial health. Exiting the third quarter, Gerdau’s long-term debt was approximately $14.1 billion.Threats From Raw Materials Supply Disruption & Industry Competition: Major raw materials required for steel making are iron ore and coking coal. Disruption in the supply chain of these materials can jeopardize Gerdau’s steel making operations. Also, raw material imports from intentional suppliers are subject to geopolitical risks and legal permits and duties.In addition, Gerdau faces active competition from other players in the industry.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks in the same space worth considering are Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report), Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (SCHN  -  Free Report) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report). All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings estimates of Nucor and Steel Dynamics improved for 2018 while that for fiscal 2018 increased for Schnitzer Steel, in the last 60 days. Also, financial performance of these stocks has been impressive in the last four quarters, with each pulling off a positive earnings surprise.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

675,NUE,"Nucor Corporation's (NUE  -  Free Report) stock looks promising at the moment. We are positive on the company’s prospects and believe that the time is right for you to add the stock to portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Nucor has outperformed the industry it belongs to over the past three months. The company’s shares have moved up around 4% over this period, compared with roughly 4% decline recorded by the industry.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make this steel giant an attractive investment option. What’s Working in Favor of NUE?Solid Rank & VGM Score: Nucor currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2, offer the best investment opportunities for investors.

Moreover, earnings are expected to register a 91% growth in second-quarter 2018.

The company expects earnings for the quarter in the band of $2.05 to $2.10 per share. That is a significant increase from $1.10 per share recorded in the previous quarter and $1.00 per share it earned a year ago.Nucor noted that the expected increase in second-quarter performance on a sequential comparison basis is due to a significant improvement in performance of the steel mills segment on the back of higher average selling prices and higher profitability across all steel mill product groups, especially sheet mills. The company also sees sequentially higher profitability across its steel products and raw materials segments in the second quarter.The company noted that its improved earnings reflect stronger market conditions, which it believes have been favorably impacted by tax reform, deregulation and higher, stable oil prices.Nucor also believes that there is sustainable strength in steel end-use markets based on the current steel market fundamentals and communications with its customers. The company also said that its steel mill and steel product backlogs have trended upward since the start of 2018 and remain strong. It expects strong performance and profitability to continue through the balance of the year.   Nucor has been focusing on growth through strategic acquisitions and is well positioned to gain from such efforts to expand its business.

676,NUE,"The United States formally imposed the first set of tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports on Jul 6. The trade war has finally been triggered, with China firing counter tariffs on an equal amount on imports from the United States.And if President Donald Trump does what he said he will do, the war will only intensify, with his additional tariffs that could reach an estimated worth of $500 billion Chinese goods. It now needs to be seen, who gains and who loses from the trade war, given that both countries have drawn up a long list of goods and services that will be impacted by higher import duties.Relief for Domestic Steel, Aluminum ManufacturersIn March, Trump announced tariffs of 25% and 10% on imported steel and aluminum, respectively, from China. The announcement came with the objective of protecting domestic steel and aluminum industry by increasing production, which will eventually help create more jobs.Trump’s decision was cheered by domestic steelmakers, as they stand to benefit from the newly imposed tariffs. On Thursday, shares of United States Steel Corporation X and Nucor Corporation NUE jumped 3.1% and 2.1%, respectively, while Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD surged 3.3%. United States Steel Corporation has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Similarly, shares of Alcoa Corporation (AA  -  Free Report), Kaiser Aluminum Corporation (KALU  -  Free Report) and Century Aluminum Company (CENX  -  Free Report) jumped 2.4%, 1% and 0.2%, respectively, on Thursday.Manufacturing Sector to Suffer                                         American companies that earn huge revenues from China or sell products to that country will be hit by tariffs of 15% to 25%. Heavy equipment manufacturers and airplane makers are at the highest risk. Last year, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) earned 13% of its revenues from China. Moreover, the company also entered into a deal with a state-run Chinese company to sell 300 planes for $37 billion.Excavator and earth-moving manufacturing company Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) has more than 20 facilities in China. Other heavy-equipment manufacturers like Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) too will be hit hard as it will find it hard to manufacture equipment with higher-priced steel.Tough Time for Automakers Not only the automakers but the overall auto sector, comprising carmakers, auto parts and transportation companies will bear the brunt of tariffs. For them, the tariffs are more like a double-edged sword. While producing vehicles in the United States will attract higher tariffs in China, producing vehicles in China and importing them back to the United States means paying higher import duty.Almost 30% of General Motors Company’s (GM  -  Free Report) U.S. unit sales are imported from Mexico and China, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) imports 20% of its vehicles from these two countries. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report) manufactures almost 50% of its vehicles in the United States, while the rest is imported from its Mexico and Canada plants. Tech Companies to Take a HitMany tech companies earn a significant portion of their revenues from China. Thus, a trade war will definitely affect tech companies, particularly chipmakers with significant exposure to China.The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest market. Higher tariffs will take a toll on the revenues of these semiconductor manufacturers. Qualcomm has tie-ups with a large number of Chinese companies, including Huawei. Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) too generates almost 60% of its revenues from China.Similarly, other semiconductor giants like Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm depend heavily on the Chinese market. In fact, Apple and Intel Corporation INTC are among the top 16 U.S. companies that generated a total of $105.5 billion from China in 2017. Qualcomm, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA generated respectively 16.6%, 9.5% and 1.9% of their revenues from China.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

677,NUE,"Trade worries between the United States and China, which cast a pall on Wall Street for months, have eased. This is especially true as the world’s largest economies dropped their tariff threats and set up a framework for addressing potential trade imbalances in the future.The Latest Development Beijing has agreed to substantially reduce America's massive trade deficit with China but did not commit any specific amount. The Trump administration wanted to slash the deficit by $200 billion. China has promised to purchase more U.S. goods and services that would support growth and employment in the United States and increase U.S. agriculture and energy exports.The U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expects a big increase of 35-45% in domestic farm sales to China for this year and a doubling in sales of U.S. energy products to the Chinese market increasing energy exports by $50-$60 billion in the next three to five years. Morgan Stanley estimates it could take up to three years to increase Chinese purchases of U.S. goods by $60-$90 billion, with a rise in agricultural imports in the near term followed by energy.Though the talks are in the initial stage, it has cooled down tensions, which have heightened since the Trump administration proposed tariffs of $50 billion on Chinese goods and threatened to extend the levies to an additional $150 billion. China retaliated with its own measures targeting U.S. agriculture.Market ImpactThe news has injected fresh optimism into the markets, giving a fresh lease of life to the stocks.

679,NUE,"Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) has provided guidance for fourth-quarter 2017. The steel giant expects earnings for the quarter in the band of 50-55 cents per share. This is a decrease from 79 cents per share recorded in the previous quarter and is comparable to 50 cents earned a year ago.The company’s guidance for the quarter fell short of expectations. Analysts polled by Zacks currently expect earnings of 75 cents per share for the quarter.Nucor’s projections for the fourth quarter excludes any estimates related to the impact of the proposed federal tax legislation in the United States. Notably, third-quarter earnings included a net benefit of $13.2 million or 4 cents per share associated with tax return true-ups and state credits as well as expense of $22.5 million or 5 cents per share pertaining to certain legal matters. Moreover, fourth-quarter 2016 earnings benefitted from the effect of change in estimate to the cost of certain inventories of $77.6 million or 16 cents.The company believes that the overall market demand in the fourth-quarter 2017 has been strong. However, expected earnings in the steel mills unit will be negatively impacted by margin compression owing to the surge of imports experienced in the summer of 2017. This pressure from imports along with weakness in plate steel has caused the company to lower its fourth earnings estimate for the steel mills segment. Nucor anticipates similar results for the steel products unit in the fourth quarter compared to the third-quarter 2017.Nucor Steel Louisiana witnessed an unplanned outage during fourth-quarter 2017 and resumed operations in early this month. However, this outage was shorter than the unplanned outages experienced during the last quarter. Because of this, Nucor expect earnings of the raw materials unit in the fourth quarter to improve from the third quarter.Nucor noted that the U.S. steel industry continues to be adversely affected by steel imports. The finished steel imports for the first ten months accounted for about 28% share of the American market and increased an anticipated 19.4% from the year-ago period.However, the industry continues to combat unfair traded imports. Since the beginning of the year, the United States Department of Commerce has made several ruling imposing duties on additional steel products which are favorable for the domestic steel industry.     Nucor is encouraged by market conditions as it heads into 2018. The company expects the recently announced price hikes and the downward trend in imports late in the year from the mid-year peak to build positive momentum.Moreover, automotive market continues to remain healthy and the company is increasing penetration of new automotive platforms. Nonresidential construction markets are stable at a level considerably below peak 2007 levels, while energy markets continue their recovery from the depressed levels experienced in late 2014 and 2015. Agriculture and heavy equipment are continuing to show signs of improvement and in general, Nucor is optimistic on expected overall industrial production in 2018.Shares of Nucor have gained 9.1% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s 6.8% growth.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report), Daqo New Energy Corp.

680,NUE,"Shares of major American steel makers got a lift yesterday after the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) issued positive preliminary rulings on imports of corrosion-resistant steel (CORE) and certain cold-rolled steel flat products into the United States from Vietnam that are made from materials originating in China. The DOC has imposed heavy tariffs on these imports after finding that they have been skirting U.S. anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders.Shipments of CORE to the United States from Vietnam have surged to $80 million from $2 million after preliminary duties were levied on Chinese products in 2015. Moreover, cold-rolled steel shipments from Vietnam to the United States have shot up to $215 million from $9 million after preliminary duties were imposed on Chinese products two years ago.Domestic producers of CORE and cold-rolled steel including United States Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report), AK Steel Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report), Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and ArcelorMittal USA LLC, part of ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), had filed the complaint in September 2016.The DOC will now instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to start requiring cash deposits on imports of CORE and cold-rolled steel made in Vietnam using substrate originating in China.The CBP will collect anti-dumping and countervailing cash deposits on imports of CORE made in Vietnam using Chinese-origin substrate at rates of 199.43% and 39.05%, respectively. Moreover, the CBP will collect anti-dumping and countervailing cash deposits at rates of 265.79% and 256.44%, respectively, on cold-rolled steel imported from Vietnam that are produced from substrate originating from China.The DOC is expected to issue its final rulings on these investigations on Feb 16, 2018.Steel Stocks Take Flight  The ruling marks yet another victory for crisis-hit U.S. steel companies in their ongoing battle against unfairly-traded, subsidized imports that continue to flood the American market.The DOC’s ruling provided a boost to the stocks of leading domestic steel companies that are struggling to cope with a renewed tide of cheap steel imports this year. U.S. Steel racked up the biggest gain with its shares rising as much 7.8% yesterday.  AK Steel’s shares popped 6.6% while Steel Dynamics and Nucor notched up 3.7% and 2.5% gains, respectively.U.S. Steel lauded the DOC’s move and said, in a statement, yesterday that “The Commerce Department’s finding of circumvention represents a critical step to shutting down one of the many paths used to flood the U.S. with dumped and subsidized steel."" The steel giant also urged President Trump and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to take immediate and broad action in the Section 232 investigation on steel imports and national security.AK Steel also hailed the ruling and stated that ""We are pleased with this decisive action by the Commerce Department against foreign producers and importers who have been and continue to attempt to circumvent our trade laws.""U.S. Steel, Nucor, AK Steel and Steel Dynamics each carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Imports Still Haunt U.S. Steel MillsImports of cheap steel continue to flood American shores despite a string of punitive trade actions (in the form of heavy tariffs) and threats of further future measures. Total steel imports have shot up roughly 19% to around 32.9 million net tons through the first ten months of 2017 – according to the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), an association of North American steel makers.    Finished steel imports for the same period also increased roughly 15% to around 25.4 million net tons, per the AISI. Year to date, finished steel import market share is estimated at 28%, which is higher than 26% clocked in full-year 2016.A surge in steel imports put pressure on U.S. steel prices during the third quarter. Continued import pressure has not allowed steel pricing to keep pace with higher raw material costs during the quarter.U.S. steel makers continue to pin their hopes on President Trump imposing new restrictions on imported steel. The Trump administration, in April 2017, ordered an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security.However, the Trump administration has delayed the release of the report on the Section 232 probe, which was initially expected at the end of June 2017. The Commerce Department has until mid-January 2018 to conclude the investigation.A positive outcome from the investigation will give the Trump administration the opportunity to take broad-based trade actions (in the form of tariffs or quotas) against cheap imports. This would also give domestic steel makers more pricing power.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

681,NUE,"Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) declared that its board has increased the regular quarterly cash dividend on Nucor's common stock to 38 cents. The revised dividend reflects a roughly 0.7% increase from the prior payout of 37.75 cents per share.This cash dividend is payable on Feb 9, 2018, to stockholders on record as of Dec 29, 2017. This also marks Nucor's 179th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The company has hiked dividend for 45 straight years since 1973 and has returned more than $5 billion in capital to stockholders in the form of dividends, share repurchases and supplemental dividends. Nucor’s shares have moved up 4.6% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s 3.3% gain.  Nucor, in October, said that it expects generally stable and improving market conditions for automotive, energy, nonresidential construction, agriculture and heavy equipment. It is also encouraged by the cumulative benefits resulting from successful trade cases of the domestic steel industry.Nucor has been focusing on growth through strategic acquisitions over the past several years. The purchase of Gallatin Steel has strengthened its foothold in the key Midwest market and allowed it to better serve its flat-rolled customers in the growing pipe and tube segment. The buyout of Independence Tube Corporation has also reinforced the company's foothold in the key non-residential construction end-use market. Moreover, the buyout of Southland Tube strengthened Nucor’s foothold in the hollow structural section (HSS) steel tubing market.The company is seeing continued momentum in the automotive market. It remains focused on achieving greater penetration of this major market. Nucor has entered into a joint venture with JFE Steel Corporation of Japan to build and operate a plant in Mexico that will supply sheet steel to the country’s growing automotive market.Nucor also remains committed to boost its production capacity. The company, last month, said that it will build a full-range merchant bar quality (MBQ) mill at its bar steel mill located in Bourbonnais, IL. The MBQ mill, which is likely to cost $180 million, will have an annual capacity of 500,000 tons. The project is expected to be completed in two years.However, Nucor expects fourth-quarter 2017 earnings to be similar to slightly decreased from the third quarter. It also sees some declines in the steel mills segment mainly due to seasonality factors and weakness in plate steel. In third-quarter 2017, steel mills unit witnessed decreased profitability on a sequential-comparison basis while performance of plate mills decreased considerably. Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus  Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus | Nucor Corporation Quote Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report), Daqo New Energy Corp.

682,NUE,"No reprieve for U.S. steel makers yet as imports of cheap steel continue to flood American shores despite a string of punitive trade actions (in the form of heavy tariffs). Steel imports have shot up roughly 19% year to date – according to a recent report from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), an association of North American steel makers.    Per AISI, based on preliminary U.S. Census Bureau data, total U.S. steel imports went up 19.4% year over year to roughly 32.9 million net tons through the first ten months of 2017. Finished steel imports for the same period also increased 15.4% to around 25.4 million net tons. Year to date, finished steel import market share is estimated at 28%, which is higher than 26% clocked in full-year 2016.Major finished steel products that have showed a significant year-to-date increase in imports on a year-over-year basis include oil country goods (up 231%), line pipe (up 68%), standard pipe (up 44%), mechanical tubing (up 34%), cold rolled (up 26%), sheets & strip all other metallic coatings (up 25%), hot rolled bars (up 21%) and sheets & strip hot dipped galvanized (up 17%).The biggest offshore suppliers for the ten-month period were South Korea with 3,328,000 net tons (up 2% year over year), Turkey with 2,065,000 net tons (down 1%), Japan with 1,307,000 net tons (down 17%), Taiwan with 1,148,000 net tons (up 35%) and Germany with 1,160,000 net tons (up 14%).Imports Remain a Pressing ProblemNotwithstanding a raft of stringent trade actions and threats of further future measures, imports continue to flow into the U.S. market due to foreign producers’ overcapacity.U.S. steel producers including Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report), United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS  -  Free Report), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and Commercial Metals Co. (CMC  -  Free Report) have raised concerns about a renewed flood of subsidized imports this year. While positive rulings in trade cases (resulting in levy of heavy tariffs) against China last year led to a decline in Chinese steel exports to the United States, imports from other countries remain at above historical levels.According to AISI data, steel imports from China fell roughly 6% year over year through the first ten months of 2017. However, imports from other countries such as Russia, Taiwan, Germany, South Korea and Brazil have spiked over this period.A surge in steel imports put pressure on U.S. steel prices during the third quarter. Continued import pressure has not allowed steel pricing to keep pace with higher raw material costs during the quarter.Can Section 232 Bring Respite?U.S. steel makers continue to pin their hopes on President Trump imposing new restrictions on imported steel. The Trump administration, in April 2017, ordered an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The Section 232 probe is aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security and also gives the President the power to impose broad tariffs or quotas on imported steel.However, the Trump administration has delayed the release of the report on the Section 232 probe, which was initially expected at the end of June 2017. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in an interview told Bloomberg in September that a decision on steel tariffs has been delayed until after the completion of the tax reform.The U.S. Department of Commerce has until mid-January 2018 to conclude the investigation. A delay in the Section 232 probe has triggered a spike in steel imports into the American market in the recent months.Nevertheless, major U.S. steel makers such as Nucor, U.S. Steel and AK Steel remain optimistic about the Section 232 investigation. Nucor’s Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias, in the third-quarter earnings call, said that he remains confident that President Trump will fulfil his commitments to the steel industry. Moreover, U.S. Steel’s CEO, David B. Burritt, during third-quarter call, said that “We're still fairly optimistic that 232 will have a meaningful impact on the continued unfair trade practices that are harming domestic steel.”Both Nucor and U.S. Steel currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.While the findings from the Section 232 steel investigation are due, a positive outcome from the probe will give the Trump administration the opportunity to take broad-based trade actions against cheap imports. This would provide a significant thrust to steel prices and give domestic steel makers more pricing power.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

683,NUE,"ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report) – the biggest steel producer on the planet – is having an impressive run of late, thanks to improving global steel market conditions and the company’s internal initiatives.The Luxembourg-based company has seen its shares shoot up roughly 34% so far this year. The stock is also up around 29% over the last six months.ArcelorMittal has also seen strong earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming more bullish on the firm’s prospects in both the short and long term. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has shot up roughly 16% over the last 30 days. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has risen roughly 9% over the same period.  This has helped ArcelorMittal to earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), further underscoring the company’s solid position. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.ArcelorMittal also sports a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy), offer the best investment opportunities for investors.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make this steel behemoth an intriguing choice for investors right now.Above the IndustryArcelorMittal has significantly outperformed the industry it belongs to year to date. The company’s shares have gained 28.2% over this period, compared with roughly 4.4% gain recorded by the industry.Moreover, the company has outperformed other major players in the steel space such as United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS  -  Free Report), Olympic Steel, Inc.  and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) over the same timeframe. Shares of U.S. Steel, Nucor, AK Steel and Olympic Steel have lost roughly 18%, 8%, 57% and 21%, respectively, year to date while Steel Dynamics has gained a paltry 4%. Valuation Looks AttractiveGoing by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries like steel, ArcelorMittal is currently trading at trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 4.9, lower compared with the industry average of 6.3. The stock also looks cheaper compared with U.S. Steel, Nucor, AK Steel, Steel Dynamics and Olympic Steel with respective readings of 6.3, 8.4, 5.8, 7.8 and 10.6.Strong Q3 & Upbeat OutlookArcelorMittal delivered solid results in third-quarter 2017. The company saw its profits zoom around 77% year over year to roughly $1.2 billion or $1.18 per share in the quarter. Earnings per share also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents.In fact, the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of around 42%.Higher steel shipments as well as improved steel and seaborne iron ore prices led to a roughly 22% year over year rise in revenues to $17,639 million in the third quarter. Total steel shipments rose around 7% while steel selling prices went up roughly 15% in the quarter.   ArcelorMittal, in its third-quarter call, said that market conditions are favorable and demand environment remains positive along with healthy steel spreads. It continues to see global apparent steel consumption to grow in the range of 2.5-3% for 2017.Steel market conditions have improved lately, driven by favorable developments on steel trade cases across the United States and Europe in the recent past, providing reprieve to steel producers including ArcelorMittal. The overall demand fundamentals for steel also remain healthy. ArcelorMittal also gained from higher steel prices in the third quarter, driven by strong pricing in Europe – the company’s biggest market.China’s actions to reduce its excess steel supply are also expected to lend support to global steel prices moving ahead. Beijing has started implementing a four-month reduction in output to streamline its burgeoning steel sector and control pollution during the winter months. China plans to cut its steel production capacity by around 50 million metric tons in 2017 in a bid to reduce overcapacity.China’s finished steel exports also slumped around 35% year over year to 4.98 million tons in October, per data released by the General Administration of Customs. The country’s steel exports are also down roughly 30% for the first ten months of 2017. Positive rulings in trade cases (resulting in levy of heavy tariffs) against China is contributing to a decline in Chinese steel exports.Action 2020 Initiatives to Boost ProfitabilityArcelorMittal remains focused on implementing strategic measures under its Action 2020 plan to drive profitability. The Action 2020 plan, a strategic roadmap for each of the company’s key segments, targets a structural EBITDA improvement of about $3 billion. Upon full achievement of the plan, the company expects to deliver free cash flow of more than $2 billion annually. The company’s EBITDA jumped roughly 36% year over year to around $6.3 billion in the first nine months of 2017.ArcelorMittal also remains on track with its cost-reduction actions under the Action 2020 program. The program contributed $900 million to operating results in 2016 and is expected to make a healthy contribution in 2017.Also, in sync with the Action 2020 plan, ArcelorMittal recently announced a three-year investment program of roughly $1 billion at its Mexican operations. The investment, which is geared toward improving the quality and efficiency of operations, will allow ArcelorMittal Mexico to produce 2.5 million tons of flat rolled steel that will be supplied to customers of domestic non-auto and general industry.Ilva Buyout to Provide Attractive Growth PlatformThe planned acquisition of Ilva S.p.A. in Italy represents another attractive growth opportunity for ArcelorMittal. Ilva is expected to be a good investment without compromising on the strength of the company’s balance sheet. It will provide an opportunity to expand leadership and product offering in Italy, the second-largest steel producing and consuming market in Europe.The buyout is expected to create synergies of €310 million by 2020, excluding impact from volume improvements and fixed cost reductions. Ilva is also expected to be EBITDA accretive to ArcelorMittal in one year, and free cash flow accretive in three years.Deleveraging Actions on TrackArcelorMittal remains highly focused on deleveraging its balance sheet. It has cut net debt by nearly 45% over the past five years. Proceeds from the company’s $3 billion rights issue and the sale of its minority stake in automotive metals component company Gestamp have helped it to pare debt and strengthen its balance sheet. The company's net debt fell by $0.2 billion year over year in the third quarter.ArcelorMittal’s sustained commitment to cut debt is leading to lower net interest expenses (down 20% year over year in the third quarter). These moves are also expected to lead to better operational performance in the long run.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

The MBQ mill, which is likely to cost $180 million, will have an annual capacity of 500,000 tons. The project is expected to be completed in two years. The setting up of the latest MBQ mill is in sync with the company’s long-term growth strategy. The move builds on the company’s position as a low-cost producer to displace tons which are being supplied by competitors outside the region. Additionally, it will strengthen Nucor’s product offerings of merchant bar, light shapes and structural angle and channel in markets in the central United States.  With this project, Nucor will be able to fully utilize the company's existing bar mill’s melt capacity and infrastructure. The project will also take advantage of ample scrap supply in the Midwest region and Nucor’s footprint in the central United States.  Nucor’s shares have lost 2.1% over the past six months underperforming the 11% gain of the industry it belongs to.   Nucor logged a profit of $268.5 million or 83 cents per share for third-quarter 2017, compared with earnings of $305.4 million or 95 cents it registered a year ago. Barring one-time items, earnings per share for the quarter were 79 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents. Revenues increased roughly 20.5% year over year to $5,170.1 million in the reported quarter from $4,290.2 million, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,276 million. The company expects generally stable and improving market conditions for automotive, energy, nonresidential construction, agriculture and heavy equipment.  It is also encouraged by the cumulative benefits resulting from successful trade cases of the domestic steel industry. The company expects earnings in fourth-quarter 2017 to be to be similar to slightly lower from the third quarter, excluding tax benefits recognized during the quarter. Nucor expects improved performance from the raw materials unit on the back of consistent DRI production. Its downstream steel products unit is also expected to benefit from margin improvement whereas the steel mills unit is expected to suffer a decline due to weakness in plate steel and typical seasonality. Nucor remains committed to expand its production capabilities and grow its business through strategic acquisitions.

686,NUE,"Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Oct 19.The steel giant witnessed its profits surge year over year in second-quarter 2017, but its earnings and sales fell short of expectations. Nucor logged a profit of $323 million or $1.00 per share for the second quarter, compared to earnings of $243.6 million or 76 cents it registered a year ago. The figure, however, trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07.Revenues went up around 22% year over year to $5,174.8 million in the second quarter, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,307.8 million.  Nucor beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing in the other two, with an average positive surprise of 8.99%.Shares of Nucor have declined 4.8% in the last three months, significantly underperforming the industry’s 6.6% growth.  Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLast month, Nucor provided its revised guidance for third-quarter 2017 and it expects earnings for the quarter in the band of 75-80 cents per share. This is a decrease from $1.00 per share recorded in the previous quarter and 95 cents it earned a year ago.Notably, expected earnings for the third quarter are also lower than the qualitative guidance provided by the company during its second-quarter 2017 earnings call in July. Earlier, the company had expected earnings in the third quarter to be in a band similar to the quarterly results of first-half 2017.Nucor expects a decrease in earnings of the steel mills segment in third-quarter 2017 on a sequential-comparison basis. Regardless of higher utilization rates at its sheet mills, continued import pressure has not allowed pricing to keep pace with rising input costs during the quarter. Earnings of plate mills unit are also anticipated to be considerably less owing to tepid demand in plate end-use markets.The company expects profitability of its steel products unit to improve on a sequential basis in the third-quarter 2017, but less than what was witnessed a year ago. Non-residential construction indicators are showing signs of marginal improvement compared to activity levels in 2016.Moreover, Nucor Steel Louisiana was affected from unexpected outages for most of third-quarter 2017, which caused the company to lower its forecasted earnings estimate for the raw materials segment. The unit halted production in late July for repairing materials handling systems and to address other equipment issues.  Despite the punitive trade actions in the recent past (in the form of imposition of heavy tariffs on imports), the U.S. steel industry still remains under the risk of cheaper imports. Despite the U.S. steel industry’s low capacity utilization, imports continue to flow into the domestic market due to foreign producers’ overcapacity. In the first eight months of 2017, finished steel imports have increased by an estimated 16.5% year over year, and accounted for about 28% share of the American market.Nucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Nucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Nucor Corporation Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nucor is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Nucor for the third quarter is -13.54%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 78 cents and 91 cents, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Nucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

687,NUE,"The steel industry remains on a slow road to recovery. Notwithstanding a few lingering headwinds, the industry ended the third quarter on a positive note, racking up a market-thumping return.   The Zacks Steel Producers industry gained around 7.5% in the September quarter, higher than the S&P 500’s corresponding return of roughly 3.8%.While the overall demand fundamentals for steel remain healthy, the industry is still challenged by sustained overcapacity. The global steel industry continues to reel under the effects of excess capacity – the biggest obstacle to persistent growth and profitability.   Meanwhile, U.S. steel mills remain impacted by low capacity utilization and a more pressing problem – renewed flood of cheap imports. A surge in steel imports have put downward pressure on U.S. steel prices during the third quarter.Steel Demand Poised for Steady RecoveryThe steel industry is poised to benefit from solid demand in the United States and emerging markets this year. The World Steel Association (WSA) – the international trade body for the iron and steel industry – expects global steel demand to expand 1.3% in 2017 following a 1% rise in 2016.A cyclical upturn in steel demand is expected to be supported by an ongoing recovery in the developed economies along with an accelerating growth momentum in the emerging and developing economies.The United States is expected to lead growth in the developed world thanks to strong fundamentals, measures related to fiscal stimuli and rising infrastructure spending. Steel demand in the United States is expected to rise 3% this year.Demand in emerging and developing economies (barring China) is also expected to rise 4% this year.Too Much Steel Poses a ConcernThe global steel industry continues bear the brunt of a surge in production in China – the world's biggest steel maker. According to WSA, global crude steel production went up 4.9% year over year during the first eight months of 2017.Output from China, which accounts for around half of the global production, climbed 5.6% year over year during the first eight months of the year. Production from the country also shot up 8.7% year over year to a monthly record of 74.6 Mt in August.China’s steel juggernaut continues to gather steam notwithstanding the global production glut. Steel mills in the country are ramping up production to take advantage of a spike in domestic steel prices that translates to higher profits for the industry.Nevertheless, production cuts are expected later this year as Beijing pushes forward with supply-side structural reform to streamline its burgeoning steel sector. China, earlier this year, announced plans to cut its steel production capacity by around 50 million metric tons in 2017 in a bid to reduce overcapacity and control pollution.Imports Still Haunting U.S. MillsThe American market continues to be inundated with cheap steel imports from overseas producers despite a raft of punitive trade actions. According to a recent report from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), total and finished steel imports for the first eight months of 2017 shot up 20.6% and 15.5% year over year, respectively. Year to date, finished steel import market share is estimated at 28%, which is higher than 26% clocked in full-year 2016.While positive rulings in trade cases (resulting in levy of heavy tariffs) against China last year led to a decline in Chinese steel exports to the United States, imports from other countries remain at above historical levels.U.S. steel producers, Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) recently provided lower-than-expected earnings guidance for the third quarter saying that high levels of steel imports have put pressure on domestic steel prices during the quarter.Continued import pressure has not allowed steel pricing to keep pace with higher raw material costs during the third quarter. U.S. hot-rolled coil steel prices retreated in September and some analysts expect prices to weaken through the balance of the year. High import levels are likely to keep U.S. steel prices in check.Can Section 232 Bring Relief?U.S. steel makers are pinning their hopes on President Trump imposing new restrictions on imported steel. Steel stocks got a shot in the arm in April 2017 after the Trump administration ordered an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The Section 232 probe is aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security and also gives the President the power to impose broad tariffs or quotas on imported steel.However, the Trump administration has delayed the release of the report on the Section 232 probe, which was initially expected at the end of June 2017. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in an interview told Bloomberg last month that a decision on steel tariffs has been delayed until after the completion of the tax reform. The U.S. Department of Commerce has until mid-January 2018 to conclude the investigation.A delay in the Section 232 probe has triggered a spike in steel imports into the American market in the recent months. While the findings from the Section 232 steel investigation are due, a positive outcome from the probe will give the Trump administration the opportunity to take broad-based trade actions against cheap imports. This would provide a significant thrust to steel prices and give domestic steel makers more pricing power.5 Market-Beating Steel StocksThe steel industry fared well in the September quarter outperforming the broader market, notwithstanding the headwinds still plaguing the industry as discussed above.

688,NUE,"The U.S. steel industry put up a commendable performance in the first quarter. We note that a host of American steel producers including United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) racked up better-than-expected earnings in the quarter, driven by a rally in U.S. steel prices.Steel prices have been on an upswing in the United States on the back of the Trump administration’s trade actions to curb imports, reflected by the run-up in hot-rolled steel prices.The Trump administration, in March, slapped a 25% tariff on steel imports aimed at protecting the U.S. steel industry which had long struggled to cope with a tide of subsidized foreign imports. The tariffs are the result of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s investigations, which were carried out under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to determine whether the imports pose a threat to national security.The tariffs would lead to lower imports into the United States, which would in turn boost demand for American steel and also give domestic steel makers more pricing power.According to the American Iron and Steel Institute (“AISI”), an association of North American steel makers, total and finished steel imports dipped 3% and 1.7%, respectively, year over year in the first quarter. For 2018, annualized total and finished steel imports are expected to decline 8.8% and 7.6% year over year, respectively, per the AISI.While there are still uncertainties surrounding exemptions of countries from the Trump tariff orders, there is no denying the fact that the trade actions have instilled optimism in the long-struggling American steel industry. The trade tariffs contributed to a spike in U.S. steel prices, driving the performance of domestic steel makers in the first quarter. The pricing momentum is likely to continue in the second quarter, thereby providing a boost to margins of U.S. steel players.The Zacks Steel Producers industry has outperformed the broader market (S&P 500) over the past six months. The industry has gained around 26% in this period, topping the S&P 500’s corresponding return of around 5.3%. In this write up, we run a comparative analysis on two major U.S. steel stocks –  Nucor and U.S. Steel – to figure out which one is a better option for investment right now. While Nucor sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), U.S. Steel is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Both Nucor and U.S. Steel delivered forecast-topping earnings performance in the first quarter, buoyed by higher selling prices. Nucor reported a 9% year over year increase in average sales price in the first quarter. Moreover, U.S. Steel swung to a profit in the first quarter on the back of improved results across all three of its reportable segments. The company saw higher average realized prices across its segments in the quarter.Nucor, during its first-quarter call, noted that it expects its earnings in the second quarter to increase considerably from the first. It expects steel mills segment’s performance to improve sequentially in the second quarter as it continues to see the benefits of price increases.U.S. Steel, on the other hand, said that it is presently experiencing some operational challenges at its steelmaking facility at Great Lakes Works. As a result, it expects to have an unfavorable EBITDA impact of roughly $30 million on second-quarter results. However, U.S. Steel believes that adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter will be roughly $400 million, reflecting a sequential increase from $255 million in the first quarter.Let's take a closer look at how U.S. Steel and Nucor are stacked up against each other in terms of certain key metrics.Price PerformanceU.S. Steel’s shares have rallied 95.8% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 46.8%. On the other hand, Nucor’s shares have gained 17.7% over the same period, underperforming the industry. As such, U.S. Steel clearly scores above Nucor. Earnings Surprise HistoryWith respect to surprise, U.S. Steel beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. In this timeframe, it came up with an average negative surprise of 56.7%. On the other hand, Nucor has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 3.8%.Growth ExpectationsIn terms of earnings growth expectations, Nucor scores way above U.S. Steel. The expected earnings per share growth rate for Nucor for the second quarter currently stands at 69% compared with an expected increase of 4.7% for U.S. Steel.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. U.S. Steel has a debt-to-equity ratio of 74.8, while the industry has debt-to-equity ratio of 66.8. In contrast, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 40.9 Nucor wins this round. Current RatioThis metric measures the ability of a company to meet its short-term debt obligations efficiently. In other words, it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and versus the current level of liabilities. Here, Nucor is a clear winner with a current ratio of 2.49, which is superior to U.S. Steel’s reading of 1.63. ValuationGoing by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, which is often used to value steel stocks, U.S. Steel looks cheaper compared with Nucor.In case of Nucor, the trailing 12-months EV/EBITDA ratio is 9.9, which is above its own average of 8.9 in the past one year. Moreover, it is overvalued than the industry that has a reading of 8.1. On the other hand, U.S. Steel is cheaper with a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 5.9. Dividend YieldNucor has a current dividend yield of 2.31% while U.S. Steel has a dividend yield of 0.53%. Nucor’s dividend yield is also higher than the broader industry’s average dividend yield of 1.44%. Hence, on a comparable basis, Nucor shareholders earned a better dividend yield than U.S. Steel.  The VerdictOur comparative analysis shows that U.S. Steel holds an edge over Nucor in terms of price performance, earnings surprise history and valuation. However, when considering earnings growth projections, dividend yield, current ratio and debt-to-equity ratio, Nucor seems to be the preferred stock. As the scale is tipped in favor of Nucor, it makes a better investment proposition compared to U.S. Steel.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

690,NUE,"A layman can end up losing bucks if he decides to pick a stock only on the basis of numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is essential for a better investment decision.Often investors evaluate a company’s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company’s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the role of coverage ratios comes into play — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for a majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. And the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.The Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: A Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screening:Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report), which manufactures and sells steel and steel products, has a VGM Score of B. Its expected EPS growth rate for 3-5 years is pegged at 12%. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Lithia Motors, Inc. (LAD  -  Free Report), which operates automotive franchises, and retails new and used vehicles, has a VGM Score of A and an expected EPS growth rate of 16.9% for 3-5 years. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.Grand Canyon Education, Inc. (LOPE  -  Free Report), which provides postsecondary education services, has a VGM Score of B. This Zacks Rank #2 company has an expected EPS growth rate of 14.5% for 3-5 years.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), which designs, develops, manufactures, sales and services commercial jetliners, military aircraft, has a VGM Score of B. This Zacks Rank #2 company has an expected EPS growth rate of 13.8% for 3-5 years.Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), which operates, franchises, and licenses hotel, has a VGM Score of B.

692,NUE,"Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) recently provided guidance for third-quarter 2017. The steel giant expects earnings for the quarter in the band of 75-80 cents per share. This is a decrease from $1.00 per share recorded in the previous quarter and 95 cents a share it earned a year ago.The company’s guidance for the quarter fell short of expectations. Analysts polled by Zacks currently expect earnings of $1.03 per share for the quarter. Expected earnings for the third quarter are also lower than the qualitative guidance provided by the company in its second-quarter 2017 earnings call in July. Earlier, the company had expected earnings in the third quarter to be in a band similar to the quarterly results of first-half 2017.Outages & Steel Imports to Dent EarningsNucor expects a decrease in earnings of the steel mills segment in third-quarter 2017 on a sequential comparison basis. Regardless of higher utilization rates at its sheet mills, continued import pressure has not allowed pricing to keep pace with rising input costs during the quarter. Earnings of plate mills unit are also anticipated to be considerably less owing to tepid demand in plate end use markets.Moreover, Nucor Steel Louisiana was affected from unexpected outages for most of third-quarter 2017, which caused the company to lower its forecasted earnings estimate for the raw materials segment. The unit halted production in late July for repairing materials handling systems and address other equipment issues. Operations are expected to resume in October.Nucor expects profitability of its steel products unit to improve on sequential basis in the third-quarter 2017, but less than what was witnessed a year ago. Non-residential construction indicators are showing signs of marginal improvement compared to activity levels in 2016.Nucor noted that the U.S. steel industry continues to be adversely affected by steel imports. The finished steel imports for the first eight months accounted for about 28% share of the American market and increased an anticipated 16.5% from the year-ago period.However, the industry continues to combat unfair traded imports. Since the beginning of the year, the United States Department of Commerce imposed duties on additional steel products which are favorable for the domestic steel industry.  Price Performance Shares of Nucor have declined 4.2% in the last three months against the industry’s 16.8% growth. Acquisitions & Expansions to Aid GrowthNucor, in early 2017, wrapped up its purchase of steel electrical conduit maker, Republic Conduit, from Luxembourg-based Tenaris S.A. for $335 million. The acquisition is expected to make Nucor a market leader in steel electrical conduits. Moreover, the company acquired Southland Tube for $130 million in January 2017. The buyout strengthens Nucor’s foothold in the hollow structural section (HSS) steel tubing maker.Nucor is also expected to gain from continued momentum in the automotive market. The company remains focused on achieving greater penetration of this major market. The company has entered into a joint venture with JFE Steel Corporation of Japan to build and operate a plant in Mexico, which will supply sheet steel to the country’s growing automotive market. Construction of the plant started in June has the capacity to produce 400,000 tons annually.Nucor, in May, also announced that it will build a hot band galvanizing line at its sheet mill in Kentucky that will serve its objective of growing share in the automotive market. The $176 million project is expected to expand the product capabilities of Nucor Steel Gallatin and the new line will have an annual capacity of 500,000 tons.Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus  Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus | Nucor Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksNucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A.

697,NUE,"Steel is utilized in every important industry ranging from energy, construction, automotive and transportation, infrastructure, packaging and machinery. A favorable global economic scenario, commodity prices and perked up investment is expected to buoy steel demand in both developed and developing economies.Consequently, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader steel industry, both in the short and long term. Here, we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector can look forward to in the coming months and years.The “Trump” EffectAfter being in the dumps for a major part of 2016, steel stocks got a big boost following President Trump’s win that November on expectations of significant infrastructure spending. The president’s call for such spending is expected to lead to an increase in steel demand as it is a key component in many infrastructure products. Trump’s “big” spending plans have thus painted a bullish picture for steel companies.President Trump, on Mar 8, signed proclamations imposing steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in a major move to protect the domestic producers of these metals, rebuild the long-struggling U.S. steel and aluminum industries as well as safeguard American jobs.Steel Import Drops: Respite to Beleaguered U.S. PlayersThe tariffs are welcome news for American steel makers as it will lead to lower imports into the United States, which would in turn boost demand for American steel. This will provide the domestic players with more pricing power.Per the American Iron and Steel Institute (“AISI”), an association of North American steel makers, total and finished steel imports have dipped 3.0% and 1.7%, respectively, in the first three months of 2018 compared with the prior-year period. For 2018, annualized total and finished steel imports is projected to decline 8.8% and 7.6%, respectively, from the prior year. Finished steel import market share was an estimated 26% in March and is estimated at 25% for the year.On prospects of higher steel demand as a result of the latest U.S. trade measures, United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) stated recently that it will restart one of its Granite City Works blast furnaces and steelmaking facilities. The company expects to call back around 500 employees starting this month. Both the blast furnaces of Granite City Works and its steelmaking facilities were idled in December 2015 in response to challenging market conditions, including unfairly traded imports.Another U.S. steel major, Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report) also recently announced that it will build a rebar micro mill in Florida. This $240-million investment will be Nucor’s second rebar micro mill.Moreover, the tariffs are anticipated to boost production capacity of domestic steel makers amid lower imports. The U.S. Department of Commerce earlier stated that the trade actions are aimed at increasing domestic steel production to roughly 80% operating rate from its present capacity of 73%. This is the minimum rate needed for the long-term viability of the industry.Construction Sector to Remain Key Demand DriverThe homebuilding market remains a pillar of strength for the economy, as well as the steel industry. The housing and construction sector is the largest consumer of steel, accounting for almost half of the total consumption. Positives like an improving economy, healthy job growth, low interest rates, positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the sector’s performance.The American Institute of Architects (“AIA”) anticipates spending in the non-residential building sector to advance around 4% in 2018 and continue at that pace of growth through 2019. The recently enacted tax reform as well as Trump’s promised infrastructure package will boost demand in the sector. Nucor and Commercial Metals Company (CMC  -  Free Report) are the leading steel suppliers to the non-residential construction sector.Over the long haul, as the urban population increases worldwide, the requirement for steel to build skyscrapers and public transportation infrastructure should see an uptrend as well. Emerging economies will continue to be major catalysts, owing to the huge amount of steel needed for urbanization and industrialization. Hence, demand for steel is anticipated to remain robust in the years to come. Companies like United States Steel, ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), Nucor and Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) would gain from momentum in construction.Automotive Sector Drives Steel DemandThe automotive sector, which is the second largest steel consumer, is showing significant promise despite threats from other materials. The rising sales trend is anticipated to persist driven by falling fuel prices, low interest rates, enhanced job security, rising wages and household wealth. Moreover, the trend will be backed by improving consumer confidence, residual pent-up demand, attractive deals and vehicle launches.Moreover, the high average age of light vehicles on U.S. roads is resulting in large replacement demand for cars as well as car parts. This will benefit auto parts manufacturers and retailers. The auto industry in Asian countries, particularly China and India, are also projected to flourish over the next five to seven years. China is the biggest and fastest growing auto market globally in terms of number of vehicles sold.With automakers cashing in on strong demand, steel is anticipated to get a proportional boost in the years to come. ArcelorMittal and AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS  -  Free Report) generate a large portion of their revenues from auto companies. Arcelor Mittal is expanding its global portfolio of automotive steels by launching a new generation of advanced high strength steels (“AHSS”).Steady Growth in Developed EconomiesDeveloped economies are expected to witness growth of 1.8% in steel demand in 2018. In the United States, strong demand and investment fueled by high confidence, rising income and low interest rates will drive steel demand. While rising investment is buoying the manufacturing sector, the construction sector looks good on rising housing prices and steady non-residential sector growth.The recent tax reform will also lead to higher investment and consequently boost steel demand. The announced infrastructure plan will be a catalyst for steel demand in the long term. In the EU, broadening recovery across countries, higher investments, pickup in non-residential construction and strong manufacturing activities will be catalysts.Developing Countries to Support GrowthSteel demand in developing economies (excluding China) is expected to increase by 4.9% and 4.5% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Recovery in oil and commodity prices has led to a revival in steel demand in the Middle East, and if geopolitical stability is achieved, steel demand for the region will be driven by reconstruction activities.Recovery in Russia will be supported by credit expansion, easing monetary policy and improving consumer and business confidence. In Brazil, recovery of construction activities has been sluggish while in other Latin American countries, recovery is underway and growth is likely to accelerate if reforms are implemented.The Indian economy is stabilizing from the impact of currency reform and GST implementation last year. India, currently the fourth largest producer of steel in the world, is anticipated to record exponential growth in the future. This will be fueled by increasing urbanization, along with projected growth in the infrastructure, automobile and real estate sectors. The country’s comparatively low per capita steel consumption and the anticipated rise in consumption owing to increased infrastructure construction, along with the thriving automobile and railways sectors, offer huge scope for growth.How to Play the IndustryAs you can see, there are many reasons to be optimistic about the steel industry over the long haul.

698,NUE,"The steel industry is poised to benefit from solid demand in the United States and emerging markets like India. However, steel stocks are plagued with equity market volatility and a host of other broader factors. Below, we discuss some of the key reasons and what investors in the steel sector should be wary of in the coming months and years.Valuation ConcernsGoing by the EV/EBITDA multiple (a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries like steel) the steel-pipe and tube and steel specialty have a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 20.2 and 14.3, respectively, higher than the S&P 500 EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.7. Meanwhile, the steel producers industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 9.2, which compares favorably with the S&P 500 EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.7. Overall, valuation looks expensive for the steel industry.Expected Deceleration in ChinaIn 2017, China’s government stimulus measures helped lift the construction activity. However, investment continued to decelerate and steel demand showed only a moderate increase despite the boost. In 2018 and 2019, China’s GDP growth is expected to decelerate mildly and as the government continues to focus on shifting the growth driver toward consumption, investment is likely to further decelerate.In 2018, steel demand is likely to remain flat and contract 2.0% in 2019 due to a further slowdown in construction activity. The machinery sector is anticipated to deliver positive growth aided by a strong global economy while automotive and home appliances will decelerate.Trump’s Softening Stance Not a Good SignFollowing the tariff announcement, President Trump softened his stance by excluding Canada and Mexico — two major sources of steel imports to the United States — from the tariff orders. Moreover, the orders have provisions for other countries to apply for exemptions provided their imports do not hurt the U.S. economy, leaving some wiggle room for U.S. allies to seek concessions.The President noted that Canada and Mexico represent “a special case,” and will continue talks with them to address concerns. The exclusions of these countries are dependent on the outcome of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) renegotiation talks that are underway.Canada is the largest steel exporter to the United States, accounting for roughly 16% of total U.S. steel imports in 2017, per the U.S. Census Bureau data. Mexico is the fourth-largest exporter of the metal with around 9% market share. Together these countries represent roughly a quarter of U.S. steel imports.To make the matters more complicated, the Trump administration later added that it would temporarily exempt more countries from steel and aluminum tariffs, according to a proclamation released by the White House. The list includes the European Union, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, many of which have been in talks with the United States to win an exemption. However, the administration may impose import quotas on these countries to protect the domestic industries.The Trump administration’s gradually softening tariff stance is bad news for the domestic steel makers. More countries may seek exemptions for steel imports in the future that cannot be made in the United States. This may thwart the administration’s efforts to curb the influx of cheaper imports and eventually hurt steel prices.Risks of Trade RetaliationConcerns over a full-blown international trade war gripped the markets since the declaration of the metal tariffs. The U.S. trade actions are likely to trigger a potential backlash from the affected countries and major foreign trade partners. The tariffs risk tit-for-tat retaliation measures on American exports, consequently hurting the U.S. economy.China imposed new tariffs on 128 US imports worth $3 billion in retaliation to the steel and aluminum tariffs recently, fueling fears of a trade war. While China only accounts for 2% of U.S. steel imports, it is the world’s biggest producer of steel accounting for around half of the global production. Beijing has been repeatedly accused of dumping excess steel capacity into global markets. Trump has a record of attacking China for unfair trade practices. In fact, the President has plans to implement new tariffs on some $60 billion of Chinese imports.Japan, the sixth largest exporter of steel to the United States, is also currently not on Trump’s temporary exemption list. Japan's Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, Hiroshige Seko earlier said that the United States’ move to levy trade tariffs is “extremely regrettable” and could significantly unsettle global trade.The EU had also threatened to impose tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles and other iconic U.S. brands in retaliation to the Trump administration’s tariff move. The 28-nation bloc recently published a list of U.S. products worth around $3.4 billion on which it plans to impose trade penalties. Brazil, the second-largest exporter of steel to the United States, with roughly 13% share of total imports last year, has also pledged to take “all necessary actions” to protect its interests.Geopolitical TensionsPerformance of some key emerging and developing economies has deteriorated due to internal structural issues, lower commodity prices associated with China’s economic slowdown, and escalating political instability. Geopolitical tensions and political instability in the Middle East and Africa continues to have a negative effect. Political uncertainty in the Brazilian economy has resulted in a sharp decline in steel demand.Sluggish Momentum of the Auto SectorIn China, the automotive sector is expected to decelerate in 2019. Also, the automotive sector in both the EU and the US is expected to moderate due to saturation effect and rising interest rates.Other Dampening FactorsAn expected monetary tightening in the United States and the EU will lead to deceleration of steel demand growth in 2019. Improving investment sentiment and government stimulus has been beneficial to steel demand in Japan. However, the scope of growth will continue to be limited by structural factors such as an aging population. Further, despite improved consumer sentiment, steel demand growth in South Korea will be constrained by high consumer debts, weakening construction and a depressed shipbuilding sector.Excess Capacity: Perennial ProblemThe biggest obstacle to persistent growth and profitability in the steel industry is excess capacity. The industry is under relentless pressure caused by years of excess steel-making capacity, further aggravated by weak demand and uneven economic growth. To solve this problem, steelmaking capacity needs to be reduced for the industry’s profit margin to reach a sustainable level, and raise the capacity utilization rate from below 80% levels.The industry remains highly fragmented compared with other global businesses. However, the restructuring and consolidation needed to eliminate overcapacity is progressing at a slow pace.Low Crude Steel Capacity UtilizationThe crude steel capacity utilization ratio remained stubbornly below 80% in the last three years. The average capacity utilization in the 2016 and 2017 was around 69% and 66%, respectively.  The average capacity utilization till March 2018 was around 73.6%, an improvement from the 71% in the comparable period last year. Excess steel capacity has been a perennial problem for the steel industry as steel prices generally move in tandem with capacity utilization rates. To remain competitive and rationalize operations, some major steel companies have resorted to idling steel plants.Increasing Use of Aluminum in Auto IndustryCurrently, steel is the major raw material for the auto industry, the second largest steel consumer. However, major automakers like Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report), General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and others are becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, given the metal's recyclability and light-weight properties. The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is anticipated to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025. Hence, in order to remain competitive, the steel companies will have to come up with better and lighter varieties of steel.Stocks to Steer ClearThe short-term prospects are a bit clouded considering the headwinds plaguing the steel industry globally as discussed above. So, it would be prudent to stay away from steel stocks that carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank now. Particularly, we suggest staying away from Aperam S.A. (APEMY  -  Free Report) which carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and Shiloh Industries, Inc. (SHLO  -  Free Report) which carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The estimates for Aperam have declined 8% for fiscal 2018 and 9% for fiscal 2018. Shiloh Industries has witnessed a 13% drop in earnings estimates for fiscal 2018. The company also has a negative average earnings surprise of 43.48% in the trailing four quarters.However, investors, who can look beyond the near-term clouds to the industry’s bright long-term prospects, may consider buying some steel stocks based on a favorable Zacks Rank.We also recommend stocks such as Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report), Ternium S.A. (TX  -  Free Report) which sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

699,NUE,"The steel industry enjoyed a good run in 2017, barring a few lingering challenges. The industry will benefit from strong economic momentum being exhibited by advanced and developing economies, and sustained healthy demand in the automobile and construction sectors.Further, President Trump’s plans for massive infrastructure spending — one of his key campaign promises — will be a catalyst for American steel makers given the expected increase in steel consumption. Notably, Trump’s aggressive trade policies are anticipated to provide more protection to the U.S. steel industry.Steel Imports “Threat to National Security,” Trump Slaps TariffIn March, President Trump implemented a tariff of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports from all countries except Canada and Mexico, to counter an ""assault on the country"" by foreign competitors. This is an attempt to reinforce the American steel and aluminum industries, which have long been reeling under the onslaught of cheap imports and suffered significant reduction in production as well as employment.This was the aftermath of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 at the behest of the Trump administration. In fact, in January 2018, the investigating authority submitted reports to the President stating that the quantities of steel and aluminum imports “threaten to impair the national security.” Notably, U.S. steel imports were nearly four times the country’s exports. Six basic oxygen furnaces and four electric furnaces have been closed since 2000 and employment has slumped 35% since 1998.Tariffs a Relief for Steel IndustryThe imposition of tariff on imports would improve domestic steel production from its present capacity of 73% to approximately an operating rate of 80% — the minimum rate required for the long-term viability of the industry. It will also lead to lower imports into the United States, which would in turn, will boost demand for American steel. This will provide the domestic players with more pricing power and help to level the playing field.According to the latest report from the American Iron and Steel Institute (“AISI”), an association of North American steel makers, total and finished steel imports have dipped 3.0% and 1.7%, respectively, year over year in the first quarter of 2018. For 2018, annualized total and finished steel imports is projected to decline 8.8% and 7.6% year over year, respectively.This is a major improvement from the 15% rise noted in total steel imports in 2017. Despite the U.S. Department of Commerce’s imposition of several duties on additional steel products, imports refused to abate last year due to foreign producers’ overcapacity. Moreover, a delay in Section 232 investigation on steel imports by the U.S. Department of Commerce also triggered a spike in steel imports in 2017.Steel Production Expands at Solid PaceFollowing an increase of 5.3% in world crude steel output in 2017, the momentum continues in 2018. Per the World Steel Association, (“WSA”) global steel production improved 4.1% to 426.6 metric tons (Mt) on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2018 propelled by higher output across all regions.Steel production in Asia was pegged at 294 Mt in the quarter, an increase of 4.6% year over year. North America’s crude steel production registered a 1.9% rise to 29.5 Mt in the quarter while the EU produced 43.1 Mt of crude steel, rising 0.9% year over year. China, the world’s largest steel maker which accounts for around half of the global production, delivered a 4.5% rise in steel production to 74 Mt during the quarter.Industry Positioning: FavorableThe Zacks Industry Rank relies on the same estimate revisions methodology that drives the Zacks Rank for stocks. The way to look at the complete list of industries is that, we put our X industries (all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).In the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, the Steel specialty, Steel producers, Steel-pipe and tube and industries are grouped under the Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors). The Steel specialty, Steel producers, Steel-pipe and tube, with a Zacks Industry Rank of #14, #23 and #102, respectively, remain in the top half.Sector Level Earnings Trend: PositivePer the Zacks Industry classification, the steel industries are grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector. Per our projections, earnings for the Basic Materials sector are anticipated to surge 38.6% in the first quarter of 2018. For full year 2018, the sector is anticipated to log an impressive earnings growth of 35%. In 2019, earnings growth will be 8.3%.Ahead of S&P 500The Steel Specialty, Steel Producers and Steel-pipe industries’ respective rise of 31.9%, 25.6% and 13.5% in the past year has outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of 11.8%.Where’s the Industry Headed?The WSA forecasts global steel demand to expand 1.8% in 2018 to 1,616.1 Mt as favorable global economic scenario, commodity prices and perked up investment will drive steel demand in both developed and developing economies. However, deceleration in China and weakened investment momentum due to higher interest rates has led to a weakened projection of 0.7% for 2019. As the China government continues to focus on shifting the growth driver toward consumption, investment is likely to further decelerate.The outlook for steel demand in the United States is supported by strong demand and investment triggered by rising income and low interest rates. In the Eurozone, broadening recovery across countries, robust domestic demand, resumption in investment as well as pickup in non-residential construction and strong manufacturing activities will lead to growth.Recovery in oil and commodity prices has improved the outlook for the Middle East. Provided geopolitical stability can be achieved, steel demand outlook for the region could further improve driven by reconstruction demand. The mild recovery in Russia and Brazil is anticipated to continue and in other Latin American countries, recovery is underway and growth will likely pick if reforms are implemented.India is anticipated to act as the next growth engine, given its progressing construction and manufacturing sectors along with rapid urbanization and structural reforms. The Indian economy is stabilizing from the impact of currency reform and GST implementation and steel demand is expected to accelerate gradually, mainly driven by public investment.However, rising trade tensions, inflationary pressure and tightening of the United States and EU monetary policies may cause market volatilities and trouble highly indebted emerging economies. These factors are likely to dampen the steel industry’s momentum. Meanwhile, the automotive and construction industries will continue to be the mainstays of the steel industry.Some Stocks in FocusOverall a favorable ranking, earnings growth expectation instils optimism for the industry. Investors can consider the following steel stocks that are backed by a solid Zacks Rank and healthy growth projections.Steel Dynamics, Inc.

700,NUE,"You can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always guarantee superior returns. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision.A company’s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio — the Interest Coverage Ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.What’s the Strategy?Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.  Here are five of the 24 stocks that qualified the screening:Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report), which is engaged in the steel products manufacturing and metals recycling businesses, has a VGM Score of B and an expected EPS growth rate of 12% for 3-5 years. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc.

701,NUE,"Hurricane Harvey’s rainfall has wreaked havoc on Houston and the surrounding area, as floodwaters cover America’s fourth-largest city. The economy in the area will likely feel the effects of Harvey for years to come, but U.S. steel companies might have already benefited from the storm’s scope and devastation on southeastern Texas.  Houston floodwaters reached historic highs on Tuesday as rainfall surpassed 25 inches in many areas, with a least one location expected to receive over 50 inches, according to the National Weather Service.President Donald Trump met with Texas Governor Greg Abbott in Corpus Christi, Texas as relief efforts ramped up. He and the first lady later traveled to Austin to tour an emergency operations center, according to an official White House statement.New reports suggest that Hurricane Harvey could eventually make its way to Louisiana.U.S. Steel Oil production has been slowed, and even halted, off Texas’ Gulf Coast due to Harvey. Now, another major commodity could be affected as well.Houston receives roughly 30% to 35% of all U.S. steel imports, according to KeyBanc analyst Philip Gibbs. The analyst noted that Harvey will therefore undoubtedly shake-up the U.S. steel industry, at least for the time being.With steel imports likely curbed, if not stopped, in the Houston area, U.S. steel companies find themselves in the position to benefit as demand for steel products did not stop when Harvey reached land.Shares of United States Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report) jumped by over 2.50% on Tuesday, while Olympic Steel  climbed more than 1.50%.Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) both saw their stock prices rise by over 0.50%. Shares of the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (XME  -  Free Report) gained 0.94% on Tuesday. Steel Dynamics (STLD  -  Free Report) stock closed up marginally.Bottom Line U.S. steel manufacturers have struggled in recent years as production and exports from China have risen, which means investors might seize on any possible sign of an uptick in U.S. steel prices or production.Aside from Harvey, U.S. steel sector stocks might be ready to experience gains that don’t coincide with a hurricane’s devastation to a major U.S. city.China, despite recording its 17thconsecutive monthly year-over-year jump in steel production, has seen its export rates drop dramatically. The nation exported 7 million metric tons of steel products last month, which marked a roughly 32% drop-off from the year-ago period. And Chinese net steel exports are down more than 30% overall compared to last year.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

702,NUE,"Imports of cheap steel continue to haunt the American steel industry. Steel imports have shot up roughly 22% year to date – according to the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), an association of North American steel makers.Per AISI, based on preliminary U.S. Census Bureau data, total U.S. steel imports went up 22.1% year over year to roughly 23.17 million net tons through the first seven months of 2017. Finished steel imports for the same period also increased 17.3% to around 17.94 million net tons. Year to date, finished steel import market share is estimated at 28%, which is higher than 26% clocked in full-year 2016.Major finished steel products that have showed a significant year-to-date increase in imports on a year-over-year basis include oil country goods (up 254%), standard pipe (up 47%), line pipe (up 39%), cold rolled sheets (up 37%), sheets and strip all other metallic coatings (up 35%), mechanical tubing (up 32%), hot rolled bars (up 26%) and sheets & strip hot dipped galvanized (up 25%).The biggest offshore suppliers for the seven-month period were South Korea with 2,265,000 net tons (down 5% year over year), Turkey with 1,723,000 net tons (up 14%), Japan with 937,000 net tons (down 12%), Taiwan with 784,000 net tons (up 54%) and Germany with 750,000 net tons (up 7%).Notwithstanding a series of punitive trade actions in the recent past in the form of heavy tariffs and threats of further future measures, imports continue to make inroads into the American market due to foreign producers’ overcapacity. High levels of imports remain a pressing problem for U.S. steel producers such as Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report), United States Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report). In particular, Nucor and AK Steel, during their second-quarter earnings call, raised concerns about a renewed flood of subsidized imports this year.While affirmative rulings in trade cases (resulting in levy of heavy tariffs) against China last year led to an improvement in U.S. steel market conditions, imports from other countries remain at above historical levels.The Zacks Steel Producers industry, nonetheless, has outperformed the broader market in a year’s time. The industry has gained around 32% in this period, higher than the S&P 500’s corresponding return of around 12%.Steel stocks, which were in the dumps for the most part of 2016, got a shot in the arm following Donald Trump’s win in November on expectations of significant infrastructure spending under him. However, nothing concrete has materialized from the new administration yet on the infrastructure-spending front.The Trump administration’s aggressive trade policies are also expected to provide more protection to the U.S. steel industry. Steel stocks also got a big lift in April 2017 after the Trump administration ordered an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The Section 232 probe is aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security and also gives the President the power to impose broad tariffs or quotas on imported steel.However, steel imports have surged since the initiation of the investigation with import market share reaching as high as 30% in June 2017. Per a Reuters report, the executives of U.S. steel and steel-related firms including Nucor, U.S. Steel and ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), in a letter, recently urged President Trump to impose immediate restrictions on imports. The appeal comes after a delay in the release of the report on the Section 232 investigation by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which was initially expected at the end of June 2017.While the findings from the Section 232 steel investigation are due, it goes without saying that a positive outcome from the probe will provide a major thrust to American steel makers.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector.

703,NUE,"United States Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report) has priced its $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2025. The notes were issued at a price equal to 100% of their face value. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on Feb 15 and Aug 15 every year starting from Feb 15, 2018. The notes will mature on Aug 15, 2025, unless redeemed earlier or repurchased.   U.S. Steel plans to use the net proceeds along with cash on hand, for the redemption of all of its 7.00% Senior Notes due 2018, its 6.875% Senior Notes due 2021, and its 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 and the payment of associated fees and expenses. U.S. Steel, which is among the prominent U.S. steel makers along with Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report), AK Steel (AKS  -  Free Report) and Steel Dynamics (STLD  -  Free Report), recorded a profit of $261 million or $1.48 per share in second-quarter 2017, helped by strong results in its Flat-Rolled unit. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.07 per share for the reported quarter that topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents. Revenues rose roughly 22% year over year to $3,144 million in the quarter, also surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,975 million. The company now expects net earnings of around $300 million or $1.70 per share for 2017, up from $260 million or $1.50 per share expected earlier. U.S. Steel remains optimistic for 2017. The company is seeing positive sentiment in the markets served by Flat-Rolled and USSE units. Its Tubular unit is also gaining from operational and cost improvements and strong market conditions.   U.S. Steel is expected to gain from healthy automotive demand. Also, the company is actively engaged in improving its cost structure and increasing revenues on a sustainable basis through its “Carnegie Way” initiative that includes actions such as manufacturing process/logistics improvements and savings on SG&A costs.

704,NUE,"Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) has agreed to buy St. Louis-based steel bar maker, St. Louis Cold Drawn, Inc. for an undisclosed price. St. Louis Cold Drawn, which employs 125 people, makes cold drawn rounds, hexagons, squares and special sections that primarily caters the U.S. and Mexican automotive and industrial markets.St. Louis Cold Drawn has two manufacturing locations in St. Louis, MO, and Monterrey, Mexico, that have a total annual capacity of 200,000 tons. The addition of these facilities will expand the total annually capacity of Nucor's cold finished bar and wire facilities to over 1.1 million tons. It will also help the steel maker advance its objective of growing its sales to automotive customers.The buyout is in sync with Nucor's strategy to expand its position as the market leader in cold finished bar products and complements its goal to profitably grow its value-added product portfolio. Moreover, the acquisition creates synergies with Nucor's bar mills by offering an additional channel to market for its special bar quality products.Nucor has been focusing on growth through strategic acquisitions and it is well positioned to gain from such efforts to expand business through mergers and acquisitions.Nucor, in early 2017, wrapped up its purchase of steel electrical conduit maker, Republic Conduit, from Luxembourg-based Tenaris S.A. for $335 million. The acquisition is expected to make the Nucor a market leader in steel electrical conduits. Moreover, the company acquired Southland Tube for $130 million in Jan 2017. The buyout strengthens Nucor’s foothold in the hollow structural section (“HSS”) steel tubing maker. Moreover, the purchase of the assets of open web steel joists maker, Omega Joist also allows Nucor to grow its joist and decking business in Canada.Nucor’s shares gained 11.6% over the past year, underperforming the 30.6% gain of the industry it belongs to.Nucor missed both revenue and earnings expectations in second-quarter 2017. Its earnings of $1.00 per share for the quarter trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07. Revenues climbed around 22% year over year to $5,174.8 million in the quarter, also falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,307.8 million.Nucor sees earnings in third-quarter 2017 to be in a band similar to the quarterly results of first-half 2017. The company continues to achieve greater penetration of the automotive market and expects to continue this trend for the remaining year. Nucor is also upbeat about improving prospects in the energy markets.Nucor currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus  Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus | Nucor Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are POSCO , The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report) and Kronos Worldwide Inc (KRO  -  Free Report).

705,NUE,"Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Jul 20.The steel giant’s profits surged year over year in first-quarter 2017 on higher sales. However, its earnings of $1.11 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14. Revenues went up around 30% year over year to $4,815.2 million in the quarter and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,698 million. The company saw higher pricing and shipments in the quarter.Nucor beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing in the other two, with an average positive surprise of 11.63%.Nucor has underperformed the Zacks categorized Steel-Producers industry over a year. The company's shares gained 5% over this period while the industry saw a gain of 23.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Watch ForNucor’s shares got battered last month after it provided downbeat guidance for the second quarter of 2017 that fell short of analysts’ expectations. The company sees earnings for the quarter in the band of $1.00–$1.05 per share. That is a decrease from $1.11 per share recorded in the previous quarter, but an increase from 76 cents a share it earned a year ago.Nucor said that the expected decrease in second-quarter performance on sequential basis is due to decreased performance of the steel mills segment, especially bar mills and sheet mills. The market condition for hot rolled steel products is facing challenges due to aggressive competition. However, the company expects the profitability of plate mills to improve in second quarter of 2017.The company expects the performance of its downstream products segment to improve in the second quarter as compared with the first, but to decrease from the prior-year quarter.While Nucor sees an overall positive trend in non-residential construction markets, conditions have not been as strong as it had expected earlier. The company expects performance of raw materials segment to improve in second quarter of 2017 on sequential basis due to profitable performance of direct reduced iron facilities.Nucor noted that the U.S. steel industry continues to be hit by cheaper imports, which account for about 26% market share. Finished steel imports from foreign producers have increased about 14% year over year during the first five months of 2017.Nevertheless, Nucor should gain from its efforts to expand business through acquisitions. Nucor, in early 2017, wrapped up its purchase of steel electrical conduit maker, Republic Conduit, from Luxembourg-based Tenaris S.A. for $335 million. The acquisition positioned Nucor as the market leader in steel conduits. Moreover, the company acquired Southland Tube for $130 million in Jan 2017. The buyout has strengthened Nucor’s foothold in the hollow structural section (HSS) steel tubing segment. The company should benefit from the contributions of its recent acquisitions in the June quarter.Nucor should also gain from continued momentum in the automotive market. The company remains focused on achieving greater penetration of this major market. The company has entered into a joint venture with JFE Steel Corporation of Japan to build and operate a plant in Mexico that will supply sheet steel to the country’s growing automotive market.Nucor, in May, also announced plans to build a hot band galvanizing and pickling line at its sheet mill in Ghent, Kentucky, that will serve its objective of growing share in the automotive market. The $176 million project is likely to expand the annual production capabilities of Nucor Steel Gallatin products by almost 500,000 tons. The addition of hot band galvanizing line is in sync with Nucor’s automotive growth strategy.Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus  Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus | Nucor Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nucor is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Nucor for the second quarter is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.07. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Nucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Endeavour Silver Corp. (EXK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +100% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.04% and a Zacks Rank #2.The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion's share of the output.
"
708,NUE,"The largest segment of the global metals market is iron and steel followed by aluminum. The iron and steel segment comprises more than half the industry in terms of volume. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products, such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars.
"
709,NUE,"The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores.
"
710,NUE,"Historically, the automotive and construction markets have been the largest consumers of metals, accounting for more than 50% of total demand. Other metal consumers include energy, electrical equipment, agricultural, domestic and commercial equipment and industrial machinery. Large automakers such as General Motors Company (GM), Ford Motor Co. (F), Toyota Motor Corp (TM) and Honda Motor Co. Ltd (HMC) are large consumers of metals, especially steel and aluminum.Overall Outlook
"
711,NUE,"The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over-demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in London Metal Exchange prices, general economic conditions and end-use markets. Individual company profitability depends on volume and operating efficiency. Large producers with huge resources are able to discover and develop new deposits, thereby boosting reserves, while the smaller ones devote their attention to fewer mines.
"
712,NUE,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have historically been a critically important growth strategy for mining companies. The year 2009 experienced a lull in M&A activity under the impact of the global economic downturn, with a deal value almost half that of 2008. The focus of M&A activity shifted from being a driver of growth to that of defense, as companies looked to safeguard their teetering balance sheets rather than seeking expansion.
"
713,NUE,"In 2010, fairly unpredictable financial markets dictated metals prices, despite strong underlying fundamentals. In addition, several notable mining accidents have made mine safety a major factor for the industry and regulators. Despite the volatility, gold prices rose 400% over the past ten years and made a record run in 2010, increasing 26% and hitting a high of $1,432 an ounce.
"
714,NUE,"The year 2011 has been unstable for metals so far, with double-digit gold sell-offs and rallies during the first quarter. However, investors remain cautiously optimistic regarding the sector. Many analysts predict metal prices will end the year with double-digit growth considering demand is still outstripping supply.
"
715,NUE,"Unrest in the Middle East is also driving metal prices. On the down side, the end of the Fed's QE2 program and overall atmosphere of greater focus on fiscal restraint may limit significant gains.
"
716,NUE,"In an industry plagued with rising energy and raw material costs, increasing productivity and reducing costs are the keys to success. Given the cyclical nature of the metals industry, low-volume, and high-cost producers need to generate sufficient cash or ensure a strong borrowing position during market peaks to survive the market troughs.
"
717,NUE,"Continuing consolidation supports the sector's ability to influence the cost of inputs and companies can also obtain synergies and economies of scale through the operation of vertically integrated raw materials sources. Expansion in low-cost countries will ensure lower labor costs and also help tap their growth potential.
"
718,NUE,"Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region -- in particular China and India -- is witnessing higher production and consumption of metals. Per capita consumption levels in both these countries are calibrating to U.S./European levels, which could, theoretically at least, double metal demand in the longer term. China is the world's largest consumer of metals and is expected to remain so.
"
719,NUE,"Further, developed regions such as the US and Europe are showing signs of recovery, albeit at a moderate pace. Overall, we expect global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries.
"
720,NUE,"Demand as well as production for industrial metals in Japan has been recently affected as factories have been shut in the aftermath of the country's earthquake and Tsunami. Japan is the biggest buyer of aluminum and the second largest buyer of copper ore. We, however, believe that metal demand will be boosted by the construction industry triggered by the country's reconstruction efforts.Detailed Look into Metals
"
721,NUE,"Steel
"
722,NUE,"As the major shareholder (about 60%) of the metals market, the steel industry was severely bruised by the global economic downturn. However, according to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production in 2010 reached a record 1,414 million metric tons (mmt), an increase of 15% compared with 2009. All the major steel-producing countries and regions showed double-digit growth in 2010. In September 2011, the world crude steel production was 124 mmt, an increase of 9.7% from September 2010.
"
723,NUE,"China's crude steel production in September 2011 was 56.7 mmt, up 16.5% from September 2010.
"
724,NUE,"Elsewhere in Asia, Japan produced 8.9 mmt of crude steel in September 2011, down 3.8% year over year. South Korea's crude steel production in September 2011 was 5.5 mmt, up 17.7% from September 2010.
"
725,NUE,"In the EU (European Union), Germany's crude steel production in September 2011 was 3.7 mmt, up 10.3% from September 2010. Italy produced 2.6 mmt of crude steel, up 11.5%. France produced 1.3 mmt of crude steel, up 4.2%.
"
726,NUE,"Turkey produced 3.0 mmt of crude steel in September 2011, 16.9% higher than September 2010.
"
727,NUE,"The US produced 7.2 mmt of crude steel in September 2011, up 8.9% from September 2010.
"
728,NUE,"Brazilian crude steel production for September 2011 was 2.8 mmt, 3.8% higher than September 2010.
"
729,NUE,"The World Steel Association provided its Short Range Outlook (SRO) for 2011 and 2012. World Steel forecasts that apparent steel use will increase by 6.5% to 1,398 mmt in 2011, following a growth rate of 15.1% in 2010. In 2012, it is forecast that world steel demand will grow further by 5.4%.
"
730,NUE,"China's apparent steel use in 2011 is expected to increase by 7.5% to 643.2 mmt following an 8.5% growth rate in 2010. In 2012, steel demand is expected to maintain a 6.0% growth rate, which will bring China's apparent steel use to 681.6 mmt.
"
731,NUE,"In 2011, India's steel use is forecast to grow by 4.3% to reach 67.7 mmt. In 2012, the growth rate is forecast to accelerate to 7.9%.
"
732,NUE,"Apparent steel use in the US is forecast to rebound strongly by 11.6% in 2011. In 2012, steel use in the US is expected to grow by 5.2% to 93.8 mmt, bringing it back to 87% of the 2007 level. For NAFTA as a whole, apparent steel use will grow by 9.0% and 4.9% in 2011 and 2012 respectively.
"
733,NUE,"In Central and South America, apparent steel use is forecast to grow by 4.7 % in 2011 to reach a historical high of 47.8 mmt. In 2012, the region's apparent steel use is forecast to grow by 9.8% to reach 52.4 mmt, almost 28% higher than the 2007 level.
"
734,NUE,"European countries continued to show divergent recovery paths in 2011. While steel demand in Germany and Poland are expected to grow at impressive rates, steel demand in Spain, by contrast, is expected to record a sluggish 1.7% recovery.
"
735,NUE,"Overall, apparent steel use in the EU is projected to increase by 7.0% in 2011 to 155.0 mmt. In 2012, the growth of steel demand is expected to stall in most of the European countries with the notable exception of Poland which is forecast to post an impressive 9.5% growth. Overall, apparent steel use in the EU is forecast to grow by 2.5% to around 158.9 mmt in 2012, bringing it back to only 80% of the 2007 peak.
"
736,NUE,"Japan's steel use is expected to decline by 2.7% to 61.8 mmt in 2011 due mainly to the disruptions caused by the earthquake. In 2012 apparent steel use in Japan is forecast to show a growth of 0.8% to reach 62.3 mmt, 77% of the 2007 level.
"
737,NUE,"In the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS, consisting of Russia and 10 other former Soviet Union republics), apparent steel use is forecast to grow by a strong 14.4% in 2011 and then by 7.5% in 2012. These projections will bring the region's apparent steel use in 2012 to almost 60 mmt, a new high for the region.
"
738,NUE,"Steel demand in Middle East-North Africa (MENA) region is expected to fall by 0.9% in 2011, mainly due to downward revisions from North African countries. However, boosted by high oil prices, steel use in the region is forecast to resume growth in 2012 at a rate of 8.7%. Given that the political situation in the region is far from settled, considerable uncertainties hold out a threat to the current forecasts for this region.
"
739,NUE,"In the third quarter 2011, sales of ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), the world's largest steel-producing company, increased 22.6% year over year to $24.2 billion from $19.7 billion in the year-ago quarter but decreased 3.6% sequentially from $25.1 billion. Sales were down sequentially primarily due to lower average steel selling prices (-1.7%) and lower volume of shipments (-4.9%). Total steel shipments in the third quarter of 2011 were 21.1 million metric tons compared with 20.5 million metric tons in the year-ago quarter.
"
740,NUE,"Similarly, sales for U.S. Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) improved 13% year over year to $5.1 billion from $4.5 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.1 billion. Shipments totaled 5.5 million tons, and were down by 0.8% year over year.Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) sales surged 27% year over year to $5.25 billion beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.86 billion. The growth was attributable to an increase of 24% in average price per ton and a rise of 3% in shipments (to 5.8 million tons) to outside customers. Steel mill shipments grew 9% to 4.2 million tons during the quarter.
"
741,NUE,"Currently, Nucor has a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) for the short-term (1 to 3 months) while U.S. Steel holds a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold). ArcelorMittal currently retains a Zacks Rank #5 Rank (Strong Sell). We maintain our Outperform recommendation in the long term for ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel, while we maintain a long-term Neutral recommendation on Nucor.Gold
"
742,NUE,"As per the World Gold Council, gold prices rose for the tenth consecutive year in 2010, reflecting recovery in key sectors of demand and continued global economic uncertainty. In 2010, gold prices jumped 29%, reaching $1,405 per ounce as of the end of December.
"
743,NUE,"During 2010, the price of gold rose to record levels on several occasions, trading as high as $1,432 per ounce. Gold's performance was strong and volatility remained low. The World Gold Council suggests that the increase was not only driven by inflationary forces but was also inflated as both the private and public sectors of India and China rushed into the gold market.
"
744,NUE,"Gold demand went up 9% over 2009, showcasing a 10-year high of 3,912.2 tons, driven by the rise in jewelry demand, the revival of the Indian market and strong momentum in Chinese gold demand. Moreover, central banks became net purchasers of gold for the first time in 21 years, hiking the demand for the yellow metal.
"
745,NUE,"Major demand came from India and China. India bought 746 tons, a 69% increase over 2009, and China bought 400 tons of gold jewelry. China bought 179.9 tons of gold in the form of bars and coin, a 70% increase over 2009.
"
746,NUE,"Global gold demand in the second quarter of 2011 totaled 919.8 tons, down 17% from the remarkably strong levels of 1,107 tons in the second quarter of 2010. Gold demand in value terms grew by 5% year-on-year reaching $44.5 billion up from $42.6 billion in the second quarter of 2010. This is the second highest quarterly value on record, only fractionally below the $44.7 billion record that occurred in the fourth quarter in 2010.
"
747,NUE,"The quarterly average gold price rose by 26%, reaching a record high of $1,506.13 (as per the London PM fix).
"
748,NUE,"Second quarter 2011 global investment demand was 359.4 tons, 37% down year-on-year from 574.2 tons in the second quarter in 2010, which was the second highest quarter ever.
"
749,NUE,"Demand for gold bars and coins totaled 307.7 tons during the second quarter of 2011, a gain of 9% over year-earlier levels of 282.6 tons. In value terms, bar and coin demand was worth $14.9 billion, an increase of 37% from $10.9 billion in the second quarter of 2010.
"
750,NUE,"Jewelry demand in the second quarter of 2011 was 442.5 tons, 6% higher than the year-earlier levels of 416.7 tons. In value terms, this represented a 34% increase to $21.4 billion from $16.0 billion in the same quarter last year. India, China and Turkey together accounted for 59% of global jewelry demand at 260.1 tons in the second quarter of 2011 and registered a combined growth of 36.1 tons on year-earlier levels.
"
751,NUE,"Gold supply was 1,058.7 tons in the second quarter of 2011, which was a 4% decline from 1,108.3 tons in the same period in 2010, as a result of an increase in net purchasing by central banks. Mine production rose by 7% to 708.8 tons from year-earlier levels of 659.4 tons in 2010.
"
752,NUE,"Gold remains a coveted asset given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries made gold an attractive and safe investment option. The European sovereign debt crisis made European investors use gold as a currency hedge. Pressure on the US dollar against various currencies coupled with higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, also pushed up gold prices.
"
753,NUE,"The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers. Jewelry and investment demand in non-Western markets continues to rebound while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45-50% of the world gold production, should drive demand for gold along with China. Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years. As China and India continue to grow
"
754,NUE,"rapidly, their demand for gold will also rise in tandem.
"
755,NUE,"Higher prices bode well for gold producers, which should benefit giants such as Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX), Agnico-Eagle (AEM  -  Free Report) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report). However, gold producers like Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and offset the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
756,NUE,"Overall, the stock prices of gold producers are not expected to benefit much from this favorable commodity-price backdrop. This is reflected in our overall long-term neutral views on the stocks. As major economies continue to recover, investors' confidence will be restored to invest in stock markets, which could cause gold prices to fall. However this is not going to happen in the near future. We have a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) on Barrick Gold, Goldcorp and Kinross Gold Corporation and a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) on Agnico-Eagle and Newmont Mining.Aluminum
"
757,NUE,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, relating to prices subject to worldwide supply and demand forces along with other influences. The global economic downturn had a historic, negative impact on the aluminum industry, leading to an unprecedented decline in LME-based aluminum prices, weak end markets, fall in demand, increased global inventories, higher costs of borrowing and diminished credit availability. The economy has, however, recovered from the crisis of the economic downturn.Alcoa Inc. (AA) is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum. In response to the global economic downturn, the company implemented a number of operational and financial actions to improve its cost structure and liquidity, including curtailing production, halting non-critical capital expenditures, accelerating new sourcing strategies for raw materials, divesting non-core assets, reducing global headcount, suspending its share repurchase program, reducing its quarterly common stock dividend and resorting to other liquidity enhancements.
"
758,NUE,"In 2011, Alcoa plans to restart certain idled potlines at three smelters. These restarts are expected to increase Alcoa's aluminum production by 137 kmt during 2011 and by 200 kmt on an annual basis thereafter. Such measures are sure to meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand.
"
759,NUE,"On September 15, 2011, Alcoa announced it will expand its Davenport, Iowa rolled products plant to meet rising demand from the automotive market. More and more automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are switching from steel to aluminum as they seek to increase the fuel efficiency, safety, durability and performance of the cars they produce.
"
760,NUE,"The expansion will entail an investment of approximately $300 million. The growth project will create an additional 150 full time jobs in Davenport once completed, bringing total employment to more than 2,300 high-value jobs. In addition, during construction, an incremental 150 jobs will be created at the plant. The expansion is expected to be completed by the end of 2013.
"
761,NUE,"Alcoa is expected to benefit from the improving outlook of aluminum and alumina prices. Alcoa continues to project that aluminum demand will grow 12% in 2011 versus 13% growth in 2010, well ahead of the 6.5% compound annual growth rate needed to double aluminum demand by 2020.
"
762,NUE,"Increasing demand in China, where the company has raised its 2011 growth projection two-percentage points to 17%, will mostly offset declines in Europe and other regions. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization.
"
763,NUE,"Both these factors are positives for underlying aluminum demand. We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to see deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices.
"
764,NUE,"We are also optimistic about Alcoa's long-term growth projects in China, Australia, Jamaica, Suriname and Brazil. Demand from these countries is expected to increase its alumina and aluminum production capacity while lowering its operating costs. The company recently expanded its Alumar Refinery, north of Brazil, and doubled its annual capacity from 1.5 million tons to 3.6 million tons of alumina. Recently, Alcoa started production at its Aviles smelter in Spain under the Primary Metal segment. We expect such expansions to drive Alcoa's top line.
"
765,NUE,"Alcoa reported adjusted earnings per share of 15 cents per share in the third quarter 2011, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents per share. Adjusted earnings more than doubled from 6 cents per share reported in the year ago quarter, but were 46.4% lower from the sequential quarter earnings of 28 cents per share due to lower metal prices, seasonal factors and weakness in Europe.
"
766,NUE,"Revenues for the quarter were up 21% year over year to $6.419 billion, and were down from $6.585 billion in the sequential quarter. Alcoa's end-markets demonstrated strong revenue growth, on a year-over-year basis whereas sequentially they experienced mixed market conditions. Revenue was lower for both alumina and aluminum, down 5% and 1%, respectively, driven by lower alumina shipments and lower realized pricing in both businesses.
"
767,NUE,"In the end-markets, revenue increased in commercial transportation (6%) and aerospace (2%), while declines were seen in automotive (7%), industrial products (6%), building and construction (5%), and packaging (4%).
"
768,NUE,"Since the sudden decline from the peak prices in mid-2008, aluminum prices have increased over the last 2 years. In 2010, global aluminum prices increased 13%. Alcoa increased its fiscal 2010 profit on the back of higher prices and continued strengthening in most end markets. Aluminum Corporation of China, or Chalco  swung back to profit in 2010 after posting a loss in 2009, attributable to increased global aluminum prices.
"
769,NUE,"In the medium-to-long term, aluminum consumption will improve globally with improving automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. Aluminum is widely used for packaging, beverage cans, food containers and foil products. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and the light weight of the metal.
"
770,NUE,"Further, the surge in copper price this year is pushing manufacturers to switch to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers for example, are now shifting toward aluminum, which is more economical.
"
771,NUE,"We expect aluminum demand to increase in the long term, outstripping supply growth with the improving end-markets. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization. Both these factors are positive for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa, Paramount Gold and Silver Corporation (PZG  -  Free Report) and Aluminum Corporation of China should benefit from the improving demand outlook.
"
772,NUE,"Currently, Alcoa holds a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell) supported by our long-term Underperform recommendation, while Paramount Gold and Silver has a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold).Copper
"
773,NUE,"Copper prices have shown a rising trend since 2010 benefiting copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO  -  Free Report). Although copper demand was down 10% year over year in 2009, global copper demand has since been witnessing growth.
"
774,NUE,"The Chinese demand for copper was still robust and imports of the metal were rebounding, which was supported by steady construction and infrastructure activity in the country. The improvement in copper prices would be supported by limited supply and increased demand from China.
"
775,NUE,"Even though copper prices are close to their all-time highs, the outlook for copper prices remains favorable. Not denying the volatility in prices that are bound to remain, we have a bullish stance on copper prices, in the long term. However, as discussed earlier, manufacturers might now resort to aluminum as a substitute.
"
776,NUE,"Market conditions are expected to be positive for copper in the next couple of years due to higher consumption of the metal in the developing nations. The companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.
"
777,NUE,"We currently have a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) and long-term Neutral recommendation on Freeport and a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell) on Southern Copper.
"
778,NUE,"The U.S. steel industry is buoyant in the backdrop of a favorable regulatory environment. The goal of the government is to revive the industry, which has seen a steady decline as local production was increasingly substituted with cheaper imports.Steel imports have jumped from $22.7 billion in 2010 to $29.1 billion last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau with the country remaining the world’s largest importer of steel. Further, USGS data shows that while steel mill and semi-finished product imports were 36 million metric tons (MMT) and 8.4 MMT in 2017, steel mill exports were a mere 11 MMT.Steel Import Monitoring and Analysis (SIMA) data says that in the year ending January, 35% of imported steel comprised flat products, 28% pipes and tubes, 19% semi-finished and 18% long products. Canada (19%), Brazil (13%), Korea (12%), Mexico (11%), Turkey (5%) and Japan (5%) were the top exporters to the U.S.So the prospect of a 25% tariff on imported products was seen as a positive for the industry that could perhaps help it generate higher volumes and stronger pricing. A longer-term benefit (because it is capital intensive) could also be the resuscitation of operations that were shut down in the last few years as a result of consistent Chinese dumping.But there was a catch: Canada, Mexico, the European Union, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea were granted exemptions until May 1, so they could negotiate more favorable terms with the U.S. as regards their steel exports to the country, something the government has flagged as a national security concern. Since the list includes all of the top steel suppliers to the U.S., the May 1 deadline has assumed great importance.Moreover, even if these deals work out, the government will introduce a quota system, so cheap Chinese products can’t sneak in indirectly through dumping in any of the supplier countries.ChallengesWhile the tariff will bring pricing support, it will also result in some challenges.For one, it is practically impossible to take China out of the pricing equation because it is the world’s biggest producer, exporter and consumer of steel. On the positive side, after the EU raised its antidumping duty on Chinese steel from a range of 18.1-35.9% to a range of 48.3-71.9% in March while also extending the period by another 5 years and Mexico did likewise on carbon steel pipes that were threatening its domestic producers, China said it would lower production in a phased manner over the next few years. It did however announce a retaliatory tariff of 25% on U.S. seamless steel pipes in response to President Trump’s actions.Second, the U.S. imports a lot of steel pipes and tubes, such as those used in the energy industry. Whether domestic operations are currently geared to making those is debatable since a facility making sheets can’t easily be adapted to making pipes instead. Shutdown operations may be retooled for the purpose, but it will require significant time and investment.Third, the U.S., while still a big producer of pig iron, has gradually been moving away from ore-based raw materials to scrap instead. When the price of steel goes up, so does the price of scrap. Companies currently expect to pass this on to customers if competition from cheaper imports is controlled. But whether those customers are in a position to absorb the much higher priced steel is a big question.Which brings us to the fourth challenge. The top consumers of steel products in the U.S. are currently construction, automobile, energy, machinery & equipment, container, appliances, defense & military industries, which accounted for 40%, 26%, 10%, 10%, 4%, 4% and 3% of U.S. steel demand in 2017 (statista). So if steel prices go up, so will the costs for all these industries. This will hurt their profitability, make their output less competitive, and might lead them to curtail production. If they curtail production, steel producers will be hit again.So the big question before us now (other than price) is the level of demand that steel producers are seeing, which we can gauge from management comments, utilization rates (both current and expected) and revenue estimates. What a good thing that we are in the earnings season!Recent Earnings Reports Paint A Rosy PictureNucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) reported revenue and earnings that were both ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue grew 15.6% from last year while earnings grew 5.4%. Average selling price (ASP) grew 9%. Management said on the call that utilization at its steel mills was up.  The Zacks #2 (Buy) ranked company’s June quarter revenue estimate of $6.29 billion is up 2.7% from January while the September quarter revenue estimate of $6.38 billion is up 7.9%. The estimates represent 21.5% and 23.4% increases from the respective quarters of 2017.Steel Dynamics, Inc (STLD  -  Free Report) reported strong revenue and earnings, both of which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimates. Revenue grew 10.0% from last year while earnings grew 17.1%. ASP grew 11%. We’ll know about the utilization after the call.The Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) ranked stock’s June quarter revenue estimate of $2.82 billion is up 7.2% from January while the September quarter revenue estimate of $2.86 billion is up 10.7%. The estimates represent 18.0% and 17.1% increases from the respective quarters of 2017.ArcelorMittal’s (MT  -  Free Report) fourth quarter earnings report was in February, so it doesn’t capture the tariff drama. But the estimate revision trend may tell the story.The Zacks #1 ranked stock’s March quarter revenue estimate of $19.38 billion is up 5.0% from February while the June quarter revenue estimate of $21.15 billion is up 16.7%. The estimates represent 20.5% and 22.7% increases from the respective quarters of 2017.United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) will report results next week. The Zacks #1 ranked stock’s March quarter revenue estimate of $3.10 billion is marginally down from February while the June quarter revenue estimate of $3.45 billion is up 3.3%. The estimates represent 13.8% and 9.7% increases from the respective quarters of 2017.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

779,NUE,"Launched on 04/02/2007, the Invesco Zacks Mid-Cap ETF (CZA  -  Free Report) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Mid Cap ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.Fund Sponsor & IndexBecause the fund has amassed over $314.62 M, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Mid Cap ETFs. CZA is managed by Invesco. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Zacks Mid-Cap Core Index before fees and expenses.The Zacks Mid-Cap Core Index is comprised of 100 securities selected, based on investment and other criteria, from a universe of mid-capitalization securities including master limited partnerships and American depositary receipts.Cost & Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.65% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 1.11%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 32.40% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector; Industrials and Information Technology round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR  -  Free Report) accounts for about 2.22% of the fund's total assets, followed by Nucor Corp (NUE  -  Free Report) and Blackstone Group Lp/the (BX  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 20.39% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe fund's year-to-date return has lost about -1.07%, and is up about 8.52% in the last one year (as of 07/04/2018). CZA has traded between $59.80 and $68.99 in the past 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 0.93 and standard deviation of 13.06% for the trailing three-year period. With about 99 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

781,NUE,"Nucor Corporation’s (NUE  -  Free Report) shares rallied yesterday after it provided strong earnings guidance for second-quarter 2018. The steel giant expects earnings for the quarter in the band of $2.05 to $2.10 per share. That is a significant increase from $1.10 per share recorded in the previous quarter and $1.00 per share it earned a year ago. Analysts polled by Zacks currently expect earnings of $1.69 per share for the quarter.The Charlotte-based company’s shares rose around 2.6% to close at $68.53 yesterday. Nucor’s shares are up 7.8% so far this year, outperforming its industry’s 6% rise. Nucor noted that the expected increase in second-quarter performance on a sequential comparison basis is due to a significant improvement in performance of the steel mills segment on the back of higher average selling prices and higher profitability across all steel mill product groups, especially sheet mills. The company also sees sequentially higher profitability across its steel products and raw materials segments in the second quarter.The company noted that its improved earnings reflect stronger market conditions, which it believes have been favorably impacted by tax reform, deregulation and higher, stable oil prices.Nucor also believes that there is sustainable strength in steel end-use markets based on the current steel market fundamentals and communications with its customers. The company also said that its steel mill and steel product backlogs have trended upward since the start of 2018 and remain strong. It expects strong performance and profitability to continue through the balance of the year.   Nucor has been focusing on growth through strategic acquisitions and is well positioned to gain from such efforts to expand its business. The company also remains committed to expand its production capabilities.The company’s board, last month, cleared the construction of a galvanizing line at its sheet mill in Arkansas. The move will enable Nucor to expand into a wider and more diverse set of strategic end-market applications. The company is investing $240 million in the new galvanizing line that will have an annual capacity of around 500,000 tons and is expected to come online in the first half of 2021.This project is in sync with the company’s previous investment of $230 million which is currently underway to construct a specialty cold mill complex at Nucor Steel Arkansas.Both these projects will support the company to efficiently produce products beyond the capability of any North American mill. Further, it will help the company meet demand for advanced high-strength steel products. The company also plans to build additional galvanizing lines at other sheet mills as part of its initiative to further expand the sheet business.Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus  Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus | Nucor Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report), The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report) and Celanese Corporation (CE  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

782,NUE,"The White House is moving ahead with tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from top U.S. allies -- Canada, Mexico and the European Union (EU), triggering renewed fears of an international trade war and tit-for-tat retaliatory actions.The Trump administration said yesterday that it would levy a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminum imports from these three allies. The U.S. Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross said that the tariffs will go into effect today and are based on the lack of progress in the ongoing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiation talks.Following the initial tariff announcement on Mar 1, President Trump softened his stance by excluding Canada and Mexico -- two major sources of steel imports to the United States -- from the tariff orders, noting that they represent “a special case,” and will continue talks with them to address concerns.Canada is the largest steel exporter to the United States, accounting for roughly 16% of total U.S. steel imports in 2017, per the U.S. Census Bureau data. Mexico is the fourth-largest exporter of the metal with around 9% market share. They together represent roughly a quarter of U.S. steel imports.The U.S. administration extended negotiations on tariffs with Canada, Mexico and the EU by a month in May. The temporary exemptions on these major trade partners expired at midnight yesterday.U.S. Steel Makers Breathe a Sigh of ReliefThe Trump administration’s move is aimed at protecting the domestic steel and aluminum industries which had long been grappling with the onslaught of cheap imports and has suffered significant reduction in production and employment. President Trump believes that steel and aluminum companies have been “very unfairly treated by bad policy, by bad trade deals, by other countries” and the tariffs are necessary to protect the national security.The imposition of trade tariffs ends a month-long uncertainty surrounding the exemption of countries from the Trump tariff orders, providing a breather to American steel stocks. Shares of major U.S. steel makers got a lift yesterday following the tariff news. Shares of U.S. Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS  -  Free Report), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report) popped as much as roughly 8.2%, 7.4%, 3.6% and 3.3%, respectively.U.S. Steel, AK Steel, Steel Dynamics and Nucor each currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Domestic steel makers struggled to cope with a renewed tide of cheap steel imports last year. These imports hurt selling prices and margins of U.S. steel makers.The trade tariffs would provide a much-needed reprieve to the U.S. steel makers. The tariffs would provide a boost to steel prices, give American steel makers more pricing power and help to level the playing field.Steel prices have been on an upswing in the United States on the back of the Trump administration’s trade actions to curb imports, reflected by the run-up in hot-rolled steel prices. The trade tariffs contributed to a spike in U.S. steel prices, driving the performance of domestic steel makers in the first quarter. The pricing momentum is likely to continue in the second quarter, thereby providing a boost to margins of U.S. steel players.The tariffs are expected to lead to lower imports into the United States, which would in turn boost demand for American steel and drive profitability of U.S. steel makers. All these are likely to help in creating hundreds of new steel jobs in the country.According to the American Iron and Steel Institute (“AISI”), an association of North American steel makers, total and finished steel imports dipped 3% and 1.7%, respectively, year over year in the first quarter. For 2018, annualized total and finished steel imports are expected to decline 8.8% and 7.6% year over year, respectively, per the AISI.The tariffs are also expected to boost production capacity of domestic steel makers amid lower imports. The U.S. Department of Commerce earlier said that the trade actions are aimed at increasing domestic steel production to roughly 80% operating rate from its present 73% capacity.But Trade War Fears Flare AgainThe tariff announcement stoked concerns of a global trade war and sparked selloff on Wall Street yesterday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling roughly 1% while the S&P 500 losing around 0.7%.Moreover, fears of higher steel prices as a result of the tariffs hit the stocks of some of the major industrial companies that are key consumers of the metal. Shares of Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) lost 2.3% while The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) was down 1.7%.The announced trade actions have prompted fiery responses from major U.S. allies. Canadian Foreign Minister, Chrystia Freeland said yesterday that Canada would impose retaliatory tariffs on C$16.6 billion worth of U.S. exports beginning in July and also challenge the U.S. measures under the NAFTA and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau also said the tariffs are ""totally unacceptable"" and “these tariffs will harm industry and workers on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border”.Mexico, in its response to the U.S. tariffs, said that it will impose equivalent measures on a vast range of U.S. farm and industrial products including steel, pork legs, apples, blueberries, grapes and various cheeses. Mexico's economy minister noted that the measures will remain in effect until the United States eliminates the tariffs.Meanwhile, the European Commission (EC), in a tweet, said yesterday that “The EU believes these unilateral US tariffs are unjustified and at odds with World Trade Organisation rules. This is protectionism, pure and simple.” “We will immediately introduce a settlement dispute at WTO and will announce counterbalancing measures in the next hours. Unilateral measures are totally unacceptable” the EC added.The EU had earlier threatened to impose tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles and other iconic U.S. brands in retaliation to the Trump administration’s tariff move. The 28-nation bloc, in March, published a list of U.S. products worth around $3.4 billion on which it had planned to impose trade penalties.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

785,NUE,"Overview
"
786,NUE,"The Metals & Mining industry encompasses the extraction (mining) as well as the primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals such as aluminum, gold, precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of the output.
"
787,NUE,"The largest segment of the global metals market is iron and steel followed by aluminum. The iron and steel segment comprises more than half the industry in terms of volume. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products, such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars.
"
788,NUE,"The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores.
"
789,NUE,"Historically, the automotive and construction markets have been the largest consumers of metals, accounting for more than 50% of total demand. Other metal consumers include energy, electrical equipment, agricultural, domestic and commercial equipment and industrial machinery. Large automakers such as General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report), Toyota Motor Corp (TM  -  Free Report) and Honda Motor Co. Ltd (HMC  -  Free Report) are large consumers of metals, especially steel and aluminum.
"
790,NUE,"Overall Outlook
"
791,NUE,"The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over-demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in London Metal Exchange prices, general economic conditions and end-use markets. Individual company profitability depends on volume and operating efficiency. Large producers with huge resources are able to discover and develop new deposits, thereby boosting reserves, while the smaller ones devote their attention to fewer mines.
"
792,NUE,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have historically been a critically important growth strategy for mining companies. The year 2009 experienced a lull in M&A activity under the impact of the global economic downturn, with a deal value almost half of 2008. The focus for M&A activity shifted from business growth to business survival, as companies looked to safeguard their teetering balance sheets rather than seeking expansion.
"
793,NUE,"In 2010, fairly unpredictable financial markets dictated metals prices, despite strong underlying fundamentals. In addition, several notable mining accidents have made mine safety a major factor for the industry and regulators. Despite the volatility, gold prices rose 400% over the past ten years and made a record run in 2010, increasing 26% and hitting a high of $1,432 an ounce.
"
794,NUE,"The year 2011 has been unstable for metals so far with double-digit gold sell-offs and rallies during the first quarter. However, investors remain cautiously optimistic regarding the sector. Many analysts predict metal prices will end the year with double-digit growth considering demand is still outstripping supply. Unrest in the Middle East is also driving metal prices. On the down side, the end of the Fed’s QE2 program and overall atmosphere of greater focus on fiscal restraint may limit significant gains. 
"
795,NUE,"In an industry plagued with rising energy and raw material costs, increasing productivity and reducing costs are the keys to success. Given the cyclical nature of the metals industry, low-volume, and high-cost producers need to generate sufficient cash or ensure a strong borrowing position during market peaks to survive the market troughs.
"
796,NUE,"Continuing consolidation supports the sector’s ability to influence the price of input costs and companies can also obtain synergies and economies of scale through the operation of vertically integrated raw materials sources. Expansion in low-cost countries will ensure lower labor costs and also help tap their growth potential.
"
797,NUE,"Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region -- in particular China and India -- is witnessing higher production and consumption of metals. Per capita consumption levels in both these countries are calibrating to U.S./European levels, which could, theoretically at least, double metal demand in the longer term. China is the world’s largest consumer of metals and is expected to remain so.
"
798,NUE,"Further, developed regions such as the US and Europe are showing signs of recovery, albeit at a moderate pace. Overall, we expect global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries.
"
799,NUE,"Demand as well as production for industrial metals in Japan has been recently affected as factories have been shut in the aftermath of the country’s earthquake and Tsunami. Japan is the biggest buyer of aluminum and the second largest buyer of copper ore. We, however, believe that metal demand will be boosted by the construction industry triggered by the country’s reconstruction efforts.Detailed Look into Metals
"
800,NUE,"Steel
"
801,NUE,"As the major shareholder (about 60%) of the metals market, the steel industry was severely bruised by the global economic downturn. However, according to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production in 2010 reached a record 1,414 million metric tons (mmt), an increase of 15% compared with 2009. All the major steel-producing countries and regions showed double-digit growth in 2010. In April 2011, the world crude steel production was 127 million metric tons (mmt), an increase of 5.0% from April 2010.
"
802,NUE,"The U.S. produced 80.6 mmt of crude steel, 38.5% higher than 2009. Of the world’s steel production, US’s share increased to 5.7% from 4.7% in 2009, pushing the country to the third position in 2010 from fifth position in 2009.
"
803,NUE,"The growth trend continued in 2011, with world crude steel production increasing 5.3% in January to 119 mmt from January 2010 levels. United States crude steel production rose smartly by 9.4% to 6.8 mmt compared with January 2010. The US produced 7.1 mmt of crude steel in April 2011, an increase of 2.1% year over year.
"
804,NUE,"Reflecting on 2010 data, we see a sharp increase in revenues and shipments across most companies. Sales of ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), the world’s largest steel-producing company, increased 27.3% year over year to $22 billion in the first quarter of 2011. Steel shipments also increased to 22.0 million metric tons compared with 21.0 million metric tons in the year-ago quarter.
"
805,NUE,"Similarly, sales for U.S. Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) soared 24.8% to $4.9 billion and steel shipments went up to 5.8 million tons. Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) recorded a sales increase of 32% to reach $4.83 billion with shipments increasing 9%. Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) reported a 29.6% increase in revenues to generate $2.01 billion with shipments rising 4% to 1.5 million tons.
"
806,NUE,"The steel industry is emerging from the gloom of the global recession as is evident from the above figures. However, given its economic sensitivity, we expect global steel demand to improve only gradually, in line with the recovery in the user industries, especially automotive and residential construction.
"
807,NUE,"Although steel prices have been stabilizing since the latter part of 2009, they remain significantly below the pre-crisis levels. We believe that a sustained recovery in steel prices remains uncertain in the backdrop of sluggish economic activity.
"
808,NUE,"Currently, Steel Dynamics has a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) for the short-term (1 to 3 months) while U.S. Steel holds a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold). ArcelorMittal currently retains a Zacks Rank #3 Rank (Hold). We maintain our Outperform recommendation in the long term for ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel, while we maintain a long-term Neutral recommendation on Nucor.Gold
"
809,NUE,"As per the World Gold Council, gold prices rose for the tenth consecutive year in 2010, reflecting recovery in key sectors of demand and continued global economic uncertainty. In 2010, gold prices jumped 29%, reaching $1,405 per ounce as of the end of December.
"
810,NUE,"During 2010, the price of gold rose to record levels on several occasions, trading as high as $1,432 per ounce. Gold’s performance was strong and volatility remained low. The World Gold Council suggests that the increase was not only driven by inflationary forces but was also inflated as both the private and public sectors of India and China rushed into the gold market.
"
811,NUE,"Gold demand went up 9% over 2009, showcasing a 10-year high of 3,912.2 tons, driven by the rise in jewelry demand, the revival of the Indian market and strong momentum in Chinese gold demand. Moreover, central banks became net purchasers of gold for the first time in 21 years, hiking the demand for the yellow metal.
"
812,NUE,"Major demand came from India and China. India bought 746 tons, a 69% increase over 2009, and China bought 400 tons of gold jewelry. China bought 179.9 tons of gold in the form of bars and coin, a 70% increase over 2009.
"
813,NUE,"Global gold demand in the first quarter of 2011 totaled 981.3 tons, up 11% year over year from 881.0 tons in the first quarter of 2010. This was largely attributable to the widespread rise in demand for bars and coins, supported by an improvement in jewelry demand in key markets.
"
814,NUE,"The quarterly average gold price hit a new record of $1,386.27/oz (London PM Fix), its eighth consecutive year-over-year increase. Despite a period of price consolidation in the early part of the quarter, it climbed to record highs throughout March and has continued to achieve new highs in April and May.
"
815,NUE,"Gold remained a coveted asset given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries made gold an attractive and safe investment option. The European sovereign debt crisis made European investors use gold as a currency hedge. Pressure on the US dollar against various currencies coupled with higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, also pushed up gold prices.
"
816,NUE,"The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers. Jewelry and investment demand in non-Western markets continues to rebound while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world gold production, should drive demand for gold along with China. The Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years.
"
817,NUE,"Even though gold price dropped 7% in January this year, it again recorded a rise in February. We believe gold demand and prices will strengthen in 2011. As China and India continue to grow rapidly, their demand for gold will also rise in tandem.
"
818,NUE,"Higher prices bode well for gold producers, which should benefit giants such as Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX  -  Free Report), Agnico-Eagle (AEM  -  Free Report) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG). However, gold producers like Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and offset the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
819,NUE,"Overall, the stock prices of gold producers are not expected to benefit much from this favorable commodity-price backdrop. This is reflected in our overall long-term neutral views on the stocks. As major economies continue to recover, investors’ confidence will be restored to invest in stock markets, which could cause gold prices to fall. However this is not going to happen in the near future. We have a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) on Barrick Gold, Agnico-Eagle, Goldcorp, Kinross Gold Corporation and Newmont Mining.

820,NUE,"Aluminum
"
821,NUE,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, relating to prices subject to worldwide supply and demand forces along with other influences. The global economic downturn had a historic, negative impact on the aluminum industry, leading to an unprecedented decline in LME-based aluminum prices, weak end markets, fall in demand, increased global inventories, and higher costs of borrowing and diminished credit availability. The economy has however recovered from the crisis of the economic downturn.Alcoa Inc. (AA) is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum. In response to the global economic downturn, the company implemented a number of operational and financial actions to improve its cost structure and liquidity, including curtailing production, halting non-critical capital expenditures, accelerating new sourcing strategies for raw materials, divesting non-core assets, reducing global headcount, suspending its share repurchase program, reducing its quarterly common stock dividend and resorting to other liquidity enhancements.
"
822,NUE,"In 2011, Alcoa plans to restart certain idled potlines at three smelters. These restarts are expected to increase Alcoa’s aluminum production by 137 kmt during 2011 and by 204 kmt on an annual basis thereafter. Such measures are sure to meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand.
"
823,NUE,"Alcoa expects demand for aluminum to grow 12% this year. China, India, Brazil and Russia are all expected to register double-digit increases in aluminum demand. Market conditions for aluminum products in all global markets are expected to improve, particularly in aerospace, automotive and industrial gas turbine.
"
824,NUE,"On the cost side, however, energy prices and currency movements are expected to keep posting challenges. Overall, Alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum remain bright and envisions that global demand for aluminum will double by 2020.
"
825,NUE,"Since the sudden decline from peak prices in mid-2008, aluminum prices have increased over the last 2 years. In 2010, global aluminum prices increased 13%. Alcoa increased its fiscal 2010 profit on the back of higher prices and continued strengthening in most end markets. Aluminum Corporation of China, or Chalco (ACH) swung back to profit in 2010 after posting a loss in 2009, attributable to increased global aluminum prices.
"
826,NUE,"In the medium-to-long term, aluminum consumption will improve globally with improving automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. Aluminum is widely used for packaging, beverage cans, food containers and foil products. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and the light weight of the metal.
"
827,NUE,"Further, the surge in copper price this year is triggering a switch among manufacturers to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting toward aluminum, which is more economical.
"
828,NUE,"We expect aluminum demand to increase in the long term, outstripping supply growth with the improving end-markets. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization. Both these factors are positive for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa, Paramount Gold and Silver Corporation (PZG) and Aluminum Corporation of China should benefit from the improving demand outlook.
"
829,NUE,"Currently, Alcoa holds a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) supported by our long-term Neutral recommendation, while Paramount Gold and Silver has a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell).
"
830,NUE,"Copper
"
831,NUE,"Copper prices have shown a rising trend in 2010 benefiting copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO). Although copper demand was down 10% year over year in 2009, global copper demand has since been witnessing growth.
"
832,NUE,"The Chinese demand for copper was still robust and imports of the metal were rebounding, which was supported by steady construction and infrastructure activity in the country. The improvement in copper prices would be supported by limited supply and increased demand from China.
"
833,NUE,"Even though copper prices are at near all-time highs, the outlook for copper prices remains favorable. Not denying the volatility in prices that are bound to remain, we have a bullish stance on copper prices, in the long term. However, as discussed earlier, manufacturers might now resort to aluminum as a substitute.
"
834,NUE,"Market conditions are expected to be positive for copper in the next couple of years due to higher consumption of the metal in the developing nations. The companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.
"
835,NUE,"We currently have a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) and long-term Neutral recommendation on both Freeport and Southern Copper.                    
"
836,NUE,"Despite the credit crunch, housing slump and ongoing economic weakness, steel companies are enjoying pricing power. AK Steel (AKS  -  Free Report) recently announced price increases for both stainless and carbon steel products and Steel Dynamics (STLD  -  Free Report) cited widened margins as the reason for its improved first-quarter EPS guidance.
"
837,NUE,"How is this possible?
"
838,NUE,"The bubble in commodity prices has customers expecting price increases. The far bigger reason, however, is supply. Inventories, which have been volatile, are low. Less supply means higher prices.
"
839,NUE,"Global economic growth has kept demand for steel relatively good, while consolidation within the industry has kept capacity from being greatly expanded. Within the U.S., higher freight costs and the weaker dollar have made imported steel less competitive.
"
840,NUE,"Steel producers are taking advantage of the situation to push through price increases, while keeping an eye on controlling costs where they can. Higher raw material costs are a concern, but so far, steel producers have been able to pass along those costs.
"
841,NUE,"Not surprisingly, brokerage analysts have recently raised their forecasts on multiple companies within Steel-Producers. Just within the past 30 days, four or more brokerage analysts have upwardly adjusted their projections on Arcelormittal (MT  -  Free Report), Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (SID  -  Free Report), Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) and U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report), in addition to AKS and STLD.
"
842,NUE,"MT, SID, NUE, STLD and X are Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stocks. AKS is a Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stock.
"
843,NUE,"One industry group lacking pricing power is Transportation-Trucking. The economic slump, competition from rail for long-haul freight and too many trucks has resulted in price competition within the industry. Spot prices remain weak and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future.
"
844,NUE,"Adding to the pressures are rising fuel costs. Like gasoline, the cost of diesel has risen significantly and now averages about $4 per gallon.
"
845,NUE,"On Tuesday, independent truck drivers went on strike to protest diesel fuel prices. News reports place the cost of filling up a rig in excess of $1,000. Since independent drivers cannot pass along the higher costs, they are seeing their salaries being cut. As a result, many of them want the Bush administration to act. The strike is expected to last throughout the week, though it is unclear how many drivers are actually participating.
"
846,NUE,"Although the large trucking companies are better equipped to handle higher diesel prices, their profit margins are still taking a hit. This is why brokerage analysts continue to express pessimism about the outlook for these companies.
"
847,NUE,"During the past 30 days, four or more brokerage analysts have lowered their full-year earnings estimates on Con-Way (CNW), Heartland Express (HTLD  -  Free Report), J.B. Hunt (JBHT), Knight Transportation (KNX), Werner Enterprises (WERN  -  Free Report) and YRC Worldwide (YRCW  -  Free Report).

851,NUE,"Global crude steel production expanded in April as steel mills in China -- the world's biggest steel producer -- ramped up production following the end of the winter output cuts that were aimed at cleaning up the environment. Higher output from India and the United States also supported the production growth.According to the latest report from the World Steel Association (""WSA"") -- the international trade body for the iron and steel industry -- crude steel production for 64 reporting nations went up 4.1% year over year for the reported month to 148.3 million tons (Mt).Chinese Steel Mills Step Up OutputProduction from China, which accounts for around half of the global steel output, spiked 4.8% year over year to a new record high of 76.7 Mt in April as steel mills in the country beefed up output after the four-month production restriction to curb pollution during the winter months was lifted in March 2018.Chinese steel mills are stepping up production, driven by higher profits. The spike in output came despite Beijing’s ongoing efforts to reduce the country’s massive excess steel capacity and streamline its burgeoning steel sector. The lifting of the capacity restrictions has triggered fears of renewed oversupply.Meanwhile, cheap steel exports from China is still causing a problem. China’s steel exports shot up roughly 15% on a monthly basis in April, the highest since August 2017, per data released by the General Administration of Customs. High levels of steel exports from the country amid weak domestic demand and surplus supply remain a concern.How Other Key Producers FaredAmong other major Asian producers, India saw a 5.6% rise in production to 8.7 Mt in April. Steel mills in the country have been benefiting from higher domestic steel prices and increasing local demand.Production in Japan slipped 0.4% to 8.7 Mt in the reported month. South Korea witnessed a 7.1% jump to 5.9 Mt. Consolidated output were up 4.2% to 103.5 Mt in Asia.In North America, crude steel production rose 3.6% to 6.9 Mt in the United States. American steel mills are benefiting from higher domestic steel prices.The trade tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are expected to boost production capacity of U.S. steel makers amid lower imports. The U.S. Department of Commerce had said that the trade actions are aimed at increasing domestic steel production to roughly 80% operating rate from its present 73% capacity.On prospects of higher steel demand as a result of the U.S. trade measures, U.S. Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) is restarting one of its Granite City Works blast furnaces and steelmaking facilities. Another U.S. steel major, Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report) also investing $240 million to build a rebar micro mill in Florida.While there are still uncertainties surrounding exemptions of countries from the Trump tariff orders, there is no denying the fact that the trade actions have instilled optimism in the long-struggling American steel industry.Meanwhile, output in Canada shot up 13.8% to around 1.2 Mt in April. Overall production in North America was up 6.4% to roughly 9.9 Mt.  In the Europe Union, production from Germany, the biggest producer in the region, fell 1.7% to 3.8 Mt. Output went up 3.7% in Italy to 2.1 Mt while climbing 10.7% to 1.4 Mt in France. Spain saw a 7.5% jump to 1.3 Mt. Total output rose 3.4% in the European Union to 14.9 Mt.Output in the Middle East climbed 8.6% to 2.9 Mt with Iran, the top producer in the region, seeing a 12.4% rise to 1.9 Mt. Africa recorded a 3.8% gain to 1.1 Mt in the reported month.Among other notable producers, production from Turkey was down 3.1% to 2.9 Mt. Output from Brazil, the largest producer in South America, ticked up 1.9% to 2.9 Mt.Crude steel capacity utilization ratio for the reporting countries was 76.9% in April, up from 74.5% recorded both in the previous month and a year ago.Steel Sector Gaining MomentumThe steel industry has staged a recovery after being out of favor for long. The industry’s upturn has been supported by strong economic momentum in advanced and developing economies and sustained healthy demand in automobile and construction sectors.While the overall demand fundamentals for steel is improving, the industry is still challenged by sustained overcapacity. The global steel industry continues to reel under the effects of excess capacity -- the biggest obstacle to persistent growth and profitability.The Zacks Steel Producers industry has outperformed the broader market in a year’s time. The industry saw a rise of around 31% in this period, higher than the S&P 500’s corresponding gain of around 12.6%. Demand outlook for steel is encouraging as the WSA sees global steel demand to expand 1.8% in 2018 as favorable global economic scenario, a rebound in commodity prices and strong investment will drive steel demand in both developed and developing economies.Per the WSA, the outlook for steel demand in the United States is strong, backed by strong investment and consumption triggered by rising income and low interest rates. In the Eurozone, broadening recovery across countries, robust domestic demand, resumption in investment as well as pickup in non-residential construction and strong manufacturing activities will support steel demand. Steel Stocks to ConsiderA few stocks worth considering in the steel space are Ternium S.A. (TX  -  Free Report), Grupo Simec, S.A.B. de C.V. (SIM  -  Free Report), ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report) and Universal Stainless & Alloy Products, Inc. (USAP  -  Free Report).

854,NUE,"The World Steel industry is rather concentrated in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of sales.
"
855,NUE,"Steel products are classified into four broad categories: flat steel products, long steel products, scrap and semi-finished products. Flat products include plates, hot-rolled strip and sheets and cold-rolled strip and sheets. The long steel product category comprises wire rods, beams, reinforced bars and merchant bars. The products under both these categories are rolled from steel slabs, which are considered as unfinished or semi-finished products that are generally not sold.
"
856,NUE,"Historically, the automotive and construction markets have remained the largest consumers of steel, absorbing more than half of the total steel produced. Large automakers such as General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report) and Honda Motor Company (HMC  -  Free Report) depend upon the steel industry. Other steel consuming industries include appliances, agricultural implements, converters, containers, energy, electrical equipment and industrial machinery.Production
"
857,NUE,"The global steel industry has been going through major changes since 1970. World crude steel production has continued to show a steady increase since April 2009 on the back of a moderate rise in demand and the resumption of work at idled facilities. China has emerged as a major producer and consumer.
"
858,NUE,"According to the World Steel Association (WSA), world crude steel production was 127 million metric tons (mmt) in April 2011, an increase of 5.0% from April 2010. In 2010, world crude steel production reached a record 1,414 mmt, up 15% year over year. ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report) is the world’s largest steel company, with crude steel production of 90.6 million tons in 2010.
"
859,NUE,"China’s crude steel production for April 2011 was 59 mmt, up 7.1% year over year. Japan produced 8.4 mmt of crude steel in April 2011, down 6.3% year over year due to the production disruption caused by the recent earthquake and tsunami. South Korea experienced an increase of 15.9% from April 2010, producing 5.9 mmt of crude steel in April 2011.
"
860,NUE,"The US produced 7.1 mmt of crude steel in April 2011, an increase of 2.1% year over year.
"
861,NUE,"In the EU (European Union), Germany’s crude steel production for April 2011 was 3.8 mmt, down 1.7% year over year. Italy’s crude steel production was 2.5 mmt, up 9.8% year over year. Spain produced 1.5 mmt of crude steel in April 2011, down 5.8% year over year.
"
862,NUE,"Turkey’s crude steel production for April 2011 was 2.8 mmt, up 14.3% year over year. Egypt crude steel production in April 2011 was 0.5 mmt, down 0.8% year over year.
"
863,NUE,"In April 2011, the world crude steel capacity utilization ratio of the 64 countries was 82.8%, up 0.9% than in March 2011. Compared to April 2010, the utilization ratio remained unchanged.Growth Trends
"
864,NUE,"With the global economy picking up in late 2009, the steel industry started seeing signs of improvement. However, given its economic sensitivity, we expect global steel demand to improve gradually, in line with the recovery in the user industries, especially automotive and residential construction.
"
865,NUE,"According to World Steel Association, steel demand in the U.S. was down 41.6% in 2009 to 57.4 million tons. However, with the economy in recovery mode, production increased by 7.7% to 7.1 million metric tons in March 2011 from 6.6 million metric tons in February 2011. This marks a 0.2% decrease from the March 2010 production level.
"
866,NUE,"The steel industry has recorded high growth rates in both production and consumption over the past few years, benefiting from soaring steel demand in the automobile and construction sectors before the recession. Moreover, cost effective and highly efficient steel-making technologies have lifted the demand for US steel in the Middle Eastern and Asian countries.
"
867,NUE,"As per the WSA, India was the fourth largest producer of crude steel during January to September 2010. India produced 50.1 million tons crude steel during the period. However, according to the industry estimates, India is likely to be the second-largest producer of crude steel in the next four years from its current fourth place.
"
868,NUE,"In the short term, local steel demand in Japan will be lower as the country's carmakers have suspended production following the earthquake. However, the need for reconstruction of earthquake-devastated areas offers the steel industry significant hope. In the medium term though, steel demand will likely surge.
"
869,NUE,"However, WSA expects the Chinese steel consumption to decelerate in 2011 as China tries to ease back on its own economic boom.
"
870,NUE,"Here, we will discuss recently quarterly results of a few companies, whose results were aided by higher selling prices and increased shipments, and their growth expectations.
"
871,NUE,"Steel giant ArcelorMittal reported diluted net earnings of 69 cents per share in the first quarter of 2011, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents as well as last year’s 42 cents per share. Total steel shipments in the first quarter of 2011 were 22.0 million metric tons compared with 21.0 million metric tons in the year-ago quarter.
"
872,NUE,"Quarterly revenues increased 27.3% year over year to $22.2 billion from $17.4 billion in the year-ago quarter and increased 7.2% sequentially. Sales were higher over the previous quarter primarily due to higher shipment volumes (+4%). However, the results were slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.8 billion.
"
873,NUE,"For the second quarter of 2011, management expects EBITDA to be approximately $3.0 - $3.5 billion. Steel shipment volumes, average steel selling prices and EBITDA/ton are expected to increase sequentially, while capacity utilization levels are expected to improve to approximately 80%.
"
874,NUE,"Additionally, operating costs are expected to increase sequentially due to higher raw material prices. The company also expects mining production and profitability to improve sequentially in the second quarter.
"
875,NUE,"The company expects working capital requirements to increase in line with the increased activity levels and prices resulting in further increase in net debt in the second quarter. The company expects its full-year 2011 capital expenditure to reach $5 billion, of which $1.4 billion is estimated to be spent on mining.
"
876,NUE," The commercial metals company AK Steel Holding (AKS) posted its first-quarter 2011 results delivering an EPS of 8 cents compared with 2 cents during the year-ago quarter and striding ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of a cent.
"
877,NUE,"Net sales were $1,581.1 million on the shipments of 1,423,100 tons versus $ 1,405.7 million and 1,385,800 tons in the prior-year quarter. It however, missed the Zacks Estimate of $1,609 million. The improvement in shipments was mainly due to higher pricing, which increased 9% on a year-over-year basis to $1,109 per ton.
"
878,NUE,"The company expects shipments in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 to be in the range of 1,500,000 and 1,550,000 tons, indicating a strong increase over the first-quarter shipments. The company also anticipates its average per-ton selling price to be 7% higher compared with the first quarter. The operating profit is expected to be approximately $65 per ton for the second quarter.
"
879,NUE,"AK Steel is uniquely positioned to focus on products with high margins. Electrical steel continues to be the company’s strongest product line, with demand recovering in the U.S. and abroad, though at a slower rate. AK Steel is operating its plants at above 80% capacity and is well positioned to serve the end markets when the demand rebounds.
"
880,NUE,"However, higher input costs, particularly iron ore, are eroding margins of the company. Iron ore pricing concerns have led to a negative outlook for steel manufacturers. Allegheny Technologies Inc. (ATI  -  Free Report) also earned $56.3 million, or 54 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2011, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents and last year's $18.2 million, or 18 cents per share. First-quarter results were impacted by $5.8 million, or $0.05 per share, for previously announced executive retirements and a discrete tax item.
"
881,NUE,"Quarterly revenues soared 36.5% year over year to $1.23 billion from $899.4 million on higher shipments and rising raw material prices. Revenues were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 billion.
"
882,NUE,"Segment wise, revenue increases were distinct in the Engineered Products segment (46%) and in the Flat-Rolled Products segment (38%), while sales in the Higher Performance Material segment increased (32%).
"
883,NUE,"Allegheny continues to expect 2011 revenue growth to be in the range of 15% to 20% compared with 2010, and expects segment operating profit to be approximately 15% of sales. The company targets a minimum of $100 million in new gross cost reductions. Capital expenditures are forecasted at $300 to $350 million.

884,NUE,"During the second quarter of 2011, management anticipates utilizing approximately $395 million of cash on hand to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration for the previously announced acquisition of Ladish and to pay related fees and expenses.
"
885,NUE,"Currently, Allegheny has a short-term (1 to 3 months) Zacks #2 Rank (Buy).Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) reported a stupendous increase in profit to $190.8 million or 56 cents per share (excluding special items) in the first quarter of 2011 from $55 million or 15 cents per share (excluding special items) in the same quarter of 2010. With this, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21 cents per share and its own guidance of 30 cents–35 cents per share.
"
886,NUE,"Consolidated sales surged 32% to $4.83 billion due to a 22% increase in average price per ton and a 9% rise in shipments (to 6.0 million tons) to outside customers. It was higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.43 billion.
"
887,NUE,"Steel mill shipments grew 10% to 5.2 million tons during the quarter. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton gained 33% to $424.
"
888,NUE,"Nucor expects results in the second quarter to improve over the first quarter, despite some market weakness that may impact results at the end of the second quarter. Further, the company continues to see slow but steady improvement in real demand in certain end markets.
"
889,NUE,"The most challenging markets for its products are associated with residential and non-residential construction. The company retains a Zacks #3 (Hold) Rank on its stock.
"
890,NUE,"According to the World Steel Association (WSA), in 2011 world steel demand is expected to grow by 5.9% to reach a historical high of 1,359.2 mmt, up from 1,339.7 mmt predicted in October 2011. While 2012 global steel consumption is forecast to rise 6% to 1,440.6 mmt, the WSA noted that the forecast was made prior to the Japanese earthquake, which would likely lead to steel demand coming in below 63 mmt estimated by the association in 2011, while steel consumption will probably be higher than the 2012 forecast of 63 mmt.Industry Capacity
"
891,NUE,"The global steel industry is capital intensive, cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity. Capacity utilization rates were, however, low (around 60%) at the beginning of 2009, in response to the much softer demand. With steel demand picking up in the latter half of the year, the world crude steel capacity utilization ratio in January 2011 was 75.6%, up from 73.3% in December 2010.
"
892,NUE,"Steel makers continue to add capacity besides resuming operations at the idled facilities, inspired by the expected rebound in steel industry in the longer term.Price Trends
"
893,NUE,"The steel industry has long witnessed volatility in prices with a large spot market. Steel prices rose steadily for most of 2008, after which there was a downtrend. Lower prices had an adverse effect on steel producers, who recorded lower revenues and margins, and had to write down finished steel and raw material inventories.
"
894,NUE,"The period witnessed major steel producers slashing production to minimize inventory accumulation. The U.S. Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report), the eleventh-largest steel producer worldwide, slashed production by almost 62% during the second quarter of 2009, while Korean steel maker POSCO  cut production by about 15%. This was the first time in its history that POSCO was forced to adopt such a measure, which is a proof of the adverse operating environment.
"
895,NUE,"Although steel prices have been stabilizing since the latter part of 2009, they are significantly below the pre-crisis level. We believe that a sustained recovery in steel prices remains uncertain in the backdrop of sluggish economic activity.Factors Affecting Steel PricesChinese Imports: The steel industry is also affected by fluctuations in steel import–export and tariffs. China is the largest steel producer globally, and balances its domestic production and consumption, which is an important factor in global steel prices.
"
896,NUE,"Consumers in the U.S. are importing cheaper steel from China, which is forcing domestic steel producers to sell at lower prices, and even at a loss, sometimes. To this end, the U.S. government has been imposing anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel imports.Economic Sustainability: Concerns about the sustainability of economic recovery and queries regarding China’s growth momentum come into play in the pricing equation. This relatively uncertain Chinese outlook, coupled with a still tentative recovery in the developed world, is expected to weigh on prices.Threat from substitutes: Steel has many substitutes like aluminum, which replaces it in the automotive markets. Cement, composites, glass, plastic and wood are also used as steel substitutes. This significantly influences market prices and demand for steel products.Raw Material Trends
"
897,NUE,"The key input for steel production is iron ore. Apart from this, coking coal and coke, scrap, electricity and natural gas are also used as inputs in steel production. The raw materials industry is highly concentrated with only three major players -- Vale (VALE  -  Free Report), Rio Tinto (RTP) and BHP Billiton (BHP  -  Free Report) -- having significant pricing power. The risk lies in further consolidation among raw material suppliers. For instance, the announced iron ore joint venture between mining companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto would further increase the pricing power of both the suppliers.
"
898,NUE,"Steel makers would face higher production costs if suppliers shift to sales based on spot prices from the long-term fixed price contract system, as spot prices for most of the raw materials, especially iron ore, remained high from 2006 through 2008. Iron ore prices dropped 5.7% to $168 a ton for ore with 62% iron content delivered to China.
"
899,NUE,"Iron ore prices have remained volatile during most of 2010 and are expected to rise sharply in 2011. ArcelorMittal’s iron ore and coal mining projects have been a key focus in the recent years and this focus is only expected to intensify in the medium term, as the company has a goal to secure 100 million tons of iron ore supply from its own mines and under strategic long-term supply contracts on a cost-plus basis. As part of this strategy, in January 2011, the company announced the acquisition of Baffinland, which holds a substantial undeveloped iron ore deposit in the Canadian territory of Nunavut.
"
900,NUE,"Consolidation
"
901,NUE,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have remained an important growth strategy in the steel industry. M&A activities prevent additional steel capacity, providing production efficiency and economies of scale. The biggest example is Mittal Steel’s acquisition of Arcelor in 2006. The Tata Steel and Corus merger in 2008 is another instance of industry consolidation.
"
902,NUE,"Consolidation has been primarily driven by the urge to increase global scale and operations, and access new markets. The industry is likely to see more M&A activity in the coming years as the industry players prepare themselves for a recovery in the long run.Zacks Recommendation
"
903,NUE,"Steel demand in the emerging markets outside China is expected to grow strongly in 2011. In China, the government’s expansionary economic policies, easy credit and construction initiatives have thus far sustained demand. But with China attempting to rein in its overheated property sector and engineer a soft landing for its economy, steel demand will most likely soften noticeably in the coming months. This relatively uncertain Chinese outlook, coupled with a still tentative recovery in the developed world, is expected to weigh on prices.
"
904,NUE,"In the short term, we are neutral on steel manufacturers like AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS), Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI  -  Free Report).
"
905,NUE,"AK Steel’s cost structure is higher than its peer group due to a greater reliance on external supply of raw materials such as carbon scrap, purchased slabs, iron ore and purchased coke. Iron ore is the key raw material in steel manufacturing operations.
"
906,NUE,"However, industry giants with integrated business models like U.S. Steel and ArcelorMittal have an edge over their peers. Both steel makers have substantial captive sources of iron ore and coal and source about 75%–80% of their coke and iron ore requirements from owned and/or operated facilities.
"
907,NUE,"Nucor Corporation's (NUE  -  Free Report) share price is up 21% in the last four months as profitability has improved in each month of the new year. With Steel prices on the upswing and a bullish 41% growth projection, this Zacks #1 rank stock is fabricating momentum.
"
908,NUE,"Company Description
"
909,NUE,"Nucor Corp, through its subsidiaries, manufactures and sells steel products in the United States and internationally. The company was founded in 1940 and has a market cap of $14 billion.
"
910,NUE,"Although NUE has seen its fair share of volatility over the last 12 months, shares have been trading strong since early December as steel demand begins to improve. That led the company to provide guidance on its Q1 results set to hit the wire on April 2.
"
911,NUE,"First-Quarter Guidance
"
912,NUE,"Nucor expects earnings to come in between 30 and 35 cents per share, a huge gain from last year's 10 cents and last quarter's loss of 4 cents. Analysts had been looking for earnings of 30 cents.
"
913,NUE,"The company noted that the strong results were a product of demand improvement in its end markets and higher steel prices. But even though the tone was optimistic, Nucor did note that it continues to see weakness in both residential and non-residential construction, tempering expectations for a return to the booming steel market we saw from 2006 to 2008.
"
914,NUE,"Estimates
"
915,NUE,"We've seen some pretty decent movement in estimates over the last few months, with the current year up 46 cents to $2.76. The next-year estimate is also up 46 cents to $3.91, a bullish 42% growth projection.
"
916,NUE,"Valuation
"
917,NUE,"But in spite of the gains, the valuation picture looks compelling, with a PEG ratio (PE/Growth) of .39, well below the benchmark of 1 for value.
"
918,NUE,"12-Month Chart
"
919,NUE,"On the chart, NUE has been strong since gaining traction in early December, hitting a new 52-week high at $49.24 in mid February. Shares have pulled back a bit since then on general market volatility but increased steel demand and a solid valuation should support shares. Take a look below.
"
920,NUE,"Michael Vodicka is the Momentum Stock Strategist for Zacks.com. He is also the Editor in charge of the Zacks Momentum Trader Service. 
"
921,NUE,"The continued rise in bond yields yesterday was caused in part by concerns about the pace of inflation of China. Prices rose 3.4% last month, driven by an 8.3% increase in food prices. The cost of pork, a staple of Chinese diets, was a primary driver of the inflationary prices.  
"
922,NUE,"So what does the price of pork in China (sorry, I did not see any data on the price of tea) have to do with the Zacks Industry Rank? It reflects broader trends within the agricultural sector.
"
923,NUE,"Last week, pork, and beef, producer Smithfield Foods (SFD) topped lowered fiscal fourth-quarter profit expectations by two cents with earnings of 35 cents per share. Revenue and earnings growth were held back by hog production results. Although prices per hundredweight were 15% higher, circovirus and higher feed costs had an adverse affect. A shortage of pigs and higher feed costs were also the culprit behind the higher pork prices in China. SFD is a Zacks #3 Rank (hold) stock and is classified in Food-Meat Products.
"
924,NUE,"The higher feed prices are not only impacting pig farmers, however. The higher costs are also making it more expensive to operate dairy farms. Dean Foods (DF  -  Free Report) warned yesterday that raw milk prices will reach all-time highs by the third quarter. Making matters worse for the company, DF also is facing an oversupply of organic milk. As such, DF cut its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings to a range of $1.52 to $1.58 per share. The revised guidance comes about a month after CEO Gregg Engles predicted profits would be at the low end of the companys previous EPS guidance of $1.72 to $1.78 per share. Four brokerage analysts slashed their projections in response to the latest update, causing the full-year consensus estimate to drop 16 cents this week to $1.55 per share. DF is a Zacks #5 Rank (sell) stock and is classified in Food-Dairy Products.
"
925,NUE,"The upside of higher costs for livestock feed is that it helps to create more demand for fertilizer. During the past 30 days, three analysts have raised their forecasts on Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (POT). The current full-year profit projection of $2.95 per share is seven cents higher than the average forecast of a month ago and 22 cents above the consensus estimate of two months ago. One brokerage analyst did recently trim his forecast, but his revised prediction of $2.99 per share is still four cents above the consensus estimate. POT is a Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stock and is classified in Fertilizers.
"
926,NUE,"Investors should note that not all meat producers are succumbing to higher feedstock prices. Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) has been able to charge more for beef and both TSN and Sanderson Farms (SAFM  -  Free Report) have realized higher poultry prices. Therefore, the issue of higher feedstock costs is directly related to a companys ability to charge more for their products. Obviously, higher food costs result in inflationary pressures, as is occurring in China.
"
927,NUE,"On Monday, Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) warned that the second-quarter profits would be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15 per share; brokerage analysts had been forecasting earnings of $1.37 per share. NUE blamed hedge buying among customers during the first quarter, caused by volatile scrap metal prices, for causing weaker demand in the second quarter. The company also cited described as challenging sheet metal conditions this quarter. According to NUE, weaker demand in the automotive and residential construction markets as well as imports from China are adversely impacting prices. 
"
928,NUE,"Brokerage analysts have start to slash their forecasts for both second-quarter earnings (the consensus estimate now stands at $1.13 per share) and full-year profits. The consensus estimate calls for 2007 profits of $5.31 per share, 14 cents less than a week ago.
"
929,NUE,"Earnings estimates are not falling for several other steel stocks, however. Rather, analysts are largely sticking to the positive revisions they have made over the past 60 days for companies such as AK Steel (AKS  -  Free Report), Schnitzer Steel (SCHN  -  Free Report) and Olympic Steel . Even Quanex (NX  -  Free Report), which operates in similar markets as NUE, recently provided optimistic guidance. Steel-Producers contains a total of six Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stocks and four Zacks #2 Rank stocks.
"
930,NUE,"Given this backdrop, it appears that NUEs lowered guidance reflects company-specific issues. This said, steel inventories have been volatile. High stockpiles at steel service centers created downward pressure on estimates at the beginning of the year, but by the end of the first quarter, inventory levels were not the issue. Instead, earnings were generally bullish and brokerage analysts have been raising their forecasts. Therefore, while the outlook may be generally bullish, those investors who are risk-adverse should keep a close eye on the overall trend of forecasts for the group.
"
931,NUE,"The number of estimate revisions continues to drop for stocks within the Zacks Rank universe. Using a four-week rolling period, a total of 4,145 estimates were revised last week (2,109 positive revisions and 2,036 negative revisions). This compares to the peak of 13,077 estimate revisions during first-quarter earnings season. The good news is that the revisions ratio is slightly above one, meaning there are more positive revisions than negative revisions.
"
932,NUE,"I expect this trend of fewer estimate revisions to continue throughout June. Brokerage analysts have been less likely to adjust their forecasts between earnings seasons. This is a trend that has been amplified during the past two quarters and given the continuing uncertainty about the pace of economic growth, there is little reason not to expect this trend to continue.
"
933,NUE,"What does this mean for the markets? Simply, the lack of positive estimate revisions is one less catalyst to move stocks higher. This is part of the reason the equity markets have been reacting to the sharp rise in treasury bond yields.

937,NUE,"Last week, I talked about the opportunities and challenges facing steel producers. You can get the story here: U.S. Steel Producers On A Roll As May 1 Deadline ApproachesThis week, let’s see if the valuation warrants investment or if the good news is already priced in.First off, it’s worth noting that the industry is in the top 6% of Zacks classified industries, usually indicating the existence of some positive drivers. The following price chart also therefore shows an attractive trend with respect to the S&P 500. As far as individual stocks are concerned, let’s take Steel Dynamics (STLD  -  Free Report) first, which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), a VGM (value-growth-momentum) score of B meaning it is suitable for all kinds of investors and earnings surprise of 5.5% in the March quarter and positive estimate revision trend (2018 earnings estimate up 8.4% and 2019 estimate up 0.4% in the last 7 days)In the last quarter, revenue grew 10.0% year on year, earnings grew 17.1%, ASP grew 11% and utilization was 94%. This demonstrates the thesis that both demand and prices are up following the tariff on imports.Now for the valuation:The company’s price to sales is 1.13x compared to 3.28x for the S&P 500. Its price by earnings growth is 0.85x compared to the S&P 500’s 1.71x. The price to book value is 3.31x compared to 3.71x for the S&P 500. The price to free cash flow basis also shows that the company is undervalued with respect to the S&P 500. Second is Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report), which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), a VGM score of B, earnings surprise of 6.4% in the March quarter and positive estimate revision trend (2018 earnings estimate up 2.8% and 2019 estimate up 0.2% in the last 7 days).In the last quarter, revenue grew 15.6% year on year, earnings grew 5.4%, ASP grew 9% and utilization increased a few points. So here too, both demand and prices appear to be benefiting from the tariff on imports.Turning to the valuation:The company’s price to sales is 0.96x compared to 3.28x for the S&P 500. The price by earnings growth of 0.92 also compares favorably with the S&P 500’s 1.71x. It’s price to book value is 2.16x compared to 3.71x for the S&P 500.  Next up is United States Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report), which has a Zacks Rank #1, a VGM score of A, earnings surprise of 11.8% in the December quarter (next earnings report on April 30) and positive estimate revision trend (2018 earnings estimate up 32.9% and 2019 estimate up 30.9% in the last 60 days).  As for valuation, the company’s price to sales is 0.54x compared to 3.28x for the S&P 500. The price by earnings growth is 0.86x compared to the S&P 500’s 1.71x. Its price to book value is 1.96x compared to 3.71 for the S&P 500. The price to free cash flow basis also shows that the company is undervalued with respect to the S&P 500. Arcelor Mittal (MT  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #1, a VGM score of A, earnings surprise of 12.5% in the December quarter (next earnings report on May 11), positive estimate revision trend (2018 earnings estimate up 4.6% and 2019 estimate up 9.1% in the last 60 days).  The company’s price to sales is 0.5x compared to 3.28x for the S&P 500. The company’s price by earnings growth is 0.64x compared to the S&P 500’s 1.71x. It’s price to book value is 0.84x compared to 3.71 for the S&P 500. The price to free cash flow basis also shows that the company is undervalued with respect to the S&P 500. Last WordNot all stocks stand to gain from recent developments and even for those that do, it’s a good idea to take a look at the valuation metrics to see if more upside is indicated. Also, a buy rank is for the short term, so investors stocking up for the long haul should also consider fundamentals before jumping in.Here is the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks . More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

938,NUE,"POSCO  reported impressive results for the first quarter of 2018. The American Depository Receipt of this Korean steel producer gained 3% yesterday, ending the trading session at $83.05.Net income in the quarter was KRW 1,084 billion ($1 billion), reflecting growth of 11% over the year-ago tally and 93.6% over the previous quarter. The sequential increase was driven by rise in operating profit and fall in impairment loss of assets, partially offset by adverse corporate tax impact.Net earnings were KRW 3,106 per share or approximately $2.90 per ADR. This compares favorably with KRW 2,799.4 per share or $2.43 per ADR recorded in the year-ago tally and KRW 1,604.6 per share or $1.45 per ADR recorded in the previous quarter. Revenues Grow Y/Y, Steel Production AdvancesIn the quarter, POSCO’s revenues totaled KRW 15,862 billion ($14.8 billion), increasing 5.2% year over year and 1.7% sequentially.Crude steel production grew 2.3% year over year to approximately 9.3 million tons. Sequentially steel production fell 2.9% due to the lower number of calendar days in the quarter.Product manufacturing in the quarter was up 4.2% year over year to 9.1 million tons while advanced 1.3% sequentially on the back of the completion of rationalization at the Gwangyang Works facilities.Product sales increased 6.6% year over year and 8.5% sequentially to roughly 9.3 million tons. As noted, POSCO’s domestic sales ratio grew 440 basis points (bps) year over year to 56.9%. Operating Margin Improves Y/YPOSCO’s cost of sales was at 85% of the quarter’s revenues, flat compared with the year-ago quarter. Gross profit margin was maintained at 15%. Selling and administrative expenses inched up 0.6% year over year to KRW 898 billion ($0.8 billion).Operating profit increased 9% year over year and 29.2% sequentially. The quarter-over-quarter improvement came on the back of higher contributions from steel (including POSCO and overseas steel) and non-steel (including POSCO Energy and POSCO Daewoo) businesses. Operating margin was 9.4%, up 30 bps year over year and 200 bps sequentially. Balance SheetExiting the first quarter of 2018, POSCO had a cash balance of KRW 10,676 billion ($10.1 billion), up from KRW 9,595 billion ($8.5 billion) recorded in the previous quarter. Its non-current liabilities increased 2.6% sequentially to KRW 12,944 billion ($12.2 billion).The company’s current ratio in the quarter improved 3.2 percentage points sequentially to 167.5% while liabilities ratio grew 1.6 percentage points to 68.1%. OutlookFor 2018, POSCO anticipates consolidated revenues to be approximately KRW 63 trillion, up from KRW 61.9 trillion predicted earlier. Finished product sales are estimated to be roughly 35.9 million tons versus the earlier forecast of 35.3 million tons. Crude steel production is projected to be nearly 37.6 million tons, slightly above 37.4 million tons anticipated earlier. The company targets at achieving domestic sales ratio of 60% in 2018.Consolidated capital spending is likely to be KRW 4.2 trillion.Global steel demand worldwide is anticipated to grow 1.8% year over year in 2018 on the back of demand expansion in India, the United States and European Nations as well as from Southeast Asian nations, the Middle East and North Africa regions. Steel demand in China is projected to be flat year over year.Steel demand is predicted to be weak in 2018 compared with the previous year, evident from the predicted 1.6% fall in national consumption and 0.3% decline in export demand. Production in the automobile industry is expected to be weak in the second half of year while construction investments will also be poor due to weakness in investments for development of public infrastructure and housing markets. Shipbuilding industry will offer a relief as new orders are anticipated to grow.POSCO Price and Consensus  POSCO Price and Consensus | POSCO QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderPOSCO, with approximately $25.8 billion of market capitalization, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

939,NUE,"Steel-related industries have been a fixture on the Zacks Industry Rank list for a while. They are getting help both domestically and internationally, fueled by a solid manufacturing sector in the U.S. and strong consumption growth from emerging economies around the world. Despite ongoing challenges in the economy, especially high raw materials prices, three steel industries remain in the top 100.
"
940,NUE,"Steel-Specialty leads the pack with a Zacks Industry Rank of 2, which places it in a tie for the third spot. Out of five companies, there is one Zacks #1 Rank and one Zacks #2 Rank.  
"
941,NUE,"With a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.67, the Steel  Pipe & Tube is next and resides in a tie for 30th. There is one Zacks #1 Rank here out of six companies.  
"
942,NUE,"Close on its heels is Steel  Producers in a tie for 38th place with a Rank of 2.73. This is the largest of the three groups with 22 Ranked companies. The space contains one Zacks #1 Rank and five Zacks #2 Rank companies.   
"
943,NUE,"There are many concerns about how the cost of raw materials and a slower economy could impact the industry. Several analysts believe steel prices will move lower in 2007 compared to 2006. Therefore, it is important for investors to know which markets a particular company serves. For example, steel demand for aerospace and commercial construction is expected to remain high. Furthermore, oil & gas companies continue to boost spending in exploration and production, which means drilling equipment will remain necessary.

945,NUE,"Analysts like Nucors prospects for several reasons, including a potential pickup in demand for non-residential construction, its long-term fundamentals and acquisitions that are expected to raise production capacity. Earnings estimates for this year are up 59 cents, or approximately 12%, over the past three months. This includes a rise of nine cents, or about 1.7%, in the past 30 days. Nucor is a Zacks #2 (Buy) Rank company.  
"
946,NUE,"Earlier this month, Nucor announced that it expects third-quarter earnings per share between $1.50 and $1.60. Previously, the company expected that earnings would be equal to or better than the second quarters result of $1.45. In last years third quarter, earnings per share were 93 cents. The guidance was announced due to the continuation of strong business conditions. 
"
947,NUE,"In the second quarter, Nucors net earnings of $452.8 million, $1.45 per share, surged year over year by 40% from $322.7 million, or $1.01. That marked a positive surprise of approximately 8.2%. Sequentially, the result increased by nearly 20%. Net sales advanced 21% to $3.81 billion from $3.15 billion in the second quarter of 2005, and were up 7% from the first quarter of 2006.
"
948,NUE,"Other recent news of note includes Nucors announcement that it will purchase most of the assets of privately-held Verco Manufacturing Company for approximately $180 million. Verco produces steel floor and roof decking. The acquisition of Verco is an extremely attractive growth opportunity to enhance Nucor's market leadership position in steel deck and to expand our highly profitable vertical integration business model, said Daniel R. DiMicco, Nucor's Chairman, President and CEO. Nucor's downstream value-added businesses have consistently generated very attractive returns on assets through the economic cycle.""

The company operates in three business segments: flat-rolled products, high-performance metals and industrial products. 
"
949,NUE,"Allegheny is a Zacks #2 (Buy) Rank company due to rising earnings estimates. Over the past two months, expectations for this year are up 21 cents, or about 4.4%. Likewise, expectations for next year improved 18 cents, or approximately 3.1%, in that time. Analysts point to managements expectation that its cost reduction programs will help the company save $100 million in 2006. They also believe that strength in commercial aerospace have favorable implications for the high-performance metals business, especially as the content of high-performance metal increases on new aircraft. 
"
950,NUE,"For its second quarter, Allegheny Technologies reported earnings per share of $1.37 on sales of $1.21 billion. Earnings advanced from 91 cents in the year-earlier period and topped the consensus by more than 22%. Sales advanced 34% from $904.2 million, including 49% growth in the High Performance Metals segment; 30% in the Flat-Rolled Products segment; and 9% in the Engineered Products segment. 
"
951,NUE,"""Each of our business units is hitting on all cylinders and each unit is implementing aggressive growth initiatives, said L. Patrick Hassey, Chairman, President and CEO. Our key growth markets, namely aerospace and defense, chemical process industry, oil and gas, electrical energy, and medical, remain strong, representing just over 63% of ATI's year-to-date 2006 sales. Aerospace and defense was the largest of our markets at 31% of year-to-date 2006 sales. 
"
952,NUE,"Allegheny sees no seasonal slowing in the third quarter, as demand for such key markets as high performance metals and flat-rolled products remains very strong. The company also said that recent price increases for its flat-rolled stainless products are further evidence of the continued strength in the markets for these products.

"
953,NUE,"Earnings estimates for the year ending December 2006 improved 22 cents, or approximately 7.6%, over the past three months. Due to this upward momentum from analysts, Tenaris is a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stock. 
"
954,NUE,"The company is scheduled to report its third quarter results early next month. In early August, Tenaris announced solid second-quarter numbers as it continues to benefit from strong global demand from the energy industry for its OCTG and other seamless pipe products. Earnings per ADS reached 80 cents, beating the consensus by about 2.6%. The result also soared by 51% from the year-earlier result of 53 cents. Net sales advanced by 12% to $1.96 billion, versus $1.74 billion in the second quarter of 2005. Both earnings and net sales improved sequentially as well. 
"
955,NUE,"Seamless pipe shipments and production were at record highs and reflected incremental improvements in our industrial and supply chain management performance, according to Tenaris press release. Higher sales to the Middle East and Africa, which represented 27% of our total seamless pipe sales by volume during the quarter, compensated for lower sales in North America and reflected our strong global positioning as well as the strength of oil and gas investment activity in the region.
"
956,NUE,"In June, Tenaris announced a plan to acquire Maverick Tube Corporation in a deal valued at $3.19 billion. Maverick is a North American producer of welded OCTG, line pipe and coiled tubing for use in oil and natural gas wells. The deal is expected to close at the beginning of the fourth quarter, subject to certain regulatory approvals, majority approval of Maverick's shareholders and other customary conditions.

"
960,NUE,"Last month, IPSCO announced that it will acquire NS Group for $66 per share in cash in a move to strengthen its position as a leading North American producer of tubular products for the energy sector. Meanwhile, the move will also help to maintain its position as the leading North American supplier of steel plate products. The aggregate price of the deal is approximately $1.46 billion, and the combined company is expected to have annual revenues of more than $4 billion. 
"
961,NUE,"NS Group is a leading manufacturer of seamless and welded oilfield tubular goods with sales of $677 million for the 12 months ended Jun 30, 2006. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year.

"
963,NUE,"With almost 94% of S&P 500 companies reported, the summer earnings season is all but complete and the results have been surprisingly positive.  The median second quarter reported growth rate is an impressive 13.2% and positive surprises have outnumbered disappointments by almost 4:1.  
"
964,NUE,"The top-performing sector for the second quarter was Energy, with a median year-over-year EPS gain of over 65%.  From here however, growth in the sector is expected to slow, with analysts expecting median earnings growth for all of 2006 to be just over 30%.  Much tougher comparisons due to the anniversary of last years storms are the cause of the growth slowdown.  Looking into 2007, analysts are expecting median growth for the sectors companies of 16.2%.  No tree grows to the sky, but this is still very impressive given the gains of the last few years in the sector.  This would push Energy just under the Tech sector, where analysts are expecting an ambitious 18% median growth rate for 2007. 
"
965,NUE,"The Industrials, Telecom and Materials sectors also performed well in the quarter, with 19%, 17%, and 15% median earnings growth, respectively.  For the Material, metals producers like Alcoa (AA) and Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) lead the charge, with EPS growth rates of 87% and 43% respectively.  Growth in this sector, unlike in Energy, is expected to hold strong for the remainder of the year.  For 2007 however, analysts are expecting a slight cool down, with median EPS growth for the sectors companies expected to be just under 13%.
"
966,NUE,"In terms of the positive-to-negative surprise ratio, Telecom was the sector that fared best.  Out of the nine companies that report in this tiny sector, only one company, Sprint, disappointed.  The Consumer Discretionary and Industrials sectors also impressed, both with ratios of over 5:1.  Companies in the Consumer Staples sector also had favorable earnings surprise results, though median Q-over-Q growth was a paltry 5%.  As we move into the second half of the year, continued upside surprises by the likes of Conagra (CAG  -  Free Report), McCormick (MKC  -  Free Report), and Coors (SYY  -  Free Report) could spark higher comps to boost this sectors lagging growth outlook. 
"
967,NUE,"Overall, third-quarter comparable growth rates are expected to be less than those posted in the second quarter.  Median earnings growth is expected to come in at 9.28%, which would be a drop-off of over 390 basis points sequentially.  In eight of the 10 S&P sectors, growth is expected to slow.  However, we have seen this before, in both of the first two quarters, growth was origionally expected to slow to single digits, only to see the combination of estimate increases and positive surprises push the actual growth well into the teens.  With a year-to-date gain of only 2.1%, and a 2006 P/E of less than 15, the S&P 500 isnt exactly priced for perfection.  The earnings yield on the S&P 500 of 6.67% looks very favorable relative to the 10-year T-note yield of 4.78%.  The underlying companies need only report modest results going forward for the index to continue building up fundamental investment value.

969,NUE,"The total number of 2006 earnings revisions over the past month stands at 2,702, which is markedly down from the 3,721 reported at this time last week. This is a normal seasonal slowdown as earnings season winds down.  For 2006, positive estimate revisions have outnumbered negatives, with 1550 up and 1152 down, a ratio of 1.35:1, or about four estimates raised for every three cut.  This is a significant slowdown from last weeks 1.57, but is still a very healthy number. The upward movement of estimates was widespread, with all but two sectors having more upward than downward revisions.  Three sectors however, Consumer Staples, Tech and Utilities, had more firms with estimate downgrades than upgrades.  At press time last week, only the Utilities sector was listed in this unfavorable category.  Regarding the total upward to downward revisions ratio, Telecom lead the pack with a healthy 2.36:1, while the Tech and Utilities sectors were at the opposite end of the spectrum, with ratios of 0.85 and 0.63 respectively. 
"
970,NUE,"Energy, began showing more negative revisions as earnings season unfolded, but its ratio remains healthy at 1.35:1, inline with the rest of the index.  The Consumer Staples sector, despite showing previous signs of upward-revision strength, now shows a revisions ratio of just 1.05:1.
"
971,NUE,"Note below that the outlier for the Average 4wk. 2006 estimate change was Tech.  The 9.73% estimate boost posted was due completely to upward revisions related to Electronic Arts (ERTS).  Four revisions for the company averaged 738% higher than they were previously.  Remove this company and the four-week revision change for Tech drops to a minuscule 0.15%.  This illustrates the danger of placing too much emphasis on the change in the average estimate and why we tend to focus on the revisions index and the ratio of firms with rising to falling estimates.

"
973,NUE,"Looking ahead to next year the story is much the same, although the ratio is 1.26, which while comfortably above one, is moderately below the ratio for the current year.  As well, the ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is lower for 2007 than it is for 2006.   Technology and Utilities are the revision ratio laggards regarding next years estimates, despite the fact that Tech is expected to be the overall growth leader in 2007.  Of course if these revisions trends persist, Techs standing as the expected growth leader is unlikely to be maintained.  At the end of 2005, Tech was expected to trail only Consumer Discretionary in total net income growth for 2006, it now languishes in 7th place among the 10 sectors (Consumer Discretionary has fallen to sixth place by the way).

"
975,NUE,"Earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain solid for both this year and next, on both a median firm basis and on a total net income basis.  On a median basis, growth for both the current year and for 2007 is expected at 12.80%.  On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are more skewed towards this year, at 15.2% versus 10.5% next year.  While the total growth rate is certainly predicted to slow, by no means is declaring a 10.5% year-over-year growth rate tantamount to predicting a near-term recession.  
"
976,NUE,"Note that unlike the growth rates in the Earnings Scorecard above, the numbers below represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms, not just those which have already reported.   Energy is expected to post rock-solid growth for both years on a median basis, with earnings climbing almost 34% this year and over 16% next year.  However, there is a real disparity for 2007 in the Energy sector, where it is near the front of the pack on a median firm basis but near the back on a total earnings basis.  The key to that difference is that a handful of giant super majors  Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhilips (COP)  account for over half of the sectors total expected earnings.  Their earnings are currently expected to be flat to slightly down in 2007 relative to 2006, while the oil service and many of the E&P firms are expected to continue growing at a rapid clip.    However, its a bit of a moving target for the super majors, as estimates for both years are being revised upward.  The Materials sector shows a similar disparity for 2007.

"
978,NUE,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization.  This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
979,NUE,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2005, 2006 and 2007, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
980,NUE,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.6%, it has more influence than the Consumer Staples, Utilities, Materials and Telecom sectors combined. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.3% of the total expected earnings for 2006, or more than the total earnings of the Tech, Industrial and Utility sectors combined.
"
981,NUE,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.7% of total earnings for 2006, but represents only 10% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 14.1% in 2007, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Clearly at 10%, Energy is far from being in a bubble phase.  Frankly, I find the notion of an Energy stock bubble to be absurd.  Even though the NASDAQ is at only 40% of its early 2000 peak, a much stronger case could be made for Tech being bubbly than for Energy.
"
982,NUE,"Looked at another way, Energy will provide 21.9% of the total incremental earnings in the S&P 500 this year, while that is down from the 43.3% of the total it provided last year, it is still far above its weight in the index.  In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 10.2x 2006, and 9.7x 2007 earnings.  Tech on the other hand is trading for 20.7x 2006 and 17.6x 2007 earnings.  The S&P is trading for 15.0x and 13.6x, respectively.

986,NUE,"This weeks screen has something for both Growth Investors and Value Investors. 
"
987,NUE,"Growth Investors focus on companies with great earnings growth, but that alone isnt good enough for many stock pickers any more. They want good growth at reasonable prices (low P/Es). 
"
988,NUE,"And while Value Investors focus on low P/E stocks, too many are low because they lack earnings power. 
"
989,NUE,"So instead, try combining the best of both worlds and focus on the companies with the highest growth rates and the lowest P/E ratios.
"
990,NUE,"The screen Im running this week is as follows:  Companies with 5-Year Historical Growth Rates in the top 20 percentile of all companies. 
"
991,NUE,"(Using a Uniform Rank of 1-99 (99 being the best growth rates), I screened for stocks ranked 80 or better.)  Companies that also happened to have the lowest P/Es  lower than 80% of all other companies. 
"
992,NUE,"(Using a Uniform Rank of 1-99 again (this time 99 having the lowest P/Es), I screened for stocks ranked 80 or better.)  I then required those stocks to be trading at or above $5, ... with average daily trading volumes of 100,000 shares or more.  And a Zacks Rank of #2 or better.

995,NUE,"Incidentally, this screen backtested very well. And while it wasnt designed to be a trading strategy per se (15-20 stocks is a lot of stocks to trade every month), this screening strategy beat the market every year for the last five years (2001 thru 2005). (I ran a series of tests over the last five-year time span, using a four-week rebalancing period. Each run was rebalanced over a different set of four-week periods to eliminate coincidence and verify robustness.)

1000,NUE,"Alan Greenspan surprised the bond market last week when he commented that should Federal Reserve inflation expectations prove conservative, the Fed would increase interest rates as quickly as needed. The comments were delivered via satellite to a conference in London, but the message was heard around the world. This new message replaced the rhetoric that the interest rate increase cycle was likely to be at a measured pace. While the entire investment community expects the Fed to increase interest rates by at least 25 basis points when it meets at the end of the month, two Experts are looking at how to deal with the clear shift in the direction of interest rates and the series of rate increases that are likely to follow. Discover the strategies and sectors that offer the best return potential to your portfolio in the months to come. Futures Hold the Future 
"
1001,NUE,"Paul Tracy, editor of the StreetAuthority Market Adviser, looks to the Fed Funds Futures market to discern what the bond market expects the Fed to do. According to the December futures contract, the bond market expects the Fed to increase interest rates to 2.125%, which would be a 1.125% increase over the next six months. The Fed Funds rate is the interest rate the Federal Open Market Committee votes on at each one of its meetings. It currently sits at lows not seen since the Eisenhower Administration, and with the economy heating up; the Fed will begin moving the benchmark higher.  
"
1002,NUE,"The addition of nearly 1 million jobs over the last three months, including 248,000 in May and upward revisions for the previous two months, is the central catalyst for rising interest rates. Tracy draws a comparison to the rate-raising cycle coming out of the 1990-1991 recession, which occurred in 1994. Job recovery lagged after that recession as well, and its return is once again compels the Fed to act. 
"
1003,NUE,"However, Greenspans comment proves the Fed is looking to more than just economic growth. Inflation and pricing pressures are on the forefront of the Feds mind, emphasized by Greenspans invocation of the Feds mandate for price stability. Ben Zacks, editor of the Zacks Advisor has written of what one Chicago trader called the IOU Market. Interest rates/Inflation, Oil prices and Uncertainties are the markets prime concerns right now. 
"
1004,NUE,"Oil prices are on the rise, which necessarily increases the costs for virtually all goods in manufacturing and transportation processes. The additions to payrolls and eventual tightening of the job market are likely to increase wage pressures and benefits for companies that have to pay for new hires. Also, commodity prices are rising globally due to industrial revolutions in India and China. Food prices are also on the rise, and believe me, Chicago soybean traders are pleased. Anecdotally, Zacks thinks that inflation is rising more quickly than the numbers indicate. Unfortunately, though, the Bureau of Labor Statistics postponed the release of the Producers Price Index numbers for the third time this year due to computer problems with the new methodology. 
"
1005,NUE," Interest rate increases and inflation are not inherently damaging to business, with the exception of consumer financial and other interest sensitive stocks. The problem, though, is that rising interest rates will strengthen the dollar and reverse the currency benefits that many companies received. The combination of rising costs in the form of inflation and rising interest rates could result in an environment of solid economic growth and meager earnings growth. 
"
1006,NUE,"As such, both Zacks and Tracy continue theirDefensive Investment Posture
"
1007,NUE,"Both Tracy and Zacks agree that stocks remain the best return opportunities vs. all others right now. Bonds do not do well in a rising rate environment and cash offers paltry yields.  The search for the best investments leads both Experts to pharmaceuticals and consumer staples. Staples are preferable over Consumer Discretionary stocks as rising interest rates are expected to increase the debt burdens of consumers. Further, where retail lacks pricing power, many commodity driven consumer staples stocks are in the midst of an upswing. 
"
1008,NUE,"Kellogg's (NYSE: (K  -  Free Report) ) products have been staples at breakfast tables worldwide since the company was founded over 80 years ago. The company's lineup of brands needs no introduction. Earnings growth for Kellogg has been remarkably stable over the years at nearly +10% annually. Revenue growth has held around +6%, with the rest coming from cost-cutting efforts. The company's extreme earnings stability, 62% return on equity and stable cash flows allow Tracy to overlook its relatively high debt burden. Also, most of that debt was financed at low rates and won't need to be rolled over until after 2010.
"
1009,NUE,"GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: (GSK  -  Free Report) ) is the cheapest of the big pharmaceuticals. The problem for the stock isn't a lack of new drug candidates. Instead, it relates to their stage of development. Although the company sports some promising new compounds, they won't be ready for sale for at least a few more years. On the positive side of things, however, the news flow surrounding the company is likely to improve in coming quarters. Clinical trials are now in progress for many of the company's new drugs, and key results are due out this year and next. As these results are released, investors should regain confidence in Glaxo's pipeline. Even without any good news on the pipeline front, Tracy thinks Glaxo still looks like a smart, low-risk play. The company's blockbuster drugs, such as Paxil for depression/anxiety and Imitrex for migraines, generate enormous amounts of cash each year. In addition, the company's +3.4% dividend yield is among the highest in the business.
"
1010,NUE,"Both Zacks and Tracy also find oil companies compelling given the stubborn floor below the price of oil over the past year. He recently added Murphy Oil and Gas (NYSE: (MUR  -  Free Report) ) to the Focus List in place of another. Murphy Oil has pipelines in the US and owns two US refineries and a 30% interest in a UK refinery. The company sells refined products in the US through a network of wholesale and retail gas stations and through more than 380 UK stations as MURCO and EP. Most of its US retail stations are located in the parking lots of Wal-Mart stores. The company has had significant recent discovery success. Murphy Oil is expanding its retail network to Wal-Mart stores in Canada. Following several successful appraisal wells in the companys first and largest deepwater discovery in Malaysia, management continues to expect reserves to come in within its previous estimates of 400-700 million barrels. Production from the Medusa field is likely to increase two-fold and full-year 2004 domestic volumes are expected to average about 41,000 barrels per day, compared to 2003 levels of about 18,000. Zacks added Murphy Oil to the Focus List as the company reported its fifth major oil discovery in Malaysia. Estimates have been revised upwards, and would get additional boost from the latest announcement. The Kakap field holds up to 300 million barrels of recoverable reserves. MUR has 80% stake in the field. Recent success bodes well for further discoveries around waters of Malaysia. 
"
1011,NUE,"Steel-producer Nucor (NYSE: (NUE  -  Free Report) ), which is receiving significant upward earnings revisions. The steel industry continues to consolidate, and Nucor has played a part in this process over the last couple years. Nucor has used an acquisition strategy to strengthen its position as one of the leading global steel producers. The company purchased the assets of Trico Steel Company. That acquisition increased Nucor's capacity for sheet steel by 30% to 8,700,000 tons per year. The purchase of Birmingham Steel assets for approximately $615 million was the largest acquisition in its history. These mills boosted Nucor's 2003 shipment volume by approximately 2,400,000 tons.

1017,NUE,"The steel industry is gaining strength on the back of a cyclical upturn in steel demand and a resurgent global economy. Steel makers are also benefiting from a recovery in steel prices. In particular, steel prices are on an upswing in the United States on the back of the Trump administration’s trade actions to curb imports, reflected by the recent sharp rise in hot-rolled steel prices.President Donald Trump’s recent imposition of tariffs on steel imports is a welcome relief to U.S. steel players. The Trump administration, last month, slapped a 25% tariff on steel imports aimed at protecting the U.S. steel industry which had long struggled to cope with a tide of subsidized foreign imports.The President’s protectionist trade actions should provide further cushion to the American steel industry. The tariffs are expected to lead to lower imports into the United States, which would in turn boost demand for American steel and drive profitability of domestic steel makers.The hefty tariffs would lead to a spurt in steel prices and give American steel producers more pricing power. Notably, U.S. steel prices are on an uptrend following the trade tariff announcement. Higher steel prices should drive the performance of U.S. steel makers in the first quarter.The Zacks Steel Producers industry has outperformed the broader market (S&P 500) in a year’s time. The industry has gained around 31.2% in this period, topping the S&P 500’s corresponding return of around 14.8%.Per the Zacks Industry classification, the steel industry is grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector. The Basic Materials sector is among the Zacks sectors that are expected to rack up the strongest gains in the first quarter. Earnings for the sector are projected to surge 41% in the first quarter while revenues are expected to go up 20.3%, per our latest Earnings Preview.In this write up, we run a comparative analysis on two major U.S. steel stocks – United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) and Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report) – to figure out which of these stocks is better placed ahead of their first-quarter earnings report.Nucor is scheduled to report its first-quarter numbers on Apr 19, while U.S. Steel will post its results on Apr 26. While U.S. Steel sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Nucor is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Other steel stocks reporting earnings this week and the next include Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report), Universal Stainless & Alloy Products, Inc. (USAP  -  Free Report) and Ternium S.A. (TX  -  Free Report).Let's take a closer look at how U.S. Steel and Nucor are stacked up against each other in terms of certain key metrics.ESP and Earnings HistoryEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Nucor is likely to beat earnings in the quarter to be reported. This is because the stock has an Earnings ESP of +0.61% and a Zacks Rank #2. However, the picture is different for U.S. Steel with an Earnings ESP of -4.04% and a Zacks Rank #1, a combination which makes surprise prediction difficult.With respect to surprise, U.S. Steel beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters while missed once. In this timeframe, it came up with an average negative surprise of 40%. On the other hand, Nucor has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 2.7%.Growth ExpectationsIn terms of earnings growth expectations, U.S. Steel scores way above Nucor. The expected earnings per share growth rate for U.S. Steel for the first quarter currently stands at 134.9% compared with an expected decline of 0.9% for Nucor.Price PerformanceU.S. Steel’s shares have rallied 27.9% over the past year while Nucor’s shares have gained 11.3%. While both stocks have underperformed the industry over the same period, U.S. Steel clearly scores above Nucor. Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. U.S. Steel has a debt-to-equity ratio of 81.3, while the industry has debt-to-equity ratio of 55. In contrast, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 41.8 Nucor wins this round. Current RatioThis metric measures the ability of a company to meet its short-term debt obligations efficiently. In other words, it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and versus the current level of liabilities. Here, Nucor is a clear winner with a current ratio of 2.42, which is superior to U.S. Steel’s reading of 1.75. ValuationGoing by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, which is often used to value steel stocks, U.S. Steel looks cheaper compared with Nucor.In case of Nucor, the trailing 12-months EV/EBITDA ratio is 9.4, which is above its own average of 8.8 in the past one year. Moreover, it is overvalued than the industry that has a reading of 9. On the other hand, U.S. Steel is cheaper with a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.9. Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds. ROE for the trailing 12-months for Nucor and U.S. Steel is 13% and 12.6%, respectively. As such, Nucor holds an edge here. The VerdictNucor scores higher in terms of debt-to-equity ratio, ROE measures and current ratio. On top of that, the company has a better ESP reading vis-à-vis U.S. Steel.However, U.S. Steel holds an advantage when it comes to price performance, growth expectations and valuation. Overall, our comparative analysis shows that Nucor has an edge over U.S. Steel.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1018,NUE,"Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 19.Last quarter, the steel giant delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.2% by posting adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents.Revenues increased roughly 28.7% year over year to $5,092.3 million in the fourth quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,960.2 million.Nucor beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing in one, delivering an average positive surprise of 2.7%.Can the company surprise investors again or is it heading for a possible pullback? Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Nucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Nucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Nucor Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Nucor is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Nucor for the first quarter is +0.61%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at $1.11 and $1.10, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Nucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderLast month, Nucor provided guidance for first-quarter 2018. The company expects earnings in the band of $1.00-$1.05 per share. This reflects a decrease from $1.20 recorded in the previous quarter and $1.11 earned a year ago.  Nucor noted that first-quarter projected figures include an expense of 7 cents per share related to a deferred tax assets write off as a result of changes in the tax status of a subsidiary. Barring non-operating items, the company expects first-quarter performance to be better than the previous quarter but flat year over year.Nucor’s total sales for the first quarter are projected to sequentially increase by roughly 9% from the fourth quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is currently pegged at $5,550 million.Earnings for Nucor’s steel mills unit are expected to improve sequentially in the first quarter as the company noted that average selling prices for steel mill product groups have witnessed an increase since the start of this year. The company expects this positive pricing momentum to continue in the second quarter.Moreover, there is considerable optimism in steel end-use markets and the company is also encouraged by recent actions taken by the Trump administration to address the issue of illegally subsidized imports into the United States.Nucor expects earnings in the steel products unit to sequentially decline in the first quarter due to seasonality while earnings in its raw materials unit are expected to improve.Shares of Nucor have moved up 9.4% in the last six months, slightly underperforming the industry’s 10.6% growth. Other Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +9.38% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

1019,NUE,"Global crude steel production expanded in February on the back of a surge in output in China, the world's biggest steel maker, despite Beijing’s efforts to curb output during winter months to streamline its burgeoning steel sector and mounting trade tensions with the United States. Higher output from India, which pipped Japan as the second-largest steel producer, also supported the production growth.According to the latest report from the World Steel Association (""WSA"") – the international trade body for the iron and steel industry – crude steel production for 64 reporting nations went up 3.5% year over year for the reported month to 131.8 million tons (Mt). This follows a paltry 0.8% increase in January.Chinese Steel Mills Ramp Up OutputProduction from China, which accounts for around half of the global steel output, spiked 5.9% year over year to 64.9 Mt in February as steel mills in the country took advantage of higher domestic steel prices that translates to higher profits for the Chinese steel industry.Chinese steel output was expected to decline during winter months as Beijing had implemented a four-month reduction in production to reduce the country’s excess steel supply and clean up the environment. Production is expected to rise further moving ahead as those winter restrictions ended earlier this month.The rise in production in February also came amid escalating trade tensions between the United States and China. The Trump administration has slapped a 25% tariff on steel imports with China being one of the main targets of the punitive trade action.  While China only accounts for 2% of U.S. steel imports, it has been repeatedly accused of dumping its excess steel capacity. Notably, President Trump has a record of attacking China for unfair trade practices. This is well reflected in his plans to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from China worth as much as $60 billion, announced last week.    Beijing has also responded with plans to levy tariffs on a range of American products with U.S. export value of $3 billion in 2017, including a 15% tariff on steel pipes. Nevertheless, the world’s two largest economies are reportedly in talks to avert a full-blown trade war.How Other Major Producers Fared in February?Among other major Asian producers, India saw a 3.4% rise in production to 8.4 Mt in February. Indian steel mills have been benefiting from higher domestic steel prices and increasing local demand.Production in Japan slipped 0.5% to 8.3 Mt in February following a 0.3% rise a month ago. South Korea also witnessed a 2.1% decline to 5.4 Mt. Consolidated output were up 4.3% to 90.5 Mt in Asia.In North America, crude steel production rose 0.4% to 6.4 Mt in the United States. This follows a 2.2% decrease in production in January. The rebound came as American steel mills benefited from higher domestic steel prices.Moving ahead, the trade tariffs are expected to boost production capacity of U.S. steel makers amid lower imports. The U.S. Department of Commerce had said that the trade actions are aimed at increasing domestic steel production to roughly 80% operating rate from its present 73% capacity.On prospects of higher steel demand as a result of the U.S. trade measures, U.S. Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) said recently that it will restart one of its Granite City Works blast furnaces and steelmaking facilities. Another U.S. steel major, Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report) also recently said that it will build a rebar micro mill in Florida. This $240-million investment will be Nucor’s second rebar micro mill.Meanwhile, output in Canada skid 10.4% to around 1 Mt in February. Overall production for the region was down 2.3% to roughly 9.1 Mt.  In the Europe Union, production from Germany – the biggest producer in the region – fell 3.2% to 3.3 Mt. Output went up 4.5% in Italy to 2.1 Mt while rising 1% to 1.3 Mt in France. Spain saw a 0.4% increase to 1.1 Mt. Total output fell 0.8% in the European Union to 13.4 Mt.Output in the Middle East climbed 19% to 2.9 Mt with Iran, the top producer in the region, seeing a 48.6% surge to 2.1 Mt. Africa logged a 4% gain to 1.1 Mt in the reported month.Among other notable producers, production from Turkey was up 8.7% to 3 Mt. Output from Brazil, the largest producer in South America, rose 5.5% to 2.7 Mt.Crude steel capacity utilization ratio for the reporting countries was 73.3% in February, up from 71.5% a year ago and 72.8% in the previous month.Steel Sector on the MendThe steel industry has staged a recovery after being out of favor for long. The industry enjoyed a good run in 2017 notwithstanding a few lingering challenges. Continued momentum in the automotive space and a recovery across housing and commercial construction markets have been key tailwinds for the steel industry. The automotive and construction industries will continue to provide the backbone to the industry.The Zacks Steel Producers industry has outperformed the broader market in a year’s time. The industry has gained around 13.2% in this period, higher than the S&P 500’s corresponding return of around 10.8%.While the overall demand fundamentals for steel is improving, the industry is still challenged by sustained overcapacity. The global steel industry continues to reel under the effects of excess capacity -- the biggest obstacle to persistent growth and profitability.Steel Stocks to Watch ForA few stocks worth considering in the steel space are Tenaris S.A. (TS  -  Free Report), Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI  -  Free Report) and Salzgitter Aktiengesellschaft (SZGPY  -  Free Report).

1020,NUE,"Much to the respite of American steel makers, U.S. steel imports have dropped roughly 5% year to date – according to the latest report from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), an association of North American steel makers.    Per AISI, based on preliminary U.S. Census Bureau data, total domestic steel imports went down 18% on a monthly comparison to roughly 2.36 million net tons in February. Finished steel imports for the same month also fell 17.6% from a month ago to around 1.92 million net tons. This follows a 17.3% and 23.8% increase in total and finished steel imports in January, respectively.Year to date (through first two months of 2018), total and finished steel imports are down 5.3% and 3.5% year over year, respectively. Finished steel import market share was estimated at 25% year to date.Major finished steel products that have showed a significant decrease in imports on a monthly comparison basis in February include reinforcing bars (down 58.8%), oil country goods (down 37.6%), standard pipe (down 28.5%), line pipe (down 27.4%), sheets & strip all other metallic coatings (down 25.9%) and hot rolled bars (down 22.9%).The biggest offshore suppliers for February were South Korea with 277,000 net tons (down 18% from January), Germany with 116,000 net tons (up 28%), Japan with 90,000 net tons (down 37%), Taiwan with 75,000 net tons (down 36%) and China with 60,000 net tons (down 16%).A Reprieve for U.S. Steel MillsU.S. steel producers have suffered heavily due to high levels of cheap steel imports, reflected by declined orders, idling of mills and layoffs across the nation. The continued surge of steel imports into the United States hollowed out much of the domestic steel industry last year.Imports of cheap steel continued to make inroads into the American market in 2017 despite a raft of stringent trade actions and threats of further future measures. Subsidized steel products are being illegally dumped by foreign steel producers in the American market at unfairly low prices that significantly undercut the prices of U.S. steelmakers.Although the U.S. Department of Commerce made several ruling imposing duties on additional steel products, imports refused to abate last year due to foreign producers’ overcapacity. Moreover, a delay in Section 232 investigation on steel imports by the U.S. Department of Commerce also triggered a spike in steel imports in 2017.Total steel imports shot up roughly 15% in 2017, according to the AISI. While the levy of heavy tariffs led to a decline in steel exports from China to the United States, imports from other countries kept flowing into the American markets. These cheap imports hurt the margins of American steel players last year. As such, a slowdown in imports (as reflected by the latest data) is a welcome relief for the crisis-hit U.S. steel makers. But Trump’s Softening Tariff Stance is a WorryU.S. steel makers have been pinning their hopes on President Donald Trump imposing broad-based tariffs on imported steel that would provide a boost to steel prices and give them more pricing power.Steel stocks got a shot in the arm on Mar 1 after President Trump said that the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminum imports in a big move to protect the domestic producers of these metals. Expectations of an across-the-board tariff on steel imports provided a thrust to shares of major American steel makers.However, the initial euphoria fizzled out after the President signed executive orders on Mar 8 imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports while excluding U.S. allies Canada and Mexico (together represent roughly a quarter of U.S. steel imports) from the tariff orders. Moreover, the orders included provisions for other countries to apply for exemptions provided their imports do not hurt the U.S. economy.The President noted that Canada and Mexico represent “a special case,” and will continue talks with them to address concerns. The exemptions are dependent on the outcome of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiation talks that are underway.Shares of major U.S. steel makers including U.S. Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS  -  Free Report), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and Commercial Metals Company (CMC  -  Free Report) tumbled after Trump signed the tariff orders. The selloff was triggered by the concessions made by the President in the tariff order by excluding two main sources of U.S. imports while leaving room for other nations to negotiate exclusions from the tariffs.Adding to the worries, the Trump administration on Mar 22 said that it would temporarily exempt more countries from steel and aluminum tariffs. The list includes the European Union (EU), Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, many of which have been in talks with the United States to win an exemption. The news sent U.S. steel stocks reeling with shares of U.S. Steel and Commercial Metals being hit the hardest.U.S. Steel, Nucor, Steel Dynamics, AK Steel and Commercial Metals each carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.President Trump’s move to exclude the EU – a major source of steel imports – from the tariff orders appears to avert a potentially fierce trade war with the 28-nation bloc. The EU had threatened to impose tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles and other iconic U.S. brands in retaliation to the U.S. tariff move. The bloc recently published a list of U.S. products worth around $3.4 billion on which it plans to impose trade penalties.The Trump administration’s gradually softening tariff stand is bad news for the domestic steel makers. More countries may seek exemptions for steel imports in the future that cannot be made in the United States. This may thwart the administration’s efforts to curb the influx of cheaper imports and eventually hurt steel prices. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1021,NUE,"As would be expected for earnings season, the number of earnings estimate revisions for stocks within the Zacks Rank universe1 is rising. Using a four-week rolling period for 2006 forecasts, there were 5,549 estimate revisions  nearly a 75% increase from a month ago. Growth expectations are basically unchanged with the average company projected to generate a 21.3% increase in full-year earnings1.
"
1022,NUE,"Speaking of revisions, it would not be surprising to see analysts adjust their forecasts for BlueCross BlueShield provider WellPoint (WLP) over the next few days given this mornings report. WLP, a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock, generated adjusted third-quarter profits of $1.24 per share, versus expectations for $1.22 per share. Enrollment was up by 5.2 million, to 34.2 million members, over year-ago levels, primarily because of an acquisition. Medicare Part D also played a role, adding 42,000 new members during the third quarter.  
"
1023,NUE,"Looking ahead, the company projected 2006 profits to total $4.78 per share on an adjusted basis versus the current consensus estimate of $4.75 per share. Per share guidance for 2007 was not provided, although WLP is projecting 15% growth in net income. This forecast appears to be above analysts current forecast of $5.41 per share.
"
1024,NUE,"WLP belongs to the Medical-HMO group. This group contains two Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks  Amerigroup (AGP) and Humana (HUM  -  Free Report)  and seven Zacks #2 Rank stocks.
"
1025,NUE,"Toymakers Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) and Mattel (MAT  -  Free Report) recently gave investors reason to smile with third-quarter earnings that were above expectations. HAS reported profits of 58 cents per share, seven above expectations. Revenues rose 5%. MAT said third-quarter results totaled 62 cents per share, a penny above expectations. Revenues rose 7% as several product lines showed good growth. 
"
1026,NUE,"Analysts reacted to the reports by raising 2006 and 2007 profit forecasts on both stocks. The full-year estimates for HAS, a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock, are $1.22 and $1.44 per share, respectively. (A month ago, the estimates stood at $1.16 and $1.41.)  Full-year estimates for MAT, a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock, are $1.28 and $1.40 per share, respectively. (A month ago, analysts were forecasting $1.24 and $1.31 per share.)
"
1027,NUE,"Both stocks belong to Toys/Game/Hobby group, which also contains Electronic Arts (ERTS), a Zacks #1 Rank stock.
"
1028,NUE,"Metals companies are going to face tough comps over the next several quarters because of the rally in commodity prices that started about year ago. Therefore, analysts are projecting profits to decline for some companies and growth to slow for others. Normally, such a backdrop would only appeal to stout contrarians, but there is actually positive news for steel companies  earnings estimates are being revised upwards.
"
1029,NUE,"Part of the reason for the relative bullishness is the sustained strength of the economy, both here and abroad. Another factor is that metal prices are still up from a year ago. Better-than-expected earnings dont hurt either, as was the case with Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report). 
"
1030,NUE,"Last week, NUE reported third-quarter profits of $1.68 per share, surpassing analysts forecasts by 14 cents per share.  Revenues rose 30%, reflecting increases in both average sales price per ton and total tons shipped.  Looking forward, NUE predicted that fourth-quarter earnings would be strong, despite seasonal weakness and efforts by service center customers to reduce inventory levels. Analysts responded by raising their full-year projections for both 2006 and 2007. The new consensus estimates call for profits of $5.77 per share for this year, versus last weeks forecast of $5.53, and $4. per share next year, versus last weeks estimate of $4.70.

1035,NUE,"President Donald Trump, on Mar 8, signed proclamations imposing steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in a major move to protect the domestic producers of these metals, rebuild the long-struggling U.S. steel and aluminum industries and safeguard American jobs. The highly controversial tariffs, which the President believes are necessary to protect national security, are set to go into effect today.The Trump administration has slapped a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports. The tariffs, which have drawn criticism from major U.S. trading partners and some members of the Republican Party, are the result of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s investigation that was carried out under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to determine whether the imports pose a threat to national security.The tariffs would also fulfil one of President Trump’s key election promises of bringing down America's massive trade deficit. The tariffs are, in particular, are targeted at countries with which the United States has significant trade deficits.Let’s take a quick look at the impacts of the highly criticized trade tariffs on the U.S. steel industry.What’s Good?The President’s move is aimed at protecting the domestic steel and aluminum industries which had long been reeling under the onslaught of cheap imports and has suffered significant reduction in production and employment.U.S. steel makers struggled to cope with the renewed tide of cheap steel imports last year. Imports of cheap steel continue to flood American shores despite a string of punitive trade actions and threats of further future measures. These imports have hurt the selling prices and margins of U.S. steel makers.According to the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), an association of North American steel makers, total steel imports shot up 15.4% to around 38.1 million net tons in 2017. While positive rulings in trade cases (resulting in levy of heavy tariffs) against China last year led to a decline in steel exports to the United States from that country, imports from other countries remain at above historical levels.As such, the trade tariffs would provide a much-needed reprieve to the U.S. steel makers. The tariffs would provide a boost to steel prices, give American steel makers more pricing power and help to level the playing field. U.S. steel prices are on an uptrend following the trade tariff announcement, reflected by a spike in hot-rolled steel prices. The tariffs are expected to lead to lower imports into the United States, which would in turn boost demand for American steel and drive profitability of U.S. steel makers. All these are likely to help in creating hundreds of new steel jobs in the country.On prospects of higher steel demand as a result of the latest U.S. trade measures, U.S. Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) said recently that it will restart one of its Granite City Works blast furnaces and steelmaking facilities. U.S. Steel expects to call back around 500 employees starting this month. Both the blast furnaces of Granite City Works and its steelmaking facilities were idled in December 2015 in response to challenging market conditions, including unfairly traded imports.Another U.S. steel major, Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report) also recently said that it will build a rebar micro mill in Florida. This $240-million investment will be Nucor’s second rebar micro mill.Moreover, the tariffs are expected to boost production capacity of domestic steel makers amid lower imports. The U.S. Department of Commerce earlier said that the trade actions are aimed at increasing domestic steel production to roughly 80% operating rate from its present 73% capacity.What’s Bad?Just after the tariff announcement, President Trump softened his stance by excluding Canada and Mexico — two major sources of steel imports to the United States — from the tariff orders. Moreover, the orders have provisions for other countries to apply for exemptions provided their imports do not hurt the U.S. economy, leaving some wiggle room for U.S. allies to seek concessions.The President noted that Canada and Mexico represent “a special case,” and will continue talks with them to address concerns. The exclusions of these countries are dependent on the outcome of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiation talks that are underway.  Canada is the largest steel exporter to the United States, accounting for roughly 16% of total U.S. steel imports in 2017, per the U.S. Census Bureau data. Mexico is the fourth-largest exporter of the metal with around 9% market share. They together represent roughly a quarter of U.S. steel imports.The exclusion of two main sources of U.S. imports, while leaving room for other nations to negotiate exclusions from the tariffs, marked a significant concession from the President’s initial plan of an across-the-board tariff on steel and aluminum. Shares of major U.S. steel makers including U.S. Steel, Nucor, AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS  -  Free Report), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and Commercial Metals Company (CMC  -  Free Report) tanked after Trump signed the tariff orders.To make the matter more complicated, the Trump administration said yesterday that it would temporarily exempt more countries from steel and aluminum tariffs, according to a proclamation released by the White House. The list includes the European Union, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, many of which have been in talks with the U.S. to win an exemption. However, the administration may impose import quotas on these countries to protect the domestic industries.The United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer yesterday said that ""The idea that the President has is that, based on a certain set of criteria that some countries should get out"". He added that ""There are countries with whom we're negotiating"" and there will be ""a pause in imposition of tariffs with respect to those countries"".The news sent stocks of American steel makers tumbling with shares of U.S. Steel, Commercial Metals, Nucor, AK Steel and Steel Dynamics crashing roughly 11%, 12.3%, 6.5%, 8.7% and 7.5%, respectively. The Trump administration’s gradually softening tariff stance is bad news for the domestic steel makers. More countries may seek exemptions for steel imports in the future that cannot be made in the United States. This may thwart the administration’s efforts to curb the influx of cheaper imports and eventually hurt steel prices.While Commercial Metals currently sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), U.S. Steel, Nucor, Steel Dynamics and AK Steel each have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.And Finally, The UglyConcerns over a full-blown international trade war gripped the markets since the declaration of the metal tariffs in early March. The U.S. trade actions are likely to trigger a potential backlash from the affected countries and major foreign trade partners. The tariffs risk tit-for-tat retaliation measures on American exports, hurting the U.S. economy.While no one wants to enrage the dragon, the first retaliation may come from China. Reportedly, China's commerce ministry is planning tariffs on a range of American products (with U.S. export value of $3 billion in 2017) that include a 15% tariff on steel pipes. China had earlier warned that it is ready to take an ""appropriate and necessary response"" in any trade war with the United States. While China only accounts for 2% of U.S. steel imports, it is the world’s biggest producer of steel accounting for around half of the global production.Beijing has been repeatedly accused of dumping excess steel capacity into global markets. Trump has a record of attacking China for unfair trade practices. This is well reflected in his recent plans to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from China worth as much as $60 billion.Japan, the six-largest exporter of steel to the United States, is also currently not on Trump’s temporary exemption list. Japan's Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, Hiroshige Seko earlier said that the United States’ move to levy trade tariffs is “extremely regrettable” and could significantly unsettle global trade.The EU had also threatened to impose tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles and other iconic U.S. brands in retaliation to the Trump administration’s tariff move. The 28-nation bloc recently published a list of U.S. products worth around $3.4 billion on which it plans to impose trade penalties. Brazil, which is the second-largest exporter of steel to the United States, with roughly 13% share of total imports last year, has also pledged to take “all necessary actions” to protect its interests.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1036,NUE,"Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) has provided guidance for first-quarter 2018. The steel giant expects earnings for the quarter in the band of $1.00-$1.05 per share. This reflects a decrease from $1.20 recorded in the previous quarter and $1.11 earned a year ago. Analysts polled by Zacks currently expect earnings of $1.07 per share for the first quarter.        Notably, first-quarter projected figures include an expense of 7 cents per share related to a deferred tax assets write off as a result of changes in the tax status of a subsidiary. Barring non-operating items, the company expects first-quarter performance to be better than the previous quarter but flat with first-quarter 2017.Nucor expects earnings in the steel mills unit to improve sequentially in the first quarter. Nucor noted that average selling prices for steel mill product groups have witnessed an increase since the start of this year and the company expects this positive pricing momentum to continue in the second quarter.There is considerable optimism in steel end use markets and Nucor is also encouraged by recent actions taken by the Trump administration to address the issue of illegally subsidized imports into the United States.The company expects earnings in the steel products unit to sequentially decline in the first quarter due to seasonality, while earnings in its raw materials unit are expected to improve.   Shares of Nucor have gained 6.8% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s 8.2% growth.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

1037,NUE,"Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) stated that it will build a rebar micro mill in Frostproof, FL. This $240-million investment will be Nucor’s second rebar micro mill. Nucor had announced a rebar micro mill project in Sedalia, MO in November 2017.Nucor is building the mill in a market where demand is strong. This rebar micro mill project is in line with the company’s long-term strategy for profitable growth and strengthens its position as a low-cost producer.

It will have an estimated annual capacity of 350,000 tons and will create jobs for about 250 people.Nucor’s shares have gained 6.4% over a year, underperforming the 16.2% growth of the industry it belongs to. Nucor expects earnings in first-quarter 2018 to increase sequentially, excluding tax reform benefits recorded in fourth-quarter 2017. The company believes that there is considerable optimism in steel end-use markets. It is also encouraged by positive pricing momentum for its products in the steel mill unit.However, the company expects first-quarter 2018 results to be adversely impacted by weather related interruptions at some of its sheet mills and higher scrap prices. It expects earnings in the steel products unit to decline owing to seasonality effect, while earnings in raw materials unit is expected to improve sequentially.Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus  Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus | Nucor Corporation Quote Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNucor has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic material space are LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

1038,NUE,"As widely expected, President Donald Trump signed orders imposing steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from certain countries yesterday, defying a wave of criticism and threats of counter-measures from major foreign trade partners.The President’s move is aimed at protecting the domestic steel and aluminum industries which had long been reeling under the onslaught of cheap imports and has suffered significant reduction in production and employment. In line with last week’s announcement, the White House has pushed ahead with a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminum imports. The tariffs, which President Trump believes are necessary to protect the national security, will go into effect in 15 days.The tariffs are the result of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s investigations, which were carried out under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to determine whether the imports pose a threat to national security. The Trump administration ordered the investigation last year.Trump Exempts Canada & MexicoPresident Trump excluded Canada and Mexico — two major sources of steel imports to the United States — from the tariff orders that he signed in presence of steel and aluminum workers. Moreover, there will be provisions for other countries to apply for exemptions should their imports do not hurt the U.S. economy.The President noted that Canada and Mexico represent “a special case” and will continue talks with them to address concerns. The exemption of these nations marks a significant concession from the President’s initial plan for broad-based tariffs on steel and aluminum. The exclusions of these countries are dependent on the outcome of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiation talks that are underway.  Canada is the largest steel exporter to the United States, accounting for roughly 16% of total U.S. steel imports in 2017, per the U.S. Census Bureau data. Mexico is the fourth-largest exporter of the metal with around 9% market share.The markets cheered the move with three major U.S. stock indexes closing higher yesterday on the news of exemptions that somewhat eased concerns of a fierce trade war.Steel Stocks RetreatSteel stocks rallied following the tariff announcement last week on expectations of a broad-based trade action. However, the Trump tariff order sent stocks of major U.S. steel makers tumbling yesterday.Shares of U.S. Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS  -  Free Report), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and Commercial Metals Company (CMC  -  Free Report) tanked roughly 2.9%, 2.7%, 4%, 2.8% and 3.6%, respectively, yesterday.The price reaction appears to have been triggered by the concessions made by the President in the tariff order by excluding two main sources of U.S. imports while leaving room for other nations to negotiate exclusions from the tariffs.Nevertheless, the tariffs would give American steel makers more pricing power and also help to level the playing field. The tariffs will lead to lower imports into the United States, which would in turn boost demand for American steel.On prospects of higher steel demand as a result of the latest U.S. punitive trade measures, U.S. Steel said recently that it will restart one of its Granite City Works blast furnaces and steelmaking facilities. U.S. Steel expects to call back around 500 employees starting this month. Both the blast furnaces of Granite City Works and its steelmaking facilities were idled in December 2015 in response to challenging market conditions, including unfairly traded imports.Moreover, the tariffs are expected to boost domestic steel production capacity. The U.S. Department of Commerce earlier said that the trade actions are aimed at increasing domestic steel production to roughly 80% operating rate from its present 73% of capacity.Both U.S. Steel and Steel Dynamics sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). While Nucor carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), both AK Steel and Commercial Metals currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Worries for Industry GroupsSome industry groups have expressed their discontent about the trade tariff action, worrying that it would drive up manufacturing costs, increase prices for consumers and may also lead to job losses. Fears of higher steel prices resulting from the levy of tariffs hit the stocks of a host of industrial companies following the tariff announcements including Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) that are major consumers of steel.The automotive industry, which consumes a big chunk of steel, is among the industries that will be hit the hardest. U.S. automakers fear about the higher costs they have to bear for steel, a key raw material, which would eventually result in higher cost for consumers.The tariffs also pose a headwind for the U.S. chemical industry. The move is expected to hurt new chemical investments in the United States and may lead to a slowdown in growth in the domestic chemical industry. These costly tariffs are likely to push up the costs of building chemical plants that use a significant amount of steel.Risks of Tit-for-Tat Trade RetaliationConcerns over an international trade war gripped the markets since the declaration of the metal tariffs last Thursday, further exacerbated by the resignation of White House chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn on Tuesday. The tariff announcement stoked fears of an intense trade war and sparked selloff on Wall Street on Mar 1.The U.S. trade measures now risk retaliatory actions on American exports, hurting the U.S. economy. Since its announcement on Mar 1, metal tariffs have drawn criticism from major U.S. trading partners and some members of the Republican Party.U.S. Republican Senator Jeff Flake said, in a statement, that the “so-called 'flexible tariffs' are a marriage of two lethal poisons to economic growth — protectionism and uncertainty.”Moreover, the European Union (EU) has reportedly threatened to impose tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles and other iconic U.S. brands in retaliation for the Trump administration’s tariff move. Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU Trade Commissioner, tweeted ""The EU is a close ally of the US and we continue to be of the view that the EU should be excluded from these measures.""China has also warned that it is ready to take an ""appropriate and necessary response"" in any trade war with the United States. While China only accounts for 2% of U.S. steel imports, it is the world’s biggest producer of steel accounting for around half of the global production. Beijing has been repeatedly accused of dumping excess steel capacity into global markets.Brazil, which is the second-largest exporter of steel to the United States with roughly 13% share of total imports last year, has also pledged to take “all necessary actions” to protect its interests.  Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

1039,NUE,"Continued uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs caused U.S. steel and aluminum stocks and funds—including U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report), Alcoa (AA  -  Free Report), and the S&P Metals and Mining ETF (XME  -  Free Report)—to fluctuate on Tuesday.The debate surrounding Trump’s proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum continues to rage, with some companies coming out against the overarching proposal and several prominent Republican lawmakers changing their rhetoric. Meanwhile, NAFTA negotiations also remain an inflection.Aluminum AssociationThe U.S.-based Aluminum Association, which represents 114 companies including Alcoa, Vulcan (VMC), and others, voiced its concerns about the potential 10% tariff on aluminum in a letter to Trump on Monday.The letter stated that the association agrees with the president’s overall idea to create a thriving domestic aluminum industry but does not side with Trump on the current all-encompassing proposal. In fact, the statement noted that the group’s members “fear that the proposed tariff may do more harm than good.”The organization also offered to help Trump come up with a plan that exempts key trading partners, including Canada and the European Union, while coming down hard on China.""Unfortunately, the tariffs proposed will do little to address the fundamental problem of massive aluminum overcapacity in China, while impacting supply chains with vital trading partners who play by the rules,"" the letter said.GOP & NAFTAHouse Speaker Paul Ryan today backed away from his previous call to drop the proposed tariffs outright in favor of a more measured and concentrated approach on countries that abuse the current system. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin echoed some of Ryan’s sentiments when he spoke to lawmakers regarding current NAFTA negotiations.“To the extent that we’re successful in renegotiating NAFTA, those tariffs won’t apply to Mexico and Canada,” Mnuchin said at a House hearing Tuesday.Mnuchin’s sentiments seemed to back up Trump’s Monday comments regarding Nafta partners.We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies & jobs. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Also, Canada must..— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 5, 2018Stocks With so much uncertainty surrounding these tariffs—which could have long-lasting impacts on economies around the world—and more industry experts coming out against the current proposal, investors might expect stocks to have dipped across the board. Instead, industry related stocks diverged Tuesday.Aluminum powers Alcoa and Vulcan saw their stock prices surge over 3.5% and 2%, respectively, despite overall industry concerns regarding the basic 10% tariff.Shares of steel giants United States Steel and Steel Dynamics (STLD  -  Free Report) dipped 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively. However, other steel firms, including Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) and AK Steel (AKS  -  Free Report) experienced marginal gains.Meanwhile, shares of industry ETFs like the VanEck Vectors Steel ETF (SLX  -  Free Report) climbed 0.8%, while the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF popped nearly 2%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1040,NUE,"There is not much clarity yet surrounding President Donald Trump’s planned tariffs on steel and aluminum, and Monday morning only complicated the issue after Trump took to Twitter to call out Canada and Mexico regarding NAFTA.Last week, the president announced his intentions to impose new broad-based tariffs on steel and aluminum. The plan has been met with mixed reactions since then, especially in North America where the potential implications of these tariffs could have serious, long-term impacts.Canada, as one of the top exporters of steel and aluminum to the U.S., could be harmed by this proposal, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said as much recently when he called Trump’s tariff proposal ""absolutely unacceptable.""But Trump now seems set to use this steel and aluminum tariff as a tactic to help renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.“We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada,” Trump wrote in a tweet Monday morning.  “NAFTA, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies & jobs. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed.”Even though the potential new tariffs aren’t set in stone, it seems that the Trump administration is ready to roll out its plan this week, which should theoretically help U.S. steel makers—at least for now.With that said, let’s take a look at three U.S. steel stocks that investors might want to consider amid all this tariff talk.1.      Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report)This Indiana-headquartered firm is one of the biggest domestic steel producers and metals recyclers, and stands to benefit from the planned steel tariff. Steel Dynamics is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is projected to see its earnings pop by nearly 22% in the first quarter of 2018, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. This bottom-line growth is expected to continue, as Steel Dynamics’ earnings are projected to reach $4.00 per share in fiscal 2018, which would mark 51% year-over-year growth.Looking even further ahead, Steel Dynamics is projected to expand its earnings figure at an annualized rate of 12% over the next three to five years. The company has also seen analyst sentiment climb recently with a handful of upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter and full fiscal year.2.       United States Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report)United States Steel is expected to see its current-quarter sales climb by 14%, while the company’s full fiscal year earnings are projected to skyrocket by nearly 94%. Estimates regarding U.S. Steel’s substantial bottom-line growth could be moved even higher once Trump’s steel tariffs are enacted. In fact, the company’s full year earnings estimates were already upped by $0.03 to $3.76 per share within the last seven days.United States Steel is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an overall “A” VGM score. Furthermore, the steel power is expected to see its earnings per share figure expand at an annualized rate of 8% over the next three to five years.3.       Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report)This North Carolina-based company is one of the largest U.S. steel manufacturing firms, having produced over 26 million tons of steel in 2017. Nucor is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has seen its stock price pop nearly 16% in the last 12 weeks, with most of the gains coming before last week’s tariff announcement.Nucor is projected see its fiscal 2018 earnings reach $4.92 per share, which would represent 40% growth over 2017. The company is also expected to see its sales climb by more 13% over the next two quarters. Furthermore, the company’s EPS figure is projected to surge at an annualized rate of 12% over the next three to five years. And this figure could climb even higher if the proposed 25% steel tariff creates its desired effect.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1041,NUE,"President Donald Trump’s proposal of imposing tariff on imported steel and aluminum saw domestic steel stocks rally on Thursday. Although certain quarters feel that this might spark a trade war and disbalance the global economy, eventually affecting profits of exporters, the proposal has been cheered by U.S. steel and aluminum manufacturers.Domestic steelmakers see this move as Trump’s initiative to revive the steel and aluminum industry that has been declining over the last few decades. Tariff on imported steel and aluminum also makes manufacturers hopeful of more employment in the sector. So it obviously makes good sense now to add stocks from the sector to your portfolio.Domestic Steel Stocks Rally on Trump’s Announcement Trump announced on Mar 1 that he would impose hefty tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. An executive order on the proposed tariff of 25% on imported steel and 10% aluminum would be signed in the coming days. The President believes that such a move will help in rebuilding the U.S. steel and aluminum industry that has been treated unfairly by other countries for decades. The announcement may have sparked a debate on a possible trade war but it gave the share price of U.S. steelmakers a shot in the arm.Close on the heels of the announcement, shares of major steel manufacturers rallied. On Mar 1, shares of AK Steel Holding Corp (AKS  -  Free Report) rose 9.5% and U.S. Steel Corp (X  -  Free Report) jumped 5.8%. Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) and Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) jumped 3.3% and 4.0%, respectively. Shares of aluminum producer Century Aluminum Company (CENX  -  Free Report) climbed 7.5%, while Alcoa Corp. (AA  -  Free Report) increased 1%.While the decision was well received by domestic steel manufacturers and lawmakers, it drew flak from other quarters that fear damage to the U.S. economy. The big fear among investors is that other countries might now take similar retaliatory steps, which will hurt the global economy and trade, eventually affecting profits of U.S. exporters.As a result, shares of manufacturers that utilize a significant amount of imported steel declined. Shares of major automakers, which were already suffering due to lower vehicle sales in February, declined further on the announcement. Shares of General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) fell 3.97%, while Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report) plunged 3% and 2.8%, respectively.Moreover, shares of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) declined 2.9%. United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA) and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) dropped 3.3%, 3.5% and 1.8%, respectively.Trump Keeps Key Campaign PromiseThe United States has been suffering from manufacturing employment decline for decades now. Before getting elected, Trump campaigned heavily on his America First trade policy. The proposed imposition of a respective 25% and 10% tariff on imported steel and aluminum is a big step in this direction.However, Trump hasn’t taken enough measures to implement that policy since taking office. His tariff announcement could mean that he is finally keeping is election campaign promise of reviving the steel and aluminum industry in the Rust Belt, that helped him win the 2016 election.Many of the workers form states in this area, who had voted for Barrack Obama, surprised the country by swinging toward Trump. However, Trump’s support in this area has been waning since then, and this announcement comes as a move to keep his promise and of course win back support before the 2020 election.Will Import Tariff Really Create Steel Jobs?Trump’s announcement comes with the objective of protecting the domestic steel and aluminum industry by increasing production, which will eventually help in creating more jobs. Trump has constantly been stressing on the need to save these industries, which he feels were not treated fairly by other countries. U.S. steelmakers lost three fourth of their jobs between 1962 and 2005.However, a study by American Economic Associations shows that this has been primarily because of improved production technology. Most steelmakers over the last few decades have increased the level of automation on their production lines, which has increased the output per worker to five times, consequently taking a toll on workforce. Hence analysts believe that despite this announcement, the impact on employment may be far less than what one hopes.Our ChoicesTrump’s America First policy has made domestic steelmakers optimistic about the future of the industry. Such a move hints at increasing domestic steel and aluminum production, which is expected to result in higher employment. Moreover, Trump’s announcement saw shares of domestic steel and aluminum makers rally immediately.Adding domestic steel stocks to your portfolio looks like a smart option at this point. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.United States Steel Corporation is an integrated steel producer with major production operations in the United States and Central Europe. United States Steel Corporation has expected earnings growth of more than 100% for the current year.

1042,NUE,"Steel stocks got a big thrust on Thursday after President Donald Trump said that the U.S. will impose heavy tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in a major move to protect the domestic producers of these metals, rebuild the long-struggling U.S. steel and aluminum industries and safeguard American jobs.The President, in a meeting with executives of steel and aluminum companies at the White House, said that he would levy a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminum imports, with plans to formally announce them next week. The President noted that steel and aluminum companies have been “very unfairly treated by bad policy, by bad trade deals, by other countries” and the tariffs would remain for ""a long period of time."" A Welcome News for U.S. Steel MakersPositive reactions to Trump’s comments triggered a rally in major U.S. steel stocks on Thursday with U.S. Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS  -  Free Report), Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) gaining roughly 5.8%, 9.5%, 3.3% and 4%, respectively.AK Steel, which racked up the biggest gain yesterday, lauded President Trump's announcement and said, in a statement, ""We support and commend President Trump for announcing today the actions he plans to take to stem the tide of unfairly traded steel imports that threaten the national security of our country.""Both U.S. Steel and Steel Dynamics sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). While Nucor carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), AK Steel currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Steel stocks also got a lift last month after the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) issued the long-awaited reports on its probe into imports of steel and aluminum products and recommended President Trump to impose tariffs or quotas on these imports.The DOC’s investigations, which were carried out under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, were aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security. The Trump administration ordered the investigation last year.The DOC found that these imports “threaten to impair the national security” as defined by Section 232. The DOC Secretary Wilbur Ross recommended at least 24% and 7.7% global tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, respectively, from all countries. Ross also proposed a number of alternative measures to address the problem of steel imports.Domestic steel makers struggled to cope with a renewed tide of cheap steel imports last year. Imports of cheap steel continue to flood American shores despite a string of punitive trade actions (in the form of heavy tariffs) and threats of further future measures. These imports have hurt selling prices and margins of U.S. steel makers.According to the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), an association of North American steel makers, total steel imports shot up 15.4% to around 38.1 million net tons in 2017. Finished steel imports for 2017 also increased 12.2% to around 29.6 million net tons, per the AISI. For full-year 2017, finished steel import market share was an estimated 27%, which is higher than 26% clocked in 2016.As such, the proposed U.S. trade actions would give American steel makers more pricing power and also help to level the playing field.But Trade War Fears Shake MarketsThe tariff announcement stoked fears of an international trade war and sparked selloff on Wall Street yesterday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 1.7% while the S&P 500 losing 1.3%.Moreover, fears of higher steel prices hit the stocks of a host of industrial companies that are major consumers of the metal. Shares of Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) lost 2.9% while The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) was down 3.5%.Major automobile stocks were also hit hard with shares of General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) tanking 4% and 3%, respectively, on concerns about the higher costs they have to bear for the key raw material. This would eventually result in higher cost for consumers.Risks of Retaliation Loom LargeThe planned U.S. trade actions are likely to trigger retaliation measures from affected countries and major foreign trade partners, thereby hurting the U.S. economy. In fact, the announced actions have prompted fiery responses from major U.S. allies like the European Union and Canada.The European Commission released a statement yesterday in response to the announcement by President Trump. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, said that “We strongly regret this step, which appears to represent a blatant intervention to protect US domestic industry and not to be based on any national security justification.” Juncker added that “The Commission will bring forward in the next few days a proposal for WTO-compatible countermeasures against the US to rebalance the situation.""The Canadian trade minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said that “Any tariffs or any quotas that will be imposed on our aluminum industry, our steel industry, would be unacceptable” and also cautioned that the decision would “have an impact on both sides of the border.” Canada accounted for roughly 16% of total U.S. steel imports in 2017, per the U.S. Census Bureau data, making it the largest steel exporter to the United States.Brazil, which is the second-largest exporter of steel to the United States with roughly 13% share of total imports last year, also expressed significant concerns about the U.S. trade action and has threatened to take actions to protect its interests.  Meanwhile, the South Korean trade ministry stated that it will keep talking to U.S. officials and policymakers “until the U.S. government makes a final decision.” South Korea is the third-largest steel exporter to the United States with roughly 10% share of total U.S. steel imports in 2017, according to the U.S. Census Bureau data.Moreover, the Chinese commerce ministry, in a statement, said that ""The Chinese side expresses grave concern."" While China only accounts for 2% of U.S. steel imports, it is the world’s biggest producer of steel accounting for around half of the global production. Beijing had earlier threatened to take necessary actions should President Trump implements import tariffs.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

1043,NUE,"President Trump announced a tariff of 25% on imported steel to the U.S. yesterday, surprising not only market indexes but his own White House advisors. His intentions were very clear: “We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE!” the President tweeted.But economists and traders took the news quite differently, sending the Dow plummeting 500 points on the news. Trump’s announcement, which also included a 10% tariff on aluminum imports, sent question marks ricocheting around not only the steel industry but geopolitical certainties in the Western hemisphere — most importantly, NAFTA.The North American Free Trade Agreement would be immediately affected by these tariffs, as Canada is the biggest steel and aluminum importer to the U.S. in the world (16% steel, 43% aluminum). Currently, our closest ally and trading partner hopes to work out certain exemptions — or at least reassurances — regarding these purported tariffs, that they won’t be held to such an extreme new standard. This is especially considering there’s no secret who Trump’s target of these tariffs really is: China.Since the early days of his presidential campaign, Trump has said he’d get tough with China, who he claims has taken advantage of trade with the U.S. over decades of non-action from previous administrations. So these tariffs are clearly a way Trump sees to help neutralize Chinese interest on steel imports. Besides this, obviously import tariffs would help domestic steel makes, like Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) and U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) greatly.However, though the steel industry in this country hires roughly 140K workers, that’s a drop in the bucket compared to the 6.5 million workforce engaged in steel usage. Chief among these is the automobile industry, which relies greatly on steel and aluminum products. Higher prices for these materials would lead to higher prices for cars and trucks, and this sort of chain reaction through the economy is precisely why the market is having a problem digesting this news.Currently, the Dow is down another 200 points in today’s pre-market, the Nasdaq is 80 points off its Thursday close and the S&P 500 down 20 points. It’s unlikely this issue will enjoy a swift correction in normal trading hours, so as long as this remains the main pressure on stocks today, we expect to close in the red again to end the week.Q4 Earnings Sweep-UpQuickly, both J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) are also trading down ahead of today’s opening bell. Though both companies beat bottom-line estimates, they missed on revenue projections and disappointed on comps and guidance.

1044,NUE,"We issued an updated research report on Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (RS  -  Free Report) on Feb 28.Reliance Steel’s profits soared year over year in fourth-quarter 2017, helped by a hefty tax benefit. Adjusted earnings and sales for the quarter topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company, in its fourth-quarter call, said that it is seeing an improvement in overall customer sentiment and demand and expects the ongoing reduction in imports will support higher metal pricing. The company is optimistic about business activity levels in first-quarter 2018 and sees continued growth in the end markets in which it operates.Reliance Steel is gaining from its broad and diversified product base, wide geographic footprint and continued demand strength across aerospace and automotive markets and synergies of acquisitions. Reliance Steel continues with its aggressive acquisition strategy to tap growth opportunities. The addition of Metals USA to the company’s portfolio has complemented its existing customer base, product mix and geographic footprint. The buyout of Tubular Steel also provides impetus to the company’s long-term growth strategy and strength by expanding its product portfolio and end-market diversification. Moreover, the acquisition of Best Manufacturing Inc. bodes well for the company's existing service center network with its specialty high margin products, value-added processing capabilities and strong focus on customer service. The acquisition of Ferguson Perforating Company also diversifies its product portfolio.Moreover, Reliance Steel is expected to benefit from an improving metal pricing environment. Higher pricing contributed to its earnings in the most recent quarter. The company’s average prices per ton went up 8.8% year over year in the final quarter of 2017.  The company noted that the higher pricing resulted from continued mill price increases in the quarter that have continued into 2018.The company sees its average selling prices to increase 4% to 6% on a sequential comparison basis in first-quarter 2018. This should support its margins in the first quarter.Reliance Steel also expects metal prices to increase further should the pending Section 232 decision by the U.S. government leads to a reduction in steel imports.American steel makers including Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report), United States Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) are pinning their hopes on President Donald Trump enforcing new restrictions on imported steel. The U.S. Department of Commerce recently issued reports on its probe into imports of steel and aluminum products and recommended President Trump to impose tariffs or quotas on these imports. The President has until Apr 11, 2018 to make a decision on the commerce department’s steel recommendations.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1045,NUE,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects.However, one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy. While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks, GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to make the strategy foolproof.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2 (Only Strong Buy and Buy-rated stocks can get through.) Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than X-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 16.Here are seven of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen:Teradyne, Inc. (TER  -  Free Report) is a leading supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications.

1046,NUE,"Shares of major American steel makers got a lift last Friday after the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) issued the long-awaited reports on its probe into imports of steel and aluminum products and recommended President Donald Trump to impose tariffs or quotas on these imports.The DOC’s investigations, which were carried out under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, were aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security. The Trump administration ordered the investigation last year.The DOC found that these imports “threaten to impair the national security” as defined by Section 232. The reports are currently under consideration by President Trump and no final decisions have been made on the recommendations provided in the reports, the DOC noted.DOC Recommends Broad-based ActionsThe DOC Secretary Wilbur Ross recommended several options (including tariffs and quotas) to address the problem of steel imports. Ross proposed at least 24% global tariff of on all steel imports from all countries.The other proposed alternatives are at least 53% tariff on all steel imports from Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, India, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam with a quota by product on steel imports from all other countries equal to 100% of their 2017 exports to the United States and a quota on all steel products from all countries equal to 63% of their 2017 exports.The DOC also stated that these alternatives are aimed at increasing domestic steel production to roughly 80% operating rate from its present 73% of capacity.For aluminum, Ross recommended a tariff of at least 7.7% on all exports from all countries. Another option is a 23.6% tariff of on all products from China, Hong Kong, Russia, Venezuela and Vietnam with quotas for all other countries equal to 100% of their 2017 exports to the United States. A quota on all imports from all countries equal to up to 86.7% of their 2017 exports has also been proposed.Steel Stocks RallyThe DOC’s recommendations provided a boost to the stocks of leading domestic steel companies. United States Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report) racked up the biggest gain with its shares rising 14.8% last Friday. AK Steel Holding Corporation’s (AKS  -  Free Report) shares rallied 13.7% while Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) notched up 4.8% and 4.5% gains, respectively. Shares of Commercial Metals Company (CMC  -  Free Report) also popped 5.8%.AK Steel lauded the DOC’s recommendations and said, in a statement, on Feb 16 that “We are pleased with the recommendations by Secretary Ross that tough and effective actions be taken in a holistic manner to mitigate the flood of steel imports into the U.S.”Both U.S. Steel and Steel Dynamics sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). While Nucor carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), both AK Steel and Commercial Metals currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Imports Still Haunt American Steel MillsDomestic steel makers struggled to cope with a renewed tide of cheap steel imports last year. Imports of cheap steel continue to flood American shores despite a string of punitive trade actions (in the form of heavy tariffs) and threats of further future measures. These imports have hurt selling prices and margins of U.S. steel makers.According to the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), an association of North American steel makers, total steel imports shot up 15.4% to around 38.1 million net tons in 2017. Finished steel imports for 2017 also increased 12.2% to around 29.6 million net tons, per the AISI. For full-year 2017, finished steel import market share was an estimated 27%, which is higher than 26% clocked in 2016.Although positive rulings in trade cases (resulting in levy of heavy tariffs) against China led to a decline in Chinese steel exports to the United States, imports from other countries remain at above historical levels.According to AISI data, finished steel imports from China fell roughly 5.7% year over year in 2017. However, imports from other countries such as Germany, Taiwan, Brazil and Russia spiked last year.U.S. steel makers continue to pin their hopes on President Trump imposing new restrictions on imported steel. The President has until Apr 11, 2018 to make a decision on the DOC’s steel recommendations. A positive decision would provide a significant thrust to steel prices and give domestic steel makers more pricing power.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

1048,NUE,"Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Jan 30.In the last quarter, the steel giant delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.3% by posting adjusted earnings of 79 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents.Revenues increased roughly 20.5% year over year to $5,170.1 million in the third quarter, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,276 million.Nucor beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing in one, with an average positive surprise of 9.9%.Shares of Nucor have moved up 16.9% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 18.9% growth.  Can the company surprise investors again or is it heading for a possible pullback? Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLast month, Nucor provided its fourth-quarter 2017 guidance. The company expects earnings for the quarter in the range of 50-55 cents per share. This is a decrease from 79 cents per share recorded in the previous quarter and is comparable to 50 cents earned a year ago.Total sales for Nucor for the fourth quarter is projected to decline by roughly 4.1% from the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at $4,960 million.Nucor believes that the overall market demand in fourth-quarter 2017 has been strong. However, expected earnings in the steel mills unit will be negatively impacted by margin compression owing to the surge of imports experienced in the summer of 2017. This pressure from imports along with weakness in plate steel has caused the company to lower fourth quarter earnings estimate for the steel mills segment. Nucor anticipates similar results for the steel products unit in the fourth quarter compared to third-quarter 2017.Nucor Steel Louisiana witnessed an unplanned outage during fourth-quarter 2017 and resumed operations early last month. However, this outage was shorter than the unplanned outages experienced during the last quarter. Owing to this, Nucor expect earnings of the raw materials unit in the fourth quarter to improve from the third.Nucor noted that the U.S. steel industry continues to be adversely affected by steel imports. However, the industry continues to combat unfair traded imports. The United States Department of Commerce, last year, has made several ruling imposing duties on additional steel products which are favorable for the domestic steel industry.  Notably, the automotive market continues to remain healthy and the company is increasing penetration of new automotive platforms. Nonresidential construction markets are stable at a level considerably below peak 2007 mark, while energy markets continue their recovery from the depressed levels experienced in late 2014 and 2015. Agriculture and heavy equipment are continuing to show signs of improvement and in general, Nucor is optimistic on expected overall industrial production in 2018.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nucor is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Nucor for the fourth quarter is -4.93%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 55 cents and 58 cents, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Nucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #1, which when combined with a negative ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Nucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Nucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Nucor Corporation Quote Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (AEM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +20.99% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

1049,NUE,"About the Industry
"
1050,NUE,"The steel industry can well be termed the backbone of modern society considering steel’s varied uses, be it in construction, transport, electrical appliances, food packaging and the like. In terms of its composition, steel is an alloy of iron and carbon containing less than 2% carbon and 1% manganese and small amounts of silicon, phosphorus, sulfur and oxygen.
"
1051,NUE,"Steel products are classified into four broad categories: flat steel products, long steel products, scrap and semi-finished products. Flat products include plates, hot-rolled strip and sheets, and cold-rolled strip and sheets. The long steel product category includes wire rods, beams, reinforced bars and merchant bars. The products under both these categories are rolled from steel slabs, which are considered as unfinished or semi-finished products that are generally not sold.
"
1052,NUE,"The world steel industry is a large one. According to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production was a record 1,527 million tons (Mt) in 2011. However, despite its size, the steel industry remains relatively fragmented. The industry is highly cyclical and intensely competitive.A Look into Major Consumer Markets
"
1053,NUE,"Historically, the automotive and construction markets have remained the largest consumers of steel, absorbing more than half of the total steel produced. The industry caters to large automakers such as General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report) and Honda Motor Company (HMC  -  Free Report).
"
1054,NUE,"Houses, buildings, skyscrapers and bridges rely on steel for their strength. Other steel consuming industries include appliances, agricultural implements, converters, containers, energy, electrical equipment and industrial machinery.
"
1055,NUE,"Over the last few years, China has emerged as the major consumer of steel. Ranked on the basis of consumption, United States follows next with Japan, India and South Korea in tow.Global Production Numbers
"
1056,NUE,"As mentioned above, world crude steel production was a record 1,527 Mt in 2011, outperforming the 2010 record of 1,414 Mt, a 6.8% jump. China continues to be the largest steel producing country, generating almost half of the global output at 46%, and growing 8.9% year over year. Japan posted a 1.8% decline affected by last year's earthquake.  The United States enjoyed the third position, producing 86.2 Mt of crude steel, 7.1% higher than 2010 and comprising 6% of the total global output.
"
1057,NUE,"North America’s crude steel production was 118.9 Mt, an increase of 6.8% on 2010.  Asian production grew 7.9% to 988 Mt and Europe rose 4.6% to 329 Mt. Among the top 10 steel producing countries, as per the World Steel Association, Turkey outperformed the rest on the basis of year-over-year growth with a 17% surge in production to 34 Mt. South Korea followed with a 16% clip to 68.5 Mt.
"
1058,NUE,"January figures from the ongoing fiscal show a downtrend of 7.8% year over year aggregating to steel production of 117 Mt but consistent with December 2010 levels.  Chinese production dropped 13% to 52 Mt while Japan posted an 11% drop to 8.6 Mt. In Asia, overall decline was noted at 11.4% to 73.8 Mt and Europe dipped 2.7% to 17.3 Mt. The United States fared better with an annual climb of 5.7% to 7.6 Mt.Performance: Before & After
"
1059,NUE,"After enjoying a sturdy growth for most of the past decade, the steel industry suffered a decline in 2008 due to the recession, as consumers utilized existing inventories rather than buying new stock. However, the industry turned around in late 2009 and continued to grow in 2010 and 2011, in tandem with global economic activity.
"
1060,NUE,"The growth witnessed in 2011 was noteworthy considering the widespread headwinds facing the industry: the ongoing euro area sovereign debt crisis, earthquakes in Japan, the political unrest in the Middle East which resulted in a surge in oil prices, and the tightening of government monetary measures in many emerging nations.
"
1061,NUE,"Demand for steel has benefited from the spurt of growth witnessed in the developing economies that helped counter the sluggishness in developed economies. Asia, particularly China, continued to be the principal driver of growth. Demand for steel products nonetheless remains below pre-recession levels. Questions about China’s growth going forward also add an element of uncertainly to the outlook.
"
1062,NUE,"In 2010, the automotive industry began to recover from the effects of the recession. The automotive sector is showing significant promise. In February 2012, total motor vehicle sales reached the highest level since February 2008, at 15.1 million SAAR (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate). For the first two months of 2012, sales have averaged 14.6 million SAAR, outperforming the Street expectations. We believe these upbeat numbers bode well for the steel industry.
"
1063,NUE,"The construction sector has been a drag on the steel companies’ earnings. Unlike the automotive sector, the housing industry struggled in 2011 and continues to be severely impacted by the after effects of the recession. Housing starts in the United States in 2011 remained near historically low levels for the third consecutive year compared to pre-recession activity.
"
1064,NUE,"According to the data released by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, housing starts increased 34.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 698,000 in February 2012 from February 2011. Building permits in February were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 717,000, 34.3% above the February 2011 figure of 534,000.
"
1065,NUE,"These figures provide a glimmer of hope that U.S. residential construction is finally on the road to recovery. But it will likely be a long time before the industry’s conditions can be called ‘normal’ again.
"
1066,NUE,"We also see some early signs of recovery in non-residential construction. According to the American Institute of Architects, the architecture billings index, an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine to twelve month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, was 51.0 in February 2012.
"
1067,NUE,"The index has remained over 50 for the fourth consecutive month, a sure indicator of an overall rise in demand in the construction industry. The optimism is seen across most regions of the country and the major construction sectors.
"
1068,NUE,"However, given the uncertainty in the markets, we are still a little skeptical about the sustainability of the momentum. We thus expect soft-to-very-moderate near-term growth in demand in this sector as clients exercise caution in pursuing new projects and face difficulty in accessing financing for projects.How Well Did the Steel Stocks in Our Coverage Fare?
"
1069,NUE,"Reflecting on the 2011 results of the steel companies in our coverage -- ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) and Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) -- we find revenues increasing across the board due to higher average steel prices and increase in shipments.
"
1070,NUE,"ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel producing company, belched out 91.9 Mt in fiscal 2011, representing 6% of the world's steel output. ArcelorMittal’s 2011 sales increased 10% to $94 billion while AK Steel’s sales climbed 8% to $6.5 billion. Nucor recorded sales increase of 21% to reach $20 billion.
"
1071,NUE,"In terms of profitability, Nucor stood tall with its fiscal 2011 EPS of $2.45, almost six fold the 42 cents earned in 2010. ArcelorMittal’s EPS in fiscal 2011 plummeted 31% to $1.19. AK Steel reversed its year-ago loss to earn 9 cents (excluding special items) in 2011. United States Steel Corp (X  -  Free Report), though still in red, narrowed its fiscal 2011 loss per share to 47 cents from the year-ago loss of $3.36.
"
1072,NUE,"The steel companies expect volumes to improve in 2012 on recovering demand from improving end-markets, backed by a recuperating global economy. They expect operating results to significantly improve from 2011 levels mainly driven by improved average realized prices and higher shipments. Steel consumption is expected to grow in the automotive, transportation, energy, industrial and the agricultural sectors.
"
1073,NUE,"However, the European debt crisis and its potential global impact remain an overhang on the steel industry. ArcelorMittal has idled 5 of its 25 blast furnaces in Europe. The company will continue to align its steel growth projects to match demand situations. Furthermore, the company’s focus on its mining business given its more attractive returns has resulted in some planned steel investments being deferred.
"
1074,NUE,"Currently, Nucor, United Steel and AK Steel retain a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) for the short term (1 to 3 months) that corresponds with our Neutral recommendations in the long term. ArcelorMittal retains a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) and we have recently downgraded our long-term recommendation from Neutral to Underperform.Industry Capacity & Demand/Consumption Dynamics
"
1075,NUE,"World crude steel capacity utilization ratio inched up 0.5 percentage point to 71.3% in January 2012 from December 2011 but dipped 9.6 percentage points from January 2011. U.S. capacity utilization ratio in January 2012 was a forty-month record high at 77.6%, an increase from the December 2011 utilization rate of 75.2%. Though the capacity utilization rate has increased significantly from the April 2009 low level, it still remains below the historical averages.
"
1076,NUE,"In the United States, apparent consumption, which is used to measure domestic demand for steel, stood at 8.6 Mt in January 2012, up 15.6% year over year and 11.6% from the sequentially preceding month. When we compare it with the trough experienced in April 2009, demand was up a considerable 86.1%.Price Trends Seen So Far
"
1077,NUE,"Steel prices are generally volatile, in line with the highly cyclical nature of the global steel industry. Following an extended period of rising prices, steel prices plunged during the financial and economic crisis of 2008 due to the sudden drop in demand. This was further intensified by massive industry destocking as customers cleared their steel inventories. Steel producers in their turn suffered the worst casualties, recording lower revenues and margins, and even had to write down finished steel and raw material inventories.
"
1078,NUE,"Steel prices saw a recovery in late 2009 that followed into 2010 but remained below the pre-financial crisis level. In 2011, steel prices remained volatile, increasing in the first half on the back of strong demand, higher raw material costs, improved activity for the automotive, appliance and other industrial segments though construction remained relatively weak in many regions.
"
1079,NUE,"Prices fell in the second half as demand decreased due to uncertainty surrounding the Euro-zone sovereign debt crisis. The fourth quarter particularly exhibited weakness due to a sharp drop in iron ore prices in October and as customers renewed destocking considering the uncertain economic environment.
"
1080,NUE,"So far in 2012, the steel industry is seeing some price hikes. We feel that the recovery in pricing momentum will be driven by a reviving economy, no further crisis in the Euro-zone and a rebound in construction activity in the developing countries, in particular China, India and South Korea.A Closer Look at the Factors Affecting Steel PricesRising raw material prices: The steel industry consumes substantial amounts of raw materials including iron ore, coking coal and coke besides requiring a lot of energy. Increases in raw material prices necessitates a corresponding increase in steel selling prices.
"
1081,NUE,"However, the situation gets tricky in the wake of lower demand, when it becomes increasingly challenging to pass on raw material price hikes to consumers. Historically, energy prices have varied significantly. This trend is expected to continue due to market conditions and other factors beyond the control of steel companies.Overcapacity and fluctuation in steel imports-exports: The steel industry has always suffered from overcapacity. Steel consumption in China and other developing economies has increased at a rapid pace. In response, steel companies have ramped up their steel production capability with scope for increasing further capacity.
"
1082,NUE,"Steel production capability, particularly in China, appears to be in excess of China’s domestic market demand. Considering China is the largest steel producer, the export of the surplus steel at subsidized prices to other markets casts a major impact on world steel trade and prices. Consumers in the United States are importing cheaper steel from China, forcing domestic steel producers to sell at lower prices, and sometimes even at a loss. The U.S. government has thus been imposing anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel imports.Economic recovery: Steel prices are generally sensitive to changes in global and local demand, which are in turn governed by worldwide and country-specific economic conditions and available production capacity. Although the steel industry has been recovering since the 2008 recession, the recent Euro-zone sovereign debt crisis added to the still-tentative recovery in the developed world has again created a lot of uncertainty in the market. This has resulted in many countries suspending investment in infrastructure and other industries, impacting steel prices.Threat from substitutes: Steel has many substitutes like aluminum, cement, composites, glass, plastic and wood. A shift toward these or other substitutes, whether due to lower costs or government mandates on the basis of environmental or other reasons, would significantly impact prices and demand for steel products.Raw Material Trends
"
1083,NUE,"The primary inputs for the steel industry are iron ore and coking coal, along with coke, scrap, alloys and base metal. The industry also uses large volumes of natural gas, electricity and oxygen in its steel manufacturing operations.
"
1084,NUE,"Iron ore prices have remained relatively high in 2009, which continued in the first half of 2010. However, prices fell in the second half of 2010. In 2011, iron prices were up most of the year before prices fell in October.
"
1085,NUE,"The iron ore industry is highly concentrated with only three major players: Vale (VALE  -  Free Report), Rio Tinto (RTP) and BHP Billiton (BHP  -  Free Report) having significant pricing power. The risk lies in further consolidation among raw material suppliers.
"
1086,NUE,"In a recent development, VALE, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton will soon sign agreements to sell iron ore through China’s new spot trading platform. The platform will officially start operating in the first half of the year and has been set to strengthen pricing power and improve transparency.
"
1087,NUE,"China is the largest iron ore importer, and also has the world’s largest spot iron ore market. With the involvement of major foreign miners, the trading platform’s position can have more influence over the price of the raw material.Consolidation
"
1088,NUE,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have remained an important growth strategy in the steel industry. M&A activities prevent additional steel capacity, providing production efficiency and economies of scale. The biggest example is Mittal Steel’s acquisition of Arcelor in 2006. The Tata Steel and Corus merger in 2008 is another instance of industry consolidation.
"
1089,NUE,"After a lull during the global economic downturn of 2008-2009, M&A activity of various steel and mining players, including Chinese and Indian companies, has quickly picked up.
"
1090,NUE,"Consolidation has been primarily driven by the urge to increase global scale and operations, and access new markets. The industry is likely to see more M&A activity in the coming years as the industry players prepare themselves for a recovery in the long run. Further, steel makers are now focused on acquiring or are considering acquiring mines or stakes in mines to secure raw materials at more competitive prices.
"
1091,NUE,"Going forward, the abatement of the Euro-zone crisis, recovery in the US economy and developments in the Chinese real estate and construction sector will determine the fate of such deals.  However, given the prevailing uncertainty, we expect moderate growth in M&As.Challenges AheadOvercapacity: Even though demand has increased overall in the past two years, growth in steelmaking capacity is still ahead of demand and remains a significant challenge for the industry. This has further worsened by the European sovereign debt crisis which has put a bar on investments in large scale projects in Europe and reduced capital for growth.The uncertain global economy: The steel industry was significantly affected by the global economic crisis in 2008. Even though it is recovering, demand has still not reached pre-recession levels. The debt crisis in Europe remains a concern and the United States has had to resort to quantitative easing to thwart sluggish demand.
"
1092,NUE,"The saving grace is the spurt of growth witnessed in the developing economies that helped counter the sluggishness in the developed economies. Asia and particularly China continued to make up for the stalemate in Europe and North America.
"
1093,NUE,"Earlier this month, BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest miner, hinted at flattening iron ore demand as well as steel growth in China triggering concerns. However, the company believes the steel industry’s long-term story in the country remains intact, underpinned by China’s urbanization and industrialization programs. The company forecasts that the country's annual steel output will still rise by around 60% by 2025.
"
1094,NUE,"There are signs of cooling in China’s real estate sector, which accounts for almost half of the total steel demand in China. Earlier this month, China cut its 2012 growth target to an eight-year low of 7.5%.  A slowing Chinese economy will have a negative impact on infrastructure and construction spending and on the steel industry as well.Dependence of Margins on Raw Material Prices: The steel companies’ margins are dependent on the extent to which changes in raw material prices are passed through to steel selling prices. The time lag between the raw material price change and the steel selling price change, and the date of the raw material purchase and the actual sale of the steel product in which the raw material was used are also important factors affecting margins.To Sum Up
"
1095,NUE,"All said, we believe growth in the industry will be tempered by concerns regarding the continued financial uncertainty and volatility and the quintessential issue of overcapacity. Global steel demand will improve gradually in line with the recovery in the user industries, automotive and residential construction. While the automotive sector holds promise, we have yet to see a sustained recovery in the residential sector, to enforce a more positive outlook.
"
1096,NUE,"Emerging and developing economies will continue to drive growth while recovery of steel demand in the developed world will be slow. Despite concerns regarding a slowing economy, demand in China will grow in the long term given the vast capital outlay on infrastructural development. In this game, its neighbor India is not behind and will likely be a major consumer driving the steel industry.                    
"
1097,NUE,"About the Industry
"
1098,NUE,"The Metals & Mining industry encompasses the extraction (mining) as well as the primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals such as aluminum, gold, precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of the output.
"
1099,NUE,"The largest segment of the global metals market is iron and steel, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel segment comprises more than half the industry in terms of volume. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars.
"
1100,NUE,"The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls.Overall Industry Outlook
"
1101,NUE,"The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in London Metal Exchange (LME) prices, general economic conditions and end-use markets.
"
1102,NUE,"Profitability at the individual company level depends on volume and operating efficiency. Large producers with huge resources are able to discover and develop new deposits, thereby boosting reserves, while the smaller ones own fewer mines.
"
1103,NUE,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have historically been a critically important growth strategy for mining companies. The year 2009 experienced a lull in M&A activity under the impact of the global economic downturn and the focus shifted from business growth to business survival, as companies looked to safeguard their teetering balance sheets rather than seeking expansion.
"
1104,NUE,"However, reversing the trend, 2010 witnessed a surge in mining deals as the rise in commodity prices, economic recovery, demand in developing markets, growing scarcity of resources and refreshed balance sheets spurred merger activity.
"
1105,NUE,"2011 was a busy year in terms of M&A activity despite the European debt crisis, earthquake in Japan, social unrest in the Middle East, and downgrade of the U.S. government’s debt rating. We expect the momentum in M&A to sustain in 2012 as well. Armed with healthy balance sheets, reduced economic uncertainty and a pent-up demand for new projects, we expect the companies in the industry to accelerate deal activity with a re-focus on consolidation.
"
1106,NUE,"In an industry plagued with rising energy and raw material costs, increasing productivity and reducing costs are the keys to success. Given the cyclical nature of the metals industry, low-volume, high-cost producers need to generate sufficient cash or ensure a strong borrowing position during market peaks to survive the market troughs.
"
1107,NUE,"Continuing consolidation supports the sector’s ability to influence the price of input costs and companies can also obtain synergies and economies of scale through the operation of vertically integrated raw materials sources. Expansion in low-cost countries will ensure lower labor costs and also help tap their growth potential.
"
1108,NUE,"The Glencore-Xstrata merger currently in the offing is one of the biggest ever in the mining sector. If it materializes, it would result in a combined new business of $90 billion and will be the world's biggest exporter of coal for power plants and the largest producer of zinc. This will be the largest mining transaction in history, dwarfing the earlier major deals like Rio Tinto-Alcan in 2007 and Vale-Inco in 2006.
"
1109,NUE,"Demand in the metals and mining industry has benefitted from the strong growth in emerging markets. China and India in particular, are witnessing higher production and consumption of metals. Per capita consumption levels in both these countries are calibrating to U.S levels, which could, theoretically at least, double metal demand in the longer term.
"
1110,NUE,"China is the world’s largest consumer of metals and is expected to remain so in the future. Overall, we expect global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries.
"
1111,NUE,"Demand as well as production for industrial metals in Japan had been recently affected, as factories were shut down in the aftermath of the country’s strongest earthquake and tsunami. Japan is the biggest buyer of aluminum and the second largest buyer of copper ore.
"
1112,NUE,"We believe the industry will continue to benefit from the metal demand generated from the country’s rebuilding activity. Sovereign debt issues and sluggish growth in Europe however remain lingering concerns.A Detailed Look into Metals
"
1113,NUE,"Steel
"
1114,NUE,"As the major shareholder (about 60%) of the metals market, the steel industry was severely bruised by the global economic downturn. But the recovery has been swift and forceful. According to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production was a record 1,527 million tons (Mt) in 2011, outperforming the 2010 record of 1,414 Mt, a 6.8% jump.
"
1115,NUE,"China continues to retain its status as the largest steel producing country, yielding almost half of the global output at 46%, and growing 8.9% year over year. Japan, the second largest producer country, however posted a 1.8% decline due to the earthquake.  The United States remained in the third position, producing 86.2 Mt of crude steel, 7.1% higher than 2010 and comprising 6% of the total global output.
"
1116,NUE,"North America’s crude steel production was 118.9 Mt, an increase of 6.8% on 2010.  In Asia, overall growth was noted at 7.9% and Europe rose 4.6%. As per January figures, in the current fiscal, world crude steel production was 117 Mt, a 7.8% dip from January 2011 but flat with  December 2011 levels.
"
1117,NUE,"Reflecting on the 2011 results of the steel companies in our coverage - ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) and Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) -- revenues increased across the board due to higher average steel prices and increase in shipments.
"
1118,NUE,"ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel producing company, produced 91.9 million tons in fiscal 2011, representing 6% of the world's steel output. ArcelorMittal’s 2011 sales increased 10% to $94 billion and for AK Steel sales climbed 8% to $6.5 billion. Nucor recorded sales increase of 21% to reach $20 billion.
"
1119,NUE,"In terms of profitability, Nucor stood tall with its fiscal 2011 EPS of $2.45, almost six fold the 42 cents earned in 2010. ArcelorMittal’s EPS in fiscal 2011 plummeted 31% to $1.19. AK Steel reversed its year-ago loss to earn 9 cents (excluding special items) in 2011. U.S. Steel Corp (X  -  Free Report), though still in red, narrowed its fiscal 2011 loss per share to 47 cents from the year-ago loss of $3.36.
"
1120,NUE,"Currently, Nucor, United Steel and AK Steel retain a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) for the short term (1 to 3 months) that corresponds with our Neutral recommendations in the long term. ArcelorMittal retains a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) and we have recently downgraded our long-term recommendation from Neutral to Underperform.
"
1121,NUE,"The steel industry had been severely affected by the global economic crisis. However, there were signs of a turnaround from the second half of 2009 which continued into 2010 and 2011 at tandem with global economic activity. Demand for steel products nonetheless remains below pre-recession levels. We expect the recovery to be slow and steady in 2012.
"
1122,NUE,"The steel companies expect volumes to improve in 2012 on recovering demand from improving end-markets, backed by a recuperating global economy. They expect operating results to significantly improve from 2011 levels mainly driven by improved average realized prices and higher shipments. Steel consumption is expected to grow in the automotive, transportation, energy, industrial, and the agricultural sectors.
"
1123,NUE,"The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. The automotive sector is showing significant promise. In February 2012, total motor vehicle sales reached the highest level since February 2008 at 15.1 million SAAR (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate). For the first two months of 2012, sales have averaged 14.6 million SAAR, outperforming the Street expectations.
"
1124,NUE,"The construction sector has been a drag on the steel companies’ earnings. However, we see some early signs of recovery in non-residential construction.
"
1125,NUE,"According to the American Institute of Architects, the architecture billings index, an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine to twelve month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, was 50.9 in January 2012. The index has remained over 50 for the third consecutive month, a sure indicator of an overall rise in demand.
"
1126,NUE,"The optimism is seen across most regions of the country and the major construction sectors. However, given the continued uncertainty in the market, we expect soft to very moderate near-term growth in demand in this sector.
"
1127,NUE,"According to the data released by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, housing starts increased 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 699,000 in January 2012 from December 2011 and 9.9% above January 2011.
"
1128,NUE,"Building permits in January were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000, 0.7% above the December figure of 671,000 and 19% above the January 2011 number. These figures provide a glimmer of hope that U.S. residential construction is finally on a road to recovery.
"
1129,NUE,"Based on expected economic growth from developing countries like China, India and South Korea, steel prices will be pushed up higher in the future. However, the European debt crisis and its potential global impact remain an overhang on the steel industry.
"
1130,NUE,"Given the scenario in Europe, ArcelorMittal has idled 5 of its 25 blast furnaces in Europe. The company will continue to align its steel growth projects to match demand situations. Furthermore, the company’s focus on its mining business given its more attractive returns has resulted in some planned steel investments being deferred.Gold
"
1131,NUE,"As per the World Gold Council reports, 2011 was a milestone year for gold as global demand for the yellow metal grew 0.4% to 4,067.1 tons at an estimated value of $205.5 billion -- the highest tonnage level with a value exceeding $200 billion since 1997. The increase was mainly propelled by the investment sector, particularly in India, China and Europe.
"
1132,NUE,"Mine production increased 4% year over year to a record level of 2809.5 tons. However, there was a decline noted in recycling activity as consumers held on to their gold in the expectation of even higher prices. Central banks purchases rose significantly to 440 tons from 77 tons in the prior year reflecting the need to diversify assets, reduce reliance on one or two foreign currencies and rebalance reserves. Central banks have been net buyers for three straight years, the longest stretch since 1973.
"
1133,NUE,"Demand for gold bars and coins were robust due to the concerns raging in Europe, inflation in some countries and the unsatisfactory performance of a range of alternative instruments. The ongoing crisis in Europe has positively affected the demand for gold given the need for asset protection.
"
1134,NUE,"Jewelry demand was particularly strong in the first half of 2011 driven by the two major markets, China and India, due to the timing of local festivals. China and India remain the major consumers of gold, generating 55% of global jewelry demand and 49% of global demand. However, record prices in September combined with price volatility deviated customers towards other investment products.
"
1135,NUE,"On the whole, a 28% increase in average annual price led to an annual decline of 3% in tonnage demand in fiscal 2011. Notwithstanding this, annual demand was a record $99.2 billion.
"
1136,NUE,"Gold demand in the technology sector was at 463.5 tons worth $23.4 billion, a 28% increase year over year. Particular strength was noted in automotive electronics, industrial electronics and wireless equipment segments. However, the memory sector weakened considerably and is expected to remain so in 2012 as well. Severe flooding in Thailand which affected hard disk drive shipments, ongoing turmoil in Europe, and shift toward other non-precious metals also contributed to the weakness.
"
1137,NUE,"Gold prices in 2011 ranged from a low of $1,310 per ounce to a high of $1,895 per ounce. The record gold price of $1,895 per ounce was attained in September, 33% higher than the 2010 peak of $1,421 per ounce recorded in November 2010. Average gold price was $1,572 per ounce in 2011 compared with the prior year average of $1,223 per ounce.  
"
1138,NUE,"So far in 2012, gold has ranged from $1,598 per ounce to $1,781 per ounce, with an average of $1,698 per ounce. Continuing concerns about Europe's financial problems and China’s reduced economic growth forecast led to the climb. Given the performance in 2011, and thus far in 2012, we expect his year to be stellar for the yellow metal.
"
1139,NUE,"Gold remains a coveted asset given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries made gold an attractive and safe investment option. The European sovereign debt crisis made European investors use gold as a currency hedge. Pressure on the US dollar against various currencies coupled with higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, pushed up gold prices.
"
1140,NUE,"The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers. Jewelry and investment demand in non-western markets continues to rebound while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world gold production, should drive demand for gold along with China. China will likely emerge as the largest gold market in the world in 2012 and Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years.
"
1141,NUE,"Higher prices bode well for gold producers, which should benefit giants such as Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX), Agnico-Eagle (AEM  -  Free Report) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report). However, gold producers like Newmont Mining (NEM  -  Free Report) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and negate the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
1142,NUE,"Ironically, rallying gold prices are not having the same effect on the share prices of the gold companies. This is reflected in our overall long-term neutral view on the space. Investors prefer alternative financial products that allow them to invest in gold rather than investing in gold companies per se that are grappling with labor issues, escalating cost and other risks.
"
1143,NUE,"As the major economies continue to recover, investor confidence in the stock markets will be restored, causing gold prices to fall. In reality this is not going to happen anytime soon. The stocks of Barrick Gold, Newmont Mining, Goldcorp and Kinross Gold Corporation retain a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold). However, Agnico Eagle holds a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell).Aluminum
"
1144,NUE,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand forces along with other influences. The global economic downturn had a drastically negative impact on the aluminum industry, leading to an unprecedented decline in LME-based aluminum prices, weak end markets, fall in demand, increased global inventories, and higher costs of borrowing and diminished credit availability. The sector has however recovered from recessionary lows.Alcoa Inc. (AA), the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, in response to the global economic downturn implemented a number of operational and financial actions to improve its cost structure and liquidity, including curtailing production, halting non-critical capital expenditures, accelerating new sourcing strategies for raw materials, divesting non-core assets, reducing global headcount, suspending its share repurchase program, reducing its quarterly common stock dividend and resorting to other liquidity enhancements.
"
1145,NUE,"For fiscal 2011, Alcoa reported adjusted earnings of 72 cents per share, reversing the year-ago loss of 3 cents per share. The company anticipates that global aluminum demand will go up 7% and burgeoning demand for aluminum along with market-related production cutbacks will lead to a global aluminum industry deficit of 600,000 metric tons in 2012.
"
1146,NUE,"Aluminium demand started on a strong note in 2011 but weakened in the second half. Overall, aluminium demand grew 10% in the year after 13% growth witnessed in 2010. Overall, Alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum remain bright and envisions that global demand for aluminum will double by 2020.
"
1147,NUE,"Market conditions for aluminum products are expected to improve globally, particularly in aerospace (10–11%), driven by rising demand for large commercial aircraft. The strong performance at the automotive sector in the fourth quarter is expected to sustain in 2012, growing at en estimated clip of 3–5%. Commercial transportation is expected to grow 2–5%, packaging in the range of 2–3% and building and construction markets in the band of 4–5%.
"
1148,NUE,"Region-wise, in 2012, China is expected to lead the pack with a growth of 12% followed shortly by India with a 10% rise. Asia (excluding China) is expected to record a growth of 9% and North America 3%. Russia and Brazil are expected to increase 4% and 3%, respectively. Europe, besieged by sovereign debt problems, is expected to remain flat year over year.
"
1149,NUE,"Since the sudden decline from peak prices in mid-2008, aluminum prices have subsequently increased. In 2010, global aluminum prices rose 13%. However, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, aluminum prices plunged 27% from peak levels in April 2011. This was perpetrated by market concerns that the eurozone debt crisis could affect the global manufacturing industry and would lead to a huge downside in metals demand.
"
1150,NUE,"Consequently, profits for the mining companies took a blow compelling them to cut back on production. Rio Tinto announced plans to sell its aluminium assets and close its smelter in order to cut costs.
"
1151,NUE,"Alcoa plans to close or curtail 531,000 metric tons, or approximately 12% of its global smelting capacity, in the first half of 2012. This will lower the company’s cost position by 10 percentage points and improve its competitiveness. Energy prices and other input costs are expected to pose challenges for the aluminum industry. In addition to the curtailments, the company will step up actions to reduce the escalating cost of raw materials.
"
1152,NUE,"In the medium to long term, aluminum consumption will improve globally with revival palpable in the automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. Aluminum is widely used for packaging, beverage cans, food containers and foil products.
"
1153,NUE,"The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and the light weight of the metal. Further, the surge in copper price this year is triggering a switch among manufacturers to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting their focus on the more economical aluminum.
"
1154,NUE,"We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to see deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization.
"
1155,NUE,"Both these factors are positive for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China  should benefit from the improving demand outlook.
"
1156,NUE,"Currently, both Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China hold a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) supported by our long-term Neutral recommendation.Copper
"
1157,NUE,"Copper has become a major industrial metal given its properties of high ductility, malleability, and thermal and electrical conductivity, and its resistance to corrosion. In terms of consumption, it ranks third after iron and aluminum. Construction is the single largest market, followed by electronics and electronic products, transportation, industrial machinery, and consumer and general products.
"
1158,NUE,"Copper is an internationally traded commodity, and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – the London Metal Exchange (LME), New York Mercantile Exchange (COMEX) and Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE). Prices on these exchanges reflect the global balance of copper supply and demand, which can be volatile and cyclical.
"
1159,NUE,"Copper prices were at high levels from 2006 through most of 2008 as limited supplies, combined with growing demand from China and other emerging economies, resulted in high copper prices and low levels of inventories.
"
1160,NUE,"In December 2008 copper prices dipped to a low of $1.26 per pound due to reduced consumption, turbulence in the U.S. financial markets and concerns about the global economy. However, copper prices have since improved from the 2008 lows, thanks to strong demand from emerging markets and limited supply.
"
1161,NUE,"During the past three years, copper prices have fluctuated with LME spot copper prices ranging from $1.38 to $4.60 per pound. During 2011, LME spot copper prices ranged from $3.08 per pound to a record high of $4.60 per pound, with an average of $4.00 per pound. This rising trend has benefited copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO  -  Free Report).
"
1162,NUE,"Not denying volatility in prices, which would always be there, we have a bullish stance on copper prices, long term. Prices will be influenced by demand from China, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and copper smelters.
"
1163,NUE,"The outlook for the copper business remains positive, supported by widespread use of copper, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.
"
1164,NUE,"Freeport and Southern Copper retain a Zacks #3 Rank in agreement with our Neutral recommendation on the shares.                    
"
1165,NUE,"Overview
"
1166,NUE,"The World Steel industry is rather concentrated in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of sales.
"
1167,NUE,"Steel products are classified into four broad categories: flat steel products, long steel products, scrap and semi-finished products. Flat products include plates, hot-rolled strip and sheets and cold-rolled strip and sheets. The long steel product category comprises wire rods, beams, reinforced bars and merchant bars. The products under both these categories are rolled from steel slabs, which are considered as unfinished or semi-finished products that are generally not sold.
"
1168,NUE,"Historically, the automotive and construction markets have remained the largest consumers of steel, absorbing more than half of the total steel produced. Large automakers such as General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report) and Honda Motor Company (HMC  -  Free Report) depend upon the steel industry. Other steel consuming industries include appliances, agricultural implements, converters, containers, energy, electrical equipment and industrial machinery.Production
"
1169,NUE,"World crude steel production has continued to show a steady increase since April 2009 on the back of a moderate rise in demand and the resumption of work at idled facilities. China has emerged as a major producer and consumer of steel.
"
1170,NUE,"According to the World Steel Association (WSA), world crude steel production was 124 million metric tons (mmt) in September 2011, up 9.7% year over year. ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report) -- a leader in all major global carbon steel markets, including automotive, construction, household appliances and packaging, with leading R&D and technology -- produced 90.6 million tons of crude steel in 2010, representing approximately 6% of world steel output. In the first nine months of 2011, the company produced 70.2 million tons of crude steel.
"
1171,NUE,"In the first nine months of 2011, Asia produced 728.3 mmt of crude steel, an increase of 9.5% versus the year-ago period. The European Union (EU) produced 135.7 mmt of crude steel in the first three quarters of 2011, up by 4.3% compared with the corresponding three quarters in the previous year. North America’s crude steel production in the first nine months of 2011 was 89.3 mmt, 6.1% higher than the first nine months of 2010.
"
1172,NUE,"In the EU, Germany’s crude steel production for September 2011 was 3.7 mmt, an increase of 10.3% on September 2010. Italy produced 2.6 mmt of crude steel in September 2011, 11.5% higher than September 2010. France produced 1.3 mmt of crude steel in September 2011, up 4.2% compared to September 2010. China’s crude steel production for September 2011 was 56.7 mmt, an increase of 16.5% year over year.
"
1173,NUE,"Elsewhere in Asia, Japan produced 8.9 mmt of crude steel in September 2011, a decrease of 3.8% compared to the same month last year. South Korea’s crude steel production for September 2011 was 5.5 mmt, up 17.7% compared to September 2010.
"
1174,NUE,"The US produced 7.2 mmt of crude steel in September 2011, an increase of 8.9% compared to September 2010.
"
1175,NUE,"Turkey produced 3.0 mmt of crude steel in September 2011, 16.9% higher than September 2010.
"
1176,NUE,"Brazilian crude steel production for September 2011 was 2.8 mmt, 3.8% higher than September 2010.
"
1177,NUE,"The world crude steel capacity utilization ratio of the 64 countries in September 2011 rebounded slightly to 79.1%, 1.8 percentage points higher than in August 2011. Compared to September 2010, the utilization ratio in September 2011 increased by 3.5 percentage points.Growth Trends
"
1178,NUE,"With the global economy picking up in late 2009, the steel industry started seeing signs of improvement. However, given its economic sensitivity, we expect global steel demand to improve gradually, in line with the recovery in the user industries, especially automotive and residential construction.
"
1179,NUE,"According to World Steel Association, in the first half of 2011, the worldwide demand for steel has remained on the improving trend line. This is despite a series of anticipated and unanticipated negative developments: the ongoing euro area sovereign debt crisis, the earthquakes in Japan , the political/social unrest in some countries of the MENA region leading to the related surge in oil prices and the tightening of government monetary measures in many emerging economies.
"
1180,NUE,"Today the global economy is facing increased uncertainty over the ongoing turmoil in the financial markets and how it will affect the real economy. The WSA’s current forecast for 2012 assumes that developing economies continue to drive global growth and the policy response to the European sovereign debt crisis prevents increased volatility in the equity and financial markets.
"
1181,NUE,"WSA expects to see growth performance varying widely across regions. Not surprisingly, the recovery of steel demand in the developed world is expected to be slow, while most of the emerging and developing world should continue to enjoy robust growth in steel demand.
"
1182,NUE,"China’s apparent steel use in 2011 is expected to increase by 7.5% to 643.2 mmt following an 8.5% growth in 2010. In 2012, steel demand is expected to maintain a 6.0% growth, which will bring China’s apparent steel use to 681.6 mmt.
"
1183,NUE,"In 2011, India’s steel use is forecast to grow by 4.3% to reach 67.7 mmt due to economic growth. In 2012, the growth rate is forecast to accelerate to 7.9%.
"
1184,NUE,"Apparent steel use in the US is forecast to rebound strongly by 11.6% in 2011. In 2012, steel use in the US is expected to grow by 5.2% to 93.8 mmt, bringing it back to 87% of the 2007 level. For NAFTA as a whole, apparent steel use will grow by 9.0% and 4.9% in 2011 and 2012, respectively.
"
1185,NUE,"In Central and South America, apparent steel use is forecast to grow by 4.7% in 2011 to reach a historical high of 47.8 mmt. In 2012, the region’s apparent steel use is forecast to grow by 9.8% to reach 52.4 mmt, almost 28% higher than the 2007 level.
"
1186,NUE,"European countries continued to show divergent recovery paths in 2011. While steel demand in Germany and Poland are expected to grow at impressive rates, steel demand in Spain in contrast is expected to record a sluggish 1.7% recovery.
"
1187,NUE,"Overall, apparent steel use in the EU is projected to increase by 7.0% in 2011 to 155.0 mmt. In 2012, the growth of steel demand is expected to stall in most of the European countries with the notable exception of Poland, which is forecast to post an impressive 9.5% growth. Overall, apparent steel use in the EU is forecast to grow by 2.5% to around 158.9 mmt in 2012, bringing it back to only 80% of the 2007 peak.
"
1188,NUE,"Japan’s steel use is expected to decline by 2.7% to 61.8 mmt in 2011 due mainly to the disruptions caused by the earthquake. In 2012 apparent steel use in Japan is forecast to show a growth of 0.8% to reach 62.3 mmt, 77% of the 2007 level.
"
1189,NUE,"In the CIS, apparent steel use is forecast to grow by a strong 14.4% in 2011 and then by 7.5% in 2012. These projections will bring the region’s apparent steel use in 2012 to almost 60 mmt, a new high for the region.
"
1190,NUE,"Steel demand in the MENA region is expected to fall by 0.9% in 2011, mainly due to downward revisions from North African countries. However, boosted by high oil prices, steel use in the region is forecast to resume growth in 2012 at a rate of 8.7%. Given that the political situation in the region is far from settled, there exist considerable uncertainties about the current forecasts for this region.
"
1191,NUE,"As per WSA’s forecast by 2012, steel use in the developed world will still be at 15% below the 2007 level whereas in the emerging and developing economies, it will be 44% above. In 2012, the emerging and developing economies will account for 73% of world steel demand in contrast to 61% in 2007.
"
1192,NUE,"The steel industry has recorded high growth rates in both production and consumption over the past few years, benefiting from soaring steel demand in the automobile and construction sectors before the recession. Moreover, cost effective and highly efficient steel-making technologies have lifted the demand for US steel in the Middle Eastern and Asian countries.
"
1193,NUE,"Here, we will discuss the recent results of a few companies, whose results were aided by higher selling prices and increased shipments, and their growth expectations.
"
1194,NUE,"ArcelorMittal reported diluted net earnings of 19 cents per share in the third quarter of 2011, much below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents and last year’s 89 cents per share. Total steel shipments in the third quarter of 2011 were 21.1 million metric tons compared with 20.5 million metric tons in the year-ago quarter.
"
1195,NUE,"Quarterly revenues increased 22.6% year over year to $24.2 billion from $19.7 billion in the year-ago quarter and decreased 3.6% sequentially from $25.1 billion. Sales were down sequentially primarily due to lower average steel selling prices (-1.7%) and lower volume of shipments (-4.9%).
"
1196,NUE,"The company’s EBITDA in the second half of 2011 is expected to exceed the level achieved in the comparable period of 2010. The company expects shipments in fourth quarter 2011 to be lower sequentially, reflecting economic uncertainties leading to customers adopting a “wait and see” approach.
"
1197,NUE,"Higher iron ore and coal volumes will continue to be a positive underlying driver. The company’s iron ore and coal production is expected to increase by 10% and 20% respectively, by the end of 2011 as compared with 2010.
"
1198,NUE,"In light of the recent market uncertainty, the company is focusing on core growth capital expenditure. This will result in postponement of some planned steel investments. Accordingly, full-year 2011 capital expenditure is expected to be below the previously targeted level of $5.5 billion. Our long-term recommendation on ArcelorMittal remains Outperform, though it has a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold).
"
1199,NUE,"The commercial metals company AK Steel Holding (AKS  -  Free Report) posted its third-quarter 2011 results, delivering a net loss of $3.5 million or $0.03 cents compared with a net loss of $59.2 million or $0.54 cents during the year-ago quarter. However, results were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.00 cents per share.
"
1200,NUE,"Net sales, as reported by the company, were $1,585.8 million on the shipments of 1,368,800 tons versus $1,575.9 million and 1,465,800 tons in the prior-year quarter. Net sales also missed the Zacks Estimate of $1,662 million. Average selling price for the third quarter of 2011 was $1,158 per ton, up 8% year over year, but down 2% sequentially.
"
1201,NUE,"Value-added shipments for stainless/electrical increased to 229.3 tons compared with 226.9 tons in the prior-year quarter. Value-added shipments for Coated, Cold-rolled and Tubular product decreased to 577.2, 278.3 and 32.4 tons, respectively, compared with 624.4, 322.5 and 33.2 tons, respectively, in the year-earlier quarter.
"
1202,NUE,"Non-value-added shipments including Hot-rolled increased to 222.6 tons from 213.6 tons in the year-earlier quarter. Non-value-added shipments including secondary products decreased to 29.0 tons from 45.2 tons in the prior-year quarter. AK Steel currently retains a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold rating). Our long-term recommendation also remains Neutral.Allegheny Technologies Inc. (ATI  -  Free Report) also earned $70.6 million or 63 cents per share (excluding acquisition related expenses of $8.3 million, net of tax) in the third quarter of 2011 up from $1.0 million or 1 cent in the same quarter of 2010. Results exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents.
"
1203,NUE,"Sales in the quarter increased 28% to $1.35 billion, driven by higher shipments for most high-value products, higher raw material surcharges and increases in average base selling prices for many products. However, sales were lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39 billion.
"
1204,NUE,"Segment operating profit surged 157% to $161.8 million, or 12.0% of sales, from $63.0 million, or 6.0% of sales, in the third quarter of 2010.
"
1205,NUE,"Allegheny expects to continue to benefit from its new alloys and products, diversified global growth markets and differentiated product mix over the next 3 to 5 years. Demand is expected to be strong for its mill products and highly engineered forged and cast components from the aerospace market.
"
1206,NUE,"Strong growth is also expected from the oil and gas/chemical process industry for its titanium-based alloys, nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys, and tungsten products. We currently have a Neutral long-term recommendation on the stock, which is the same as reflected in the Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) rating.Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) reported net earnings of $181.5 million, or 57 cents per diluted share (excluding special items) in the third quarter of 2011, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents per share. This was a significant increase from $23.5 million, or 7 cents per diluted share (excluding special items) reported in the year-ago quarter. Nucor’s third-quarter earnings exceeded those of last year's quarter, but they declined from the second quarter of this year on lower steel prices and significantly lower metal margins.
"
1207,NUE,"Consolidated sales surged 27% year over year to $5.25 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.86 billion. The growth was attributable to an increase of 24% in average price per ton and a rise of 3% in shipments (to 5.8 million tons) to outside customers. The company’s end-markets such as automotive, heavy equipment, energy and general manufacturing demonstrated strength compared to 2010 but showed very little improvement compared with the first half of 2011.
"
1208,NUE,"Steel mill shipments grew 9% to 4.2 million tons during the quarter. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton accelerated 27% to $449.
"
1209,NUE,"Although Nucor expects to see only slight improvement in demand in its non-residential construction markets through the end of 2011, it remains optimistic about its combined construction businesses (steel mills and downstream facilities) and anticipates that it will continue to operate profitably.
"
1210,NUE,"Nucor expects fourth-quarter earnings to be below its third-quarter level. The company expects margin compression in the sheet market in the fourth quarter of 2011. Furthermore, the company forecasts a smaller compression in plate margins due to imports. The magnitude of margin compression will be favorably impacted by expected lower scrap costs through the quarter.
"
1211,NUE,"The company has a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) Rank on its stock.Industry Capacity
"
1212,NUE,"The global steel industry is capital intensive, cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity. Capacity utilization rates were, however, low (around 60%) at the beginning of 2009, in response to the much softer demand. With steel demand picking up in the latter half of the year, the world crude steel capacity utilization ratio in January 2011 was 75.6%, up from 73.3% in December 2010.
"
1213,NUE,"Steel makers continue to add capacity besides resuming operations at the idled facilities, inspired by the expected rebound in steel industry in the longer term.Price Trends
"
1214,NUE,"The steel industry has long witnessed volatility in prices with a large spot market. Steel prices rose steadily for most of 2008, after which there was a downtrend. Lower prices had an adverse effect on steel producers, who recorded lower revenues and margins, and had to write down finished steel and raw material inventories.
"
1215,NUE,"The period witnessed major steel producers slashing production to minimize inventory accumulation. U.S. Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report), the eleventh-largest steel producer worldwide, slashed production by almost 62% during the second quarter of 2009, while Korean steel maker POSCO  cut production by about 15%. This was the first time in its history that POSCO was forced to adopt such a measure, which is a proof of the adverse operating environment.
"
1216,NUE,"Steel prices globally have fallen from highs marked earlier this year in 2011 as the industry hasn't shaken off a pronounced slowdown in purchasing and demand since mid-year. A weakening in orders and buying sentiment first took hold this year in Europe, before spreading to North America and Asia.
"
1217,NUE,"Although steel prices have been stabilizing since the latter part of 2009, they are significantly below the pre-crisis level. We believe that a sustained recovery in steel prices remains uncertain in the backdrop of sluggish economic activity.Factors Affecting Steel PricesChinese Imports: The steel industry is also affected by fluctuations in steel imports–exports and tariffs. China is the largest steel producer globally, and balances its domestic production and consumption, which is an important factor in global steel prices.
"
1218,NUE,"Consumers in the U.S. are importing cheaper steel from China, which is forcing domestic steel producers to sell at lower prices, and even at a loss, sometimes. To this end, the U.S. government has been imposing anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel imports.Economic Sustainability: Concerns about the sustainability of economic recovery and queries regarding China’s growth momentum come into play in the pricing equation. This relatively uncertain Chinese outlook, coupled with a still tentative recovery in the developed world, is expected to weigh on prices.Threat from substitutes: Steel has many substitutes like aluminum, which replaces it in the automotive markets. Cement, composites, glass, plastic and wood are also used as steel substitutes. This significantly influences market prices and demand for steel products.Raw Material Trends
"
1219,NUE,"The key input for steel production is iron ore. Apart from this, coking coal and coke, scrap, electricity and natural gas are also used as inputs in steel production. The raw materials industry is highly concentrated with only three major players -- Vale (VALE  -  Free Report), Rio Tinto (RTP) and BHP Billiton (BHP  -  Free Report) -- having significant pricing power. The risk lies in further consolidation among raw material suppliers. For instance, the announced iron ore joint venture between mining companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto would further increase the pricing power of both the suppliers.
"
1220,NUE,"Steel makers would face higher production costs if suppliers shift to sales based on spot prices from the long-term fixed price contract system, as spot prices for most of the raw materials, especially iron ore, remained high from 2006 through 2008.
"
1221,NUE,"Iron ore prices have remained volatile during most of 2010 and are expected to rise sharply in 2011. ArcelorMittal’s iron ore and coal mining projects have been a key focus in the recent years and this focus is only expected to intensify in the medium term, as the company has a goal to secure 100 million tons of iron ore supply from its own mines and under strategic long-term supply contracts on a cost-plus basis.Consolidation
"
1222,NUE,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have remained an important growth strategy in the steel industry. M&A activities prevent additional steel capacity, providing production efficiency and economies of scale. The biggest example is Mittal Steel’s acquisition of Arcelor in 2006. The Tata Steel and Corus merger in 2008 is another instance of industry consolidation.
"
1223,NUE,"Consolidation has been primarily driven by the urge to increase global scale and operations, and access new markets. The industry is likely to see more M&A activity in the coming years as the industry players prepare themselves for a recovery in the long run.Zacks Recommendation
"
1224,NUE,"Prospects for 2012 have remained mildly positive despite high levels of uncertainty surrounding the outlook for end-users in the EU. Activity in the manufacturing sectors and in construction will continue to grow, albeit in the case of the manufacturing industry at a significantly slower pace than in 2010 and 2011.
"
1225,NUE,"Particularly in the first half of 2012, real steel consumption is forecast to grow only modestly. From mid-2012 onwards improving end-user fundamentals should result in a modest acceleration in consumption growth.
"
1226,NUE,"In China, the government’s expansionary economic policies, easy credit and construction initiatives have thus far sustained demand. But with China attempting to rein in its overheated property sector and engineer a soft landing for its economy, steel demand will most likely soften noticeably in the coming months. This relatively uncertain Chinese outlook, coupled with a still tentative recovery in the developed world, is expected to weigh on prices.
"
1227,NUE,"In the short term, we are neutral on steel manufacturers like AK Steel (AKS  -  Free Report), U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) and Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report).
"
1228,NUE,"AK Steel’s cost structure is higher than its peer group due to a greater reliance on external supply of raw materials such as carbon scrap, purchased slabs, iron ore and purchased coke. Iron ore is the key raw material in steel manufacturing operations.
"
1229,NUE,"However, industry giants with integrated business models like U.S. Steel and ArcelorMittal have an edge over their peers. Both steel makers have substantial captive sources of iron ore and coal and source about 75%–80% of their coke and iron ore requirements from owned and/or operated facilities.                    
"
1230,NUE,"Overview
"
1231,NUE,"The Metals & Mining industry encompasses the extraction (mining) as well as the primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals such as aluminum, gold, precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of the output.
"
1232,NUE,"The largest segment of the global metals market is iron and steel, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel segment comprises more than half the industry in terms of volume. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars.
"
1233,NUE,"The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls.
"
1234,NUE,"Historically, the automotive and construction markets have been the largest consumers of metals, accounting for more than 50% of total demand. Other metal consumers include energy, electrical equipment, agricultural, domestic and commercial equipment and industrial machinery. Large automakers such as General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report), Toyota Motor Corp (TM  -  Free Report) and Honda Motor Co. Ltd (HMC  -  Free Report) are big consumers of metals, chiefly of steel and aluminum.Overall Outlook
"
1235,NUE,"The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in London Metal Exchange prices, general economic conditions and end-use markets. Individual company profitability depends on volume and operating efficiency. Large producers with huge resources are able to discover and develop new deposits, thereby boosting reserves, while the smaller ones devote their attention own fewer mines.
"
1236,NUE,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have historically been a critically important growth strategy for mining companies. 2009 experienced a lull in M&A activity under the impact of the global economic downturn with deal value almost halving compared with 2008. The focus for M&A activity shifted from business growth to business survival, as companies looked to safeguard their teetering balance sheets rather than seeking expansion.
"
1237,NUE,"However, reversing the trend, 2010 witnessed a surge in mining deals as the rise in commodity prices, economic recovery, demand in developing markets, growing scarcity of resources and refreshed balance sheets spurred merger activity.
"
1238,NUE,"We expect the momentum in M&A to be maintained in 2011. Armed with healthy balance sheets and with reduced economic uncertainty, we expect the companies in the industry to accelerate deal activity with renewed focus on consolidation. This would ensure raw materials supply and expand the frontiers of such mining companies into growth markets.
"
1239,NUE,"In an industry plagued with rising energy and raw material costs, increasing productivity and reducing costs are the keys to success. Given the cyclical nature of the metals industry, low-volume, high-cost producers need to generate sufficient cash or ensure a strong borrowing position during market peaks to survive the market troughs.
"
1240,NUE,"Continuing consolidation supports the sector’s ability to influence the price of input costs and companies can also obtain synergies and economies of scale through the operation of vertically integrated raw materials sources. Expansion in low-cost countries will ensure lower labor costs and also help tap their growth potential.
"
1241,NUE,"Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region, in particular China and India, is witnessing higher production and consumption of metals. Per capita consumption levels in both these countries are calibrating to U.S./European levels, which could, theoretically at least, double metal demand in the longer term. China is the world’s largest consumer of metals and is expected to remain so. Further, developed regions such as the US and Europe are showing signs of recovery. Overall, we expect global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries.
"
1242,NUE,"Demand as well as production for industrial metals in Japan has been recently affected as factories have been shut down in the aftermath of the country’s earthquake and Tsunami. Japan is the biggest buyer of aluminum and the second largest buyer of copper ore. We, however, believe that metal demand will be boosted by the construction industry triggered by the country’s reconstruction efforts.A Detailed Look into Metals
"
1243,NUE,"Steel
"
1244,NUE,"As the major shareholder (about 60%) of the metals market, the steel industry was severely bruised by the global economic downturn. However, according to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production in 2010 reached a record 1,414 million metric tons (mmt), a 15% increase compared with 2009. All the major steel-producing countries and regions showed double-digit growth in 2010.
"
1245,NUE,"The U.S. produced 80.6 mmt of crude steel, 38.5% higher than 2009. U.S’s share of world steel production improved to 5.7% from 4.7% in 2009 catapulting the country to the third position in 2010 from the 5th rank in 2009. The growth trend continues in January 2011 with world crude steel production increasing 5.3% to 119 mmt from January 2010 levels. United States crude steel production rose smartly by 9.4% to 6.8 mmt compared with January 2010.
"
1246,NUE,"Reflecting on 2010 data, we see a sharp increase in revenues and shipments across most companies. Sales of ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), the world’s largest steel-producing company, increased 28% to $78 billion and a 22% jump in steel shipments. Sales for United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report) soared 57% to $17.4 billion and steel shipments went up 49% to 22 million tons. Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) recorded sales increase of 42% to reach $15.8 billion with shipments increasing 25%. Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) reported a 59% increase in revenues to generate $6 billion with shipments rising 33% to 5.3 million tons.
"
1247,NUE,"In terms of profitability, ArcelorMittal stood tall with its fiscal 2010 EPS of $1.93, a substantial improvement over 11 cents in 2009. Nucor and Steel Dynamics reversed their year-ago losses to earn a respective 42 cents and 64 cents per share. United States Steel, though remaining in the loss territory, narrowed its fiscal 2010 loss per share to $3.36 from the year-ago loss of $10.42.
"
1248,NUE,"The steel industry is emerging from the gloom of the global recession as is evident from the above figures. However, given its economic sensitivity, we expect global steel demand to improve only gradually, in line with the recovery in the user industries, especially automotive and residential construction.
"
1249,NUE,"Although steel prices have been stabilizing since the latter part of 2009, it is significantly below the pre-crisis level. We believe that a sustained recovery in steel prices remains uncertain in the backdrop of sluggish economic activity.
"
1250,NUE,"Currently, Steel Dynamics has a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) for the short-term (1 to 3 months) while U.S. Steel holds a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy). ArcelorMittal currently retains a Zacks Rank #3 Rank (Hold). We maintain our Neutral recommendation in the long term for ArcelorMittal and United Steel while we have recently upgraded our long-term recommendation on Nucor from Neutral to Outperform, given its upbeat first quarter guidance.
"
1251,NUE,"Gold
"
1252,NUE,"As per the World Gold Council, gold prices rose for the tenth consecutive year in 2010, ascribed to recovery in key sectors of demand and continued global economic uncertainty. In 2010, gold prices jumped 29%, reaching $1,405 per ounce as of December's end.
"
1253,NUE,"During 2010, the price of gold rose to record levels on several occasions, trading as high as $1,420 per ounce. Gold’s performance was strong and volatility remained low. The World Gold Council suggests that the increase was not only driven by driven by inflationary forces but was also inflated as both the private and public sectors of India and China rushed into the gold market.
"
1254,NUE,"Gold demand went up 9% over 2009, showcasing a 10-year high of 3,912.2 tons, driven by the rise in jewelry demand, the revival of the Indian market and strong momentum in Chinese gold demand. Moreover, central banks became net purchasers of gold for the first time in 21 years, hiking the demand for the yellow metal.
"
1255,NUE,"Major demand came from India and China. India bought 746 tons, a 69% increase over 2009, and China bought 400 tons of gold of jewelry. China bought 179.9 tons of gold in the form of bars and coin, a 70% increase over 2009.
"
1256,NUE,"Gold remained a coveted asset given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries made gold an attractive and safe investment option. The European sovereign debt crisis made European investors use gold as a currency hedge. Pressure on the US dollar against various currencies coupled with higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, also pushed up gold prices.
"
1257,NUE,"The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers. Jewelry and investment demand in non-Western markets continues to rebound while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world gold production, should drive demand for gold along with China. Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years.
"
1258,NUE,"Even though gold price dropped 7% in January this year, it again recorded a rise in February. We believe gold demand and prices will strengthen in 2011. As China and India continue to grow rapidly, their demand for gold will also rise in tandem.
"
1259,NUE,"Higher prices bode well for gold producers, which should benefit giants such as Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX  -  Free Report), Agnico-Eagle (AEM  -  Free Report) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG). However, gold producers like Newmont Mining (NEM) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and offset the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
1260,NUE,"Overall, the stock prices of gold producers are not expected to benefit much from this favorable commodity-price backdrop. This is reflected in our overall long-term neutral view on the space. As major economies continue to recover, investors’ confidence will be restored to invest in stock markets, which could cause gold prices to fall. However this is not going to happen in the near future. We have a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) on Barrick Gold, Agnico-Eagle, Goldcorp and Kinross Gold Corporation. However, Newmont Mining has a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell).Aluminum
"
1261,NUE,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand forces along with other influences. The global economic downturn had a historic, negative impact on the aluminum industry, leading to an unprecedented decline in LME-based aluminum prices, weak end markets, fall in demand, increased global inventories, and higher costs of borrowing and diminished credit availability. The economy has however recovered from the crisis of the economic downturn.Alcoa Inc. (AA), the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, in response to the global economic downturn implemented a number of operational and financial actions to improve its cost structure and liquidity, including curtailing production, halting non-critical capital expenditures, accelerating new sourcing strategies for raw materials, divesting non-core assets, reducing global headcount, suspending its share repurchase program, reducing its quarterly common stock dividend and resorting to other liquidity enhancements.
"
1262,NUE,"In the first half of 2011, Alcoa plans to restart certain idled potlines at three smelters. These restarts are expected to increase Alcoa’s aluminum production by 137 kmt during 2011 and by 204 kmt on an annual basis thereafter. Such measures are surely to meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand.
"
1263,NUE,"Alcoa expects demand for aluminum to grow 12% this year. China, India, Brazil and Russia are all expected to register double-digit increases in aluminum demand. Market conditions for aluminum products in all global markets are expected to improve, particularly in aerospace, automotive and industrial gas turbine. On the cost side, however, energy prices and currency movements are expected to keep posting challenges. Overall, Alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum remain bright and envisions that global demand for aluminum will double by 2020.
"
1264,NUE,"Since the sudden decline from peak prices in mid-2008, aluminum prices have increased over the last 2 years. In 2010, global aluminum prices have increased 13%. Alcoa increased its fiscal 2010 profit on the back of higher prices and continued strengthening in most end markets. Aluminum Corporation of China, or Chalco (ACH) swung back to profit in 2010 after posting a loss in 2009, attributable to increased global aluminum prices.
"
1265,NUE,"In the medium-to-long term, aluminum consumption will improve globally with improving automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. Aluminum is widely used for packaging, beverage cans, food containers and foil products. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and the light weight of the metal.
"
1266,NUE,"Further, the surge in copper price this year is triggering a switch among manufacturers aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting toward the much economical aluminum.
"
1267,NUE,"We expect aluminum demand to increase in the long term, outstripping supply growth with the improving end-markets. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization. Both these factors are positive for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa, Paramount Gold and Silver Corporation (PZG) and Aluminum Corporation of China should benefit from the improving demand outlook.
"
1268,NUE,"Currently, Alcoa, Paramount Gold and Silver all hold a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) supported by our long-term Neutral recommendation.Copper
"
1269,NUE,"Copper prices have shown a rising trend in 2010 benefitting copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO). Although copper demand was down 10% year over year in 2009, global copper demand is seen to be growing again.
"
1270,NUE,"Chinese demand for copper was still robust and imports of the metal were rebounding, which was supported by steady construction and infrastructure activity in the country. The improvement in copper prices would be supported by limited supply and increased demand from China.
"
1271,NUE,"With copper prices at near all-time highs, outlook for copper prices is still strong. Not denying volatility in prices that are bound to remain, we have a bullish stance on copper prices, long term. However, as discussed earlier, manufacturers might now resort to aluminum as a substitute. Market conditions are expected to be positive for copper in the next couple of years due to higher consumption of the metal in the developing nations. Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.
"
1272,NUE,"We currently have a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) and long-term Neutral recommendation on both Freeport and Southern Copper.                    
"
1273,NUE,"The U.S. houses one of the world's largest steel industries. It is rather concentrated in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of sales. ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report) is the world’s largest steel company, with crude steel production of 73.2 million tons in 2009, representing about 6% of the global steel output.
"
1274,NUE,"Steel products are classified into four broad categories: flat steel products, long steel products, scrap and semi-finished products. Flat products include plates, hot-rolled strip and sheets, and cold-rolled strip and sheets. The long steel product category comprises wire rods, beams, reinforced bars and merchant bars. The products under both these categories are rolled from steel slabs, which are considered as unfinished or semi-finished products that are generally not sold.
"
1275,NUE,"Historically, the automotive and construction markets have remained the largest consumers of steel, absorbing more than half of the total steel produced. Large automakers such as General Motors (MTLQQ), Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report) and Honda Motor Company (HMC  -  Free Report) depend upon the steel industry. Other steel consuming industries include appliances, agricultural implements, converters, containers, energy, electrical equipment and industrial machinery.Growth Trends
"
1276,NUE,"Accelerating demand in the automobile and construction markets triggered production growth in the steel industry before the recession hit. However, the global economic turmoil that started at the end of 2008 and continued through much of 2009 severely impacted both these markets, with the demand for steel nose-diving as a consequence. Steel manufacturers saw inventories soaring and scrambled to cut production.
"
1277,NUE,"With the global economy picking up in late 2009, the steel industry started seeing signs of improvement. However, given its economic sensitivity, we expect global steel demand to improve only gradually, in line with the recovery in the user industries, especially automotive and residential construction. According to World Steel Association (“worldsteel), steel demand in the U.S. was down 41.6% in 2009 at 57.4 million tons. However, with the economy in recovery mode, the industrial sector is expected to drive a 26.5% increase in steel demand in the U.S. in 2010 and a further 7.5% in 2011 to 78.1 million tons.
"
1278,NUE,"The emerging economies reflected growth trends throughout the recession and are expected to continue to drive steel demand, going forward. Worldsteel expects steel demand in India to grow 13.9% and 13.7% in 2010 and 2011, respectively, following a growth of 7.7% in 2009. The European Union experienced a 35.2% decline in steel demand in 2009. Spain and Italy saw a significant fall in steel production with the breakdown of their construction market.
"
1279,NUE,"According to the association, in 2010 the European region will see an increase of 13.7% in steel demand, driven by the restocking of inventory. Japan would see steel demand rising 10.3% in 2010 after a 31.7% fall in 2009.
"
1280,NUE,"However, worldsteel expects Chinese steel consumption to increase by a modest 6.7% to 579 million tons in 2010, after an impressive 24.8% increase in 2009. Expansionary Chinese economic policies, easy credit and construction initiatives have thus far sustained demand. But with China attempting to rein in its overheated property sector and engineer a soft landing for its economy, steel demand will most likely soften noticeably in the coming months.
"
1281,NUE,"Globally, worldsteel anticipates steel demand to rise 10.7% to 1,241 million tons in 2010 in contrast to last year’s decline of 6.7%. For 2011, worldsteel expects global steel requirement to inch up 5.3% to 1,306 million tons.Production Scenario
"
1282,NUE,"The year 2010 started well for the steel industry, with improving demand conditions in several end markets, leading to a steady rise in steel production worldwide. All major steel-producing countries -- Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, Russia, Turkey, the U.S. and Ukraine -- have recorded healthy production so far this year. According to worldsteel, North American steel output jumped 50.3% year over year to 74.8 million tons in the first 8 months of 2010. However, it is still lagging the 19.4% growth rate seen in 2008.
"
1283,NUE,"In the European Union, steel production shot up 37.5% to 115.6 million tons in the first 8 months of 2010 while production in Asia climbed 17.8% to 592.7 million tons. Of this, China experienced a 15.3% production growth to 425.7 million tons while Japanese production leapt 38.1% to 72.7 million tons over the first 8 months. Over the same period, steel production in Brazil soared 40.5% to 22.1 million tons and that in Russia jumped 15.4% to 43.8 million tons. In Ukraine, steel production moved up 11.7% to 21.2 million tons.Industry Capacity
"
1284,NUE,"The global steel industry is capital intensive, cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity. Capacity utilization rates were, however, low (around 60%) at the beginning of 2009, in response to the much softer demand. With steel demand picking up in the latter half of the year, capacity utilization rates increased to above 70%. Utilization rates continued to increase in the first half of 2010, averaging at over 80%. The capacity utilization rate has, however, come down to around 70% again since then.
"
1285,NUE,"Steel makers continue to add capacity besides resuming operations at the idled facilities, inspired by the expected rebound in steel industry in the longer term.Price Trends
"
1286,NUE,"The steel industry has long witnessed volatility in prices with a large spot market. Steel prices rose steadily for most of 2008, after which there was a downtrend. Lower prices had an adverse effect on steel producers, who recorded lower revenues and margins, and had to write down finished steel and raw material inventories.
"
1287,NUE,"The period witnessed major steel producers slashing production to minimize inventory accumulation. U.S. Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report), the fifth-largest steel producer worldwide, cut down production by almost 62% during the second quarter of 2009, while Korean steel maker POSCO (PKX) cut production by about 15%. This was the first time in its history that POSCO was forced to adopt such a measure, proof of the very adverse operating environment.
"
1288,NUE,"Although steel prices have been stabilizing since the latter part of 2009, it is significantly below the pre-crisis level. We believe that a sustained recovery in steel prices remains uncertain in the backdrop of sluggish economic activity.Factors Affecting Steel PricesChinese Imports: The steel industry is also affected by fluctuations in steel import–export and tariffs. China is the largest steel producer globally, with the balance between its domestic production and consumption being an important factor in global steel prices. Consumers in the U.S. are importing cheaper steel from China, which is forcing domestic steel producers to sell at lower prices, and even at a loss, sometimes. To this end, the U.S. government has been imposing anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel imports.
"
1289,NUE,"Concerns about the sustainability of economic recovery and question marks about China’s growth momentum come into play in the pricing equation. This relatively uncertain China outlook, coupled with a still tentative recovery in the developed world, is expected to weigh on prices.Threat from substitutes: Steel has many substitutes like aluminum, which replaces it in the automotive markets. Cement, composites, glass, plastic and wood are also used as steel substitutes. This significantly influences market prices and demand for steel products.Raw Material Trends
"
1290,NUE,"The key input for steel production is iron ore. Apart from this, coking coal and coke, scrap, electricity and natural gas are also used as inputs in steel production. The raw materials industry is highly concentrated with only three major players -- Vale (VALE  -  Free Report), Rio Tinto (RTP) and BHP Billiton (BHP  -  Free Report) – having significant pricing power. The risk lies in consolidation among raw material suppliers. For instance, the announced iron ore joint venture between mining companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto would further increase the pricing power of both the suppliers.
"
1291,NUE,"Steel makers would face higher production costs if suppliers shift to sales based on spot prices from the long-term fixed price contract system, as spot prices for most of the raw materials, especially iron ore, remained high from 2006 through 2008. In 2009, iron ore prices, which are linked with the London Metal Exchange prices, were about 28% to 33% below the benchmark prices.
"
1292,NUE,"Iron ore prices have remained volatile during most of 2010 and are expected to rise sharply in 2011. AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) expects a 65% rise in benchmark iron ore prices in the near term. The company assumes reduction of its earnings by $11 million or $7 per ton for each 5% increase in iron ore prices. The prices of coking coal, zinc and nickel, as well as scrap, have followed a similar trend.Consolidation
"
1293,NUE,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have remained an important business strategy in the steel industry. M&A activities prevent additional steel capacity, providing production efficiency and economies of scale. The biggest example is Mittal Steel’s acquisition of Arcelor in 2006 and their merger in 2007. The Tata Steel and Corus merger in 2008 is another good instance of industry consolidation. The industry is likely to see more M&A activity in the coming years as the industry players prepare themselves for a recovery in the long run.
"
1294,NUE,"Zacks Recommendation
"
1295,NUE,"Iron ore pricing concerns have led to a negative outlook for steel manufacturers. Revenues and average selling prices are lower, as the U.S. and global markets are in a gradual recovery. In the short term, we are negative on steel manufacturers like AK Steel Holding Corporation, Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI  -  Free Report).
"
1296,NUE,"AK Steel’s cost structure is higher than its peer group due to a greater reliance on an external supply of raw materials such as carbon scrap, purchased slabs, iron ore and purchased coke. Iron ore is the key raw material in steel manufacturing operations. The company expects to purchase about 6 million tons of iron ore pellets in 2010.
"
1297,NUE,"One of the largest and most diversified producers of specialty materials in the world, Allegheny Technologies has forecasted operating losses in the near-term. Allegheny has been battling cost-pressures associated with high raw material costs. For Allegheny, a hypothetical $1.00 per mmbtu increase in the price of natural gas would result in increased annual energy costs of about $10 to $12 million.
"
1298,NUE,"Costs of scrap and oil are also rising significantly. A change of $1.00 per pound in nickel prices would result in increased costs of about $80 million, while a hike of $0.01 per pound of ferrous scrap would result in increased costs of approximately $5 million.
"
1299,NUE,"We remain strongly negative on Steel Dynamics, the third-largest steel maker in the U.S., who is operating its structural steel mills at less than 40% of its total capacity due to uncertain demand conditions.
"
1300,NUE,"However, industry giants with integrated business models like U.S. Steel Corp and ArcelorMittal have an edge over their peers. Both steel makers have substantial captive sources of iron ore and coal and source about 75%–80% of their coke and iron ore requirements from owned and/or operated facilities. U.S. Steel Corp returned to profitability in the second quarter of 2010 on improving business conditions.
"
1301,NUE,"Similarly, earnings of Nucor Corporation, the largest recycler of steel scrap in the U.S. , broke out from the loss territory in the last quarter of 2009. We expect Nucor to exhibit strong profitability driven by long-term contracts, cost reduction efforts and a dominant acquisition strategy.
"
1302,NUE,"Collectively, ArcelorMittal, AK Steel, Allegheny Technologies, United States Steel Corporation and Nucor Corporation carry long-term Neutral recommendations, while Steel Dynamics has a long-term Underperform recommendation.
"
1303,NUE,"Imports of cheap steel continue to make inroads into the American market despite a raft of stringent trade actions and threats of further future measures. Steel imports have spiked roughly 18% year to date – according to a recent report from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), an association of North American steel makers.    Per AISI, based on preliminary U.S. Census Bureau data, total U.S. steel imports went up 17.5% year over year to roughly 35.6 million net tons through the first eleven months of 2017. Finished steel imports for the same period also increased 14.3% to around 27.6 million net tons. Year to date, finished steel import market share is estimated at 27%, which is still higher than 26% clocked in full-year 2016.Major finished steel products that have showed a significant year-to-date increase in imports on a year-over-year basis include oil country goods (up 223%), line pipe (up 69%), standard pipe (up 41%), mechanical tubing (up 31%), hot rolled bars (up 25%), sheets & strip all other metallic coatings (up 21%), cold rolled sheets (up 18%) and sheets & strip hot dipped galvanized (up 15%).The biggest offshore suppliers for the eleven-month period were South Korea with 3,558,000 net tons (up 0.4% year over year), Turkey with 2,133,000 net tons (down 6%), Japan with 1,422,000 net tons (down 16%), Germany with 1,301,000 net tons (up 18%) and Taiwan with 1,204,000 net tons (up 29%).Imports Remain a Pressing ProblemThe continued surge of steel imports into the United States has hollowed out much of the domestic steel industry. U.S. steel producers including Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report), United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS  -  Free Report), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and Commercial Metals Co. (CMC  -  Free Report) have raised concerns about a renewed flood of subsidized imports this year.While the U.S. Department of Commerce has made several ruling imposing duties on additional steel products since the start of 2017, imports continue to flow into the domestic market due to foreign producers’ overcapacity. These cheap imports are hurting the margins of American steel players.Although positive rulings in trade cases (resulting in levy of heavy tariffs) against China last year led to a decline in Chinese steel exports to the United States, imports from other countries remain at above historical levels.According to AISI data, steel imports from China fell roughly 5% year over year through the first eleven months of 2017. However, imports from other countries such as Germany, Taiwan, Brazil and South Korea have spiked over this period.All Eyes on Section 232U.S. steel makers continue to pin their hopes on President Trump imposing new restrictions on imported steel. The Trump administration, in April 2017, ordered an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security.However, the Trump administration has delayed the release of the report on the Section 232 probe, which was initially expected at the end of June 2017. The Commerce Department has until mid-January 2018 to conclude the investigation. A delay in the Section 232 probe has triggered a spike in steel imports into the American market in the recent months.Major U.S. steel makers such as Nucor, U.S. Steel and AK Steel remain optimistic about the Section 232 investigation. Nucor’s Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias, in the third-quarter earnings call, said that he remains confident that President Trump will fulfil his commitments to the steel industry. Moreover, U.S. Steel’s CEO, David B. Burritt, during third-quarter call, said that “We're still fairly optimistic that 232 will have a meaningful impact on the continued unfair trade practices that are harming domestic steel.”Nucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) while U.S. Steel is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.As the deadline for the probe approaches, a positive outcome will give the Trump administration the opportunity to take broad-based trade actions (in the form of tariffs or quotas) against cheap imports. This would provide a significant thrust to steel prices and give domestic steel makers more pricing power.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1304,NUE,"Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) is set to build a rebar micro mill in Sedalia, MO, about 90 miles east of Kansas City. This project was formally announced at an event with Governor Eric Greitens held at Lowell Mohler Assembly Hall post its approval by the Missouri Development Finance Board.  The project, which represents an investment of at least $250 million, is expected to start in 2019 pending the final approval, state and local incentives as well as other permits and regulatory clearances. This rebar micro mill project is in line with the company’s long-term strategy for profitable growth and strengthens its position as a low-cost producer. The move will allow the company to take advantage of the abundant scrap supply in the immediate area provided by Nucor's scrap business. Additionally, the mill is expected to create 255 full-time jobs as well as 450 temporary jobs.  Nucor’s shares have lost 4.5% over the last six months underperforming the gain of 9.7% for the industry it belongs to.   The company logged adjusted earnings of 79 cents per share for the third quarter of 2017, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents. Revenues increased roughly 20.5% year over year to $5,170.1 million in the reported quarter from $4,290.2 million, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,276 million. According to Nucor, the company expects generally stable and improving market conditions for automotive, energy, nonresidential construction, agriculture and heavy equipment. It is also encouraged by the cumulative benefits resulting from successful trade cases of the domestic steel industry.

1305,NUE,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 6.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Nucor's Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues MissNucor saw its profits (on a reported basis) decline year over year in the third-quarter 2017, but its earnings beat expectations.The company logged a profit of $268.5 million or 83 cents per share for the third quarter, compared to earnings of $305.4 million or 95 cents per share it registered a year ago. Earnings include a one-time gain of $13.2 million or 4 cents. Barring one-time items, earnings per share for the reported quarter were 79 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents.Revenues increased roughly 20.5% year over year to $5,170.1 million in the reported quarter from $4,290.2 million, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,276 million.Operating StatsTotal steel mills shipments in the third quarter were 6,165,000 tons, up 18% year over year. Total tons shipped to outside customers were up 12% year over year to 6,618,000 tons. Average sales price in the quarter were up 7% year over year.Steel mill operating rates decreased to 83% in the reported quarter from 88% a year ago.Segment HighlightsNucor witnessed decreased profitability in its Steel Mills segment in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter. According to the company, higher utilization rates at its sheet mills unit were offset by continued pressure from imports, which prevented prices from maintaining pace with rising cost of raw materials. The performance of plate mills also decreased considerably on a sequential basis.The performance of Nucor’s Raw Materials segment in the third quarter decreased compared with the second due to due to unplanned outages in its Louisiana plant during most of the quarter.Nucor also witnessed improved profitability in its downstream products segment on a sequential comparison basis in the third quarter on the back of higher selling price and volumes.Financial PositionNucor ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of around $1,575.9million, down roughly 7.6% from $1,704.7 million a year ago. Long-term debt was $3,241.5 million, down around 25.3% year over year from $4,338.3 million.OutlookAccording to Nucor, the company expects generally stable and improving market conditions for automotive, energy, nonresidential construction, agriculture and heavy equipment.  It is also encouraged by the cumulative benefits resulting from successful trade cases of the domestic steel industry. The company expects earnings in fourth-quarter 2017 to be to be similar to slightly lower from the third quarter, excluding tax benefits recognized during the third quarter of 2017.Nucor expects improved performance from the raw materials unit on the back of more consistent DRI production. Its downstream steel products unit is also expected to benefit from margin improvement whereas the steel mills unit is expected to witness some decline mainly due to weakness in plate steel and typical seasonality.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. There have been three revisions lower for the current quarter.  In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted lower by 14.8% due to these changes.Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus  Nucor Corporation Price and Consensus | Nucor Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresCurrently, Nucor's stock has a poor Growth Score of F, though it is doing a bit better on the momentum front with a D.

1307,NUE,"On Oct 18, we issued an updated research report on Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. (RS  -  Free Report).Reliance Steel is gaining from its broad and diversified product base, wide geographic footprint, continued demand strength across aerospace and automotive markets and synergies of acquisitions.Reliance Steel continues with its aggressive acquisition strategy to incite growth. The addition of Metals USA to the company’s portfolio has complemented its existing customer base, product mix and geographic footprint.The buyout of Tubular Steel also boosts the company’s long-term growth strategy and strength by expanding its product portfolio and end market diversification. Moreover, the acquisition of Best Manufacturing Inc. highly complements the company's existing service center network with its specialty high margin products, value-added processing capabilities and strong focus on customer service.Reliance Steel also recently acquired all the common stock of Ferguson Perforating Company through its fully-owned subsidiary, Diamond Manufacturing Company. Ferguson’s high value-added processing capabilities align well with the company’s inorganic growth strategy and also extends its product portfolio.Moreover, Reliance Steel is witnessing strong demand for its products across aerospace and automotive markets. Demand in the aerospace market has been supported by higher commercial aerospace build rates. Strong demand is also witnessed in the automotive market, backed by the company’s toll processing businesses in the U.S. and Mexico as well as increased use of aluminum in the industry. Reliance Steel expects sustained momentum across these markets in 2017.Reliance Steel, in July, said that it remains carefully optimistic regarding activity levels of business in third-quarter 2017 due to normal seasonal patterns. The company anticipates demand to remain steady except for decline in shipping volume owing to customer vacation and shutdowns schedules in the third quarter.As a result, the company expects tons sold will be down 3% to 5% in third-quarter 2017, compared with the previous quarter. Average selling price for the third quarter is expected to be flat to up 3% from the second quarter. The company benefited from higher metals pricing in the second quarter and expects positive momentum in pricing in the third quarter given increases in carbon steel pricing and potential for lower imports.Reliance Steel also expects prices to increase further should the Section 232 investigation by the U.S. government leads to restriction on steel imports. The Section 232 probe is aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security and also gives the Trump administration the power to impose broad tariffs or quotas on imported steel. American steel makers including Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report), United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corp.

1309,NUE,"U.S. steel imports show no signs of abating, notwithstanding a string of punitive trade actions (in the form of heavy tariffs) in the recent past. Steel imports have shot up roughly 21% year to date – according to a recent report from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), an association of North American steel makers.Per AISI, based on preliminary U.S. Census Bureau data, total U.S. steel imports went up 20.6% year over year to roughly 26.6 million net tons through the first eight months of 2017. Finished steel imports for the same period also increased 15.5% to around 20.4 million net tons. Year to date, finished steel import market share is estimated at 28%, which is higher than 26% clocked in full-year 2016.Major finished steel products that have showed a significant year-to-date increase in imports on a year-over-year basis include oil country goods (up 250%), standard pipe (up 47%), line pipe (up 42%), sheets and strip all other metallic coatings (up 33%), mechanical tubing (up 32%), cold rolled sheets (up 31%), sheets & strip hot dipped galvanized (up 25%) and hot rolled bars (up 19%).The biggest offshore suppliers for the eight-month period were South Korea with 2,620,000 net tons (down 3% year over year), Turkey with 1,827,000 net tons (up 8%), Japan with 1,065,000 net tons (down 17%), Taiwan with 906,000 net tons (up 39%) and Germany with 849,000 net tons (up 2%).Imports - Still a Pressing ProblemU.S. steel producers including Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report), United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS  -  Free Report), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) and Commercial Metals Co. (CMC  -  Free Report) are still struggling to defend their turf from a tide of low-priced steel imports from foreign manufacturers.Despite a raft of stringent trade actions and threats of further future measures, imports continue to make inroads into the American market due to foreign producers’ overcapacity.While positive rulings in trade cases (resulting in levy of heavy tariffs) against China last year led to a decline in Chinese steel exports to the United States, imports from other countries remain at above historical levels.Domestic steel producers, during their second-quarter earnings call, raised concerns about a renewed flood of subsidized imports this year.Moreover, Nucor recently lowered its earnings guidance for the third quarter citing continued import pressure that has not allowed steel pricing to keep pace with higher raw material costs during the quarter. Steel Dynamics also provided lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings guidance recently, saying that high levels of steel imports have put pressure on domestic steel prices.  Nucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) while Steel Dynamics is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Much Hopes Pinned on Section 232Domestic steel makers are pinning their hopes on President Trump enforcing new restrictions on imported steel. Steel stocks got a big lift in April 2017 after the Trump administration ordered an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The Section 232 probe is aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security and also gives the President the power to impose broad tariffs or quotas on imported steel.Executives of U.S. steel and steel-related firms, in a letter, urged President Trump last month to impose immediate restrictions on imports. The appeal came after a delay in the release of the report on the Section 232 probe by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which was initially expected at the end of June 2017.While the findings from the Section 232 steel investigation are due, it goes without saying that a favorable outcome from the probe will provide a major boost to domestic steel makers.Should the findings under the investigation come positive, the Trump administration will get the opportunity to take broad-based trade actions against cheap imports. This would provide a significant thrust to steel prices and give American steel producers more pricing power.    Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1310,NUE,"United States Steel Corporation (X  -  Free Report) and Japan’s Kobe Steel, Ltd. have agreed to start construction of a new continuous galvanizing line (CGL) at their subsidiaries’ joint venture, Pro-Tec Coating Company in Leipsic, OH. The move is in response to growing demand for advanced high-strength steels (AHSS).  The new line, involving an investment of around $400 million, will use a proprietary process for coating steel that will help automakers make economically lightweight vehicles to meet increasing fuel efficiency requirements and maintain high safety standards.The line will enable Pro-Tec to produce Generation 3 steels with a hot-dipped zinc coating, which automakers can utilize with their present stamping and assembly methods to make strong, safe and cost-effective structural components for vehicle bodies.The CGL will have annual capacity of 500,000 tons. Construction is expected to start in fourth-quarter 2017. The line is expected to begin startup in 2019.U.S. Steel, which is among the prominent U.S. steel makers along with Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report), provided an optimistic view for 2017 in July.The company now expects net earnings of around $300 million or $1.70 per share for 2017, up from $260 million or $1.50 per share it expected earlier. The company is seeing positive sentiment in the markets served by Flat-Rolled and U.S. Steel Europe (USSE) units. Its Tubular unit is also gaining from operational and cost improvements and strong market conditions.   U.S. Steel is expected to gain from healthy automotive demand. Also, the company is actively engaged in improving its cost structure and increasing revenues on a sustainable basis through its “Carnegie Way” initiative. The company sees incremental impact from Carnegie Way benefits of $390 million for full-year 2017 as compared with 2016.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?                                                                                                                                                            Here's another stock idea to consider.

1311,NUE,"ArcelorMittal’s (MT  -  Free Report) unit in Romania, ArcelorMittal Galati recently launched a new range of organic coated coils. This follows an investment of roughly €15 million that also incorporates considerable technical updates to ArcelorMittal Galati's Galvanizing Line. The new coating line, having an annual capacity of as much as 90,000 tons, will supply Romania's domestic market which has growth potential. The line makes strips in a vast spectrum of thicknesses and widths to satisfy customer expectations for products including roofing, drainage systems, sandwich panels and industrial coolers.ArcelorMittal, which is among the prominent steel makers along with POSCO , Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation  and Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report), said in July that it expects global apparent steel consumption to rise 2.5-3% year over year in 2017, up from its earlier expectation of 0.5-1.5%.ArcelorMittal continues to focus on shifting to high added value products and expanding its automotive steel line of products. The company is expanding its global portfolio of automotive steels by launching a new generation of advanced high strength steel. It is also planning to expand its family of third-generation advanced high strength steel. These products will enable the company to meet customer requirements via a strong technical and product portfolio.ArcelorMittal also remains focused on reducing debt and lowering costs. The company’s net debt declined to $11.9 billion at the end of second-quarter 2017 from $12.1 billion recorded at the end of first quarter. The company also remains on track with its cost-reduction actions under its Action 2020 program, which includes plans to optimize costs and increase steel shipment volumes, along with improving the portfolio of high added value products.Moreover, the recently announced acquisition of Ilva S.p.A. in Italy will provide growth opportunity for the company in Europe. Ilva is expected to be a good investment without compromising on the strength of the company’s balance sheet. The deal is expected to create synergies of €310 million by 2020, excluding impact from volume improvements and fixed cost reductions.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

The steel maker is considering five states in the Midwest and Southeast for the project that include Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, South Carolina and Florida.In addition, the company’s board has cleared the expansion of either its Illinois or Ohio merchant bar operations.The company noted that both projects are part of its strategy for long-term profitable growth. These projects are expected to help Nucor retain its position as a low-cost producer and enable it to better serve its customers. The bar mills are expected to deliver considerable value in the future, the company noted.Nucor’s shares have declined 3.3% over the past three months, underperforming the gain of 18.3% for the industry it belongs to.Nucor recently provided downbeat guidance for third-quarter 2017. The company sees earnings for the quarter in the band of 75-80 cents per share. That is a decrease from $1.00 per share recorded in the previous quarter and 95 cents a share it earned a year ago.The projected earnings for the third quarter are also lower than the qualitative guidance provided by the company in its second-quarter 2017 earnings call in July. Earlier, the company had expected earnings in the third quarter to be in a band similar to the quarterly results of first-half 2017.Nucor noted that the U.S. steel industry continues to be hurt by steel imports. The finished steel imports for the first eight months accounted for about 28% share of the American market and increased an estimated 16.5% from the year-ago period.Nevertheless, the industry continues to combat unfair traded imports.

1313,NUE,"The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), yesterday, made its final determinations on anti-dumping duty investigations on imports of steel concrete reinforcing bar (rebar) from Taiwan and found that imports of these products have caused material injury to the American steel industry. The regulator also approved the anti-dumping duties on imports of these products.The anti-dumping case was filed by the Rebar Trade Action Coalition on behalf of its individual members that include Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report), Commercial Metals Company (CMC  -  Free Report) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report). Imports of steel concrete rebar from Taiwan were valued at an estimated $53 million last year.The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), in July 2017, determined that these products are being sold in the American market below their fair values. The DOC slapped a final anti-dumping duty rate of up to 32% on these imports. As a result of the USITC’s affirmative findings, the DOC will now issue an anti-dumping duty order on the Taiwanese imports.The ruling marks yet another victory for crisis-hit U.S. steel companies in their ongoing battle against unfairly-traded, cheap imports.American steel makers continue to reel under the effects of a tide of cheap imports, notwithstanding a series of punitive trade actions in the recent past. Domestic steel producers, during their second-quarter earnings call, raised concerns about a renewed flood of subsidized imports this year.While positive rulings in trade cases (resulting in levy of heavy tariffs) against China last year led to a decline in Chinese steel exports to the United States, imports from other countries remain at above historical levels.Steel stocks got a big thrust in April 2017 after the Trump administration ordered an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The Section 232 probe is aimed at determining whether the imports pose a threat to national security and also gives the President the power to impose broad tariffs or quotas on imported steel. However, steel imports have surged since the launch of the investigation with import market share reaching as high as 30% in June 2017.According to the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), an association of North American steel makers, total steel imports shot up roughly 22% year over year through the first seven months of 2017. Year to date, finished steel import market share is estimated at 28%, which is higher than 26% clocked in full-year 2016.Executives of U.S. steel and steel-related firms, in a letter, recently urged President Trump to impose immediate restrictions on imports. The appeal came after a delay in the release of the report on the Section 232 probe by the DOC.Nevertheless, steel prices have rebounded this year on the back of trade actions, reflected by an increase in hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel prices. China’s actions to reduce its excess steel supply are also expected to lend support to steel prices in 2017. The world’s largest steel producer has pledged to cut its steel production capacity by around 50 million metric tons in 2017.The Zacks Steel Producers industry has outperformed the broader market in a year’s time. The industry has gained around 33.5% in this period, higher than the S&P 500’s corresponding return of around 12.9%.A couple of stocks worth considering in the steel space are POSCO  and Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.

1314,NUE,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on steel maker, Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report).Nucor saw a year-over-year increase in revenues and net earnings in second-quarter 2017. However, both earnings and sales missed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Nucor sees earnings in third-quarter 2017 to be in a band similar to the quarterly results of first-half 2017. The company continues to achieve greater penetration of the automotive market and expects to continue this trend for the rest of 2017. Nucor is also upbeat about improving prospects in the energy markets.Nucor, which is among the prominent U.S. steel makers along with U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report), AK Steel (AKS  -  Free Report) and Steel Dynamics (STLD  -  Free Report), has been focusing on growth through strategic acquisitions and it is well positioned to gain from such efforts to expand business through mergers and acquisitions.Nucor, in early 2017, wrapped up its purchase of steel electrical conduit maker, Republic Conduit, from Luxembourg-based Tenaris S.A. for $335 million. The acquisition is expected to make the Nucor a market leader in steel electrical conduits. Moreover, the company acquired Southland Tube for $130 million in Jan 2017. The buyout strengthens Nucor’s foothold in the hollow structural section (“HSS”) steel tubing maker.Moreover, the purchase of the assets of open web steel joists maker, Omega Joist also allows Nucor to grow its joist and decking business in Canada. The recently announced acquisition of St. Louis-based steel bar maker, St. Louis Cold Drawn, Inc. is also in sync with Nucor's strategy to expand its position as the market leader in cold finished bar products and complements its goal to profitably grow its value-added product portfolio.Nucor should also gain from continued momentum in the automotive market. The company remains focused on achieving greater penetration of this major market. The company has entered into a joint venture with JFE Steel Corporation of Japan to build and operate a plant in Mexico that will supply sheet steel to the country’s growing automotive market. Construction of the plant, which will have the capacity to produce 400,000 tons annually, started in June.Nucor, in May, also announced that it will build a hot band galvanizing line at its sheet mill in Kentucky, that will serve its objective of growing share in the automotive market. The $176 million project is expected to expand the product capabilities of Nucor Steel Gallatin and the new line will have an annual capacity of 500,000 tons.However, the steel industry is still not out of the woods yet. The industry is still under relentless pressure caused by years of excess steel-making capacity. The U.S. steel industry also continues to be hit by cheaper imports. Finished steel imports from foreign producers have increased about 15% year over year during the first half of 2017.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars. But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

1317,NUE,"The third-quarter earnings season is coming to a close and it appears to be a layup win for the bulls. From the beginning there has been no doubt, as one positive surprise came in after another. And the trend has yet to let up. Nearly 89% of the S&P 500 companies had reported, and positive EPS surprises still outnumber negatives by over 3:1. The median surprise is an impressive 3.2% and median growth thus far is 12.3%. 
"
1318,NUE,"The growth leaders are the Energy and Materials sectors. Energy has shown much greater strength than expected, with median growth of 27.5% and a surprise ratio nearly 5:1. The tougher commodity price comps havent hit the sector as hard as expected, and oil field service firms like Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have been picking up the slack for lagging E&Ps. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, however, it is clear that the sectors comparable growth is expected to lag, potentially dropping to less than 1%. Recall that last years fourth quarter results were so good that they prompted a congressional hearing. Thats a textbook tough comp. Also showing strength, the Materials sector boasts median growth of 21.5% and a healthy surprise ratio of over 2:1. Big upside surprises here came from Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) and Praxair (PX  -  Free Report). 
"
1319,NUE,"The growth laggard thus far continues to be Consumer Staples, with median growth of only 6.3%. This is more favorable than expected however, as the sectors surprise ratio is over 3:1, with a median surprise of 1.9%. The two earnings surprise leaders for the sector were Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) and Supervalu (SVU  -  Free Report). Food firms Conagra (CAG  -  Free Report) and McCormick (MKC  -  Free Report) also posted double-digit surprises. The Financial and Telecom sectors are also lagging with single digit growth.

1322,NUE,"The total number of 2006 earnings revisions over the past month was 3,915. This is at, or very near, the peak of total revisions we will see during the third-quarter reporting season. Last weeks 4-week revisions total was 3,368 for comparison. In the coming weeks, we should see the total number of revisions begin to fall off. 
"
1323,NUE,"Over the last four weeks, there were 2,441 upward revisions and 1,471 downward revisions. This makes for a total revisions ratio of 1.66, slightly up from last weeks 1.61. The uptrend has continued now for several weeks and the 2006 revisions ratio has held solid above 1. The ratio of firms with higher mean estimates to lower mean estimates was similarly strong at 1.61.
"
1324,NUE,"The upward revisions were very widespread, with every sector seeing more upward than downward revisions. Looking more closely at individual revisions ratios, Consumer Staples ratio is the laggard, coming in at 1.2. Two sector companies showing strong negative revisions over the past four weeks were Hersheys (HSY) and Whole Foods (WFMI). On the upside of the revisions story, Healthcare remains at the front of the pack with an impressive ratio of 3.09. Big pharma continues to show strength, though the recent post-election sell-off has taken the industry down a bit. Over the last four weeks, Amgen (AMGN), Merck (MRK), and Eli Lilly (LLY) have all seen strong upward revisions.

"
1326,NUE,"Looking ahead to next year, the revisions ratio has continued its uptrend and remains above 1.0, at 1.16. This is extraordinarily important. With the economy slowing, housing in a free fall and the yield curve inverted, one can easily make an intellectually coherent case for a recession next year. However, there has never been a recession where earnings grow at anything close to a double-digit rate. This is the elephant in the room that must be explained by any recession predictor. There is no way that the expected growth rate will come down unless estimate cuts exceed estimate increases.
"
1327,NUE,"Just as in 2006, the bright point regarding 2007 revisions is clearly Healthcare. The sectors ratio has reached 1.78. Two positive revisions leaders in the sector are Aetna (AET) and Gilead (GILD). On the downside, Energy remains the 2007 revisions ratio laggard with a 0.47. For the S&P 500 as a whole the ratio of firms revised up to revised down was a healthy 1.16, although like the revisions ratio it was well below the stellar levels for this year.

"
1329,NUE,"On a full-year1  basis, earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain solid. Double-digit gains are expected on both a median firm and total net income basis. On a median basis, growth for the current and next fiscal year is expected to be 13.6% and 12.1%, respectively. This growth rate has stayed relatively stable (slight downward drift for 2007) over the last several weeks. On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are more skewed towards this year, at 15.3% versus 9.7% next year. While the total growth rate is certainly predicted to slow, by no means is a 9.7% year-over-year growth rate tantamount to predicting a near term recession. Further, with the revisions ratios of both 2006 and 2007 above 1.0, a significant deterioration of the expected growth rate does not look likely at this point. 
"
1330,NUE,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS, and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase. In the first half, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. The shrinks the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies. Countering this is the expensing of options this year. As recently as last year, companies were allowed to use bogus intrinsic value accounting for stock options. In other words pretend that there was no cost to the company for making its executives extraordinarily rich in many cases. Now they have to realize that compensation is indeed an expense, which holds down reported earnings growth, even if there is no change in the economic earnings. Unlike some other earnings databases, our estimates fully include the effect of expensing options (which would explain why our numbers are somewhat lower than theirs).
"
1331,NUE,"Unlike the growth rates in our Earnings Scorecard, the numbers in the table below represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms. Energy is expected to post rock-solid growth for both years on a median basis, with earnings climbing over 37% this year and approximately 18% next year. However, there is a real disparity for 2007 in the Energy sector, where it is at the front of the pack on a median firm basis, but near the back on a total earnings basis. The key to that difference is that a handful of giant super majors  ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX),  and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report)  account for over half of the sectors total expected earnings. Their earnings are currently expected to be flat to slightly down in 2007 relative to 2006, while the oil service and many of the E&P firms are expected to continue growing at a rapid clip. The Materials sector shows a similar disparity for 2007. Going the other way, total earnings growth in 2006 is much higher than median growth from the Financial Services sector. This is largely due to the very large insurance losses in 2005 due to the storms. The Financial Services sector has more firms in it, and accounts for more of the S&Ps total earnings than the Energy and Industrial sectors combined.

"
1338,NUE,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
1339,NUE,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2005, 2006 and 2007, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
1340,NUE,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.4%, it has more influence than the Consumer Staples, Utilities, Materials and Telecom sectors combined. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.4% of the total expected earnings for 2006, or more than the total earnings of the Tech, Industrial and Utility sectors combined.
"
1341,NUE,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.5% of total earnings for 2006, but represents only 9.7% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 13.8% in 2007, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Clearly at 9.7%, Energy is far from being in a bubble phase. Frankly, I find the notion of an Energy stock bubble to be absurd. Even though the NASDAQ is at only half of its early 2000 peak, a much stronger case could be made for Tech being bubbly than for Energy.
"
1342,NUE,"Looked at another way, Energy will provide 20.6% of the total incremental earnings in the S&P 500 this year, while that is down from the 38.7% of the total it provided last year, it is still far above its weight in the index. In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 10.5x 2006, and 10.1x 2007 earnings. Tech on the other hand is trading for 22.4x 2006 and 19.2x 2007 earnings. The S&P is trading for 15.8x and 14.4x, respectively. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios.
"
1343,NUE,"Matt Thurmond contributed significantly to this report.1 We follow the convention of referring to the most recently reported full fiscal year as 2005, and the next full fiscal year to be reported as 2006. There can thus be some shifting in the growth rates even for 2005 as not all calendar year firms have completed their fiscal years.
