0,UNH,"UnitedHealth (UNH) and Devon Energy (DVN), two stocks near buy points, announced plans to heap more rewards on shareholders Wednesday via dividends and buybacks, following other big companies spurred by the GOP's tax legislation and a strong economy to put more money in shareholders' pockets.XIn announcing the moves, the companies join Apple (AAPL) and other big companies in heaping more returns on shareholders. As of May, S&P 500 companies were on pace to give back a record $1 trillion to shareholders this year. The GOP's new legislation has also made it easier to bring overseas profits back into the U.S.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, said its board had OK'd a cash dividend of 90 cents a share, a 20% increase. The board also renewed UnitedHealth's share buyback program, which allowed the purchase of 100 million shares. Those shares accounted for around 10% of the company's overall outstanding stock.Meanwhile, Devon Energy, an shale company that finds and produces oil and gas, hiked its share repurchase program to $4 billion from $1 billion.Devon said the decision to ratchet up buybacks, which increase earnings per share by taking shares off the market, was made in conjunction with an agreement it struck to sell its aggregate ownership interests in EnLink Midstream Partners (ENLK) and EnLink Midstream (ENLC).Shares of Devon popped 5.6% to 41.51 in the stock market today, rushing closer to a 42.99 buy point of a handle in a cup base. UnitedHealth climbed 1.7% to 248.65, in a consolidation with a 250.89 entry.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

1,UNH,"Over the last three months, the best mutual funds have been buying shares in medical stocks like Abiomed (ABMD), Boston Scientific (BXS) and UnitedHealth (UNH). They've also continued to go shopping for retailers like Macy's (M), Dollar General (DG) and T.J. Maxx parent TJX (TJX).Seventy stocks made the latest list of new buys by the top performing funds in the past three months. Twelve hail from the medical sector, while 11 come from the retail industry. As noted last month, leading fund managers have been showing renewed interest in brick-and-mortar retailers like TJX, Macy's, Kohl's (KSS) and W.W. Grainger (GWW), all of which also earned a spot on the latest list.Nineteen mutual funds scooped up an estimated $33 million of shares in fellow retail sector stock and car-auction firm Copart (CPRT). The IBD 50 stock was recently added to the S&P 500, replacing Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFive stocks garnered over $100 million each in new investments by the top funds. Adobe Systems (ADBE) (26 funds invested approximately $255 million) and UnitedHealth (32 funds, $230 million invested) topped the list.Railroad giant CSX (CSX), building products retailer Grainger and medical products makers Abiomed and Boston Scientific also joined the $100 million-plus club.Given the recent volatility in the general market, it's not surprising that several stocks on the list are testing support or forming new chart patterns. Adobe, Macy's, Copart, CSX, Abiomed and several others are testing their 10-week moving averages. See if fund managers step in to protect and add to their positions at that bench mark line.

A break above the peak in that formation in heavy volume could offer an add-on buying opportunity.Specialty paint manufacturer RPM International (RPM) bolted past a 56.79 entry on June 28. The move came as the company announced a new deal with Elliott Management to boost efficiencies and shareholder value. RPM has managed to hold the bulk of those gains.Electronic components maker Kemet (KEM) recently jumped past a 25.79 entry in a deep and later-stage cup with handle. The IBD 50 stock went on a massive run from a low of 1.34 in February 2016 to a high of 27.35 in October 2017. After a sharp decline following that move, Kemet has rebounded and now sports an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 2.0 up/down volume ratio. Note how the 10-week line is now back above the longer-term 40-week moving average — a sign of renewed technical strength. Kemet is now out of buy range.Oil and gas stock Rowan (RDC) topped the list of stocks being sold with 14 net sellers (19 funds selling minus five buying). Vishay Intertechnology (VSH), which makes transistors, diodes and capacitors, was the only other stock in double-digits, with 10 net sellers (16 selling minus six buying).Despite that selling, Vishay has shown resilience.

4,UNH,"An early burst of upside energy devolved into broad-based losses Tuesday, despite a positive reading on inflation, in a session at least partly upended by White House politics.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.7% and the S&P 500 took a 0.6% loss.Stocks rose for the first half-hour of trade Tuesday, then backtracked aggressively with Qualcomm (QCOM) spearheading the sell-off among tech names, as General Electric (GE) spiraled to the bottom of the Dow and as health care groups posted three of the day's five worst losses among the 197 industries tracked by IBD.February consumer price data released before the open was in line with forecasts, easing inflation concerns. The Trump Administration's order blocking an attempted takeover of Qualcomm by Singapore based Broadcom (AVGO) sent Qualcomm sprawling and Broadcom down 0.5%. The news initially sent Intel (INTC) up 4%, but gains fizzled to 0.2% by the close. News reports Friday said Intel was considering a takeover of Broadcom, in order to avert the competitive threat of a Broadcom/Qualcomm combination.It is difficult to tell how prominent other events in Washington were in investors minds Tuesday. The White House's sudden, though not unexpected, replacement of Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, the break between GOP and Democrats in the House Intelligence Panel's release of findings in its Russia probe, and the Senate's progress toward Dodd-Frank banking oversight reforms may all have weighed on the stock market today.The result showed the Dow clearly stymied at its 50-day moving average, while the S&P 500 again met resistance at the 2800 level and the Nasdaq pulled back to test support at the level of its recent high, from Jan. 26.On the Dow, General Electric dived more than 4% after JPMorgan slashed its price target, with Microsoft (MSFT) and American Express (AXP) each booking losses of more than 2%.Among medical stocks, hospital operators Community Health System (CYH) and software developer Tabula Rasa Healthcare (TRHC) each skidded 7% lower. Still, insurer UnitedHealth (UNH) rose 2% to lead the Dow after naming Andrew Witty, GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) former chief executive, to head Optum health-services — the company's pharmacy benefits manager.  The positioning of a high-profile CEO to head the company stirred speculation that UntiedHealth could be considering a spin off. UnitedHealth shares are below their 10-week moving average, crawling along the bottom of a six-week consolidation.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Advanced Micro DevicesAMD was the only Philly Chip Index issue to end the session with a gain of more than 1%.  Marvel Technology (MRVL) and Qualcomm fell more than 5% to the bottom of the Philly index. Silicon Motion (SIMO) and Cavium (CAVM) dived more than 4% each.Fang stocks took one on the muzzle, with Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) falling more than 2%, and Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) off more than 1% each. Apple (AAPL) briefly scored a new high during the session, only to reverse course and end with a 1.1% loss.It's often not a good sign for markets when defensive plays such as utilities show strength, and PG&E (PCG) took the top spot among S&P 500 stocks, rising more than 7% in above-average trade. Xerox (XRX) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) were close behind, however, rising 6% and 4%, respectively. So the market's tone was not predominantly defensive.On the upside, IBD 50 stock LGI Homes (LGIH) jumped more than 4% in soft trade. The gain left shares 21% above an early march low as the homebuilder continues to rebound from support at its 40-week moving average. It now faces a test of resistance at its 10-week line, as it attempts to climb the right side of a three-month long base pattern.RELATED NEWS FOR TUESDAY:Netflix Stock Pressured By Short-Seller Citron After Huge Run-UpApple Investor Focus Shifts To Capital Return PlansGE Dividend Still Seen At 'High Risk' Even After It Was HalvedAs PayPal Slowly Weans From eBay, Is Buyback Or Merger In Cards?Amazon-Resistant Discount Retailer Near Buy Zone With Earnings Due

5,UNH,"President Trump offered a plan Friday to reduce the prices of costly ethical drugs, and the speech spurred generally positive reactions within the pharmaceutical and related industries.The biotech group was among the day's top three industries of the 197 tracked by IBD, rising 2.7%. Generic drugmakers rallied 2.5% as a group, while ethical drug stocks bounded up 2.4%, drugstores were up 1.7%, managed care up 1.6%, and wholesale drug supply up 1.4%.Meanwhile, the major equity indexes played small ball throughout most of Friday's session. But they finished the week with smart gains as IBD upgraded the stock market current outlook to ""Uptrend resumes"" on Thursday. The Nasdaq composite rushed 2.7% higher for the week. The S&P 500 lifted 2.4%.  Apple (AAPL) also posted a second straight weekly gain.The iPhone giant halted a nine-session winning streak, but still closed the bullish week up more than 2% at 188.59. That's on top of a 13% jump the prior week in unusually heavy volume. The recent rally has hoisted Apple as much as 6% past a new proper buy point of 179.04 in a very mild seven-week double-bottom base. (Read the latest updates in stock market action by going to the Stock Market Today landing page.)The Nasdaq composite edged 0.1% lower, but the S&P 500 inched nearly 0.2% higher. The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 0.3%, thanks to gains of 1 point or more from Big Pharma components Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE). UnitedHealth Group (UNH), another Dow Jones industrial component, also rose 4.57, or 2%, to 238.28.Merck is still trying to clear stubborn upside resistance at the long-term 200-day moving average. A 38 Relative Price Strength Rating means Merck is outperforming only 38% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.The small cap S&P 600 ticked 0.1% higher. At 986, the index is now up more than 5.3% since Jan. 1.Strong corporate earnings in Q1, more signs of modest U.S. inflation, and valuation of equities vs. bonds still offer reasons to be bullish on stocks for the rest of the year.""Even when you compare the earnings yield of the S&P 500 with yields on Baa corporate bonds, and not the 10-year Treasury bonds, the stock market still looks attractively valued,"" Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at asset management giant BNY Mellon Wealth Management, told IBD in an interview. ""But you should not invest on a snapshot view. Looking 12 to 18 months out, even with a cooling in the economy I cannot see the 10-year yield at 3% or lower.""The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond continued to hover below the critical 3% level, finishing the day around 2.97%. Grohowski forecasts the yield will end the year at 3.25%.Back to Apple; the megacap turnaround tech play is now trading roughly 5.3% above the 179.04 ideal buy point after a breakout from a double bottom base. Try to buy shares no more than 5% past the correct entry so that you avoid getting prematurely shaken out. Even large-cap leaders are prone to testing or even falling briefly below the breakout point after a strong upward thrust in price.Apple's fundamentals continue to shine, with earnings climbing 11%, 18%, 24%, 16% and 30% vs. year-ago levels in the past five quarters. The Street sees fiscal Q3 profit rising 31% to $2.18 a share, which would mark a slight acceleration in growth.Apple is now up almost 60% since it cleared a first-stage cup with handle base entry at 118.12 on Jan. 6, 2017.Inside the IBD 50, another pharmaceutical play rejoined the list of premier growth stocks. Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) blasted 14% higher to 57.05 as volume jumped nearly quadruple usual levels. Up three straight sessions, the stock is now extended 14% past a 49.85 correct buy point within a seven-month cuplike base.In that base, Supernus formed a roughly two-week downward slanting handle in lighter trade. This handle on the base represents the final shakeout of weak holders before this week's huge breakout. The expert in treatments for epilepsy and ADHD posted a 158% leap in first-quarter earnings to 49 cents a share, crushing the consensus estimate by nearly 49%. Sales increased 57% to $90.4 million, a quarterly record.IPG Photonics (IPGP), an industrial laser maker, and oil and gas play Wildhorse Resource Development (WRD), also joined the IBD 50 in recent sessions.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary on top growth stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:What Other Stocks Are New To IBD's Top Growth Screens?

8,UNH,"Cigna (CI) just made a bid to join an elite group of health care industry titans with its $67 billion deal to buy drug-benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX).X Yet the takeover, which includes $15 billion in assumed debt, comes as something of a shock because Express Scripts and pharmacy benefit managers, in general, have been under fire and unloved on Wall Street. To some extent, Cigna may be jumping into the frying pan.Cigna will pay $48.75 plus 0.2434 share for each Express Scripts share. At Wednesday's close that was equal to 96.03, a 31% premium for Express Scripts.Wall Street's initial reaction to the deal was skeptical. Shares of Cigna closed down 11% at 172.00 on the stock market today. Meanwhile, Express Scripts jumped 8.6% to 79.72. Among competitors, UnitedHealth (UNH) dipped 0.8%, CVS Health rose 1.3%, while Humana (HUM) lost 1.4%.Cigna sees the combination as giving it the scale and skill sets to deliver value to customers, hold down health costs and compete in a world in which its competitors like UnitedHealth and CVS, after it completes its merger with Aetna, own an increasingly formidable array of health care assets.Cigna told analysts on Thursday that the deal would immediately add to earnings and provide a significant boost in the intermediate term. The company raised its EPS target for 2021 to $20-$21 per share from $18.Yet some industry analysts worry that Amazon.com (AMZN) will disrupt the prescription industry. Amazon has flirted with entering the retail drug business and just launched a venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) aimed at lowering health care costs. Washington has amped up the rhetoric on the lack of transparency in drug pricing, and PBMs are seen as a prime suspect. To top it off, Express Scripts had a falling out with Anthem (ANTM), its biggest customer, which accused it of not passing along drug manufacturers' rebates.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

UnitedHealth acquired Catamaran, another PBM, in 2015.UnitedHealth this week announced that its OptumRx PBM would directly provide drug rebates to some 7 million insured members through employer plans, an apparent response to pressure on the industry from customers and politicians.Industry players have increasingly seen the stand-alone PBM model, meaning a pharmacy benefit manager that is not owned directly by a major insurer, as being under threat. Anthem is setting up its own in-house PBM while temporarily contracting with CVS.Some analysts had speculated in recent months that Amazon might bid for Express Scripts to ease its entry into the highly regulated and complex prescription industry.

The burrito and taco chain is now just 15% below a 52-week high of 499.Domino's gapped up and rose 7% to 250.61 in nearly double average turnover on better than expected results.Four names within IBD's restaurant industry group show a Composite Rating of 90 or higher, including Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) and Darden Restaurants (DRI), operator of the Olive Garden, Longhorn and Capital Grille chains.Chipotle, which recently hired a new CEO, notched a 33% pickup in adjusted Q1 earnings to $2.13 a share as sales were 7% higher.Domino's stretched its rally past a large double bottom base, with a 211.85 buy point, to nearly 19% after the global pizza chain notched a 59% rise in Q1 earnings to $2 a share. After-tax margin bulged 130 basis points higher to 11.3%.Sales jumped 26% to $785.4 million, the strongest year-over-year gain in more than five years.

The global oil and gas firm reported a 40% gain in Q1 profit to $1.27 a share on a 24% increase in revenue to $89.24 billion.Marathon Oil (MRO), Cheniere Energy (LNG) and EOG Resources (EOG) are also forming new bases.

A few weeks later, the stock got as low as 149.02. This big undercut of the first low means that a double bottom base could be in the works. If that's the case, the emerging buy point would be 10 cents above the middle peak in between the first and second low, or 186.20.Alphabet (GOOGL) was initially up the least among the five FAANG stocks, just 0.4% at the start, but are now outperforming the Nasdaq, up 2.4%.

18,UNH,"Growth stocks with connections to China, e-commerce, consumer spending and technology had a cheery session in stocks today as the Nasdaq composite rallied more than 0.8% and boosted into new high ground for a third straight session.Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed high-growth companies Netflix (NFLX), Etsy (ETSY) and Qualys (QLYS) symbolized an ongoing trend in 2018: institutional investors continue to hunt for innovative companies that are delivering strong increases in earnings and sales.

The gain triggered a key sell signal in which one should take many gains at 20% to 25% from a breakout point.Selling winners on the way up frees up cash in the portfolio for future new buys. Also, many great stocks will take a pause and correct significantly in price after they break out and notch strong double-digit gains.Why was the 311 price level a valid buy point for Netflix?After its breakout from a three-month cup without handle at 204.48 in early January this year, Netflix rallied valiantly, then tested buying support at the 10-week moving average for several weeks during the market's second intermediate correction that began in late March.After a solid breakout from a base, the first and second pullbacks to the 10-week moving average (as seen on a weekly chart) or the 50-day moving average (on a daily chart) can offer a secondary buy opportunity.The online video streaming giant and pioneer joined IBD Leaderboard initially in July 2014.Etsy vaulted more than 26% to 41.65 in huge volume and at one point rallied 35% intraday.

Trump pledged to suspend joint military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea. He added the U.S. would ""provide security guarantees"" to the North. Kim reaffirmed his pledge to the ""complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."" Trump said economic sanctions against the North — which his administration had tightened in order to force Kim's hand — would remain in place ""in the meantime.""China and South Korea partnered in the diplomatic preparations for the summit.

22,UNH,"Nike powered a healthy advance for the Dow Jones industrial average in late-afternoon trading Friday and extended its own gain from a 70.35 prime entry to 15%. At 3:15 p.m. ET, the 30-stock blue chip index shaved some of its advance but still gained 0.8%, surpassing gains of 0.5% to 0.6% for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite in stocks today.Nike (NKE) gapped up at the open and jumped more than 10% to reach all-time highs. The stock had broken out of a nine-week flat base at 70.35 on May 16. The gain has now reached 15%, so Nike shares are extended.The stock made a mild gain ahead of Friday's earnings-inspired big blast higher. Three weeks ago, the athletic apparel and shoe giant got as high as 75.91, up nearly 8%. Then the stock pulled back all the way to the 50-day moving average amid the current general market decline.Stocks that show support at the 50-day line (or 10-week moving average on a weekly chart) after a breakout from a proper base are showing signs of bullish institutional support.

Dow Jones component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) gained 0.7% in dull turnover to 246.66. The health insurance giant looks poised to snap a four-session losing streak and stay on the north side of its 50-day moving average.UnitedHealth is up 11.8% year to date, and gains from a first-stage breakout in late February of 2016 from a saucer-style base at 121.19 have now reached 111%.United Health's earnings, up 25% to $10.07 a share in 2017, are seen rising another 25% to $12.62 a share this year and 13% in 2019.Small caps underperformed on Friday, but are still smashing the large caps in year-to-date performance. The S&P SmallCap 600 gave back modest gains to trade down nearly 0.1%.

24,UNH,"In just four months, Amazon (AMZN) has gone from being the biggest threat to health care industry profits to an underdog.XBack in January, when Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) unveiled their new partnership to tame medical costs, the news bulldozed health care stocks.Barely four months later, the trio of companies have found a CEO to lead their venture and plan an announcement within weeks, Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett told CNBC on Thursday.Yet the emerging reality looks a lot less scary than the original idea to health care investors, if Thursday's market action is any indication.For example, UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's largest insurer slid more than 4% on that original Jan. 30 announcement, while Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled about 5%.But both stocks were higher on Thursday, with Walgreens gaining 0.7% and UnitedHealth edging up 0.1%, close to its all-time high hit the day before the big Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan news.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEven though Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Buffet and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon admitted at the time, ""Our group does not come to this problem with answers,"" and said they were in their early planning stages, investors panicked.The only plausible explanation for such an overreaction was that Amazon had reportedly been gearing up for months to take on the retail drug industry, while challenging drug distributors and kicking the middleman — pharmacy benefit managers — to the curb.Yet four months later, Amazon's health care ambitions look a whole lot less earth-shattering and unlikely to diminish health care industry profitability for years to come.In April, CNBC reported that Amazon had dropped plans to become a wholesale distributor of prescription drugs due to the cost and complexity. Investors seemed to interpret that retreat as decreasing the likelihood that Amazon will enter the retail prescription business.Bezos is clearly comfortable in the underdog role and can't be counted out. But a whole host of big industry players and technology companies have a huge head start.

25,UNH,"Top hedge fund managers have bet against Warren Buffett and taken large positions in UnitedHealth (UNH), Anthem (ANTM) and other health insurers.XMeanwhile Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) has more than doubled its stake in generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA). It also confirmed it has become the second-largest shareholder in Apple (AAPL).In an SEC filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock holdings as of March 31, the company said it owned about 40.5 million Teva American depositary receipts worth about $693 million. This is up from 18.9 million ADRs worth $358 million the previous quarter.Health insurers shares slumped after Buffett, Amazon (AMZN) chief Jeff Bezos, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon announced January a joint venture whose aim is to cut U.S. health care costs.""We want our employees to get better medical services at lower cost,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's annual shareholder's meeting earlier this month. ""The resistance will be unbelievable, and if we fail, at least we tried.""However rivals are betting against the plan, with power player Jana Partners revealing Tuesday new positions in Anthem and Cigna (CI), while Omega Advisors and billionaire investor Julian Robertson's Tiger Management have taken new positions in UnitedHealth, according to their regulatory filings.Teva had been under pressure since Mylan's (MYL) generic version of its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone was approved in October and amid challenges facing the U.S. generic medicines industry.To contend, Teva announced a restructuring plan to trim $3 billion in spending by closing plants and cutting drug programs. In February, Teva said it was well on its way to realizing half those savings by year's end.One Buffett decision that hedge fund managers seem to agree with is his increased Apple holding. Barry Rosenstein's Jana Partners has a new position in the tech giant, though it has sold all its shares in Facebook (FB). Highlighting the rough recent performance of homebuilders, Jana also revealed it had cut its stake in D.R. Horton by 96% to 47,000 shares. Other new positions include Adobe Systems (ADBE), ADT (ADT), Boston Scientific (BSX) and Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS).In contrast, Tiger Management upped its positions in Facebook, while also taking more stock in Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL).David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital added InterActiveCorp (IAC) and exited Chemours (CC)Activist investor Carl Icahn sold off his stake of American International Group (AIG) and increased his position in Herbalife Nutrition (HLF).

27,UNH,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) tumbled to a four-year low Tuesday — prodding rival Amgen (AMGN) to also dip — after announcing a deal with Express Scripts (ESRX) to cut the net price of cholesterol drug Praluent.Express Scripts will list Praluent as its exclusive PSCK9 inhibitor on its national formulary as of July 1. In exchange, it will pay a lower price for the drug. PCSK9 inhibitors, like Praluent and Amgen's Repatha, work to reduce ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood. They also benefit cardiovascular outcomes.The move is in an effort to expand access to cholesterol drug Praluent, Regeneron and partner Sanofi (SNY) said. Some reports suggest 70% of prescription requests are rejected by insurers. That could be, in part, due to price. Praluent and Repatha go for north of $14,000 per year.Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer praised the deal in a written statement. He sees the agreement as setting a new standard model for medicines like Praluent.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""This paradigm-shifting agreement is designed to break the gridlock so that Praluent is finally able to reach patients most in need,"" he said. ""U.S. cardiologists have experienced unprecedented challenges in securing access for Praluent for patients who were clearly appropriate, but were denied coverage.""But investors weren't as keen on the deal. In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Regeneron slipped 0.8% to 301.22. Amgen dropped 3% to 169.28. Sanofi lost a fraction to 39.13.The agreement significantly reduces the documentation necessary to secure Express Scripts insurance coverage for the cholesterol drug, Regeneron and Sanofi said in a press release. Physicians will submit a simplified attestation form to confirm the patient is appropriate for Praluent.Express Scripts also agreed to pass a portion of the savings onto patients enrolled in other plans. Those patients should see lower out-of-pocket costs for their Praluent prescriptions, the companies said.Analysts were largely positive on the deal, though note the specifics of the price cut aren't public. It's likely Praluent will be priced in line with a recent report that suggested it would be cost effective for higher risk patients at $4,500-$8,000 annually, RBC analyst Brian Williams said in a note.The ""price for volume"" announcement leaves a lot of the financial benefit up in the air, Williams said. The PCSK9 market is particularly attractive given its massive size. But this type of deal could further incentivize insurers to implement complicated utilization processes, he said.Further, if the deal prices the cholesterol drug closer to the $4,500 annual target, it would represent a 50%-plus cut to the net price, Williams said.""Despite this, we do not view this as a pricing 'race to the bottom' given potential for annual compounding and lifetime treatment creating distinct differences vs. the 'price for volume' contracts in the curative one-time-treatment hepatitis C space,"" he added.Now, it's a battle for the other insurers, Williams said. Amgen is in negotiations with payers and will likely leverage its ""expertise in winning contracting agreements"" to seek deals with United Health (UNH), CVS Health (CVS), Anthem (ANTM), Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI) or Humana (HUM), he said.Amgen estimates the Express Scripts formulary decision will impact 2,000, or 6%, of Repatha patients, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in a report to clients. But he kept his model on Praluent intact until after the first-quarter earnings conference call on Thursday.""Just doing some back-of-the-envelope math, if all 2,000 Repatha patients switched to Praluent on July 1, this would be an $8 million tailwind for Praluent in the second half of 2018 on the formulary decision alone,"" he said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

28,UNH,"February's stock market performance serves as a reminder that volatility can still take a bite out of market leaders like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL). After a stunning 2017 in which everything worked, the market entered January with aggressive buying, sending the major indexes to all-time highs.X But February started with a shocking reversal. The market experienced its first correction, defined as a 10% drop, in two years. The S&P 500's 10.2% decline was as swift as it was dramatic. It lasted just nine days, ending Feb. 8. But the damage was done.Despite bouncing back the last three weeks, the benchmark ended the month down 3.89%. It's first monthly loss since March 2017. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.3% in February, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds lost 3.61% according to Lipper Inc. Surprisingly, S&P 500 Index funds beat the index by 18 basis points, down 3.71%, according to Lipper.General domestic taxable bond funds average a loss of 0.8% in February and were down 0.75% year to date.""The past month has been a snapback of the previous month,"" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide Funds. In January investor sentiment turned aggressive, especially in technology, buying went a little too far too fast, Hackett said. Then at the beginning of February it reversed, partly triggered by the specter of rising interest rates.""It was indiscriminate selling,"" said Hackett. ""Even the names you would think of as safe havens didn't work because people thought of the defensive stocks, like telecom and utilities, as bond proxies and sold them. The fact we had a correction is not the slightest bit unusual and actually a healthy thing. You get a pressure valve release, so things don't get overheated and people don't get too complacent.""David Joy, the chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial, said he wasn't surprised the market recovered quickly, ""because there was no change in the fundamental outlook. We think the economy will be quite strong and that we're going to get growth close to 3% this year.""The February bounce back came because of two events from Washington, the spending bill and tax reform, which combined should increase gross domestic product over the next two years by 50 basis points, said Lawrence Kemp, the portfolio manager of the BlackRock Capital Appreciation Fund (MAFGX). The fund was up 6.75% year to date going into Friday vs. the S&P 500's return of 0.49%, according to Morningstar.""That's positive for additional money for the consumer to spend and for corporations to invest and to increase dividends and buy back stock,"" said Kemp. ""It's a very positive tailwind regarding U.S. fundamentals and for very strong earnings growth.""We're overweight in technology,"" said Kemp. ""Financials will benefit from a rising rate environment.""Among the fund's top 10 holdings are five technology stocks, Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet, Facebook, Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline Group) and China's Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).His top financial picks are Visa (V) and Bank of America (BAC). He also said he thinks the health care sector and consumer discretionary stocks will do well this year. He likes UnitedHealth (UNH) and Constellation Brands (STZ), a beer and wine company.Hackett and Joy agree that technology and financials are likely to do well. Other technology companies to look at are the ones repatriating income back to the U.S., such as Apple (AAPL), Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).As for financials, they say look at the large money center banks, such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS).  They both also see potential in late-cycle winners like industrials. This would include Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX)) and 3M (MMM).The names that were down because of interest rates have not bounced back nearly as much. Hackett said real estate is down 9% year-to-date, telecom is down 8% utilities are down 7% and consumer staples are down 7%, Names that were defensive and that you would expect to perform well in a volatile period to perform have not and are not viewed as defensive but as interest rates sensitive, and are suffering because of that.""We're also constructive on the international markets,"" said Joy. ""We like equity market in most parts of the world, developed and emerging, as there is a global recovery. There are not too many countries where the economies are not expanding. You still get very accommodative central bank policies in Europe and Japan and cheaper valuations.""""Even with huge upside in the U.S., we think foreign markets are one of the best places to be at this point, with the dollar weakening, the rest of the world lags the U.S. by two or three years,"" said Hackett, who said optimal international equity exposure would be 40%.RELATED:See What Leading Stocks Are Driving This American Century Growth FundNew To Stock Investing?

29,UNH,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite rose strongly early in the week, but then erased most of those gains by Friday's close. Netflix (NFLX) soared on subscriber growth and guidance, while energy stocks busted higher as crude oil prices kept rising. Alcoa (AA), American Express (AXP) and UnitedHealth (UNH) jumped on their Q1 reports. That offset weak outlooks from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and chip-gear giants Lam Research (LRCX) and ASML (ASML). The broader chip sector and Apple (AAPL) came under pressure.The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite were all up more than 1% through Thursday, but by Friday's close were up about 0.5%. The major averages rallied through Wednesday on Netflix (NFLX) earnings and oil-fueled energy stocks. Stocks pulled back as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) warned on the rest of 2018, citing weak smartphone demand. Already pressured by weak ASML (ASML) and Lam Research (LRCX) guidance, chip stocks sold off. Apple (AAPL) also came under heavy pressure Thursday and Friday on iPhone demand concerns. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.958%, a four-year high.Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) added 7.41 million streaming subscribers in the first quarter, beating its target for 6.35 million. It ended the March quarter with 125 million subscribers worldwide. Netflix expects to add 6.2 million subscribers in Q2, topping Wall Street's target of 5.2 million. Netflix also topped Q1 EPS and sales figures and guided higher for those metrics in Q2. Q1 subscriber numbers benefited from new original content such as science-fiction series ""Altered Carbon"" and fresh seasons of comic-book series ""Marvel's Jessica Jones"" and comedy ""Grace and Frankie."" Shares shot up to a record high.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) cut its sales outlook for the rest of the year, largely on softer smartphone demand, slamming chip stocks and Apple (AAPL). Taiwan Semi is the world's largest contract chipmaker and counts Apple, Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) among its customers.

31,UNH,"Stock market futures rose strongly Tuesday morning after blowout subscriber growth and bullish guidance from Netflix (NFLX) late Monday, with the major market averages likely to test or surpass a key support level.Fellow FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) showed fractional gains, while Netflix's China partner, iQiyi (IQ), continued to add to its recent breakout. But Lam Research's (LRCX) earnings on Tuesday may be more important for the stock market rally.During Monday's session, the Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.9% gain but was unable to close above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 index advanced 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.7%.Stock market futures jumped. Nasdaq 100 futures, boosted by Netflix, advanced 0.9% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.7%. Dow Jones futures were up 0.75%, helped as UnitedHealth (UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) edged higher after topping views early Tuesday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The internet TV giant added 7.41 million streaming subscribers, above its target for 6.35 million. Netflix jumped nearly 7% in premarket trading.Netflix may not have huge coattails, though. Amazon (Amazon Prime Video), Alphabet (Google YouTube) and Facebook (Facebook Watch) all have competing video products, but those aren't their primary revenue and profit drivers. All three FANG stocks rose less than 1% in the premarket.Baidu (BIDU)-unit iQiyi, which came public at 18 in late March, rose 1.3% in the premarket. The so-called ""Netflix of China"" actually licenses Netflix content for its streaming service. The stock cleared a very short IPO-base buy point at 18.30 last week and is now extended, rising 2.1% to 19.74 on Monday.Keep in mind that overnight trading in individual stocks or Dow Jones futures often doesn't translate into how the stock market will trade in the next regular session.Lam Research reports earnings after Tuesday's market close.

The stock is working on a new consolidation, but does not yet have a proper buy point.It's a top-rated big-cap tech stock, but why is it so important?Lam Research kicks off earnings for the semiconductor sector, which typically is a leader or contributor in tech rallies. Chips account for a big share of the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index. Chips also are in just about every tech product. So if chip stock stocks are faring well, there's a good bet that chip demand is strong, and thus demand for a variety of tech gear is also strong.And yet, chip stocks have been lagging the S&P 500 index since the market peaked just over a month ago.

34,UNH,"The Trump administration on Saturday announced the suspension of risk adjustment, a central part of ObamaCare meant to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions can get coverage.Although it's unclear how long the suspension will last, it's hard to underestimate the extent to which this will explode ObamaCare state insurance markets if not lifted soon.Suspension of risk-adjustment payments from insurers with relatively low-cost customers to those that take on a higher-cost group of customers has huge financial implications for ObamaCare insurers. Centene (CNC) — the biggest player on the ObamaCare exchanges, with 1.6 million customers — owes $620 million for risk adjustment in 2017, according to updated data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, but that payment is on hold.In 2018, Centene expects to pay $1.1 billion for risk adjustment. Even with its risk-adjustment payments, Centene makes a profit on the ObamaCare exchanges. If it were to be freed from making such payments, the impact on earnings would be massive. Centene's overall corporate net earnings in 2017 totaled $828 million.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe financial implications are even bigger for Molina Health (MOH), which has an $850 million risk-adjustment liability for 2017. Molina had been assuming a $912 million risk-adjustment liability for last year.In Monday stock market trading, Centene stock edged up 0.1%, while Molina Health stock rose 3.2%. Both Centene and Molina Health hit record highs intraday.Yet, on other side of the coin, Centene's and Molina's liability represents risk-adjustment receivables due to other companies for which the suspension of the program could be disastrous. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida is owed $617 million under risk adjustment for 2017. Anthem (ANTM) is owed about $400 million to $500 million, according to JPMorgan.Anthem stock, which got a BMO Capital upgrade and price target hike, rose 2.7%.The Blue Cross & Blue Shield Association released a statement warning that the Trump administration's move ""will significantly increase 2019 premiums for millions of individuals and small-business owners and could result in far fewer health plan choices.""Something will have to give. Either insurers like Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida will drop out of the market, or they will tailor their plans to make them less appealing to people with chronic conditions, who expect to run up high medical bills, much as Centene appears to have done. Simply raising prices may not seem like a workable option if it drives away relatively healthy customers, leaving some insurers with an even sicker group.Every time that other insurers have fled ObamaCare amid criticism of its rules and its relatively costly consumers, Centene has turned it into opportunity — and it could happen again. Centene is ranked No. 1 by IBD Stock Checkup in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends.Dow Jones component UnitedHealth (UNH), which exited ObamaCare exchanges previously, rose 1.2%. UnitedHealth stock is in buy range from a 249.27 handle entry.The Department of Health and Human Services justified its decision based on a February decision in a case brought by a New Mexico insurer that challenged the workings of risk adjustment.

The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.7% after touching an all-time high earlier in the session.Volume crept higher on the NYSE but slipped on the Nasdaq.The Dow's outperformance was somewhat misleading.

Boeing rose 1.5%, while UnitedHealth gained 1%.In the S&P 500, PepsiCo (PEP) surged about 4% as it retook its 200-day line in fast trade. The 50-day line was reclaimed in June.Pepsi's earnings popped 7%, topping views by about 6%. Revenue came in above expectations but only narrowly so.Pepsi's image is tied to its namesake soft drink, but the company's brands include Doritos, Cheetos, Frito-Lay, Ruffles and Quaker Oats. In Q2, revenue in the snack segment grew 4%, while overall revenue growth was only 2%.Meanwhile, chip stocks of a different order did well. Chip designer Marvell Technology (MRVL) gapped up 3% in twice its usual volume. Chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) rose 1% as it tried to retake its 200-day line.Alphabet (GOOGL) tacked on small gains but was on track to extend its win streak to four up days in a row.Oil stocks showed some breakouts, but action was unsteady.

Fellow Dow Jones stocks Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), UnitedHealth (UNH) and Visa (V) are near buy points in sound bases. These blue chips' relative strength lines have already hit new highs, a very bullish signal.The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. The RS line, the blue line in the charts below, is always a good way to determine if a stock is a leader or laggard. It's a specialty breakout tool for investors, because an RS line hitting a new high with or ahead of a stock is particularly bullish.Intel's low-volume breakout attempt is not a great sign, and several other stocks hit buy points Wednesday in tepid trade. Looking back, Apple, Intel, Microsoft and Visa had been rising in recent sessions on light trade, suggesting a lack of institutional support. UnitedHealth has had back-to-back gains in strong volume, especially with Tuesday's estimate-beating earnings.Apple, Intel and Microsoft account for three of the five Dow Jones tech stocks. Cisco Systems (CSCO) is acting well, with its RS line just below a new high. IBM (IBM) topped earnings views late Tuesday, but weak margins and other concerns sent the stock tumbling 7% Wednesday intraday.

Volume was below average. Investors should look for volume to rise at least 40%-50% above normal on a breakout.Apple fell 0.2% to 177.84 in the stock market today. On Tuesday, the stock rose 1.4% to 178.24 on Tuesday, about 3% below a 183.60 flat-base buy point. The iPhone maker cleared a sloppy, V-shaped flat base on March 12, but then reversed lower along with the Nasdaq composite on March 13.

Like Apple, a prior breakout quickly failed with the Nasdaq-led reversal starting March 13.Dow Jones health insurance giant UnitedHealth topped profit and revenue views early Tuesday while also raising guidance.

Visa topped a 125.40 entry for just a moment on March 21, touching 125.44 intraday, but then reversed lower. The stock fell 7.5% below the buy point, making that an automatic sell.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe report seemed to have the most direct connection to the trio of major drug distributors that handle logistics for major drug manufacturers, a big revenue but low-margin business. Complexity, such as handling temperature-sensitive products, and the lack of interest among hospitals in switching purchasing relationships, will keep Amazon out of the business.Investors seemed to interpret the move as decreasing the likelihood that Amazon will enter the retail prescription business, giving a boost to CVS and Walgreens. If so, then Amazon investors apparently don't think the internet retail giant needs prescription drugs to win over and keep customer loyalty.Amazon could still enter the prescription business, such as via an acquisition of Walgreens.

39,UNH,"Tuesday's premarket trading received several shots in the arm. First was Netflix (NFLX), which surged after reporting strong first-quarter results late Monday. Then a cohort of blue chip names kicked in and posted early advances, following above-expectation quarterly results.The result: futures for the Dow Jones industrial average vaulted 1%. The S&P 500 traded 0.8% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures pressed 1.1% higher.Netflix was the premarket trading powerhouse, up more than 7% and easily the largest gainer among Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 stocks. Merck (MRK) bolstered the Dow in early trade, following an analyst upgrade. But the drugmaker quickly surrendered its lead as investors waded into an early batch of blue-chip earnings reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).The positive premarket trading poised the week-old uptrend to hurdle resistance. The uptrend is in good standing, carrying no distribution days. But the 50-day moving average remains the key test for all three major indexes. The Dow failed to hold above its 50-day line on Monday, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have yet to break back above the critical level of support.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePremarket action suggested the Dow and the S&P 500 would open above their 50-day lines. Keep in mind that futures-driven premarket trading does not always translate to action during the regular session.On the Dow, UnitedHealth rolled up an early 2.5% gain on first-quarter results that were stronger than expected. The stock retook its 50-day line of support with a 2.6% gain on Monday, attempting to start up the right side of a four-month consolidation.Also on the Dow, Merck buzzed ahead 2.1%, after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight, from equal weight. The drugmaker surged 2.6% in heavy trade Monday, after the company's lung-cancer treatment outperformed competitors in clinical trials. Merck is up 11% from an early April low and, like the overall Dow index, stands poised to test resistance at its 50-day moving average.Further down the list of early Dow advancers, Johnson & Johnson trimmed its early gain to 0.3%. The medical products leader reported first-quarter results in which earnings and revenue topped analysts' targets, and full-year guidance met or beat expectations.Goldman Sachs reversed an early loss, stepping up 0.9% after clobbering first-quarter earnings expectations and raising its quarterly dividend nearly 7%.  The stock has spent three days fighting resistance at its 50-day moving average.IBD Leaderboard stocks churned out some strong early moves, drafting Netflix's early advance. The streaming entertainment leader reported first-quarter sales and earnings only narrowly above consensus targets. But a blowout beat in subscriber growth surprised investors and launched shares higher in premarket trading. Netflix shares remain extended after a rebound from support at their 10-week moving average.Planet Fitness (PLNT) popped 1.6% ahead of the open.  The gym network ended Monday a bit more than 2% below a 40.14 buy point in a second-stage flat base.Leader peer Lululemon Athletica (LULU) pared its early surge back to 0.3% in premarket trading.

Retail sales surged 35.4%, while investment in education soared 26.9%. China's Commerce Ministry also announced its would impose 179% tariffs on sorghum imported from the U.S. The ministry said an investigation found the grain was unfairly subsidized by the U.S. government.March IPO IQiyi (IQ) jumped 2.3% in premarket trading. Shares of the Netflix-like platform advanced over the past six sessions, rising 9.7% above their March 29 IPO price.Housing starts jumped in March to an annualized rate of 1.32 million, the Commerce Department reported. That was a healthy uptick from February's disappointing 1.295 rate of home starts, startling economists who had projected a rate of 1.264 million new projects.Building permits, which gauge upcoming activity, posted an even larger increase — to an annualized rate of 1.354 million.

41,UNH,"Investors are running for the exit in anticipation of federal action against drug companies blamed for the opioid crisis.Drug distributors including Cardinal Health (CAH), AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and McKesson (MCK) extended losses for a second day as President Donald Trump pledged to lower drug prices ""very substantially in the not-so-distant future."" He said the Justice Department is considering ""major"" federal litigation against the companies involved in the crisis.Trump threatened to ""get tough"" on drug dealers, including using the death penalty in certain cases, while speaking yesterday in New Hampshire, one of the states hardest hit by opioid addiction. The Justice Department will decide by early April whether to join local governments suing makers of opioid painkillers.Endo International (ENDP), whose shares plunged as much as 11% on Tuesday, is among those being investigated by various U.S. states. Opioid distributors being investigated include AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson.""Much is unclear about a possible suit against the distributors, however the stocks clearly seem to be trending hyper-sensitively,"" Evercore analyst Ross Muken, who covers drug distributors, wrote in a note. ""It is possible there are parties proceeding to join or file lawsuits based on this.""Trump also reiterated his promise to lower drug prices, with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar saying his agency will be rolling out proposals in about a month.

42,UNH,"American Century Ultra Fund (TWCUX) got it right with Wabtec (WAB) — also known as Westinghouse Air Brake.The $11.4 billion portfolio is underweight in industrials, but its managers nonetheless made room for the locomotive equipment maker, starting in 2010. ""Wabtec fits our quality, durable-growth philosophy based on the management team, their track record and a business with a strong operating margin averaging 17% over the last five years,"" client portfolio manager Kevin Lewis told IBD. ""Further, the company has sustainable growth opportunities in aftermarket sales, which are high margin, and also due to strong demand for active safety and improved emission products that they produce.""On news of its agreement to merge with the diesel locomotive business of Dow Jones industrials veteran General Electric (GE) in an $11 billion deal, Wabtec was full steam ahead on Monday, chugging forward nearly 4%. Shares retreated 1% on Tuesday. It lost about another 1% on Wednesday and was up Thursday morning. That left the stock ahead about 19% for this year. Wabtec shareholders will own 49.9% of the combined company. Lewis said, ""We believe the structure of the merger makes sense and view favorably that Wabtec management remains in control and is leading the merged company.""The fund's managers hope to hit similar jackpots with other holdings in leading stocks such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Abiomed (ABMD). Those stocks have gained 73%, 35% and 106% respectively this year.Overall, the fund aims to invest in companies whose fundamentals are strong and getting better, but where growth is not fully reflected in their share prices.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseUltra Fund's success with that strategy is reflected in its 24.85% gain over the 12 months going into Wednesday. That outperformed 78% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.Ultra is a bottom-up portfolio. It invests stock by stock. Buys and sells are not dictated by sectors or macro factors. Still, there are some broad themes that make some industries more likely ponds for the managers to reel in catches.One is the technology sector, where the managers see lots of growth stock stories. Information technology ended Q1 as the portfolio's largest overweight. ""We continue to find strong growth opportunities through bottom-up fundamental analysis,"" managers Keith Lee, Michael Li and Jeffrey Bourke told shareholders in their latest commentary. In the first quarter, the fund added to its stakes in Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL).Netflix has IBD's highest-possible Composite Rating of 99. Stocks with a Composite Rating of 95 or higher are considered leaders. Netflix offers TV shows and movies to subscription customers via the internet.Netflix is the most-watched streaming service, viewed by 46% of respondents, up from 42% a year ago, according to a recent report by Morgan Stanley (MS). Original programming is the main draw for Netflix.Amazon Prime Video is the third most-watched streaming service. It now captures 30% of viewers polled by Morgan Stanley. That was up from 27% a year ago.Amazon's earnings per share were flat then grew 40% and 121% the most recent quarters. Trading around 1,584, shares are just above a 1,568.62 buy point.PayPal, a tech name to which the fund added, in November agreed to sell its U.S. consumer credit business to Synchrony Financial (SYF) for $5.8 billion. Last week, PayPal agreed to buy Sweden's iZettle for $2.2 billion. That would be its biggest acquisition since being spun off by eBay (EBAY).Potential new investors have balked at PayPal's high level of stock-based compensation, according to Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette.Health care is another sector where the managers find a lot of growth stories. The fund's overweight in health care vs. its Russell 1000 Growth Index benchmark was its second largest overweight as of March 31.""Valuations of drug and medical supplies companies have corrected, and we see opportunity where earnings growth is driven by innovation,"" the managers said in their commentary. ""Despite potential measures to control drug pricing, drug pipelines are robust, with ample clinical trial readouts.""A maker of cardiac pumping devices, Abiomed is another stock with IBD's best-possible Composite Rating of 99. Trading around 390, shares are extended from a 304.38 buy point in a late-stage base.The stock ranks No. 1 in IBD's medical-products industry group. In turn, that group ranks a very strong No. 3 out of 197 groups. Leaders in strong industries get that way by showing superior earnings growth and sales. Abiomed got to the top of its industry group in part by growing earnings per share in four straight years and by posting a 44% three-year EPS growth rate.In addition to Abiomed, holdings include Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Maximize Your Social Security Benefits: How To ApplyYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

S&P 500 futures nosed up 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures scratched out a 0.4% gain.Along with IBM, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Lam Research (LRCX), railroad CSX (CSX) and United Airlines (UAL) were among the leading names active in early trading.Medical and tech stocks had powered the market Tuesday, as the major indexes seized powerful gains in rising trade. Netflix (NFLX), Goldman Sachs (GS) and UnitedHealth (UNH) posted first-quarter results that all carried elements of upside surprise. Investors sent more stocks to news highs than any session in the past five weeks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all climbed above their 50-day moving averages in Tuesday's session. That technical line had presented a possible barrier to the market's week-old uptrend. The test through the remainder of the week is whether the benchmark indexes are able to maintain that new level of support.Among the top tech stocks in early motion, Intuitive Surgical bolted 5.4% higher. The maker of the da Vinci robotic surgical system reported a 25% EPS gain and an 18% rise in revenue for its first quarter late Tuesday. The number of surgical systems shipped soared 39% during the quarter, with procedures performed using the da Vinci system rising 15%.Intuitive's shares rose 4.7% in regular trade Tuesday, the stock's best session since January. Shares are more than two months into a new base, closing Tuesday less than 4% below the potential buy point at 452.10.Lam Research tumbled 6.6% in late action, despite a largely positive fiscal third-quarter report. The chip equipment leader's earnings swept up 71%; revenue jumped 34%. Both were above consensus targets. Q4 guidance also surpassed expectations. Lam is the first chip-sector name to report results during a season in which investors are feeling flighty about chip stocks in general.Lam shares surged 4.3% in Tuesday's regular trade. The stock has been consolidating for nearly six weeks.United climbed 3% in premarket trade. Its first-quarter revenue and earnings squeaked past analysts targets. Second-quarter guidance was positive. The company's quarterly conference call is set for 10:30 a.m. ET today.  United shares are consolidating, but have a long way to go before reaching a valid buy point.On the Dow, IBM dived 4.8% after Tuesday's close. The legacy tech brand posted stronger-than-expected Q1 results, and reported a second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth for the first time in more than four years. Full-year earnings guidance was just shy of consensus views, however. The stock has had little success in attempts to climb out of a 13-month consolidation.IBD 50 issue Interactive Brokers (IBKR) edged up 1.5% in premarket trade. The Greenwich, Conn.-based online broker reported larger-than-forecasts sales and earnings gains after Tuesday's close.  The stock closed Tuesday in a buy range, above a 74.21 buy point in a flat base.Morgan Stanley (MS), ASML Holding (ASML) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) are among the names reporting results early Wednesday.Wednesday's session also offers a simple calendar of economic releases.

45,UNH,"The health care industry is focused on moving care to the lowest-cost setting, with CVS Health (CVS) planning to reinvent its drug stores to offer a broader range of services after merging with Aetna (AET). Yet there's no more convenient or lower-cost place than a cell-phone app.X Teladoc (TDOC) shares have a hit a buy zone this week as the fast-growing telemedicine company said that it's seeing as many as 1,000 flu patients a day this season.Most of Teladoc's appointments are conducted via smartphone app, but they can also be done via computer or over the phone. Doctors can prescribe medicine too, if appropriate.Common conditions include sinus problems, respiratory infection, allergies, urinary tract infection, cold and flu symptoms and many other non-emergency illnesses, according to Teladoc, which also notes the CDC ""strongly encourages patients in communities facing an extreme outbreak of flu to call their doctor before running to an inpatient setting.""General medical ""visits"" cost $40, or about 50% less than a standard doctor's office visit. Teladoc appointments are covered by some plans from Aetna (AET) and other insurers, though limited reimbursement has been a central industry challenge.Teladoc reports earnings after the close on Tuesday, Feb. 27. In January, the company updated its 2018 outlook, saying it expects revenue to grow just over 50% to $350 million-$360 million, with total visits rising by one-third to 1.9 million-2.0 million. Teladoc shares are on a win streak, rising even as the stock market rebound has hit a bit of turbulence.Shares closed above a 38.50 buy point on Wednesday. Shares added another 0.4% to 38.80 on the stock market today. Teladoc has a 93 Relative Strength rating from IBD, meaning the performance and momentum of its stock tops 93% of other companies.IBD'S TAKE: When a stock hits a buy point, a rule of thumb is that investors should only buy the stock within 5% of the breakout point. When the stock market is in a confirmed uptrend, leading stocks that hit a buy point have their best opportunity for near-term gains. Make sure to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the current market trend, which alerts investors when it's time to get cautious, as it did on Feb. 1, before stocks saw their worst stretch of selling in a couple of years.In addition to the severe flu season this year, another potential catalyst for the company is the approval of the CHRONIC Care Act as part of the budget deal signed into law earlier this month.The legislation expands telehealth coverage under Medicare Advantage Plan B starting in 2020 and, beginning in 2019, lifts geographic limitations on the reimbursement of telehealth services in assessing the health of dialysis and stroke patients.""Tucked into the bill signed are the most significant changes ever made to Medicare law to use Telehealth,"" Sen.

46,UNH,"AmerisourceBergen (ABC) stock plunged Tuesday amid a report that the drug distributor's talks over a potential takeover by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) have collapsed. But there's still a strong urge among health care services firms to merge in the face of stiff competition, including an Amazon (AMZN)-led alliance.AmerisourceBergen stock shot up earlier this month on reports that Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina had met with his Amerisource counterpart Steven Collis to discuss a potential acquisition.But discussions have now ended without agreement, though insiders stressed the deal talks could once again resume, according to CNBC. The deal would likely have been valued at more than $25 billion, as Amerisource has a market cap of around $22 billion.AmerisourceBergen stock fell 2.9% to 97.64 on the stock market today, but well off session lows of 93.16 and settling above its 50-day moving average line.Walgreens stock lost 2.1%. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a five-year low.Walgreens Boots Alliance, America's biggest drugstore chain, already owns 26% of AmerisourceBergen.On Jan. 30 a mooted plan by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to form a nonprofit company sent CVS Health (CVS), AmerisourceBergen, Walgreens, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and other big health care companies sharply lower.Last year, Walgreens gave up on an effort to buy all of No. 3 drugstore operator Rite Aid (RAD) due to regulatory objections, instead acquiring less than half of the smaller rival's stores.Grocery giant Albertsons agreed to merge with Rite Aid in a $24 billion deal, acquiring the stores that Walgreens isn't buying. Albertsons, privately held for several years, will go public via this deal.Health care companies see the need for bigger size and scope to rein in costs and compete. CVS last year announced a still-pending $69 billion acquisition of health insurance giant Aetna (AET). CVS Health is the No. 2 drugstore chain and a top pharmacy benefit manager.The CVS-Aetna deal was widely seen as a way to compete with a possible Amazon entry, as well as match up better vs. insurance giant UnitedHealth, which has its own PBM.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen Takeover Talk Follows Sweeping Health Care DealsAmazon, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase Team On Health Care; CVS, UnitedHealth DiveBiotech And Pharma Industry News

49,UNH,"The Dow Jones industrial average stood head and shoulders above other key indexes at midday on Thursday, even after a mild pullback in early-afternoon trade.At 1:15 p.m. ET, the Dow gained 0.7% after rising more than 1% thanks to early two-point gains from at least 10 of the Dow's 30 components, including Home Depot (HD), Caterpillar (CAT), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and McDonald's (MCD).Home Depot and McDonald's are in base-building phase, and a well-built base could give investors a chance to buy at a key moment of market strength.Low weekly jobless claims helped sustain confidence in the U.S. economy, and comments by White House economic advisor Peter Navarro, broadcast on CNBC, apparently helped relieve anxiety over the potential for a major trade war.Bullishness among market pundits polled each week by Investors Intelligence, meanwhile, jumped this week to 54.9%, but optimism is not excessive. In mid-January, ahead of the early-February market sell-off, the bulls ratio reached as high as 66.7%.The Nasdaq composite erased an early-morning loss of 0.3% to turn more than 0.2% higher before slumping to the breakeven point. Overall, the intraday swing is light, though. The S&P 500 edged up less than 0.1%. Discount and variety retail, hospital, mining equipment, ethical drug and truck transport firms paced the upside. Volume is running slightly lower vs. the same time Wednesday on both main exchanges.The Dow transports is now up just 0.4% after being up as much as 0.7%.Despite the indexes' gains, breadth was slightly dour. Falling stocks beat gainers by more than 3-2 ratio on the NYSE and by fewer than 200 issues on the Nasdaq.Home Depot is trying to bottom out after falling more than 15% below a 207.60 all-time high. The do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me home improvement products chain had rallied 28% following a September breakout from a solid flat base with a 160.96 buy point.Home Depot sports a decent 87 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, boosted by a strong 92 EPS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99.McDonald's, which has dropped 18% from its all-time peak of 178.70, rallied nearly 2% and is trying to regain its critical 200-day moving average. The fast-food chain's 50-day line has been sloping lower for more than five weeks, a negative sign.When high-quality stocks rally 20% to 25% from a proper buy point, it's an excellent idea in terms of portfolio management rules to take at least partial profits. IBD research has found that many leading stocks will top out and begin a serious correction after rising 20% to 40% past a breakout point.Software remains an important growth theme in the stock market today. While Palo Alto Networks (PANW), a big stock market winner in 2015-16 and former Leaderboard stock, has shown renewed strength, its group peer VeriSign (VRSN) is also acting well.The former is aiming for a 14th gain in 15 sessions; at 189.30, the large-cap network security leader has risen nearly 21% from a base breakout at 156.95. The latter rose nearly 2% to 125.35 in volume running double its usual levels and has climbed nearly 6% past a 118.38 entry in an 11-week flat base.Four highly dynamic and fast-growing companies in the business software space maintain a position currently within Leaderboard.The Dow transports rallied 0.3% as Covenant Transport (CVTI) launched a breakout, gapping up at the open and rising nearly 18% to 32 in huge turnover. That move catapulted the trucking services firm past a 30.71 proper buy point in a five-month base.The 5% buy zone extends up to 32.24. Buying more than 5% past a proper buy point can hand a new investor the added risk of being shuffled out of the stock with a fast loss of 7%-8% during a normal pullback to or even slightly below the breakout price.The golden rule of investing is to cut losses short, even if a stock has a history of outperforming. You don't want to get caught with a stock that has finally topped after a huge price run.IBD's research on big stock market winners over the past century has found that when a true market leader breaks out, it rarely falls 7% to 8% below the correct buy point. But after a 10% or 15% move up or more, it's not uncommon for the stock to dip back and test holders' resolve. So if an investorThe base built by Chattanooga, Tenn.-based Covenant doesn't have the look of a well-formed cup-with-handle or a double-bottom, but the months long base was built on top of an even longer, deeper consolidation. The chart has elements of base on base patterns, which can be very bullish.The company has notched earnings gains of 56% and 52% vs. year-ago levels in the past two quarters as revenue rose 9% and 6%.

50,UNH,"Invisalign maker Align Technology (ALGN) shares popped after hours then quickly reversed as Wall Street digested earnings results.X Estimates: A 43% increase in per-share profit to 96 cents on 35% revenue growth to $395 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: Diluted EPS of just 13 cents, due to a negative impact of $1.06 per share from changes to the tax law. Adjusted, Align earned $1.19 a share. The company reported sales of $421.3 million. Total case shipments rose 34.2% to 255,000 during the quarter, with cases for teenage patients up 44.1% to 63,500.""Record Q4 revenues were up 43.7% year-over-year driven by increased Invisalign volumes across all geographies and customer channels, as well as by record iTero scanner revenue,"" said CEO Joe Hogan in a statement. ""Q4 Invisalign volume was up 34.2% year-over-year reflecting strong international growth from increased utilization and expansion of our customer base which included over 4,000 new customers for the third consecutive quarter.""Stock: Shares for the maker of clear dental aligner devices initially skyrocketed in late trade, then quickly reversed lower to trade down 3.5%. That's after sliding 2.4% to 270.08 in the stock market today. Earlier on Tuesday shares had tumbled as much as 11.5% and briefly sank below their 50-day moving average.Align's intraday breach of the key level violated the previous 266.51 buy point. However, since the stock regained support at the 50-day intraday, a show of strength in the wake of earnings results would have potentially translated to a fresh buying opportunity. Align has rallied more than 300% since its first stage breakout. The most recent base was third stage, which carries a greater risk of failure.IBD's TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Elsewhere in the health care space, Amazon (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shook up the sector with an announced plan to improve health care costs and services for their American employees.Health care and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) stocks sold off Tuesday, with CVS Health (CVS), UnitedHealth (UNH) and Express Scripts (ESRX) taking big hits.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Abiomed, Arista, Align, YY: How To Read A Stock Rebound3 Fast-Growing Sector Leaders Telling Different Stories Ahead Of EarningsChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

51,UNH,"Stocks rose early on Tuesday but the Nasdaq surrendered moderate gains to fall mildly. The Nasdaq composite, up more than 0.6% during the first hour of trading, slumped 0.5% right before lunchtime in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average, up as much as 0.7% after the open, edged slightly lower.Alphabet (GOOGL) helped lead the pullback, falling more than 1% to 1,153. The Google site operator and pioneer in self-driving technology is forming a new base after selling off hard in early February. The megacap internet content firm limited its decline to 17% from a 1,197 peak as shares found support at the 200-day moving average.Meanwhile, semiconductor shares also cooled but still show high relative strength.ASML (ASML) was off around 0.2% but at 210.95 the Dutch chip equipment giant still held above a 208.68 buy point in a three-month base on base, one of the most powerful chart patterns that top growth stocks form before breaking out to new highs and strong price advances.ASML has grown its earnings per share by 25%, 74%, 115%, 34%, 46% and 39% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters on revenue gains of 17% to 53%. As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the megacap member of IBD's semiconductor equipment firm gets a solid but not great EPS Rating of 88. Q1 profit is seen rising just 1% to $1.13 a share, burdened by a very big gain (115%) in the year-ago quarter.At the market get-go, investors applauded the arrival of tamer U.S. consumer price increases in the U.S. and looked past the sudden termination of President Trump's Secretary Of State, Rex Tillerson.The CPI index and the core index both showed a 0.2% rise in February, down from much bigger month-to-month gains in January.Within the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, just three names rose 1 point or more, including UnitedHealth (UNH), McDonald's (MCD) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).General Electric (GE) marked the Dow industrials' index's low end, down more than 3%. JPMorgan Chase reportedly cast doubt on the viability of GE's already reduced cash dividend. The industrial powerhouse is slated to pay shareholders 12 cents a share on April 25 to holders of record Feb. 26. That gives GE an annualized yield of 3.3%, vs. 1.8% for the S&P 500.GE holds a 3 Relative Price Strength Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, meaning it's outperformed just 3% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.The large-cap S&P 500 let gains of 0.4% slip to a 0.1% loss near lunchtime on Wall Street after finishing 0.1% lower on Monday. Yet the 500 continues to create a solid cushion above its 50-day moving average, a healthy sign for stocks. The Nasdaq composite, up 0.4% on Monday, hit new highs again with another 0.4% jump. The Nasdaq is aiming for an eighth straight advance.As noted in IBD's The Big Picture column, on Friday the Nasdaq spurted into new high ground, ending a six-session phase in which the market uptrend was under pressure. The current outlook is now back to ""Confirmed uptrend,"" which means that investors can actively search out breakouts in big volume by companies with high-quality fundamentals.The S&P SmallCap 600 edged 0.3% higher early before sliding to a 0.1% loss. At 972, the index is up 3.8% year to date.Among small caps, Canada Goose (GOOS) flew back above its key 50-day moving average as shares jumped more than 2% to as high as 33.87, then settled back. It's the second rebound back above the 50-day moving average, offering a new secondary buy point following an early-November breakout at 22.10.The seller of ultra-premium outerwear and cold weather apparel has been a stunning stock within the apparel and retail group, tripling in price since its March 16, 2017, IPO at 12.75 a share.Canada Goose cleared a first-stage cup with handle at 22.10 on Nov. 8, catapulting higher the next session on solid quarterly results (earnings up 32% to 29 cents a share, sales up 35% to $172.3 million). Last month, Canada Goose posted another solid quarter of growth with EPS up 38% and sales up 27%.The Street sees the small cap firm posting a net loss of 6 cents a share in fiscal Q4 ending in March vs. a net profit of 17 cents in the year-ago period. In the quarter ended June 2017, Canada Goose lost 13 cents a share.Despite the checkered bottom-line results over the past two years, influenced by the seasonality of its merchandise mix, Canada Goose gets a 95 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Lumentum (LITE) held on to Monday's strong gains and then some, rising 0.6% to 72.35. The expert in 3D sensors for smartphones and other optical communications components has cleared a 66.80 early entry point in a deep seven-month base and is 8% past that buy point.In February, the company reported a big turnaround in earnings, up 193% in the December-ended fiscal second quarter to $1.67 a share, ending a two-quarter slump in profits. Sales leapt 53% to $404.6 million.In a Feb. 6 IBD technology story, industry analyst and Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster noted that Lumentum management indicated 3D sensor revenue should more than double in the second half of 2018 over 2017.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, top industry groups, breakouts and financial markets.)RELATED:Do You Know The Golden Rule Of Investing?Finding Great New IPO Leaders: Who Are The Next Home Depot, Microsoft, Cisco, Google?The Latest In Investor's CornerWant To Sharpen Your Market Timing In Buying Stocks?

58,UNH,"Exchange traded funds' popularity keeps growing as investors plow money into the popular low-cost vehicles that offer access to a basket of stocks.X And that trend doesn't appear to be waning. The combined assets of U.S. ETFs surged to $3.6 trillion in January, according to the Investment Company Institute, up 38% from a year ago. And the total number of U.S. ETFs rose 7% to 1,853 from January 2017.In the 25 years since the launch of the very first ETF, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), there are now some 2,000 funds available across a variety of categories and styles.To gain further insight into ETFs, their potential benefits and growth outlook, we checked in with Todd Rosenbluth, senior director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. Before CFRA acquired S&P Global in 2016, Rosenbluth was director of ETF and mutual fund research in the U.S. for S&P Capital IQ. His previous experience includes managing editor of Value Line Mutual Fund Survey and financial advisor at Morgan Stanley.The full interview with Rosenbluth, who also discusses current trends in the ETF space, follows:IBD: Should an investor own ETFs, and why?Rosenbluth: Investors who want exposure to the stock or bond market should look to ETFs, which typically provide low-cost exposure to a broad investment category or a narrower thesis with the benefits of diversification and transparency. For example, rather than own just Merck (MRK), investors in Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) or Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF (FHLC) would hold Merck; its peers, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE); and companies in other related industries, including Medtronic (MDT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). Unlike in an actively managed mutual fund, investors can see daily what's in an ETF and determine if they think it continues to fit their portfolio.IBD: Are there too many ETFs out there?Rosenbluth: Approximately one-third of CFRA-rated ETFs came to market since March 2015. So we think (that before investing) investors should determine whether an ETF serves a legitimate investing purpose. If so, it's more likely to gain sufficient assets to be viable.Keep in mind that CFRA rates far more mutual funds than ETFs, with several dozen asset managers offering similar-sounding products. Given the sentiment shift toward lower-cost ETFs and away from more expensive mutual funds, CFRA expects more mutual funds to be closed or merged in response.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!IBD: What do you think could fuel further ETF growth — and what could hinder growth?Rosenbluth: Investor and advisor adoption of ETFs designed to support their asset-allocation needs is going to further drive ETF growth. Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) or iShares Core MSCI EAFE (IEFA) are examples of such well-diversified products. As more investors gain comfort with ETFs, money will continue to flow into both established and up-and-coming products.Some investors will always favor the mutual-fund wrapper, wanting active management. To address this, many large asset managers including Davis Funds, Legg Mason, PIMCO and Vanguard offer actively managed ETFs — another area of potential growth.IBD: Even though factor-based ETFs aren't new, ""smart beta"" continues to be a buzzword. What has contributed to the rising popularity of smart-beta funds?Rosenbluth: As actively managed mutual funds struggle to keep up with the returns of the S&P 500 or the MSCI EAFE index, investors are seeking an alternative. Smart-beta ETFs launched in the last three years, including popular Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity (GSLC) and iShares Edge MSCI MultiFactor USA ETF (LRGF), combine factor approaches to offer a diversified yet lower cost approach to quantitative investing.Here again, many large asset managers have expanded their ETF presence using smart-beta products in response to growing demand. In the last six months, JPMorgan U.S. Minimum Volatility (JMIN), Oppenheimer Russell 1000 Low Volatility Factor (OVOL) and USAA MSCI USA Value Momentum Blend Index ETF (ULVM) have launched. All of these are covered by CFRA Research.IBD: ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds have been in the news too. Do you think that's a lasting trend?Rosenbluth: ESG mutual fund assets have been quite sticky, even as many actively managed mutual funds slowly bleed assets in favor of index-based ETFs. We expect over time, ESG ETFs will gain traction as investors further embrace ETFs and put money to work focused on the conviction of their values.IBD: Any new trends you're seeing now?Rosenbluth: We're seeing investors look more closely at thematic ETFs. Unlike traditional sector or well-diversified ETFs, these ETFs focus on robotics, blockchain or other potentially long-term investment trends. These more narrowly constructed products — such as Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence (BOTZ), ROBO Global Robotics & Automation Index (ROBO), Reality Shares NASDAQ Nexgen Economy (BLCN) and Innovation Shares NextGen Protocol ETF (KOIN) — tend to charge a premium price relative to market-cap-weighted ETFs, but as more asset managers compete for investor interest, fees have and will continue to move lower.IBD: Which types of ETFs do you expect to outperform as interest rates rise?Rosenbluth: With equity ETFs, CFRA thinks more economically sensitive sectors, including financials and industrials, should benefit if rates rise due to a strong U.S. economy. Vanguard Financials Index ETF (VFH) and iShares Transportation Average (IYT) are a couple of examples.In addition, as interest rates rise, CFRA is focused on bond ETFs with limited interest-rate sensitivity. These low-duration products reduce the downside impact as the Federal Reserve raises rates. IShares 0-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond (SHYG) and SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Short Term High Yield Bond ETF (SJNK) are examples of short-term ETFs rated favorably by CFRA.IBD: Given the Feb. 5 market sell-off and early redemption of VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), what are your thoughts on VIX-tied volatility ETFs? Are they appropriate for any type of investors?Rosenbluth: VIX-based products are not rated by CFRA as we focus on ETFs that directly hold stocks or bonds and not derivatives. However, investors need to understand that inverse and leveraged ETFs can aggressively move without warning and losses can pile up quickly.IBD: Does XIV's early redemption mean it's harder for investors to manage risk — and if so, how does that affect how the market operates?Rosenbluth: XIV was an exchange traded note, not a traditional ETF as are the other products we've talked about. With ETNs, investors need to understand that there is issuer risk to consider on top of the usual investment risks. With an ETF that shuts down, investors get fair warning and can understand what's inside the portfolio. This helps them track what they will receive if they hold until the product closes. With XIV, the mechanics were much different and the road to closure was much shorter.It's important to note, however, that what happened with XIV was spelled out in its prospectus. So this is less an example of a larger market issue and more an example of why investors need to know exactly what they're getting involved with, particularly with leveraged, inverse and volatility products.IBD: What is a sound strategy for a long-term investor in ETFs?Rosenbluth: Long-term investors should regularly review what's inside the ETFs they're holding to understand how the securities fit going forward. Investors should also periodically rebalance their assets as positions do not move up or down in tandem. You should not necessarily stand still even with passively managed ETFs.IBD: How does CFRA assess ETFs — and how does that differ from other industry researchers?Rosenbluth: CFRA provides a forward-looking rating on more than 1,300 ETFs, combining holdings analysis with fund attributes, including expense ratio and technical analysis. What's inside an ETF and how much it costs is a bigger driver of future returns than its three-year track record or how well it tracks a typically unique index. ETFs that rate favorably to CFRA do so because we have confidence in the valuation and risk considerations of the holdings. We also compare ETFs with one another and separate from mutual funds, as the relevant metrics differ, while others compare active mutual funds trying to beat the S&P 500 with ETFs such as SPDR S&P 500 that seeks to replicate the index.Since our equity ETF ratings launched nearly 10 years ago, under the S&P Global umbrella, our top-rated ETFs have outperformed the S&P 500 index and the bottom-rated ETFs have underperformed. S&P Equity and Fund Research was acquired by independent research provider CFRA Research in late 2016.

Trade had been somewhat hampered by Christmas, New Year's and the Martin Luther King Jr. holidays.Although the S&P 500 lagged the other indexes midday Tuesday, technical action on the large-cap index improved. The Dec. 29 distribution day fell off the count because of cumulative price gains.A distribution day involves a loss in rising volume in a major index and points to institutional selling.

The largest U.S. carmaker expects profits to rise in 2019 and beyond, as it shifts its lineup toward more profitable, next-gen SUVs and trucks. Analysts had expected about $6.24 for 2017 and EPS declines in 2018 and 2019. Ford (F) went the other way, forecasting 2017 earnings of $1.78 per share, below estimates. It expects EPS to dip in 2018, to $1.45-$1.70. Ford said Monday it will invest $11 billion in electric vehicles over the next four years, more than doubling an earlier target. GM shares fell 2.1%, with Ford plunging 9.3%, below a recent buy point.Charles Schwab (SCHW) earnings per share and revenue both rose 14%, both meeting views.

Other health insurers rallied to new highs on UnitedHealth's strong report.Airbus (EADSY) had 1,109 orders last year, up 52% from 2016, beating Boeing (BA) for the sixth straight year.

Bank of America had mixed results, while Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup (C) results beat. As Bitcoin's value continued to shrink this week, Goldman CFO Martin Chavez said it was responding to clients' interest in the cryptocurrency, but exercising ""extreme prudence and caution."" He did not say anything about whether the bank, which has already said it would clear Bitcoin futures, would develop a crypto-trading platform of its own. BofA CEO Brian Moynihan said ""customers should be careful"" with cryptocurrencies.Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) stock rocketed 52% on Wednesday on a report that longtime partner Celgene (CELG) is in talks to acquire it.

In the Phase 3 trial, Merck's regimen significantly improved overall survival and progression-free survival as a first treatment vs. chemotherapy alone. Roche (RHHBY), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN), which have rival drugs, retreated Tuesday.Atlassian (TEAM) topped fiscal Q2 earnings and revenue estimates. But the collaboration software maker forecast current-quarter profit of 8 cents a share on revenue of $218 million vs. consensus estimates of 11 cents and $215 million. Analysts said the light guidance was due to annual salary increases and higher payroll taxes. Jefferies hiked its price target to 64 from 53 on expectations for better future cash flow growth.

Shares dove 6.45%.Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO), have been climbing after Bernstein analysts predicted 22%-24% year-over-year gross gambling revenue gains in Macau for January.

(FMC) 8.2% and Global X Lithium and Battery Tech ETF (LIT) 6.2%.American Express (AXP) will suspend its buyback program in the first half of this year, after a one-off write-down on some assets and a repatriation tax from the GOP's new tax bill dented fourth-quarter profits and capital.

75,UNH,"The growing trade spat between the U.S. and China slammed the major indexes early on Wednesday, but the Nasdaq composite bounced back into positive ground and lifted its peer indexes higher. The leading index turned an early loss of nearly 1.9% to a gain of 0.8% in afternoon trading. Tesla (TSLA) led some automakers into positive ground.Tesla stock accelerated its rebound and throttled more than 5% higher to 283.24 in heavy volume. While at least three of the five FAANG stocks also reversed higher, consumer and construction-related shares led the upside. So did defensive sectors, including drugstore, meat, generic drugs, dairy and confectionery firms.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 erased a 1.6% loss and reversed to a gain of 0.7%. For the third day in a row, the large-cap benchmark undercut the long-term 200-day moving average. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.5%, as at least seven of its 30 components were up 1 point or more. They included UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Home Depot (HD) and Apple (AAPL).In IBD Leaderboard, software, e-commerce and apparel firms continue to do relatively better. Retail chain Lululemon (LULU), which joined the Leaders list on Feb. 7, fell more than 1% to 87.52 in dull turnover. But the yogawear apparel leader remains more than 4% above a buy point near 84.The stock has advanced more than 38% since it cleared a bottoming base pattern at 64.91 in November.That bottoming base also served as a first-stage pattern. First- and second-stage bases tend to carry higher probabilities of success following a breakout from those bases.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseJust two of the Dow industrials' 30 components, industrial heavyweights Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT), sank 1 point or more as investors fretted over China's expansion of retaliatory tariffs to cover more agricultural and manufactured goods.Caterpillar, off 1% to 143.64, is still holding above the 200-day moving average but is now around 17% below an all-time high of 173.24. Watch to see if the construction and mining gear titan can bottom out and begin to form the right side of a potential new base.A properly formed base sets up a market-leading stock in a position to possibly break out to new highs and stage a solid run. But today, IBD's current outlook for U.S. equities remains ""Market in correction,"" so breakouts are understandably few in number.Floor & Decor (FND) is one of the rare big movers today, rising more than 5% to 55.06 in heavy volume.The flooring products retailer, which imitates Home Depot's large warehouse-style model, is now extended more than 5% past a 51.58 buy point in an eight-week cup-style base. It's best to buy a stock no more than 5% past the proper buy point; buying too high in price can subject an investor to a quick loss if the stock makes a temporary pullback to or even mildly below the breakout entry.Floor & Decor, now a mid-cap stock with a market value of $5.3 billion, went public in April 2017 at 21 a share. It has a float of 84 million shares and currently ranks No. 22 within the IBD 50. The company has grown earnings per share 9%, 75%, 47%, 31% and 58% vs. year-ago levels in the past five quarters. Sales jumped 25%, 31%, 29%, 27% and 40% over the same time frame.Going back to Tesla, the San Francisco-based firm still trades well below its 52-week peak of 389.61. Plus, the electric vehicle pioneer trades sharply below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. So the stock is nowhere close to a new IBD-style buy point.However, those who bought at the initial April 2013 breakout near 40 still hold a fantastic long-term gain.At this point, it makes sense to wait and watch for the possibility of heavy institutional buying to return. Trading near 280, Tesla is still an institutional favorite. The stock reached a total 1,000 mutual fund and hedge fund holders for the first time during the second quarter of 2016.That sponsorship has grown a bit more to 1,027 funds as of the first quarter of this year. In Q3 of 2017, that number reached 1,095 funds owning a total 54.4 million shares. Earlier this week, Tesla reported confidence in its goal to reach a significantly higher production rate of its Model 3 sedan within the next three months and said it has no plans to raise more capital via debt or equity offerings this year.The company said it built 2,020 Model 3 sedans in the final seven days of March and expects to see that run rate climb rapidly through the second quarter of this year.Tesla is racing to meet the mountain of 500,000 preorders made for the affordable all-electric four-door vehicle. The base price of the Model 3 is $35,000, but many new buyers are likely to add options.Elsewhere, homebuilding-related stocks advanced sharply following a blistering quarterly report from giant Lennar (LEN).

76,UNH,"The stock market wasn't able to apply the brakes on a sharp slide Monday and the Dow sank 2.5%, as the market's correction showed no sign of ending anytime soon.The Nasdaq composite plummeted 3%.

But those groups certainly had a lot of company, with 18 of 197 groups down more than 3% and nearly all groups lower except for three: homebuilders, gold miners and managed care companies.The homebuilding group's gain was misleading because it was entirely thanks to NVR (NVR). The Reston, Va.-based builder rose 3% to 2,891.58, causing the price-weighted industry group to show a gain, but nearly every other homebuilder was down in price.Gold prices rose more than 1%, which explained the miners' advance.

First-stage bases generally have a higher success rate than a third, fourth or fifth-stage pattern.Today, Apple shares are trying to climb back above the 50-day moving average. Watch for a new potential base to form.Boeing may also end up as another market outperformer in 2018, despite having already issued a defensive sell signal two weeks ago. The reason? The current correction has not been too deep.On Friday, the 737 and 787 airline jet maker rebounded 1.8% to halt a two-day selling skid and is just 12% below its all-time peak of 371.60.Second-quarter earnings are looking fierce, up 27% to $2.56 a share, as global demand for passenger jets continues to rise. China, India and Latin America remain high-growth markets.Sales are seen picking up 4% to $97 billion in 2018, following two years of decline, then accelerate 6% to $102.7 billion in 2019.Elsewhere, Five Below (FIVE) and Ferrari (RACE) deserve spaces on an investor's watch list.

79,UNH,"CVS Health (CVS), whose pending acquisition of Aetna (AET) will make it one of the biggeset U.S. companies based on sales, reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that topped Wall Street expectations, while guiding lower for 2018 due to its more aggressive spending plans.X The higher investment spending comes as CVS looks to reinvent its stores with a greater emphasis on providing health care services. Minute Clinics, of which there are now more than 1,100, may be equipped to draw blood, CEO Larry Merlo told analysts.Meanwhile, Merlo downplayed the threat from the Jan. 30 announcement that Amazon.com (AMZN), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) were joining together to try and  lower health care costs and improve transparency.""What that group aspires to is what we're going to deliver"" through the combination of CVS and Aetna, he said, adding that CVS is adopting an ""open-source"" model and is willing to partner with anyone, including Amazon.Estimates: Profit of $1.89 a share, up 10.5% from a year ago, on revenue growth of 3.4% to $47.54 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS of $1.92, up 12%, on revenue of $48.4 billion, growing 5.3% from a year ago.Outlook: CVS updated guidance, noting it will get ""$1.2 billion in cash benefits"" from the tax legislation and dedicate at least $275 million ""to additional investments in employees, data analytics, care management solutions, and service offering enhancements.""CVS also will spend ""at least half of the benefits on debt reduction as we look to lower our leverage ratio.""Due to its investments, CVS lowered its 2018 operating profit guidance from up 1%-4% to down 1.5% to up 1.5%.Stock: CVS opened slightly higher, then reversed lower and closed down 5.1% at 70.58 on the stock market today. The stock had been closing in on a 52-week high and a buy point, but got tripped up by Wall Street's seeming overreaction to the vague Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire news. The broad market pullback also has been a factor.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Analysts aren't quite sure if the new Amazon venture is a prelude to its entry into the retail prescription industry, the threat of which was seen as one of the motivating forces behind the CVS acquisition of Aetna. On its third-quarter earnings call in November, CVS announced that it would begin same-day delivery of prescriptions in certain metro areas this year and next-day delivery across the country, which could be a negative for store traffic and nonprescription sales.CVS said its additional investments paid for by tax cuts would initially focus on wage increases for its retail workers, such as pharmacy technicians, who will be relied upon to provide a greater range of services under the new retail model the company is developing. The combination of CVS and Aetna is a new take on the model pioneered by Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which combines the largest health insurer, prescription benefit management and a growing health-services empire that it's adding to with the pending purchase of the medical unit of DaVita for $4.9 billion, its fourth big deal in 2017.Merlo said that CVS and Aetna have begun integration planning and that the deal is on track to close in the second half of 2018.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:How Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

A market that keeps making fresh lows dampens the prospects for a new rally.

Items among the 128 include fruits, ginseng, nuts, wine, pork and some steel products.

China has not yet included a large range of major U.S. agriculture products, such as soybeans.A week ago, China called for talks with the U.S., but the Trump administration did not respond.Another concern for the stock market is President Trump's attacks on Amazon.com (AMZN). Trump recently tweeted that Amazon does not pay enough in taxes, is a burden to the U.S. Postal Service and is putting ""thousands of retailers out of business!""If that sounds like a Latin American populist, therein lies the problem.For populists, attitude means more than facts. As the New York Times noted, Securities and Exchange Commission documents say Amazon paid $412 million in income taxes in 2016 and $957 million in 2017.Amazon also collects and pays sales tax in every state that has a sales tax, the Times reported.Two manufacturing indexes reported March data.

90,UNH,"A solid concentration in top-performing stocks, including Facebook (FB,) Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Bank of America (BAC), and a strong fund management team have helped Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX) beat the S&P 500 and its large-growth Morningstar category in the past one, three and five years.X Those leading stocks, along with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), account for nearly a fifth of the $30 billion fund's assets.Since its inception in 2003, New Insights has been managed by the legendary Will Danoff, who ran it identically to its widely followed $134 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX). In 2013, John Roth, who also manages $8 billion Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock (FMCSX), joined as co-manager, bringing with him his midcap expertise. Since late 2015, Danoff and Roth have been splitting the management of the fund 60%-40%.The fund focuses on companies that have strong growth prospects, solid management teams and whose potential is misperceived by the public.""If we think Facebook can sustain 30% growth for longer than people think, or we see Mark Zuckerberg's genius ultimately being applied to Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, video ... we're not seeing anything that other people may not see, but we think the good news will last longer,"" Danoff told IBD.Having two managers may well be the reason why New Insights is more diversified at the top than Contrafund with top 5 holdings representing 17.3% vs. Contrafund's 24.1%. In addition, 26.7% and 37.9% of each fund's assets are in the top 10 holdings, further drawing the distinction.New Insight also holds nearly 10% more midcaps, is somewhat underweight technology and has a lower overweight in financials vs. the benchmark and its peers than Contrafund. Both sectors have been strong performers in the past several years.As a result, New Insight's performance has been trailing a bit that of Contrafund's, returning 22.91%, 11.89% and 14.35% the last one, three and five years vs. Contrafund's 27%, 13.45% and 15.92%. Both funds pulled back slightly in the recent, albeit short, market correction, but quickly recovered ground and are up 5.44% and 6.57%, respectively vs. the S&P 500's 2.41% year to date.Regarding concerns that we're late in the economic cycle, Danoff notes the differences between now and conditions that led to bear markets like 2008-09.""The starting point (after the crisis) was quite drastic,"" said Danoff. ""So even though we've had this long economic expansion, I don't feel like people are high-fiving themselves. Up until very recently, most companies were managing their costs conservatively and controlling their capital spending. ... The world is much more global, U.S. companies are able now to sell their products all over the world and the big companies in the S&P 500 are now much less capital intensive, so they're high margin, high growth and they're highly cash generative.""But it's not just the top hot stocks that determine a fund's longevity and strong performance. Other winning names include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), PayPal (PYPL), Visa (V), Estee Lauder (EL), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and United Health (UNH), each of which soared between 40% and 87% last year, compared with the S&P 500's 21.8% return.Netflix, which the fund has owned since early 2015, has been benefiting from a strong international momentum for its brand and stronger-than-expected subscriber additions in the U.S. and overseas."" Netflix is crushing it overseas,"" said Danoff. ""They have some pricing power, the service is outstanding and it's a subscription model offering great value.""The top name for creative design programs, Adobe has successfully transitioned to a recurring revenue model by moving its product lineup to the cloud. Last month, the company said that its longtime CFO Mark Garrett will be retiring, though he'll stay on until they find a replacement. Adobe's earnings jumped at least 40% in each the past four quarters, while revenue increased 22% to 27%. The company also raised its fiscal Q1 and 2018 guidance after adjusting for President Trump's tax cuts. Adobe's stock is up 12.5% year to date.Cosmetics giant Estee Lauder has been experiencing strong growth. Its most recent Q2 results saw a 25% EPS rise on sales that grew 17%, primarily driven by strong advances in its skin care product lineup. Analysts expect the company to grow its market share from a current 15% as the company further builds out its e-commerce business. It also stands to benefit from the recent tax reforms. The stock is up 9.8% this year.Customer relationship software maker Salesforce.com (CRM), which rallied 49.3% last year and has risen 6.6% so far in 2018, stands to benefit from a growing product offering and low customer attrition despite strong competition in the sector. The company earnings accelerated in the past two quarters, jumping 63% in the most recent one. Sales grew 25%. Salesforce.com also raised its 2018 sales guidance to $12.5 billion and plans to reach $20 billion by fiscal 2022. Earnings guidance was also upped. It is due to release its next earnings report Feb. 28.In the midcap arena, the fund holds names such as Under Armour (UA), U.K.-based Metro Bank and LogMeIn (LOGM). The fund bought Under Armour last quarter as a starting position and Roth says they'll continue to work on it going forward.""It's a great brand, the stock got to be pretty expensive and expectations were pretty high, they struggled a bit and they got massively re-priced, the Street turned on them and investors turned on them, and then it became an interesting opportunity. ... The ultimate bet is that brand's still good.""RELATED:In A Volatile Market: Go To Cash Or Stay The Course?

91,UNH,"AmerisourceBergen (ABC) stock shot up late Monday on a Wall Street Journal report that Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) is in early talks to acquire the drug distributor.X That follows a late 2017 deal by drug store-and-pharmacy benefit manager CVS Health (CVS) to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET). That CVS-Aetna deal was seen as a pre-emptive move to head off competition from Amazon.com (AMZN). Amazon last month teamed up on Jan. 30 with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to work to lower health care costs for their employees.Walgreens Boots Alliance, the No. 1 drug store owns 26% of AmerisourceBergen, which had a $19.6 billion market cap at Monday's close.Amerisource shares shot up 17% to 105 before the opening bell on the stock market today. Walgreens was not active.The Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire plan to form a non-profit company, though in the early stages, sent CVS Health, AmerisourceBergen, Walgreens, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and other big health care companies sharply lower on Jan. 30.Last year, Walgreens gave up on an effort to buy all of Rite Aid (RAD) due to regulatory objections, instead acquiring less than half of the smaller rival's stores.Health care companies see the need for bigger size and scope to rein in costs and compete.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Health Care Disruption Fears Clash With This RealityCVS: 'We're Going To Deliver' What Amazon, JPMorgan, Berkshire Seek To DoAmazon, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase Team On Health Care; CVS, UnitedHealth Dive

93,UNH,"Stocks took a well-deserved break in afternoon trading Wednesday, yet the major indexes held losses modest in afternoon trading. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) continued to show market-leading action as shares move sideways after an Oct. 27 breakout.X Apple, one of the big-cap leaders of 2017, is down roughly 1% for the week following a 3.4% lift in the first trading week of 2018.Yet, more importantly, the mega-cap iPhone, iPad and digital services play has held nicely above a 160.97 buy point in a good cup with handle that the stock formed from early September to late October. A strong rebound off the 10-week moving average, currently near 172, offers a chance for buyers at the earlier buy point to add a small amount of shares to a winning position.Watch to see if volume also increases to the upside. The current daily average volume over the past 50 sessions for the consumer electronics giant is 28 million shares.Apple gained as much as 10% past the key 160.97 cup-with-handle entry and remains too far extended from that buy point. Following IBD's CAN SLIM stock selection system means buying no more than 5% past a proper buy point after a stock breaks out. The reason: You don't want to get shaken out at the wrong time.In that base, the correction of just 9.6% from the intraday high to intraday low was unusually shallow. In most cases, a cup with handle will show a decline from head to toe of 12% to as much as 33%. In some rare cases, the decline can reach 40% to 50% after a superlative prior price run.The 160.97 entry derives from adding 10 cents to the highest price within the handle, or in Apple's case the intraday high seen on Oct. 17. Apple broke out eight sessions later, surpassing the top of a handle just ahead of reporting a 24% jump in fiscal fourth-quarter profit to $2.07 a share (its biggest year-over-year gain in eight quarters) and a 12% rise in revenue to $52.58 billion.At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite remained off a bit more than 0.3% as sellers dominated among chipmaking and semiconductor equipment stocks. Lam Research (LRCX), a former IBD Big Cap 20 stock and big winner in 2017, fell more than 2% to 192.12 in fast turnover after trying to climb back above the key 50-day moving average on Monday. Despite a two-day drop, the expert in silicon wafer etching systems is clearly forming a new base.The S&P 500 was down almost 0.3%. Solid gains in airline, bank, department store, steel, metal ores, movie and gaming shares helped limit the downside. Last week, the large-cap benchmark rallied 2.6% on top of a 19.4% advance in 2017.The Dow Jones industrial average edged less than 0.2% lower, helped by strength in General Electric (GE) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Results from JPMorgan are due Friday before the open.JPMorgan broke out of a flat base with a 95.32 buy point on Sept. 21 and has risen as much as 16%.Besides Apple, the only other component in the Dow down 1 point or more is UnitedHealth (UNH). The managed care giant has carved a shallow five-week flat base that shows a 231.87 buy point.UnitedHealth, which garners a $216 billion market value, initially broke out all the way back in September 2010, clearing a 33.89 buy point in a saucer with handle. It created new bases along the way, providing additional correct entry points in the stock.Elsewhere in other financial markets, the rush out of U.S. government bonds got a boost on reports that China, a heavy buyer of Treasury securities, is mulling fewer purchases in the future. That actually is not new news, but the Bloomberg report still appeared to weigh on bond prices.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose to 2.58%, roughly 60 basis points above the 2-year note and 115 basis points above 3-month Treasury bill yields.Dividend-heavy utilities continue to sell off. Dominion Energy (D) dropped more than 1% to 76.07 in volume running 59% above average. A few weeks ago, the stock took out its 50-day moving average in heavy volume, a sell signal for most stocks.Be wary of buying high-yield stocks on the way down; it's no different from catching a falling knife among high-octane issues.The Dow utility average, which slid 3.1% last week, fell another 1.1% in the stock market today.Crude oil continues to climb, as WTI near-term futures ramped up 0.5% to $63.29 a barrel. In addition to constrained supply amid stricter production quotas being enforced by OPEC and Russia and low U.S. crude inventories, other factors for the rise may have to do with the fact that cash coming out of debt securities needs to find a new home.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) fell nearly 4% to 2,080 in dull turnover as its base building work continues. It lies 40% off a 3,522 all-time peak.Back to Apple, fiscal first-quarter results are due Feb. 1 after the close.Apple had a glorious first quarter in the market last year. On Jan. 6, the stock broke out ahead of quarterly results when it cleared a 118.12 buy point in a bottoming base and first-stage cup with handle. A few weeks later, Apple soared on better than expected results. That report led to a sustained turnaround in fundamentals.The gain from that initial 118.12 entry point has so far reached 50%.Wall Street expects growth in the top and bottom lines to continue. This boosts the prospects of further capital appreciation this year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 12% vs. a year ago to $3.77 in the October-to-December quarter on a 10% lift in revenue to $86.17 billion.In fiscal Q2, expect growth to accelerate. Earnings may rise 39% to $2.92 a share on a 30% jump in revenue to $68.75 billion.Institutions savor the shares of companies that can accelerate their growth.Apple gets a positive Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B- on IBD Stock Checkup, while the Relative Strength Rating is good at 83. The EPS Rating of 90 on a scale of 1 to 99 is a remarkable improvement from a 45 all the way back on Jan. 1, 2017. RELATED:How To Find The Correct Buy Point For All StocksStocks Near A Buy ZoneWhich Hot Growth Stocks Are Leading The Market?

95,UNH,"A good economy had the odd effect of sinking the S&P 500 on Monday, amid concerns about higher prices and borrowing costs as central banks remove the crutches intended to support rebounds in the U.S. and abroad.X But for the individual companies in the S&P 500 index, quarterly results — that more granular measure of customer attitudes and one of the main drivers of any stock — are surpassing Wall Street forecasts at a particularly high rate, one not seen since the previous decade.The above-the-bar results have been helped, as ever, by tech, health care and financials, including Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC) UnitedHealth (UNH) and Mastercard (MA). But companies like DowDuPont (DWDP) and Eastman Chemical (EMN) have led suppliers of materials higher. Industrials — minus long-ailing General Electric (GE) — also look solid after a long drought.Among the 322 S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far this earnings season, 78% topped Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data released Thursday. Eighty percent beat estimates for revenue.That's the best rate of above-estimate earnings since the third quarter of 2009, according to Thompson Reuters. For sales, it's the best since at least 2002.S&P 500 earnings are currently on track to deliver a 14.7% gain, with revenue up a robust 8%. That assumes that the remaining S&P 500 companies due to report will meet estimates.Analysts also appear optimistic about first-quarter earnings, even as the prospect of higher wages touches off investor fears of inflation, and economic growth stirs anxieties that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in raising interest rates to keep that growth honest.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Still, the global recovery has brought new demand for technology, energy and infrastructure. And a rebound in oil prices has boosted demand for equipment of all kinds, lifting industrials and, in turn, demand for the suppliers of chemical materials.In the stock market today, the S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq composite sold off yet again as Treasury yields hit multiyear highs. Stocks rallied strongly to start 2018 in part on expectations for strong, broad earnings growth.Within Thomson Reuters' Materials sector, which includes companies like DowDuPont and Eastman, 94% of companies have beat on earnings for the most recent quarter — the highest percentage of all 11 industry sectors measured by the firm. Eighty-one percent of companies in the Materials segment have beat on revenue.Even as the troubles deepen at General Electric, which has weighed on growth in the industrial sector as it tries to focus more on aviation, power and health care — that segment overall has remained solid. Seventy-four percent have beat on earnings, 81% on revenue.GE earnings per share slid 41% in the fourth quarter. It faces an SEC investigation, and one analyst said the company could be removed from the Dow.Within the technology sector, 85% of technology companies have beaten earnings estimates, led by companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), CA (CA), Intel (INTC) and Xilinx (XLNX). Ninety percent beat on revenue, amid strong growth in semiconductors and semiconductor equipment.More tech companies are also bringing in bigger businesses as consumers.""You're seeing a transition from consumer-based to business-based, which is a big driver,"" Aurelio said. ""So you're seeing things like data-center growth.""In the Consumer-Discretionary category, where around three quarters of companies have produced above-the-bar results, Amazon (AMZN) last week turned out earnings far ahead of analyst expectations, helped by the GOP's new tax law and the broader migration to e-commerce and smart devices.""Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,"" CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement at that time. ""We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down.""Earnings from 89% of companies in Thomson Reuters' Health Care segment — which includes biotech, pharmaceuticals and health care services — came in above analyst views; 91% beat on revenue.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, was among them. But the companies that surpassed earnings estimates by the widest margin were pharma distributor Cardinal Health (CAH), ResMed (RMD) and Align Technology (ALGN), the maker of Invisalign dental braces.Those earnings follow a 2017 that BMO analyst Matt Borsch (who follows managed care companies, hospitals and other care providers) characterized as mediocre, in terms of volume — or the number of inpatient admissions, outpatient procedures, and doctor and emergency-room visits.But more of that volume, he said, has been packed into the end of the fourth quarter, as more people meet their deductible on their high-deductible plans, which have become increasingly common.""When you have the high-deductible health plans, you generally have a pretty strong dynamic of people, on average, increasing their utilization significantly after they've met the deductible, and therefore that is why you see that more late in the year,"" he said.The companies who have reported so far, largely, aren't benefiting from low expectations, either. Expectations have remained relatively similar for earnings this quarter compared with quarters past and were a tad higher for revenue, Aurelio said.As investors make their way through fourth-quarter results and the market's volatility, the outlook for the first quarter remains not so bad.""Typically as you get closer to the next earnings season, the expectations decrease,"" Aurelio said. ""So we'd see the growth rate for Q1 normally drop, and it's been going up.""At the beginning of the year, he said, expectations were for 12.2% earnings growth in the first quarter. On Thursday, growth expectations were for 17.8%. That's despite lowered guidance from Apple (AAPL) and many iPhone chip suppliers.""So that's a pretty bullish signal,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Will Stocks Repeat The 2011 Bear Sell-Off?Big Wage Gain Sinks Stocks, Bonds: 3 Reasons To Doubt The DataDid Congress, Trump Just Crush The Stock Market Rebound?Will Brokerages Receive Fresh Lift From Tax Reform, Rate Hikes?ObamaCare Exchange Enrollment Shows Surprise Gain, Despite Trump's Attacks

98,UNH,"The Dow Jones industrial average paced mild gains Tuesday as eight of its 30 components, including Boeing (BA), health care sector leader United Health (UNH) and Caterpillar (CAT) jumped 1 point or more. Boeing, rising 5.72 to 337.48, gave a strong signal that its long-term rally is far from over.Technically, though, the maker of passenger airliners and airplane bombers still triggered a short-term sell signal Wednesday, when shares cut through the 50-day moving average in heavy turnover. It was the first such trip below the medium-term support line since Boeing's first-stage breakout at 139.55 in late October 2016.The Dow Jones industrials gained 0.5%, while the Nasdaq added nearly 0.3%. The S&P 500 rose less than 0.2%. Big rallies among solar, desktop software, Canadian oil and gas, computer networking, specialty enterprise software and fabless semiconductor shares offset a sell-off among wholesale drug distribution, food, automobile retailing, steel, hospital and long-term medical care firms.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF jumped 1.7%.Ten of the 12 names on Leaderboard, a hand-picked selection of top growth stocks with daily and weekly charts annotated in real time by IBD's markets team, saw gains of 1% or more Tuesday.Breadth was negative on both main exchanges, a curious divergence amid the gains by the major indexes. Falling stocks beat gainers by a nearly 5-4 ratio on the NYSE and 15-to-14 on the Nasdaq.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating of E on the S&P 500 (see it via the General Market Indicators page link at the bottom of IBD's daily Big Picture column) reflects the huge volume seen in down days from the early-February correction.This proprietary IBD rating covers 13 weeks' worth of price-and-volume action. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, shows a neutral C grade. If the market can keep its uptrend going, both of these Accumulation grades should improve over time.Going back to Boeing, at least two key technical reasons exist to indicate that the aerospace industry leader is still in the early to middle innings of a grand secular rally. One, during last week's sell-off Boeing did undercut its 10-week moving average but bounced a bit off the week's lows. Volume turned in 36% above average, not quite meeting the 40% threshold that commonly is met by longtime market leaders that finally top out and register a significant decline.Two, Boeing has already rebounded more than 2% so far this week and lies just 2% below its 10-week line at around 344.19. Watch to see if volume is light, though. A stock that sells off hard after making a long price run-up and recently notching new highs, then makes timid rebounds in lighter turnover, is serving a new sell signal.A third reason to be bullish about Boeing's long-term prospects? Improving fundamentals. The megacap transport and defense supplier play has posted strong profits for six quarters in a row, and the Street sees first-quarter earnings ramping up 31% to $2.64 a share.Revenue rose 2% and 9% vs. year-ago levels in the past two quarters, ending a four-quarter streak of declines.A fourth reason: Institutional sponsorship has been rising over the medium term. Mutual and hedge funds owning shares in Boeing have risen from 2,067 at the end of March 2017 to 2,325 at the end of December.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Boeing holds a decent 80 RS Rating and a poor Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D- on a scale of A (heavy net institutional buying) to E (heavy selling). Obviously, for now, these two technical indicators are in conflict. So investors in Boeing need to pay close attention to the current chart action. Further declines in accelerating volume would point to a higher likelihood that a truly significant decline is in the wings and could lead to the forming of a brand-new base.Elsewhere, Twitter (TWTR) slid more than 10% to 31.35 in volume that ran 159% above usual levels. Watch for a potential test of the social media network's fast-rising 50-day moving average.Twitter, which posted a 2% revenue rise in Q4 that ended a three-quarter drought, is still up sharply since clearing a cup-without-handle pattern at 20.98 in late October.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on breakouts, growth stocks, the economy and financial markets.)RELATED:Here Is The Sell Signal That Boeing Triggered Last WeekThe Latest Inside Investor's CornerHow Can You Find The Next Apple?

100,UNH,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose slightly early Monday morning. Several top-rated stocks that were notable winners in 2017 are moving toward fresh buy points. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), IPG Photonics (IPGP) and Arista Networks (ANET) are five stocks that have formed bases recently and are approaching entries.XWal-Mart Stores and UnitedHealth are both Dow industrial components, each doubling the S&P 500's performance in 2017.  The latter three all more than doubled last year. Tencent Holdings is one of a slew of top-rated Chinese stocks near buy points. Laser maker IPG Photonics is on IBD's Rising Profit Estimates list while Arista Networks is an IBD 50 member.S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose less than 0.1% vs. fair value. Dow futures were up 0.2%.Wal-Mart Stores has been trading in a narrow range since hitting 100.13 on Nov. 17, a day after gapping up 11% on third-quarter earnings. Shares have trended up slightly for the past four weeks, rising as high as 100.38 on Friday, just exceeding a 100.23 flat-base buy point, before settling to close at 100.13.As Wal-Mart has consolidated, the Relative Strength line has drifted lower, reflecting the S&P 500 index's modest outperformance over that time. But the RS line did rise modestly for most of last year, as booming online sales and other steps convinced investors that Wal-Mart would be a survivor in the age of Amazon (AMZN) and even pose real challenges to the e-commerce giant.Wal-Mart rose 43% in 2017 vs. the S&P 500's 19% advance.Ideally, Wal-Mart would blast past its buy point in heavy volume, pushing the RS line to confirm the breakout and signal institutional support.Tencent Holdings is a Chinese messaging and online gaming giant, operating the uber-app WeChat. Tencent is the archrival of Alibaba (BABA) and owns a stake in JD.com (JD) and several other notable Chinese companies, as well as Tesla (TSLA).Tencent shares shot up 114% last year. Not surprisingly, the RS line climbing steadily during the year, reaching a recent peak on Nov. 21, when Tencent hit a record 56.05.  Shares fell sharply to the 50-day line but found support and quickly rebounded.Tencent rose 7.6% last week, far outpacing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, closing at 55.87 and finishing a 6-week cup base.UnitedHealth has just carved out a short flat base with a 231.87 buy point. Shares rose 3.75% last week to 228.73, setting a record close on Friday.The stock's RS line gradually rose from late February to the end of November. UnitedHealth's RS line is moving closer to that old high.IPG Photonics has just completed a cup-base pattern going back the minimum six weeks, giving it a 248.33 buy point. IPG Photonics tumbled from record highs in late November and early December. Shares then began to rebound, but for the rest of 2017 held below the still-rising 50-day line. IPG retook its 50-day line on Tuesday and then kept rising, surging 13% for the week to 242.34.IPG Photonics' RS line advanced in 2017, especially from July to late November. IPG shares leapt 117%Arista Networks was a huge 2017 winners, sprinting 143%.The stock is now in a cup-with-handle base with a 241.60 buy point. Handles offer a chance to shake out weak holders before the stock blasts out of a base. But the handle largely formed as the rest of the market had big gains, pushing the RS line lower last week despite a fractional stock gain. Ideally, the RS line should confirm at least a short-term high, like a handle, on a breakout. That might be challenging for Arista, unless it advances while the market pauses.Arista Networks closed Friday at 236.77.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Top Techs Are Near Buys — Now Study The ChartsAdobe, PayPal Lead 5 Stocks Near Buy Points With Rising Earnings EstimatesThe Top 16 China Stocks Surge, In A Fast-Moving Start To 2018Bitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetDepartment Stores, Malls In 2018: Amazon Will Let You Live — For Now

Two of the week's front runners among IBD 50 stocks, Daqo is up nearly 15% for the week, extended and trekking to new highs after an October breakout.  Floor & Decor has a 10% gain in the holiday-shortened week, putting it 7% above a 46.34 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Telecom gear maker Adtran (ADTN) dived 13% before the open. The company warned its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue would come in far short of analyst expectations, due to a ""merger-related review"" and by a spending slowdown by a key customer.

103,UNH,"U.S. stocks remained broadly lower at midday Tuesday in what appears to be a perfectly normal pullback after stunning gains earlier this month. Commodity plays helped pace the downside as agricultural chemical, oil and gas exploration, oil drilling, metal ores and steel shares fell hard.X Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, fell for the fourth time in five sessions. At 165.94, the largest company on the Nasdaq by market cap is now 4% below its 50-day moving average, which flattened out last week. Gains from an Oct. 27 breakout from a good second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 have now been squeezed to 3.4%, and shares are down more than 5% from the 176.34 buy point.Apple's 1.2% slide weighed on all three major indexes, with the Nasdaq composite down 0.9%, the S&P 500 off 1% and the Dow Jones industrial average sinking 1.3%.At least eight of the 30 components within the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2 points or more, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Goldman Sachs (GS), 3M (MMM) and McDonald's (MCD). Yet even with Tuesday's decline, at 26,198 the Dow stands 8.3% higher since Jan. 1.McDonald's posted a 19% jump in adjusted fourth-quarter profit to $1.71 a share. But sales dropped 11% to $5.34 billion, the biggest year-over-year drop since the first quarter of 2015.Nevertheless, shares of the fast-food icon have performed well since clearing a long saucer with handle at 130.10 in late March, rolling up more than 38% from that breakout point. As seen on a weekly chart, it continues to hug its slowly rising 10-week moving average (painted in red in all IBD and MarketSmith charts).On Monday, the Nasdaq notched its third distribution day, or instance of heavy professional selling, and its second in four sessions. Keep track of the distribution count for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 by reading The Big Picture column on a daily basis. When the current outlook for the market changes, you'll have a good strategy and motivation to take action to either sell stocks and reduce exposure, or hold on to your positions.At this point, a new investor in Apple shares has to decide where to draw the line in the sand. When a stock has gained 10% or more following a sound breakout, a good rule of thumb is to sell shares for a small profit to prevent a complete wipeout of gains. The stock can always be bought back when market conditions improve.From a longer-term point of view, however, Apple is still acting just fine.On Jan. 6, 2017, the iPhone, iPad and digital services giant broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12. By Jan. 18 of this year, shares rose as much as 52.5%. Over the same period, the Nasdaq composite rallied 32%. The S&P 500 also trailed, rising 22.9%. The S&P SmallCap 600 rose just 14.5%.Over that ascent, Apple survived normal-looking sell-offs that sent shares temporarily below the 50-day moving average in June and September. Notice on a long-term weekly chart how Apple did not venture too far below the 10-week moving average, which moves in similar form with the 50-day on a daily chart.Elsewhere in the stock market, investors sought to accumulate shares in select names in business and medical software. Workday (WDAY) rose more than 3% to 120.75 in volume running nearly double its usual levels. The stock is now slightly extended after breaking out of an eight-week cup with handle at 114.98.Find the correct buy point in this pattern by adding 10 cents to the highest price within the handle, which is 114.88.Paycom Software (PAYC), which also excels in the HR and payroll automation and outsourcing markets, erased mild early losses to edge slightly higher. At 92.69, the Oklahoma City-based firm has gained 7.5% after a Jan. 12 breakout past an 86.20 entry in a good flat base.Defensive industries including hospital, nonalcoholic beverages, soap and meat rallied.Back to the downside, Pulte Group (PHM) gapped down and dropped more than 3% to 32.18 in active turnover. The stock closed below its 50-day moving average on Monday for the first time since a breakout past a 24.53 buy point in a flat base in June 2017, marking a key sell signal.The homebuilder reported a 27% rise in Q4 profit to 85 cents a share, matching the consensus view. Revenue rose 12% to $2.79 billion, missing the Thomson Reuters estimate.A large number of Pulte's industry peers have also slid sharply below their 50-day lines, including NVR (NVR), LGI Homes (LGIH) and Toll Bros. (TOL). But a few reversed nicely off their lows, a good sign.After a healthy breakout and substantial price run, a sharp undercut below the 50-day line and failure to recover back to the support line is a key IBD defensive sell rule to help you preserve your profits.As a two-day Federal Reserve meeting on interest rate policy began on Tuesday, bond traders did not seem to actively seek bargains even after the recent sell-off in Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond is currently at 2.71%.The 3-month Treasury paper has a yield of 1.42% and the 2-year note a yield of 2.12%; thus, the yield curve continues to maintain a positive slope.The Building sector ranks No. 3 among 33 sectors as ranked by mid- and long-term relative price performance as of the latest IBD Weekly print edition. However, the sector is also down more than 2% since Jan. 1, so it's actually severely lagging the broader market. See the entire sector rankings via the stock research tables inside IBD Weekly (beginning on page B5) as well as by going to IBD Data Tables in ""Stock Lists"" at Investors.com, then clicking on IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables.Key earnings reports after the close on Tuesday include Illumina (ILMN), Align Technology (ALGN) and Electronic Arts (EA).Illumina, the expert in genetic data analysis equipment, is expected to post a 44% jump in Q4 profit to $1.22 a share. That would mark the biggest year-over-year increase since a 72% gain in the first quarter of 2015.In the prior four quarters, Illumina showed a 5% EPS increase, declines of 11% and 5%, and a 14% gain.Illumina, down just 0.5% to 240.40 in light turnover, has rallied in steady stair-stepping fashion after breakouts past a 12-week flat base at 189.58 on Aug. 2, 2017, and from a base-on-base breakout past 214.44 on Nov. 22.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary and analysis of breakouts, growth stocks, and financial markets.)RELATED:Can You Really Spot Major Market Tops?

107,UNH,"Major stock indexes turned negative in late-afternoon trading Tuesday, not a surprise given the ebullient gains during the first two weeks of trading in 2018.X The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both showed losses of around 0.4% to 0.5% after rising as much as 1% and 0.8%, respectively. The 500 breached 2800 for the first time. The Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.2% after rising as much as 1.1% in the early going.At one point, at least nine of the 30 components in the Dow industrials advanced 1 point or more, By around 3 p.m. ET, however, only three stocks in the Dow were up 1 point or more, and all three hailed from the health care arena: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK) and UnitedHealth (UNH).Merck gapped up nearly 6% to 62.07 in quadruple normal turnover on good news regarding a potential treatment involving Keytruda with two additional medicines for lung cancer. For now, Merck continues to be in base-building mode.Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was running sharply higher vs. the same time on Friday.Meanwhile, Bitcoin and other alternative digital currencies continued to cool off. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) gave back most of Friday's rebound, losing 10% to 1,763. However, the overall picture of the fast-rising exchange-traded note has not changed. It's been in a normal correction since peaking at 3,523 on Dec. 19, and Tuesday marks the start of a fifth week of digesting the superlative gains seen in the fourth quarter of last year.On Nov. 22, Bitcoin Investment Trust broke out of a very deep cup with handle at 985.10 and roared more than 257% higher in less than a month. On a daily chart, one can see that Bitcoin Investment is trying to halt its slide at the 50-day moving average.Crude oil prices and copper eased too, while gold prices rose on the back of a weaker U.S. dollar. The euro last week moved past $1.22 for the first time since December 2015. WTI near-term futures edged 0.7% lower to $63.88 a barrel.Market breadth turned negative in U.S. equities, with losing stocks outmatching winners by nearly 2-to-1 on both exchanges.A few leading stocks let their strong gains slip. Weibo (WB) moved past a 122.31 buy point in a seven-week cup with handle and rallied to as high as 128.37, up 4.9% past the proper entry. But the stock backtracked to cut its gain to roughly 1%.The decline within Weibo's cup base runs from 123 on the left-side peak to 97.49, a correction of 20.7%. That's within the normal parameters for this important chart pattern for investors on the hunt for strong breakouts. However, the most recent base is late stage, which increases the risk of failure.The Chinese social network broke out of a first-stage base at 19.20, also a cup with handle, during the week ended April 8, 2016.Weibo was initially featured in the IBD Stock Analysis column on March 24, 2016. It also became the 10th current stock on IBD Leaderboard on Tuesday, joining fellow Chinese ADRs Autohome (ATHM) and 58.com (WUBA).Weibo wasn't alone in terms of top-rated companies starting the MLK holiday-shortened trading week on a sour note.LGI Homes (LGIH) fell more than 8% to 69.53 and triggered one sell signal as volume jumped 125% above its 50-day average. The stock posted its biggest point drop since breaking out of a solid seven-week cup base at 50.05 on Oct. 2. Tuesday's drop was also the largest since the entry-level homebuilder cleared an earlier, deeper cup base at 40.57 in late June 2017.Shares in LGI are now testing institutional buying support at the critical 50-day moving average.Lithium metal supplier Sociedad Quimica (SQM), NetEase (NTES), New Oriental Education (EDU) and streaming video hardware play Roku (ROKU) also staged negative reversals in heavy or increasing volume. Such concerted selling hinted at some pronounced profit-taking among mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, insurers, large investment advisors and the like.Stay abreast of future potential changes in the overall market trend by reading The Big Picture column each day.Amid the broad market reversal, a few highly-rated names still acted well.Oneok (OKE) gained for a fourth day in a row, rising more than 1.3% to 59.45 in above-average turnover. The oil and gas transport play has cleared a 16-week cup pattern at 56.19 and is slightly outside the proper buy range. The 5% buy zone goes up to 59.00. Buying too far extended in price puts an investor in a vulnerable spot as a stock can quickly pull back and test the initial entry following a strong move up.Wall Street expects the Oklahome-based firm to stage a strong rebound in earnings in 2018, up 34% to $2.25 a share following a 1% climb in 2017. Fourth-quarter results are likely to be announced in late February.Oneok also sports a 5.1% annualized dividend yield.Abiomed (ABMD), the heart pump maker and one of 15 names in IBD Sector Leaders screen, rose more than 1.2% to 217.74 in slightly above-average turnover. The market leader is extended after surpassing a narrow flat base at 200.38 on Jan. 5.Abiomed scores a lofty 98 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup.Grubhub (GRUB), No. 23 in the IBD 50, is off around 0.7% yet remains above the key 50-day moving average following a two-day rebound on Thursday and Friday. Continued support at the 50-day line, or 10-week moving average on a weekly chart, would give investors a chance to add to a current position in the mobile and online food ordering service.Grubhub is up 21% since clearing a 57.71 buy point in a six-week flat base on Oct. 25 following robust third-quarter results (earnings up 22% to 28 cents a share, revenue up 32% to a record $163.1 million).

109,UNH,"With a portfolio featuring leading stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Charles Schwab (SCHW), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as of Dec. 31, $1.9 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) is going strong after having outperformed both its Morningstar large-cap blend category and the S&P 500 in four of the six most recent full quarters.Its 0.79% gain so far this year going into Thursday — after the market's recent volatility — is also ahead of the big-cap bogey and its peer group.X The fund owes its portfolio firepower to a double-barreled management approach. The fund is run by two groups of managers, who work independently of each other. That doubles their opportunities to generate investment ideas. One group consists of subadvisors Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss, who focus on value-oriented stocks for the fund. The second team works for USAA Asset Management, and they focus on growth stocks.""Using two managers with different approaches can potentially provide more consistent returns over the long term,"" said USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the teams running the two sleeves.Currently, Barrow Hanley runs about 40% of fund assets, with the balance run by the USAA team. Parent firm USAA maintains that ratio by allocating new inflows.Although the Barrow Hanley team's mandate is to focus on value stocks, their portfolio sleeve still includes leaders like E-Trade and UnitedHealth, which happen to have several traits of top-notch growth names, such as IBD Composite Ratings of 99 and 94 as well as SMR Ratings of A and B respectively.Amazon and Schwab are in the fund's growth sleeve. Amazon sports a red-hot 99% three-year annual earnings per share growth rate. Its three-year sales growth rate is 26%.IBD'S TAKE: Keep up with news and analysis of Amazon at IBD's web page devoted to the e-commerce and cloud-computing colossus.Schwab's three-year annual EPS growth rate is 22%. Its EPS is expected to grow 45% this year.And if ups and downs in the stock market today presage additional volatility in the near term, the fund's blended approach should serve it well, says Mark Giambrone, head of the Barrow Hanley team. The value sleeve has ""traditionally outperformed (the overall market) during weaker periods in the market,"" Giambrone said.Still, Giambrone blames recent market volatility on program-trading by index funds. Fundamentals are still sound, in his view. ""We have a positive economic backdrop for corporate earnings and cash flows and consumer confidence and spending,"" he said.E-Trade shares are up 46% in the past 12 months. Giambrone's sleeve has owned E-Trade for several years. As a value investor, he seeks to buy stocks when temporary ills have dropped their share prices. He bought his current E-Trade stake when it was trading below book value due to investors' concerns about its portfolio of home-equity loans, he says.Those loan woes have been cleared up, he says. ""They're garnering market share,"" he said. ""They're benefiting from rising rates (which allows its net interest margin to expand on clients' cash in its custody). And we expect consolidation among online brokerage firms.""Dow Jones industrial giant UnitedHealth is the Giambrone sleeve's largest nonbank position. He sees the firm as a health care technology and services provider. Half of its earnings, he says, come from its Optum unit, which provides pharmacy benefits management and technology services and also runs clinics and doctors' offices.Optum's data cache enables UnitedHealth to lower its own costs and its charges to customers. ""Optum is an incredible growth engine and differentiator for UNH,"" Giambrone said. ""It helps current healthcare clients and non-healthcare clients lower cost trends through technological advances. It is a key driver of the investment thesis.""Overall, UnitedHealth has great cash flow and a reasonable valuation. ""It's mostly a U.S. business, so it's helped by recent tax law changes, which can help raise its earnings,"" Giambrone said.Giambrone also likes Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL). Shares in the multi-cruiseline operator are up about 35% in the past 12 months.Royal Caribbean should benefit from expansion of destinations and markets in China and Cuba, Giambrone says. At the same time, industrywide supply of ships shows only modest growth. Giambrone says earnings should grow for years.He added, ""The company has not benefited from tax reform. But once the market settles and focuses on long-term benefits (of tax reform) rather than short-term reform, the company will benefit meaningfully.""Giambrone says regional bank KeyCorp (KEY) benefits from healthy loan growth. ""Credit (risk) is fairly stable, and tax reform will have a big positive impact on the bank,"" he added. KeyCorp's 2016 acquisition of First Niagara should provide economies of scale, he says.He added, ""We think the regulatory environment should get better for banks. The 'SIFIs' threshold may rise to $250 billion, which would make it easier for them to expand.""SIFIs threshold refers to the asset level at which banks are deemed systemically important financial institutions, triggering much stricter oversight, including higher capital buffers.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

110,UNH,"While Bank Of America (BAC), Cigna (CI) and Texas Instruments (TXN) all once again earned a spot on the latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, the most noteworthy name may be the one that didn't return: Apple (AAPL).X Apple had made the list for two consecutive months as the stock continued its climb from a bottom it reached in May 2016. In January's report, 65 top funds invested a total of nearly $1.8 billion in the tech giant.But with analysts seeing a slowdown in iPhone sales, institutional investors may fear the explosive growth of the past may be coming back down to earth as the company settles in to its new headquarters nicknamed Apple Spaceship in Cupertino, Calif.For the December quarter, Apple beat estimates for sales and earnings, but came up short on iPhone sales and guided lower for the current quarter. Apple's stock has now fallen sharply below its 10-week line in heavy volume, a sign of institutional selling. Apple is currently testing support at its 40-week line.Four stocks on the list received over an estimated $1 billion each in investments from the top funds over the past three months: Bank of America, medical sector stocks UnitedHealth (UNH) and Abbott (ABT), and semiconductor pioneer Texas Instruments.BofA is up more than 20% from a breakout in September, and has shown resilience – and support at its 50-day line – in the face of increased volatility and selling pressure in the general market.Abbott has given back much of the 13% gain in made from the buy point it cleared in December. The maker of generic pharmaceuticals and diagnostic systems is now trading 2% above the entry.UnitedHealth broke out earlier this month, but has pulled back and is now 3% below the 231.87 buy point.Texas Instruments has also been retreating, although it remains about 19% above the 84.34 entry it cleared in September.With the Nasdaq and S&P 500 showing  increased selling pressure and volatility, many stocks on the list, such as Orbotech (ORBK) and DMC Global (BOOM), have seen their recent breakouts fail.Others, such as the New York Times (NYT), have managed to keep climbing. The ""Paper of Record"" broke out of a double bottom on Jan. 12 and is now more than 20% above the buy point after jumping over 11% on today's earnings beat.After pulling back in recent days, defense stock Hexcel (HXL) is testing support at the 64.03 entry it cleared on Jan. 8.Louisiana Pacific (LPX), which provides engineered wood products for home construction, has splintered recently and is now back below the 29.54 buy point it first cleared on Jan. 24.Modine (MOD) has been holding up better than many other names on the list, although it's had its share of wild price swings. It's currently still trading just within the 23.25-24.41 buy zone.Modine, which makes thermal management systems for the building, industrial and refrigeration markets, initially sank on its recent earnings report, but bounced back into buy range in heavy volume last week.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) topped the list of stocks being sold, with 59 net sellers (127 funds selling minus 68 buying). Despite that, just like its banking rival BofA, JPMorgan has continued to climb higher.No. 2 on the sell side was Aetna (AET), which had 58 net sellers (96 funds selling minus 38 buying). Last year, CVS Health (CVS) announced it was buying the managed care provider.You May Also Like:How To Quickly Find The  Best Mutual FundsIs It Time To Get Into - Or Out Of - The Stock Market?

111,UNH,"Results from insurer Centene (CNC), by far the biggest player on the ObamaCare exchanges, reveal that paid national enrollment almost certainly increased in 2018 compared to a year ago, defying predictions that President Trump's actions would lead to a sizable drop.X Centene said on a Tuesday earnings call that it now has more than 1.6 million paid exchange customers, well above the 1.4 million-plus that the company indicated to investors on Jan. 8.The unexpected surge in customers didn't result from late signups — since enrollment ended in most markets on Dec. 15 — but from a much bigger share of those who signed up following through and paying their premium.Shares of Centene jumped 4.3% on Tuesday and added another 0.7% on the stock market today, boosted by better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and an improved outlook, thanks to ObamaCare enrollment and tax cuts.Centene is ranked No. 2 by IBD Stock Checkup in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, revenue, margin and stock performance trends, trailing only Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth Group (UNH). With UnitedHealth, Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) all exiting the ACA exchanges, and Anthem (ANTM) greatly scaling back its presence, the door has been opened for Centene, which has traditionally catered to the Medicaid population, to seize a leadership position.Fears of a substantial enrollment decline were fueled by the Trump administration's adoption of a much earlier signup deadline and its gutting of the advertising budget for HealthCare.gov, along with Republicans' successful effort to repeal the individual mandate to buy coverage or pay a fine.Ironically, the unexpected strength in enrollment resulted from Trump's decision last fall to halt payments for cost-sharing subsidies, which the Affordable Care Act promised to insurers to reimburse their expense for dramatically shrinking deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income households who buy silver coverage.Trump, who had the authority to end the payments funded by President Obama without a congressional appropriation, had threatened the move as an act of sabotage. But most state health insurance officials seized on advice from Urban Institute scholars to jury-rig their exchanges in a way that turned attempted sabotage into a life raft.IBD'S TAKE: After Thursday's market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Instead of raising premiums for all customers in response to the loss of cost-sharing subsidies, as feared, insurers piled all of their extra expense onto silver plans, sending only silver premiums skyward.But while Trump ended the cost-sharing subsidies for insurers, a separate tax-credit subsidy remains in place to offset the cost of premiums that individuals pay.And because those premium tax credits are based on the cost of the second-lowest-cost silver plans, the size of those subsidies soared, which is why many more people can get free high-deductible bronze coverage in 2018 than in prior years. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 4.5 million uninsured could get bronze policies this year for no cost.Not surprisingly, anecdotal evidence suggests an increase in the take-up of bronze plans. In Connecticut, bronze signups went from 25% of the total in 2017 to 35% in 2018.Typically, somewhere between 70% and 80% of people selecting Centene plans during the open-enrollment period would eventually pay a premium, CEO Michael Neidorff said on Tuesday, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.But this year, he noted, ""we had a much higher percentage convert and pay the premium.""Given that the number of people signing up for exchange coverage came in at more than 96% of last year's total – 11.8 million vs. 12.2 million a year ago, according to ACASignups.net – the experience of Centene, whose large presence makes it a strong indicator of national trends, suggests that paid enrollment will top last year's total of 10.2 million.The wider availability of free bronze plans surely goes a long way toward explaining the higher share of enrollees who paid the premium they owed – if they owed one. The higher subsidies also likely enabled more people to buy lower-deductible gold plans for little more than the cost of silver. California reported a big increase in the take-up of gold plans, with a more modest increase in bronze coverage.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:How Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

112,UNH,"Sellers were in the stock market again Tuesday as the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq held stiff losses with less than one hour remaining in Tuesday's session.X The Dow took the biggest hit, falling 1.4%, hurt by weakness in Pfizer (PFE) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). Pfizer's earnings disappointed, fueling a 3% loss for the stock. UnitedHealth Group gave back 4% on news from Amazon.com (AMZN), Berkshire Hathway (BRKA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) that the three are collaborating on a way to offer health care to U.S. employees with more transparency and at a lower cost.Providers of pharmacy benefit management services fell hard on the news. Express Scripts (ESRX) cratered 3% but was well off session lows after touching the 50-day moving average. CVS Health (CVS) slumped 4%.Amazon bucked the trend, rising 0.7% to around 1,428 ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. The Leaderboard name has been a standout performer after a breakout over a 1,213.51 buy point.The S&P 500 lost 1% and the Nasdaq composite eased 0.8%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking higher than Monday's levels in the stock market today, more so on the NYSE. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 suffered a distribution day Monday with losses in higher volume. Distribution days are a sign of institutional selling.Workday (WDAY) was a bright spot in the Nasdaq 100, rising nearly 3% to 119.74. The weekly chart shows a conventional entry at 116.99, but the daily shows an earlier cup-with-handle entry of 114.98.Meanwhile, the two-day Fed meeting got underway today and a decision on interest rates is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The market is not expecting a rate hike this time around, but the chances for one at the March meeting are pretty good. According to CME Group FedWatch, the market sees a 70% chance for a quarter-point hike to a range of 1.50% to 1.75% in March.The 10-year Treasury yield added 3 basis points to 2.72% ahead of Friday's jobs report. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to rise 175,000 with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.1%.Inside the IBD 50, Align Technology (ALGN), the company behind Invisalign braces, recovered off lows after a quick test of the 50-day moving average. Shares of Align were still down 3% ahead of its earnings report after the close.IBD 50 name Grubhub (GRUB) gapped down, falling nearly 4% to 72.50, after Barclays downgraded shares to equal weight from overweight with a 56 price target. The stock is about 4% below the 74.90 of a flat base it cleared last week. Earnings are due Feb. 8 before the open.Growth stocks were weak again as 16 names in the IBD 50 were down 2% or more in late trading.RELATED:Workday Rises, Veeva Upgraded On Margins, HubSpot Downgraded Health Care Stocks Tumble On Amazon, Berkshire, JPMorgan AllianceAmazon Scores Price Target Increase Ahead Of Fourth-Quarter ReportAlibaba Likely To Show Strongest Revenue Growth In 15 Quarters

113,UNH,"Despite the sell-off in health stocks Tuesday, a joint venture by Amazon.com (AMZN), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to wring out cost savings from the health care system appears very unlikely to impact industry earnings over the next couple of years, according to analysts.X Figuring out how to rein in health costs without the participation of big health care players looks like a near-impossible task, Needham analyst Kevin Caliendo said. ""We note that the cost to implement systems, adjudicate patient data, and partner with hospitals, doctors, pharmacies on a national basis is onerous.""Caliendo adds that the scale of the big three new partners wouldn't be big enough to squeeze discounts out of providers by steering patients their way, compared to the purchasing power of UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS)-Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM). ""The new company will have to align itself with all these other providers in some way to provide the best care for its employees,"" Caliendo concludes.In fact, Caliendo gave CVS a big vote of confidence earlier Tuesday, saying its planned combination with Aetna positions it to create savings for the government and private employers. Needham raised its rating on CVS to strong buy with a 100 target.Caliendo does think that ""profits in the industry, especially at the underwriting level, are excessive,"" and there are improvements to the current care delivery model that can be made. He sees that as a prime reason behind the CVS-Aetna deal.CVS is looking to shift more health care services to the lowest-cost location: its in-store clinics. That's a different take on UnitedHealth's playbook of expanding into urgent care and other outpatient locales to drive savings for customers.But no such path forward was evident in the announcement from Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire. The plan to establish an independent company ""is in its early planning stages,"" according to a statement by the trio.""Our group does not come to this problem with answers,"" acknowledged Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett.""Success is going to require talented experts, a beginner's mind, and a long-term orientation,"" said Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Yet it's unclear at this point who any of those talented experts will be.As Wall Street weighed the long-term nature of the effort and the dearth of substantive details, the initial shock wave that rippled across Wall Street subsided. Shares of Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth, the nation's largest insurer, sank 4.35% to 236.65 on the stock market today, after diving as much as 6.2% earlier. CVS Health, which is in the process of buying Aetna, pared losses to a 4.1% drop.Drug distributors Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) were down 1.8% and 2.6%, respectively. Prescription benefit management firm Express Scripts (ESRX) sank 3.2%, but had tumbled 11.4% earlier. Both CVS and UnitedHealth also operate PBMs, which manage the prescription side of health insurance contracts.Pharmaceuticals and biotech stocks also lost ground, though the hit didn't look much worse than the broader market downdraft on Tuesday. Merck (MRK) shed 1.6%, Allergan (AGN) 1.6% and Gilead Sciences (GILD) 1.7% Pfizer (PFE) lost 3.1% despite topping earnings views and offering bullish guidance.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is ranked No. 2 by IBD in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leaders in each category. Insurers have been solid performers, ranked No. 43 out of 197 groups. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.The knee-jerk reaction among investors is surely a reflection of the unsustainably high cost of health care in the U.S., and the fact that Amazon, which has been itching to disrupt the retail prescription business, is attached to the effort.Traditionally, the fear among health care investors has been that government — not the private sector — will impose cost controls to get a handle on runaway budget deficits, thinning out industry profits in the process. Medicare negotiating drug costs is one such fear, but industry experts say that the government is unlikely to produce much in the way of savings unless it is willing to deny patients access to certain drugs, which could create a political backlash.But Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire aren't the first big employers to join forces to attack health costs. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte noted on Tuesday that the Health Transformation Alliance, a group of 46 large self-insured employers that launched last year, also hopes to find savings and improve employee satisfaction, though it's working with CVS and UnitedHealth to achieve its aims. Initial reports indicated that alliance members expected to save a combined $600 million in prescription costs over three years.Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire say their initial focus will be on ""technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost."" The new corporate entity, they say, will be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""Just what form those technology solutions would take is far from clear. Caliendo supposes that ""Berkshire might bring some underwriting skills (although they've never underwritten healthcare) and AMZN might make pharmacy and medical procurement contributions and provide IT expertise.""Leerkink's Gupte says she's unclear whether Amazon wading deeper into solving the health care mess will accelerate its move into the supply chain of the prescription industry.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why Trump's State Of The Union Might Move Markets Up — Or DownStocks Fall As Market Shows 3 Signs It May Be Ready For A BreakGrubhub, Redhat Lead These Three IBD 50 Stocks In Buy RangeHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

114,UNH,"Stock fell out of the starting gates Tuesday, as global markets suffered another day of losses and a new partnership announced by Amazon.com (AMZN) rattled stocks across the U.S. health care fields.XThe Nasdaq Composite opened down 0.7% as Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and ExpressScripts (ESRX) put up heavy losses.The S&P 500 traded down 0.6%. and the Dow Jones Industrial average dropped nearly 0.8%, with UnitedHealth Group (UNH) down hard and Caterpillar (CAT), Apple (AAPL) and Chevron (CVX) among the half-dozen other Dow Jones names clocking early losses of greater than 1%.International markets were also posting losses, as bond markets remained under pressure and the dollar continued its slide. Leading benchmarks in Tokyo and Hong Kong fell more than 1% on Tuesday. Stocks in Europe also showed deepening losses in afternoon trade, with London's FTSE 100 and Frankfurt's DAX diving furthest, each down 0.8%.The Federal Open Market Committee swings into its two-day meeting in Washington Tuesday morning — the last FOMC gathering over which Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will preside. A policy announcement is set for 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, though no rate hike is expected this time around.Other economic news for the day is thin, with the Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for November rising 0.7%. That was unchanged from October's reading, and just above consensus views for a 0.6% gain. The January consumer confidence survey from the Conference Board expected at 10 a.m. ET.Health-care stocks were reacting briskly to news that Amazon would partner with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to chart out new ways to provide health care for their U.S. employees, ""through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""The deal suggested that the ""Amazon effect"" — the impact of deep pockets and massive online scale the company brings to its efforts — could begin to assert an impact on health care and insurance industries, the way it has on retail, shipping and other markets.Amazon dropped 1.3%, JPMorgan slipped 0.9% and Berkshire Hathaway was flat. Amazon shares are extended, almost 17% above a 1213.10 buy point following a breakout in early January.On the Dow, UnitedHealth Group dove nearly 5% in opening action.  Other managed care providers responded similarly, with Anthem (ANTM) down 5%, Cigna (CI) sliding 5%, while Aetna (AET) slipped 3% and Humana (HUM) subtracted more than 2%.Shares also dived among pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacy chains, with Express Scripts careening 9% lower to the bottom of the Nasdaq 100. CVS Health (CVS) crumbled nearly 5%. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) fell 5% each.Apple traded down 1%, as news reports detailed the company's plans to reduce production for its iPhone X through March 31. Some reports said this was on weaker-than-expected demand, others said the move was seasonal and occurred around this time each year. Apple spent a third session below its 10-week moving average on Monday, and starts Tuesday in a test of its prior low, from early December — just ahead of its fiscal first-quarter report on Wednesday.Early earnings reports were also a factor in early trade, with McDonald's (MCD) down 1.1% after its fourth-quarter report. Homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) dropped almost 3% after its quarterly results.Life insurer MetLife (MET) tumbled 8% after announcing late Monday it would postpone its fourth-quarter earnings report as the company wrestles with a foul-up that potentially left ""tens of thousands"" of workers without monthly pension benefits. The company said it would increase reserves by $525 million to $575 million in order to deal with the problem, and revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the matter.Maxim Integrated dived nearly 7%, reversing much of Monday's 12% gain that followed news reports the company was a possible takeover target for Japanese rival Renesas for $20 billion. In reports after Monday's close, Renesas denied that it was in takeover discussions with Maxim.Callidus Software (CALD) spiked 10% at the open, after announcing German software giant SAP (SAP) would acquire the company for $2.4 billion. Dublin, Calif.-based Callidus operates as CallidusCloud, which provides cloud-based sales and marketing programs.

116,UNH,"Starbucks (SBUX) says it's getting a $350 million tax cut this year from a 7-percentage-point reduction in its effective tax rate to 26%.""The majority of the savings will go to the bottom line,"" CFO Scott Maw told analysts on Thursday. The other 40%-plus will go to investments in workers, via wage and benefit enhancements, as well as digital investments.X Starbucks joined companies like Wal-Mart (WMT), FedEx (FDX) and Wells Fargo (WFC) in tying wage increases to the Trump tax cuts. Meanwhile, dozens of other companies including AT&T (T), Disney (DIS) and Verizon (VZ) have awarded bonuses to well more than 1 million workers, crediting tax cuts for their generosity.With the U.S. economy seemingly ready to finally shift into high gear and wage growth overdue for a pickup amid 4.1% unemployment, the flurry of wage-hike and bonus announcements has raised hopes that the GOP tax reform will provide rocket fuel for a late-1990s-style growth spurt. In a sign that economic growth is breaking out to the upside, the 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 2.67% on Friday, a level not seen since early 2014.Yet there are reasons to be skeptical that a major economic and wage acceleration is at hand. Take Verizon, which on Tuesday said that tax reform would shrink its 2018 tax bill by $3.5 billion-$4 billion. Yet the company hasn't settled on any plans for deploying that cash windfall, other than sending about 10% of it, or $380 million, to employees via a bonus grant of 50 shares of stock per full-time worker. While those Verizon shares are worth about $2,700 at Friday's close on the stock market today, economists generally believe that consumers are much more likely to spend ongoing income gains than gains in paper wealth.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks is ranked No. 11 by IBD in the Retail-Restaurants industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leaders in each category. Restaurants have turned in a middling performance as a group, ranked No. 84 out of 197 groups. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.On a static basis, leaving out growth effects, tax cuts are supposed to provide roughly $200 billion in 2018 to the corporate and household sectors, equal to about 1% of GDP. While lower federal tax withholdings are set to take effect in February, raising household take-home pay, tax cuts are initially geared more to the business sector. That's in part because the new withholding will reflect the elimination of personal exemptions, but not the doubling of the child tax credit, which won't get paid until tax season in 2019.That means this year's boost from tax cuts will depend a whole lot on what companies do with their windfalls, though it's also looking like Congress will reach a spending deal that further boosts deficits and gives the economy a lift — assuming the government doesn't shut down again.Yet company after company seems to be signaling that they have fairly modest plans for putting their extra cash to work. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) told analysts last week that corporate tax reform would boost earnings and cash flow by $1.7 billion in 2018 after an additional investment and added operating expenses of $200 million to $300 million in artificial intelligence, data analytics, digital health and other initiatives.Iron-ore miner Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) said it's getting a $250 million cash infusion over the next several years and will owe no tax for years to come. It's still figuring out how to put the cash to work but said it ""will be primarily deployed towards debt reduction, as well as future CapEx needs associated with our core business, and last but not least, potential capital returns to shareholders,"" according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Railroad operator Union Pacific expects tax cuts to add $1 billion to free cash flow this year but doesn't have any extra investment plans for now. ""The lower tax rate and increased cash flow resulting from it does not change the calculus that we used for the returns that are attractive to our shareholders and for reinvesting in the railroad,"" CEO Lance Fritz told analysts. ""Just because we have increased cash, it doesn't increase the pool of either projects or markets that are effective to us.""It's still very possible that the economy finally breaks the 3% GDP growth barrier this year. The economy may not need all that much extra fuel right now with labor markets already quite tight.Although income gains outweigh stock market gains, a long, powerful bull market will surely loosen purse strings. Wal-Mart's minimum-wage hike to $11 an hour may lead other employers to follow suit, if the experience from their last big wage hike in 2016 is any guide.The upfront bonuses, while surely appreciated by those who get them, are mostly meant to buy goodwill — probably both for the employers and the Republican Party, whose control of both the House and Senate are at risk in the coming elections.Still, the effectiveness of corporate tax cuts and their power to trickle down to employees can't really be judged in the short term.The whole idea is that improving the relative attractiveness of the U.S. as a place of business will, over time, lead to more productivity-enhancing investment, faster growth, more demand for labor and higher wages. Yet the real legacy of the tax cuts over the longer term will depend in part on just how bad budget deficits get, which may determine whether the tax cuts can be sustained over time.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Tax Cuts Will Fuel Economic Growth At Just The Right TimeHere Comes A $1 Trillion — Scratch That — $2 Trillion U.S. Federal DeficitFacebook, Apple, Amazon To Grab Earnings Spotlight: Investing Action PlanHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

125,UNH,"The $67.5 billion CVS Health (CVS) takeover of Aetna (AET) will test the Trump administration's approach to far-reaching corporate takeovers, just weeks after the U.S. government sued to block a major telecommunications merger.X The health-care deal unveiled Sunday would create an industry giant with over $240 billion in annual sales with a hand in insurance, prescription drug plan administration, retail pharmacies and corner clinics. The companies said the combination will save $750 million in costs and bring consumers better, more efficient health care.In the past, deals combining companies up and down a chain of business — such as a supplier and a distributor — have been viewed as posing less anticompetitive risk than combinations of direct rivals. Last month, however, the Justice Department sued to block just such a ""vertical"" merger between AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), saying it would harm consumers and limit their media content options.""We are obviously going to get some scrutiny,"" said Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini. ""We are prepared to deal with whatever comes along to make this work.""Aetna shares were trading at $184.84 at 6:33 a.m. in New York, well below CVS's $207-a-share offer for the company — a sign investors are skeptical the deal will close at the current price.How much scrutiny the deal gets from the government may depend on which federal agency reviews the takeover — the Justice Department, or the Federal Trade Commission.Both scenarios present obstacles.The FTC has typically handled mergers of retail businesses like CVS. While it allowed Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to buy more than 1,900 Rite Aid (RAD) stores earlier this year, the deal had to be significantly scaled down to gain the regulator's approval. The Justice Department, meanwhile, successfully sued to block insurance mergers between Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI), and Aetna and Humana (HUM).In the past, vertical deals have typically won approval after companies agree to restrictions on how they operate.That may be changing. The Justice Department's new antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has criticized past settlements that allowed vertical deals with behavioral restrictions. In a speech last month, Delrahim said such conditions don't work and force antitrust enforcers to become regulators.That view was behind Delrahim's decision on Nov. 20 to sue to block AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, a vertical deal that would bring together Time Warner content like HBO with AT&T's pay-TV and wireless distribution.""Most vertical deals don't raise antitrust concerns, and the ones that do generally get approval to close with an agreement containing behavioral conditions,"" said Jennifer Rie, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who follows antitrust issues, in an email. ""But the Justice Department appears to be rejecting this kind of remedy given its approach to the AT&T-Time Warner deal.""That doesn't mean there's heightened hostility toward vertical deals at the Justice Department, but CVS might prefer the Aetna deal to go to the FTC given Delrahim's criticism of behavioral fixes, said David Kully, an antitrust lawyer at Holland & Knight in Washington and a former Justice Department attorney.""Delrahim was very clear in his concerns about behavioral decrees and then put his money where his mouth is when he brought the AT&T case,"" Kully said.One point in favor of the CVS-Aetna deal is that there's already another large insurer with many of the characteristics of a combined health companies. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) offers health insurance, administers drug benefits and runs a growing network of doctors and clinics.But the CVS-Aetna combination takes integration to a new level with its 9,700 retail drugstores. It would also allow CVS to expand its 1,100 walk-in clinics, saving Aetna's insurance customers money by steering patients away from expensive hospital emergency rooms.A condition to an approval could be measures preventing Aetna from steering patients to CVS pharmacies over competitors such as Walgreens, said Rie, who noted that CVS may be better off if the FTC takes the review.One of the few areas where the companies directly overlap is in the Medicare drug business. CVS is already the largest provider of Medicare drug plans, and Aetna is the fifth largest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug-benefits business in a CVS merger. He anticipates a deal would likely go through in the end no matter who reviewed it.The deal ""would definitely be scrutinized, but ultimately we still see a path for it to get through,"" Newshel said in an email. Evercore worked on the deal and Newshel said he's suspending his analyst coverage of Aetna.RELATED:CVS Will Buy Aetna, Reshaping Health Care As Amazon Looms

126,UNH,"CVS Health (CVS) announced same-day pharmacy delivery in certain metro areas starting next year and in New York starting next month as it girds for an approaching onslaught from Amazon.com (AMZN). Next-day delivery will be available across the country in 2018.Meanwhile, CVS reported slightly better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Monday amid reports that it could finalize a blockbuster deal to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) before the end of the year.Although expanding into health insurance seemed like a radical way for the drugstore operator to protect its turf, same-day and next-day delivery may be even more of a last resort for CVS. That's because giving customers a seamless way to get their medicine without popping into one of about 9,700 stores could deal a blow to nonprescription sales.""CVS would rather not go down this path but needs to,"" noted Matt Sargent, senior vice president of retail at the Magid research firm. The move is a reflection of its ""level of concern"" about the threat from Amazon.Shares fell 3.5% to 66.80 on the stock market today, hitting their worst levels since February 2014.Aetna shares rose 1 cent Monday to 177. Aetna climbed 2.7% Friday after a Reuters report that CVS could lift its offer price for Aetna to $70 billion and that terms could be announced in December.CVS earnings fell 8.5% to $1.50 a share as revenue grew $3.5% to $46.18 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of $1.49 on sales of $46.17 billion according to Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales fell 3.2%, slightly better than expectations. Pharmacy same-store sales fell 3.4%, depressed by introductions of generic medicines.CVS narrowed its guidance range for full-year earnings to $5.87-$5.91 from $5.83-$5.93, lifting the midpoint by a penny to $5.89. Analysts had expected $5.88 before CVS' 1-cent beat in Q3, according to Zacks Investment Research.CVS management noted that 1,600 locations now provide home delivery, but characterized that volume as ""fairly small."" Asked about the potential cost of a broad expansion in delivery, the company said it had been able to use its scale to negotiate an attractive rate. Many of the details are still apparently being drawn up, as management noted a possibility that delivery might be free to customers with the purchase of front-store merchandise.CVS has been under pressure amid soft front-end store sales and worries about a looming competitive threat from Amazon, which numerous analysts now expect to enter the $300 billion prescription retail market. Amazon would likely buy a prescription benefit management firm or strike a deal with UnitedHealth Group (UNH) to navigate the regulated prescription industry, industry observers believe.IBD'S TAKE: There's a new leader atop IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group. See which breakout stock overtook UnitedHealth for the No. 1 ranking based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance. See where your companies rank in each of 197 industry groups at IBD Stock Checkup.Analysts have been somewhat divided over the benefits of a CVS-Aetna deal, with some saying it would provide negotiating leverage with drug manufacturers and others warning that other health plans might distance themselves from CVS. Antitrust also may be an issue.CVS didn't comment on speculation about the Aetna deal, but instead held out its new deal to provide claims processing and prescription fulfillment for Anthem (ANTM) as its biggest highlight.A CVS-Aetna deal is seen as a challenge to the dominance of UnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest insurer and a competitor to CVS' pharmacy benefits manager business via its OptumRx PBM business.But investors so far aren't convinced. UnitedHealth shares have marched higher since news broke about the CVS-Aetna merger talks on Oct. 26. UnitedHealth shares closed up 0.8% on Friday, scooting higher amid word that CVS could pay $70 billion for Aetna.RELATED:Aetna Soars As CVS Health Deal Offer Could Top $70 BillionAetna Tops Earnings Views, Mum On CVS; WellCare Health SoarsInvestors Stand For Anthem; Stock Hits Buy On Earnings, New DealRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchAmazon (AMZN) Stock Quotes, Company News And Chart Analysis

129,UNH,"A strong open for the stock market Tuesday saw the Dow Jones industrial average cross the 26,000 level early, but gains faded badly by the close.X After rising 1.1% early, the Dow faded to a loss of less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite also gave back a healthy gain, falling 0.5%, while the S&P 500 gave back nearly 0.4%. Small caps underperformed with the Russell 2000 down 1%.Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in higher than Friday's levels in the stock market today, resulting in a distribution day for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Higher-volume declines haven't been an issue for the broad market in recent weeks, but it's always important to pay attention to signs of institutional selling when it arises, even when the percentage declines aren't severe.Money flowing out of stocks did not translate into bond inflows as the 10-year Treasury yield was mostly unchanged at 2.54%.Strong showings from Merck (MRK) and UnitedHealth (UNH) helped the Dow early. Shares of Merck gapped above the 200-day moving average, rising nearly 6%, after the company said a late-stage trial of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, in combination with two chemotherapy treatments, was effective in treating patients with advanced lung cancer.Shares of UnitedHealth, meanwhile, gained 2% after the company reported earnings and gave a solid outlook for 2018.Wall Street also liked the look of quarterly results from Citigroup (C).

130,UNH,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose strongly Tuesday morning while Dow futures jumped about 240 points while Bitcoin and other digital currencies plunged on renewed talk from South Korea about banning trading.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings early Tuesday. Citigroup (C), , CSX Corp. (CSX), Comerica (CMA) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) all report today.X Citigroup and Dow component UnitedHealth Group closed Friday near buy points, with caveats. CSX is the first rail operator to report this week, while Interactive Brokers precedes Charles Schwab (SCHW) on Wednesday. Citigroup and super-regional Comerica kick off a new wave of big bank earnings.S&P 500 futures were 0.5% above fair value. The dollar's recent weakness continued vs. major rivals, hitting a 2-year low vs. the Chinese yuan. Dow futures popped 1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.7% against fair value.Bitcoin fell 9% to $12,335.19, according to CoinDesk after falling as low as $11,182.71. South Korea's finance minister stressed that banning cryptocurrency trading is on the table. Ethereum lost 14% and Ripple 20% vs. 24 hours earlier, according to CoinMarketCap.

UnitedHealth also raised its 2018 EPS forecast.UnitedHealth rose 2.7% to 234.78 before the opening bell on the stock market today.

Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI) moved into a buy zone Friday, joining Humana (HUM), though none of the breakouts came on impressive volume and their RS lines continue to lag. Aetna (AET) and WellCare Helath Plans (WCG) are near buy points but with lagging RS lines.Citigroup reports early Tuesday as well. EPS should edge up 4.4% to $1.19, with revenue edging up 0.5% to $17.09 billion.Citigroup has a flat base that's a half-step above a prior flat base, which was just above yet another flat base. The buy point is 78.02. Shares rose to 76.84 on Friday.But Citigroup, which outperformed the RS line from early June to early October and generally outperformed rival banks over that span, has had a declining RS line since then.Citigroup follows bank earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) on Friday. Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report later this week.Comerica also reports Q4 earnings early Tuesday, with analysts forecasting a 31.5% EPS jump to $1.21 billion with revenue climbing 13% to $819 million.Comerica shares have risen 7.2% in January and are well extended from any buy point. The stock's RS line has been rising for the past four months.Rail giant CSX delivers Q4 results after Tuesday's close. Analysts expect a 14% advance to 56 cents even as revenue slides 5% to $2.88 billion. This is the first report after CSX named James Foote CEO in December following the death of veteran railroad exec Hunter Harrison.CSX's stock is modestly extended from a 55.09 buy point. Shares briefly tumbled on news that Harrison was taking a leave of absence followed quickly by his death, but shares didn't fall quite enough to invalidate the buy point. Also, shares found support at their 200-day line and never closed below their 50-day.CSX's RS line initially confirmed the Nov. 30 breakout. But the RS line hasn't made headway since then, and has generally been lagging for more than six months.Later this week, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Kansas City Southern (KSU) will report quarterly results.

Dow futures climbed 0.45%, or more than 100 points above fair value. Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported better-than-expected Q4 earnings Friday morning.With the major averages already at record highs, many stocks are hitting all-time bests without being market leaders or are even lagging the market.Apple (AAPL), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH), all members of the S&P 500 index and Dow industrials, are just below buy points. But a close look at their charts show that all three are lagging: Their relative strength lines, which track a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500, are at the lows of their current consolidations.That doesn't mean Apple, Wal-Mart and UnitedHealth can't work. Stocks with lagging RS lines can break out successfully. Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) cleared buy points on Jan. 3 in so-so volume and continued to rise through Thursday. But both Microsoft and Facebook are still just keeping up with the market, with their RS lines off old highs.If the market pulls back even modestly, or company-specific news sours, stocks with flat to lagging RS lines may be exposed. Facebook shares were trading lower Friday morning, suggesting a retreat below their recent buy point, after the social networking giant announced sweeping changes that could reduce audience engagement.Ideally, an RS line should lead or confirm a breakout into new high ground, at least in the short term.Apple rose 0.6% to 175.28 in Thursday's stock market trading, moving back toward a 176.34 flat-base buy point. But the S&P 500 rose 0.7%, so Apple's RS line edged lower, right at the recent low. (The RS line is the blue line in the stock charts below.)Apple's RS line hasn't made headway since early May.

132,UNH,"Despite its name and a big 41% weighting in tech stocks, AllianzGI Focused Growth Fund (PGWAX) does not aim to focus assets in any one sector. Its tech stock stake at its last count on Oct. 31 came by way of  stock-by-stock analysis at the $1.1 billion fund.X Focused Growth's next biggest sector weighting was 16% in consumer cyclical stocks. The concentration has worked well for the fund's investors. In the past year going into Thursday, the fund gained 33.11%, topping 78% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar. It outperformed 82% of its peers over the past three years with a 15.31% average annual gain. The S&P 500 averaged 23.57% and 12.70% in those time spans.The fund aims for long-term price gains by seeking stocks of what lead fund manager Karen Hiatt calls high-quality companies that she and co-manager Raphael Edelman believe can sustain growth and post earnings surprises as well as generate attractive cash flows. ""We look for companies with strong management, that have a track record of building shareholder value and delivering strong free cash flow,"" Hiatt said.To achieve that, Hiatt and Edelman invest in only their best ideas. The portfolio held just 39 stocks as of Nov. 30. The managers also focus on managing risk. One way they do that is by aiming to buy stocks they like when they are reasonably priced.The fund's focus on its managers' best ideas is reflected in the relatively big weightings for the fund's top positions. Top holdings Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Visa (V) each account for more than 5% of fund assets.Apple is up 46% in the past 12 months and FANG stocks Facebook and Amazon are up 51% and 58%. UnitedHealth is up 39% and Visa is up 46%.""The data points around Apple have been noisy recently,"" Hiatt said. ""But we think that's just from investors' fine-tuning their expectations of the run rate of the new iPhone X.""Also, she calls Apple attractively valued since its forward 12-month price-earnings multiple is trading at about a 25% discount to the S&P 500's.In addition, she says Apple should benefit from the recently enacted tax bill. It will get a lower tax rate, freedom to repatriate its overseas cash cache and more leeway in using that cash.IBD's TAKE: Tax reform should let Apple bring some of its $250 billion overseas money home at a tax rate of 15.5% vs. the old 35% rate. That could make billions of dollars available for stock buybacks, IBD has reported.With Facebook, Hiatt sees a chance of earnings declining as the company continues to invest in itself. But she likes the company's long-term outlook as Facebook finds news ways to monetize assets and as the number of users increases and advertising growth remains strong.Hiatt also sees Amazon's spending as an investment in its own future. Amazon's internal investments have tended to pay off in terms of market share gains, she says. Amazon's investments in its Prime program, for example, is paying off in the form of increased user spending. And Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods Market helps Amazon ""get closer to the customer, (capture) a high income customer base with relatively low merchandise overlap and gaining insights into fresh food distribution,"" she said.She especially likes Amazon's trends outside the U.S., where its revenue last quarter was more than $1 billion higher than expected. ""Add Prime penetration, Amazon's increased capability in video and in groceries, in India, in health care,"" she said. ""There's so much optionality that Amazon's moat grows deeper and wider.""Outside the technology sector, Hiatt likes prospects for UnitedHealth, one of the largest managed care companies. ""What's most exciting is its Optum business,"" she said.Optum provides pharmacy benefits management and technology services and also runs clinics and doctors' offices. ""This unit has significant amounts of data, which gives UnitedHealth a competitive advantage in being able to leverage that data to provide lower costs throughout its supply chain and lower costs to customers,"" she said. ""So it's an area of significant growth.""Hiatt also likes UnitedHealth's acquisition of dialysis center DaVita's (DVA) medical unit, its fourth big takeover since the start of 2017.And Visa benefits from refashioning the company's Visa Europe business, which it acquired in 2016. ""Visa Europe had been run like a co-op,"" Hiatt said. ""They've turned it into a profit-focused business, with a lot of upside.""Visa also gains from the shift to digital payments for transactions. ""They are a toll taker for global spending,"" Hiatt said. ""It's a really scalable business. There isn't much that they have to do for each incremental dollar they bring in.""RELATED:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign Tilt

133,UNH,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages had their first down week of 2018, and it was their worst showing in two years. Apple (AAPL) guided lower, as many suspected. Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts. User growth cooled while users' time spent on Facebook fell, even before its latest big News Feed changes. But executives said on the conference call that ad rates are soaring, easing analysts' revenue fears. Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees. But if they are successful with their own firms, the thinking is that they would expand the services to corporate America. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers sold off. UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer and also a PBM, sank 6.7%. Drugstore-and-PBM CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET), lost 6.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume. But the real news was that eBay stunned Wall Street with the news that it will replace PayPal in 2020 and handle payments on its own site via a partnership with Adyen. The move will add a revenue stream. Shares of eBay soared nearly 14% on Thursday. PayPal lost 10.4% for the week, closing below a buy point and its 50-day line.The Chinese e-commerce giant's revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion, the best gain in at least 15 quarters and beating views. Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to earnings per share of 83 cents on sales of $25.6 billion, above views. Shares hit a record high intraday Thursday.AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) offered investors positive financial news. AMD beat Wall Street's targets for the December quarter and guided estimates higher for the current quarter. Broadcom gave preliminary sales and earnings guidance for its fiscal first quarter that topped views. Qorvo rocketed after disclosing a big contract win with major customer Apple (AAPL) for its next-generation iPhone. Qorvo delivered better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q3, but guided well below Wall Street's targets for the current quarter.Boeing (BA) reported EPS of $4.80 a share, or $3.06 excluding a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts.

Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) announced a major delay to its highly anticipated Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" now set for release on Oct. 26 instead of this spring.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped analyst forecasts, as people broke out the plastic more often to spend during the holidays. Visa also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback. That follows American Express (AXP), which just suspended its buyback. Visa also hiked its quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents a share.Homebuilder stocks continued to struggle even as some big builders reported better-than-expected earnings after the prior week's surprise miss by NVR (NVR). Housing demand and prices are strong, but concerns are growing over rising labor and material costs. Mortgage rates, though low, are rising. America's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) beat on both EPS and revenue Wednesday, but shares met resistance at their 50-day line. PulteGroup (PHM) stock kept falling on sliding gross margins, even though earnings and sales topped views. Smaller Meritage Homes (MTH) also beat while smaller M/I Homes (MHO)  and M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) missed on EPS.A slew of biotechs and drugmakers reported earnings, including Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Merck (MRK), all of which topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Pfizer came in with $13.7 billion in sales and adjusted profit of 62 cents per share. Lilly's total sales grew 7% to $6.16 billion and the firm brought in adjusted income of $1.14 per share. Vertex reported sales of $651.6 million and adjusted profit of 61 cents per share. AstraZeneca reported core earnings of $1.30 per share and $5.78 billion in sales.

Both shares plunged below their 50-day lines, with Chevron undercutting a recent buy point. Separately, U.S. crude production continues to hit fresh longtime highs, while crude supplies rose for the first time in 11 weeks. Crude futures remain near three-year highs.Ferrari (RACE) gapped into a buy zone after reporting strong earnings Thursday.

137,UNH,"Many stock mutual fund managers are basking in the warm glow of 2017's hot performance numbers for the broad market. The S&P 500 index rose 1.11% in December, lifting the fourth quarter's gain to 6.64% and capping a 21.83% year. The Dow Jones industrials surged 28.11% for the year, on the way to topping 25,000 for the first time ever on Thursday.X The S&P 500 is already up another 2.63% so far this year. The Dow is up 2.20%.U.S. diversified stock mutual funds edged up 0.73% on average in December to extend their gains in Q4 to 5.13% and in 2017 to 18.26%, according to Lipper Inc. World equity funds, powered in part by a weaker dollar, turned in gains of 2% in December, 4.92% in Q4 and 28.52% last year.General domestic taxable bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.57% on top of a 0.39% December move. They finished the year up 4.86%.But fund managers and investment strategists have also turned their eyes to 2018, where many expect more-modest gains overall.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersTop Mutual Funds In Q4Mutual Fund Category PerformanceWhy Buffalo Discovery Fund Keeps OutperformingWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Fund managers and strategists expect to rely more on foreign stocks and on value equities for their gains. Still, fund managers certainly have not abandoned U.S. equities totally, having 2018 bets on stocks like First Solar (FSLR), part of the S&P 500; Amazon (AMZN), a key piece of the Nasdaq Composite; and Boeing (BA), the best performing Dow Jones industrial average stock in 2017.One reason fund managers and strategists expect to search further afield overall for big returns in 2018: history. Since 1963, the S&P 500 has rallied more than 15% annually in 19 years. And each time it did that, in the following year the broad market's gains averaged just 7.5%.Two more reasons for the expected rotation into more foreign stocks and value equities: Cheaper valuations for many foreign equities give them more room to run in '18, and forecasts for faster economic growth abroad.""We're in a synchronous growth pattern,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist for Nuveen Asset Management and manager or co-manager of seven of its stock mutual funds with a combined $1.7 billion in assets. ""It's rare that we have growth in the U.S. as well as in key markets abroad. In this sort of economic environment, value (stocks) overall should beat growth (stocks).""Stocks should also continue to get a tailwind from the Federal Reserve's slow tempo of interest rate hikes. ""The slow pace is reassuring to investors,"" said Allen Bond, a manager of $6.6 billion Jensen Quality Growth Fund (JENSX), which outperformed the S&P 500 in 2017 as well as the past three and 10 years, and just fell short over the past five years.One key reason why Doll expects value to outperform is that corporate earnings have been on a roll and should remain that way. That's indicative of a rising economic tide that lifts stocks of all stripes, including modestly priced value-oriented ones, Doll said. Further, as the strengthening economy lifts earnings of both types of stocks, investors are likely to flock to value stocks, which are more attractively priced than growth stocks.""Inflation and interest rates have been behaving themselves and letting earnings growth go to the bottom line,"" he added.Doll added that U.S. tax reform should boost corporate earnings. Also, both corporate CEO and consumer confidence is up. And demand is strong for many goods and services, especially in the technology, health care and certain consumer areas.IBD'S TAKE: To see how tax reform impacts individuals like you, check out this IBD report.""Much of the consumer area has been doing OK, with capital spending improving before the tax bill, (enactment of which) will accentuate capital spending,"" Doll said. ""That should be good for industrials and many tech stocks.""Within the tech space, Doll likes software companies and credit card companies, which use software to facilitate digital payments for transactions. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) were among the top four holdings of Doll's largest portfolio, $563.8 million Nuveen Large Cap Core (NLCIX), as of Nov. 30.Among health care stocks, ""I would highlight diversified biotech companies and managed care providers,"" he said. ""I'm less interested in pharmaceuticals and some equipment companies. . . . We prefer diversified biotech to pharma as they have faster growth and similar valuation characteristics.""Nuveen Large Cap Core also held cloud computing services provider Red Hat (RHT). Red Hat enables a client's noncloud enterprise software to jibe with cloud infrastructure like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was a third holding. UnitedHealth benefits from membership growth, driven by rising employment and by increased use of managed care by the U.S. government to control costs. The firm also benefits from its use of data analytics.Additional holdings included First Solar, Amazon and Boeing. Solar energy company First Solar was new to the fund in November. It posted Q3 results on Oct. 27 that crushed analysts' expectations. After four quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 0% and 64% the past two stanzas. Hot as a solar flare in 2017, the stock gained 110.41%.Trading around 125, First Solar is extended. It has a very strong IBD Composite Rating of 98. IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. Its IBD SMR Rating is A. That means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Amazon soared nearly 56% last year. The e-commerce leader slid on Dec. 29 amid reports that President Trump had called for Amazon — also a leader in cloud services — to pay the U.S. Postal Service higher fees for package deliveries. Separately, the FAANG stock says it shipped more than 5 billion items in '17 through its Prime program, for which customers pay $99 a year.Amazon is near a buy point. Shares broke out Thursday but closed just below the flat base's buy point. Now the stock is back above its proper entry of 1,213.51.And aerospace and defense titan Boeing gapped up more than 2% on Dec. 12 after saying it would raise its dividend 20%, to $1.71 a share, up from $1.42, giving shares a 2.3% dividend yield. Boeing also increased its stock buyback program.In 2018, Dow-component Boeing is up 4.19%.In the tech sector, Jensen's Bond likes stocks that benefit from the ongoing transition to cloud computing. He likes companies that help themselves by making the switch or that make money by helping others shift to the cloud.Microsoft (MSFT) is a dual beneficiary, he says. Oracle (ORCL) enables customers to use on-premises enterprise software or to shift to cloud computing. ""They are a go-to database software provider for companies with extremely sensitive information that can't have things go wrong,"" Bond said.He also likes Alphabet (GOOGL). ""GOOGL is more of a player in the cloud infrastructure space,"" he said. ""If a customer needs access to a cloud structure, they sell that. But most of their business is from their core advertising model, resulting from their ubiquitous position in online search and online ad buying.""Bond also likes specific themes in health care. One such theme is growing affluence in emerging markets. That enables patients to be able to afford better health care.""When a health care system starts to grow and develop in an emerging market, needles and syringes are some of the first things they need to make that work,"" he said. As a result, he likes Becton, Dickinson & Co. (BDX), a leading maker of needles and syringes.The company acquired CareFusion, a maker of infusion pumps (which deliver medical liquids over time), in 2015.And last month Becton Dickinson said it and C.R. Bard had agreed to divest two product lines to win regulatory approval for their merger. Bard makes catheters and biopsy devices.Bond also likes Stryker (SYK), whose orthopedic implants, surgical tools and medical devices enable it to capitalize on aging populations in the U.S., Europe and Japan.The $174 million Kinetics Internet Fund (WWWFX) was one of the top performing U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in 2017, posting a 57.43% gain, according to Morningstar Direct.The fund had 36 holdings as of Sept. 30, including a 12% stake in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC). The cryptocurrency, which is volatile, rose about 1,166% last year. ""We're not afraid to be wrong,"" said co-manager Peter Doyle. ""A lot of people won't participate in the upside of 'consensus money' and cryptocurrencies because they need outside reinforcement. We don't say cryptocurrencies can't fail. But we control our risk by controlling the size of our position.""Doyle said the fund's stake is ""much higher"" than what it has formally disclosed, due to appreciation.For investment opportunities in general, the fund is looking beyond many popular large caps that enjoyed large run-ups in 2017 and other recent years. Their high valuations leave them insufficient room to post additional gains, said co-manager James Davolos.For one thing, the fund holds stock in nine companies in which noted investor and Liberty Global (LBTYK) chairman John Malone holds large blocks of shares, including Liberty Media (LSXMK), Liberty Broadband (LBRDK) and Liberty Global. ""If you've trusted John Malone (by owning shares in his companies) over the years, almost without exception you've done well,"" Doyle said.Kinetics Internet also likes Live Nation Entertainment (LYV). The company helps popular music performers earn a living through live performances and through concession sales, corporate sponsorships and advertising, Doyle said.The fund managers also like Copart (CPRT), which conducts salvaged vehicle auctions. ""This company keeps gaining market share by providing value to both buyers and sellers of vehicles by providing price transparency and lower transaction costs,"" Davolos said.S&P 500 index funds led all U.S. diversified categories in Q4 with an average gain of 6.76% after tacking on 1.28% in December.World equity funds trailed U.S. diversified stock funds in Q4, averaging a 4.92% advance after a 2% December return. India region funds paced all foreign stock fund categories by soaring 12.64% in Q4, helped by a 4.77% December romp.Global natural resources funds beat other major sectors by posting a 6.45% Q4 gain, aided by a 4.96% December geyser. That gave them an 8.49% return for the year. But commodities base metals funds did even better with gains of 7.68% in December, 10.97% in Q4 and 28.69% for the year.Consumer services funds added 2.52% in December, which lifted its gains to 8.42% in Q4 and 18.23% in 2017.Loan participation funds were tops in Q4 among general domestic taxable bond categories, rising 1%. Their December gain was 0.35%.Among world income funds, emerging markets hard currency funds enjoyed the best Q4, gaining 0.73%, a shade better than their December return.Municipal bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.44% after returning 0.81% in December.RELATED:Stock To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top FundsHow Did Mutual Funds Perform In 2017?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

139,UNH,"Investors seeking increasing dividend income and long-term capital growth through a proven active management approach should find a lot to like in T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund (PRDGX).X Tom Huber, the fund's portfolio manager since 2000, also seeks companies that are expected to raise their dividend rates at a healthy clip — and that may be undervalued.Huber's approach has served shareholders well as the $8.5 billion fund has risen 16.7% year-to-date through Nov. 24. PRDGX has also posted an annual average return of 9.4% for the last 15 years vs. 8.7% for large blend funds tracked by Morningstar Direct.IBD recently spoke with Huber to discuss his investment process and outlook for dividend stocks in 2018.IBD: What factors have driven your outperformance against other large blend funds?Huber: The outperformance is attributable to leveraging our global research platform, finding good ideas and consistently applying our process. Having a long-term outlook is a strategy that ultimately has led us to pick good businesses that outperform over time through a market cycle.IBD: What is your strategy for selecting dividend-paying stocks?Huber: We look for companies that pay and grow their dividends over time. This leads us to durable business models of companies capable of consistently growing earnings. They are big generators of free cash flow; that is really a hallmark of the strategy and it funds our growing dividend stream.We look for well-managed businesses with management teams that are very good with capital allocation because that is going to drive share prices going forward. Finally, we pay attention to valuation. We're really trying to buy good companies at good prices, and what we end up with is a portfolio of high-quality businesses with a yield that is competitive to the market, but with faster dividend growth.IBD: Why is dividend growth important?Huber: Dividends are an important component of total return. Half of returns over time come from dividends, and dividend growth stocks outperform at lower levels of volatility through cycles.Dividends provide a measure of downside protection in volatile markets, and the growing streams of income protect investors from rising interest rates and inflation. Also, businesses that are growing dividends and cash flows over time tend to be more durable, so their earnings and cash flow streams hold up better in times of stress.Where To Find Income Without Taking Big RisksDoes Steady Earnings Growth Lead To Big Dividends?How Growth Stocks Can Yield Solid Income TooWhat Does Trump Tax Cut Mean For Dividends?IBD: If I am an income investor, how would this fund fit into my portfolio?Huber: We're offering a competitive yield with a higher level of growth and a growing income stream. For periods of rising rates and inflation, dividend-growth stocks tend to perform relatively well vs. pure yield-oriented or bond-equivalent investments.IBD: What has enabled you to maintain a relatively low turnover ratio for the fund?Huber: It really comes down to the type of business we are looking for — we're buying good companies. I feel if we are doing that, we should own them for an extended period and let the investments compound for us. I think it is, by definition, what we do in applying our process that leads us to a lower turnover strategy.IBD: Where are you looking for growth among dividend-paying stocks in 2018?Huber: The payout ratio (percentage of earnings paid out as dividends) of the S&P 500, which bottomed at about 27%, has now recovered to about 42%. So you are getting to a point where, for the market overall, dividends will likely grow with earnings.I think the sectors where you are going to find the best dividend growth, at least in the next few years, will be sectors like financials and technology because payout ratios are relatively low, and fundamentals and earnings growth are above average, so you have a nice combination to drive dividend growth.Another sector we like is health care. It's an area where you are again getting above-average growth and room for good dividend growth as well. Other sectors like consumer staples, telecom and REITs, which are traditionally more defensive, are a little bit challenged right now, so it's tougher to find robust dividend growth there.IBD: Your top position, Microsoft (MSFT), has been a holding since 2000. What aspects of the company have allowed it to be a mainstay in your portfolio?Huber: It was the first big technology company to pay a dividend, so it opened the door for big tech stocks to return capital to shareholders. We have been very impressed with Satya Nadella as CEO. He has brought about a real change in culture at the company. Microsoft is now successfully transitioning its business from on-premises to the cloud. Its valuation, in terms of multiple of enterprise value to free cash flow, has grown from 10 times to 18 times. It is still very well-positioned and capable of growing free cash flow per share well into the double digits for the next several years.IBD: Shares of your No. 2 holding, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), have posted strong gains over the past 52 weeks. How do you like the stock?Huber: I think it is probably the best managed company in the sector with Jamie Dimon running it. The company has an improving returns profile, with returns on tangible equity expected to increase from 13% in 2017 to 16% in 2020. In 2018, we think JPMorgan Chase can return about 105% of earnings to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. We have a business that we think can grow 13% for the next three to four years trading at about 12.5 times earnings, which represents good value.IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which you have owned since 2012, upped its quarterly dividend by 20% earlier this year. Are there any specific tailwinds you see for UnitedHealth right now?Huber: It's an industry leader, well-positioned with dominant scale in all of its major lines of insurance as well as in health care services through Optum. The synergy between the two businesses drives both better health outcomes and costs. I would also expect midteens growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends from the company going forward.RELATED:How To Generate Investment Income Despite Low Interest RatesFidelity's Top Income Expert Lays Out Opportunities And Challenges In Stocks And BondsBaron Funds' CEO Spies Much Opportunity Amid Current Disruptions

140,UNH,"MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund (MLAAX) is racing at a gallop, thanks in part to thoroughbred holdings like Alibaba Group (BABA), Nvidia (NVDA), PayPal (PYPL) and Facebook (FB).XThe first two have gained more than 100% this year. PayPal is up nearly 100%, and Facebook has climbed nearly 60%.Fund lead manager Justin Kelly describes where the $12.4 billion fund's giddy-up has come from in broad terms: ""During what we called the QE (quantitative easing) bubble from 2012 to 2016, growth stocks were (largely) out of favor,"" he said. ""Value and safety stocks were (generally) in favor because interest rates were so close to zero."" Now investors' appetite for growth has returned. ""People feel better about the growth outlook and (generally) are willing to pay more for growth stocks,"" he said.That appetite has enabled the fund to jump 32.05% so far this year going into Friday. That's well ahead of the S&P 500's 18.11% gain and the fund's large-cap growth peers' average of 25.74%. It's also nearly triple the fund's own three-year average annual gain and more than double its five-year pace.The fund itself shows a preference for three flavors, or buckets, of growth. One bucket holds consistent growers. ""Those are companies that tend to grow through positive as well as more-challenged economic times,"" Kelly said.The second bucket holds what Kelly calls dynamic growth companies that he and his colleagues estimate will grow revenue and earnings an average of 10% or more for each of the next three or so years. ""They've been growing market share in markets that are expanding,"" Kelly said, and their industries tend to be newer.The third bucket holds cyclical growth stocks operating in more economically sensitive sectors. ""We believe those companies are in the right part of their cycle,"" Kelly said about bucket No. 3.In any bucket, a holding must be addressing a growth opportunity, gaining market share or have a leading share, and have high or rising return on invested capital. It also must have sustainable competitive advantages and strong, innovative management.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is an example of a stock in that first bucket. Steven Hamill, who tracks health care stocks for the fund, says the fund team believes UnitedHealth benefits from membership growth, driven by rising employment and by increased use of managed care by the U.S. government to control costs. The firm also benefits from its use of data analytics.That's a payoff from UnitedHealth's acquisitions of information-technology companies over the past 15 years, Hamill says. With more insight into patient trends and cost trends, UnitedHealth has been able to offer services at prices below those of its rivals. ""That's allowed them to gain share and have profit-margin growth,"" Hamill said.Salesforce.com (CRM) — whose cloud software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships — is an example of a stock in bucket No. 2 for dynamic growers. On Tuesday the company reported adjusted third-quarter profit and revenue that topped expectations, but its profit outlook for the current quarter slightly disappointed most investors, IBD reported.""Our belief is that they can grow free cash flow at (an average of) 25% annually for the next three years, and that the market is underestimating the duration of their growth,"" Kelly said.Netherlands-based ASML Holding (ASML) is an example of a company in the fund's third bucket, holding cyclical growers. ASML makes lithography systems used to fabricate integrated circuits. The fund began its current stake in June.""We saw a big upward earnings cycle developing,"" Kelly said. ""We believe the company (looked poised to) make more money in the next two years than Wall Street's consensus view expected. So our analysis differed on both the size and duration of their expected free cash flow and earnings.""MainStay Large Cap Growth's big gainers this year include Alibaba, which is in the dynamic-growth bucket. ""They are the leading e-commerce platform in China, and they have an emerging (online) payments platform (Alipay) and cloud services business,"" Kelly noted. ""They've benefited from many growing technology trends. They are the Amazon (AMZN) of China.""Alibaba is a longtime member of Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play moves of top stocks.Nvidia, another dynamic growth stock in the fund's portfolio, has expanded well beyond its roots in video games. ""We think their video game business is a modest grower,"" Kelly said. ""We believe their gem is their data-center products business. We think their business in (chips for) self-driving cars is only beginning.""Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) enable players to see increasingly lifelike action in video games. Now variations on those GPUs provide the speedier calculations needed by data centers, machine learning and self-driving cars. ""We believe those newer businesses have faster growth than their video games business,"" Kelly said.PayPal, also a dynamic growth stock, benefits from the shift to electronic payments. ""As transactions increasingly go online, we believe PayPal makes it easier for consumers to make purchases quickly,"" Kelly said. ""We think their growth will be stronger than the market (in general) believes.""Facebook is also a member of IBD's Leaderboard. The increasing use of social media is driving Facebook, Kelly says. ""As they've gotten bigger, they've applied more analytics to their technology, increasing returns for advertisers,"" Kelly said. ""We believe it's a self-reinforcing advantage over other social media services like Twitter (TWTR) and Snapchat (SNAP).""RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

141,UNH,"CVS Health (CVS) will buy Aetna (AET) for about $67.5 billion, creating a health-care giant that will have a hand in everything from insurance to the corner drugstore.X CVS will pay $207 a share for Aetna, with $145 a share in cash and the rest in stock, the companies said in a statement Sunday. That's a 29% premium to Aetna's share price on Oct. 25, the day before the companies were reported to be in talks.The deal is among the biggest health-care mergers of the past decade, combining the largest U.S. drugstore chain with the third-biggest health insurer. CVS also manages drug-benefits plans for employers and insurers, a business that could help steer some of Aetna's 22 million customers into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription. The deal will give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.Including CVS's assumption of Aetna's debt, the deal will be valued at $78 billion. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018, the companies said.In a joint interview, CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said combining the companies would help CVS expand a variety of retail medical services, from vision care to nutrition advice to audiology, making basic care more convenient and less costly for consumers. Aetna will be operated as a separate business unit, and any new services will be designed to appeal broadly to customers of other insurance companies as well, the executives said.The immediate financial benefits of the deal are projected to be relatively modest. The companies said they expect $750 million in synergies, and profit improvements in the low-to-mid single digits the second full year after the merger is completed. The companies are betting on longer-term profit from reshaping how their customers get care, by creating what the executives are calling ""10,000 new front doors for the health-care system'' at CVS's stores and clinics.""Think of these stores as a hub of a new way of accessing health-care services across America,'' Merlo said in the joint interview. ""We're bringing health care to where people live and work.''s into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription through CVS's drug plans. It will also give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.The deal will be financed with a mix of cash and debt. Barclays, Goldman Sachs. and Bank of America have committed to provide $49 billion of financing, the person said. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018 and create cost savings of about $750 million, said the person.After the deal closes, Aetna will operate as a separate unit run by members of the current management. Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini will join the CVS board, along with two other Aetna directors.It comes as the health sector is looking over the horizon at Amazon.com (AMZN), and how the company could shake up the business of buying, distributing and selling drugs and medical products if it gets into health care. The retail industry has been battered by the online giant. Amazon hasn't revealed its plans.""One of the problems with the health-care system is it's so fragmented and there's so little coordination,"" said Steve Kraus, who invests in health firms at Bessemer Venture Partners. ""A better vertically integrated less-siloed system is a good thing in my mind.""It could also set off a new round of takeovers as CVS and Aetna's competitors look at the reshaped landscape. On Nov. 30, the CEO of Express Scripts (ESRX) said the pure-play pharmacy benefits manager would be open to a deal at the right price, though wasn't actively looking for one.""We don't need to sell to be very successful in the future, but we are always open to others who may all of sudden conclude they want what we have,"" Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said in an interview. He also mentioned the possibility of partnering with Amazon on a drug distribution arrangement.Express Scripts is just one company in a universe of independent drug plans, insurers and supply-chain middlemen. WellCare Health Plans (WCG), Humana (HUM) and Centene (CNC) could become merger targets after the CVS-Aetna deal, according to Matthew Borsch, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Drug distributors like Cardinal Health (CAH) or McKesson (MCK), and retailers such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) could also face pressure to find partners.CVS, which operates about 9,700 retail stores and 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, has been moving beyond it drugstore roots for years. In 2007, it bought pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx — a business that made up almost half of the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company's operating profit in the third quarter. In 2014, CVS stopped selling cigarettes and added ""Health"" to its name.""Aetna has emphasized its desire to move care closer to the consumer,"" Brian Tanquilut, an analyst at Jefferies, said on Oct. 26. ""CVS's capabilities, including Minute Clinic and the Coram home infusion business, could enable the health plan to improve health outcomes and reduce cost trend.""Consolidation is picking up among health-care suppliers and administrators, as insurers seek more control over how their consumers get care. But two proposed megamergers among insurers — including a deal between Aetna and Humana — were blocked this year on antitrust grounds, leading the companies to look beyond rival insurers to different types of health-care companies for potential deals.The CVS-Aetna deal antitrust prospects may depend on which U.S. regulator is tasked with reviewing it, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Rie. The Federal Trade Commission has been less critical of consolidation among companies in adjacent businesses, known as vertical consolidation. The Justice Department, on the other hand, last month sued to block the merger of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), a vertical deal.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said the DOJ effort to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal does raises concerns but a CVS-Aetna deal does have a path forward. Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug plan business, he said.The biggest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), is also the most diversified. United owns doctor clinics and an outpatient surgery chain, and also has a pharmacy-benefits management, called OptumRx, built on the acquisition of Catamaran Corp. in 2015

149,UNH,"Aetna (AET) easily topped Wall Street's third-quarter earnings estimates Tuesday even as it fell short on revenue. But the health insurer said it won't comment on reports that it is in talks to be acquired by CVS Health (CVS). The drugstore giant and pharmacy benefit manger is mulling a reported $66 billion as tries to position itself for the entry of Amazon.com (AMZN) into the retail prescription business.XMeanwhile, rival health insurer WellCare Health (WCG) soared back into a buy zone on its blowout earnings.Aetna earnings per share rose 18% to $2.45 as revenue fell 5% to $14.99 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of $2.08 and revenue of $15.11 billion. Aetna raised its full-year 2017 EPS guidance to $9.75 from the $9.45 to $9.55 range offered in early August and the $9.49 analyst consensus. But given the 27-cent beat in Q3, that implies Q4 EPS roughly in line.WellCare Health earned $4.08 a share, up 150% vs. a year earlier and more than doubled the expected $1.90. Revenue grew 25% to $4.403 billion though that was just below the consensus for $4.411 billion.Aetna shares fell 0.7% to 170.05 on the stock market today, continuing to slip from Thursday's 11.5% spike to 180.70 when news of CVS merger talks hit.WellCare shares jumped 9.1% to 197.67, hitting a record high and retaking a 184.98 buy point.Meanwhile, CVS shares rose 0.1%, but that's after tumbling more than 9% over the prior three sessions to their lowest levels since early 2014 on the buzz that it was offering $66 billion for Aetna.Amazon shares, which surged Friday on better-than-expected earnings, edged higher early, continuing to rally after  surging 13.2% Friday on its blowout Q3 earnings.Aetna highlighted Medicare as the company's primary growth driver, with 23,000 new members added in the quarter and plans to expand its geographic footprint in 2018. Aetna ended the period with 22.2 million insured members.The revenue decline reflected a one-year suspension of the Affordable Care Act health insurer fee that is tacked on to premiums, a pullback from the ObamaCare individual market and Medicaid contract losses.Management said the restoration of the health insurance fee would knock 25 cents off of 2018 EPS.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 23,400 on Friday, up more than 1,500 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Analysts have been somewhat divided over the benefits of a CVS-Aetna deal, with some saying it would provide negotiating leverage with drug manufacturers and others warning that other health plans might distance themselves from CVS. Antitrust also may be an issue.A CVS-Aetna deal is seen as a challenge to the dominance of UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which spearheaded the combination of managed care and prescription benefit management with its 2015 acquisition of Catamaran, now OptumRx. UnitedHealth shares slipped 1.5% on Monday. UnitedHealth is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, revenue, margin and stock performance trends.Express Scripts (ESRX), as a stand-alone prescription benefit manager, is seen as increasingly vulnerable and a potential takeover target.

Netflix (NFLX) rose slightly after reporting strong Q3 subscriber growth late Monday, suggesting a departure from recent big post-earnings stock swings.XMore broadly, the S&P 500 and other major averages hit fresh record highs Monday, but there were no new breakouts. Facebook (FB) and CSX (CSX) are among top stocks hovering near buy points, while Apple (AAPL) made a constructive move but not a new buying opportunity.S&P 500 index futures were essentially unchanged vs. fair value. So were Dow futures. Nasdaq 100 futures rose a fraction vs. fair value.UnitedHealth (UNH) topped third-quarter earnings estimates early Tuesday, part of a big day for Dow components and earnings reports generally.Netflix reported mixed Q3 results, with earnings growth less than expected while revenue narrowly topped. But the internet TV service added 5.3 million streaming subscribers worldwide, well above views for 4.4 million, and predicted strong user growth in Q4. Netflix credited original content for attracting customers, and said it will spend $7 billion to $8 billion on its own shows next year, up from a prior forecast for $7 billion and this year's $6 billion.Netflix rose 1.6% to 205.96 in early trading on the stock market today. Netflix rallied into earnings, closing up 1.6% to 202.68 on Monday, hitting a new all-time high and becoming extended from a 190.05 buy point.A modest post-earnings reaction would be a change. Here's how Netflix has moved the day after its last several earnings reports:Keep in mind that extended trading often doesn't translate into regular-session action. After a night to digest Netflix's results and guidance, investors may send the stock soaring or plunging.The major market averages all hit new highs during Monday's session, with the S&P 500 up 0.2%, the Nasdaq 0.3% and the Dow 0.4%. But there were no breakouts, according to IBD's Marketsmith.Facebook crept ever closer to a 175.59 flat-base buy point, rising 0.45% to 174.52. That's a record close for Facebook.CSX, which is slated to kick off rail earnings Tuesday morning, rose 2 cents to 52.85, below a 54.39 cup-with-handle entry.Apple, one of the many strong Dow performers Monday, rose 1.8% to 159.88, retaking its 50-day moving average. Apple got a Keybanc upgrade on higher-priced iPhones, noting that the average price of its new handset is 12% higher than its previous generation.Initially Monday's move came on higher volume, which would have made reclaiming the 50-day a buying opportunity. But Apple ultimately closed on volume that was 13% below normal. Apple is building the right side of a flat base with a 165.04 entry, however.RELATED:The Big Picture: Dow Approaches 23,000 As These Blue Chips RallyNetflix Beats On Third-Quarter Subscriber Gains; Stock ClimbsHow Does Facebook Compare To Amazon, Netflix And Google?4 Dow Stocks To Report Earnings Tuesday: Investing Action Plan

However, the ETF instead consolidated to form a flat base. DVY climbed past a 94.79 buy point of the new flat base on Oct. 11, and remains in buy range from the entry.

158,UNH,"Amid the ongoing war of words between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump, investors preferred to refrain from sparking big moves within the stock market Friday. Leading stocks remain healthy.XThe Dow Jones industrial average was down less than 0.2% at 3 p.m. ET, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were virtually flat.Volume is running lower vs. the same time Thursday on both main exchanges.On the positive side, winning stocks are thumping losers in the stock market today, by a nearly 9-to-5 margin on the NYSE and 17-to-11 on the Nasdaq.One Leaderboard stock, however, faced a severe sell-off and is trying to keep its nascent rally going.

Apple has survived temporary declines beneath the 10-week moving average in the past. The stock also still holds a decent cushion above its rising 40-week moving average.The last time Apple touched the 40-week line, roughly equivalent to the 200-day moving average on a daily chart, was in October 2016. That was the time when Apple was still molding a bottoming base pattern.Apple eventually broke out of that base, soaring past a 118.12 entry in a good cup with handle.Elsewhere in the market, small caps continued to thrive.The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied 0.7% as more money continued to flow into small banks.

American Express (AXP) took the hardest early hit, down 0.8%.Apple (AAPL) scaled up 1% in early trade, after KeyBanc Securities upgraded the stock to overweight from sector weight. The note said iPhone X pricing, the increase of iPhone 8/8+ and a change to its storage pricing ""represent a more aggressive strategy to segment its customer base and extract incremental gross profit from its users than we previously expected.""Apple shares rose through resistance at the stock's 10-week moving average.

The stock ended Friday at the very top of its buy range, a fraction less than 5% past a 190.05 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.

The bank is back below its 200-day line and further away from a potential double-bottom entry at 56.70.Meanwhile, Bank of America (BAC) reversed from early losses to rise over 1% after reporting better-than-expected Q3 earnings and sales. Shares are attempting to remain above a 25.45 cup-shaped base entry.FANG stock Netflix (NFLX) saw its second price-target boost in as many days as after JPMorgan raised it from 210 to 225 ahead of next week's Q3 results. Shares jumped almost 2%, and are barely extended from a cup-with-handle's 190.05 buy point.

162,UNH,"Sen. John McCain almost certainly just killed TrumpCare — and gave a boost to managed-care stocks such as UnitedHealth (UNH) and Centene (CNC). The Arizona Republican declared that he couldn't ""in good conscience"" vote for the Graham-Cassidy plan to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with block grants to states.I cannot in good conscience vote for Graham-Cassidy. A bill impacting so many lives deserves a bipartisan approach. https://t.co/2sDjhw6Era pic.twitter.com/30OWezQpLg— John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) September 22, 2017The news brought a sudden turnaround in managed-care stocks, though much of that was short-lived. Shares of Centene, whose fortunes are more tied to the ObamaCare exchanges and Medicaid than any other leading insurer, vaulted into positive territory on the stock market today. After being down more than 3%, Centene shot up to gain 3%, closing with an advance of 1.6%. Dow component UnitedHealth, which had been down more than 2%, finished off 1.1%. While UnitedHealth has bailed on the exchanges, it serves about 6 million Medicaid beneficiaries. Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) both closed 0.1% higher.Hospital operator HCA Healthcare (HCA) went from near the flatline to up 0.7% after McCain's remarks, made shortly before 2 p.m. ET.The rebound in insurers and hospitals also helped the Dow industrials pare losses and the S&P 500 index to close up 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite moved to a 0.1% gain.IBD'S TAKE: Centene isn't just widely acknowledged to be the insurer to best capitalize on the ObamaCare exchanges, it's also ranked No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group based on earnings, sales and margin trends, as well as stock performance. Check out how other insurers stack up at IBD Stock Checkup. The industry group is ranked 39 of 197 based on price performance, getting a ""neutral"" grade from IBD. Breakout stock candidates are more likely to be successful if their industry group ranks among the top 40.Before McCain spoke, the Medical-Managed Care industry group was down about 5% on the week, putting in No. 194 among 197 IBD industry groups.The last-ditch repeal bill from GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy would shift ObamaCare funding to the states via block grants — through a formula that advantages states which didn't expand Medicaid, while sticking it to states that did. Including a cap on growth of per-beneficiary Medicaid subsidies, the bill would cut federal outlays by about $200 billion from 2020-2026.Congress has until Sept. 30 to pass legislation using a filibuster-proof budget reconciliation procedure that expires at the end of the fiscal year. Extending the ObamaCare-repeal effort is unlikely because it could make tax reform more difficult.RELATED:Wall Street Is Taking The Latest ObamaCare Repeal Push SeriouslyStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksObamaCare Repeal Is Dead: Here Are The 2 Big WinnersObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths

163,UNH,"CVS Health (CVS) isn't taking the threat from Amazon.com (AMZN) lying down.XNews that the drugstore chain is reportedly in talks to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) for more than $200 per share hit just after reports that Amazon has obtained wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least a dozen states.Aetna shares vaulted 11.5% to close at 178.60 on the stock market today. CVS shares fell 2.9%, recovering somewhat after the Aetna news followed the Amazon report. Amazon shares changed little during regular trading but surged 7.8% late after reporting quarterly results that sailed past estimates.Meanwhile, news about Amazon's pharmacy licenses sent Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) down 3.2%, while a host of drug distributors also got whacked. AmerisourceBergen (ABC) lost 4.2%, McKesson (MCK) 5.2% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 3.4%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.CVS and Aetna, which serves 22 million members, already had close ties, with Aetna signing up the drugstore giant's Caremark unit as its pharmacy benefit management partner this spring.In June, Tarun Mehra of the Fuld & Co. consultancy wrote that CVS should buy Aetna: ""CVS has an impressive suite of assets already, but if it were to add a health plan to its portfolio, it would create a truly large-scale integrated platform across retail, PBM, MCO (managed care organization), and a distributor joint venture (with Cardinal Health, providing CVS with a strategic advantage over UnitedHealth Group (UNH)-OptumRx.""Yet in just a few months, the potential entry of Amazon has shaken up the $300 billion prescription-dispensing industry, and analysts are now speculating that UnitedHealth could partner with Amazon.

164,UNH,"Anthem (ANTM) shares broke above a buy point to an all-time high on Wednesday, powered by better-than-expected earnings and a strategic acquisition.XThe for-profit operator of Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans reported a third-quarter profit of $2.65 per share, up 8% from a year ago and 22 cents ahead of estimates. Revenue rose 4.8% to $22.43 billion vs. estimates of $22.05 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Anthem offered full-year EPS guidance of $11.90 to $12.00, not far ahead of the $11.83 consensus, considering its Q3 earnings beat.Still, shares of Anthem jumped 5.4% to 205.71, clearing a buy point at 199.08, though off its new intraday record high of 208.74. Shares of other insurers were mixed, with UnitedHealth Group (UNH) off 0.3%, Cigna (CI) up about 1% and Centene (CNC) down 2.4%.IBD'S TAKE: When a stock clears a buy point, it offers investors their most reliable opportunity for near-term gains. Take Caterpillar, which cleared a buy zone on the strength of Q1 earnings in April and advanced close to 40% in six months. But investors should be discriminating about which stock breakouts they jump on.

The purchase, for an undisclosed sum, is expected to close early in 2018 and be slightly accretive to earnings in fiscal 2018.Last week, Anthem said that it will launch its own pharmacy-benefit management business, relying heavily on CVS Health (CVS) for both back-end processing and retail distribution.The five-year deal with CVS, which will take effect in 2020, brings Anthem closer to resembling the model established by UnitedHealth, which bought pharmacy-benefits manager Catamaran for $12.8 billion in 2015.Amazon.com (AMZN) reportedly is close to entering the prescription-dispensing field, with several analysts speculating that Amazon might acquire a pharmacy-benefits manager to gain entry into the $300 billion business.Centene shares fell for second straight session, tumbling below its 50-day line after losing 5.1% on Tuesday. While the leading ObamaCare-exchange insurer topped earnings estimates on Tuesday, it warned that EPS in the coming quarter might face a hit of 7 to 12 cents if the White House immediately follows through on its threat to cut cost-sharing subsidies, which are paid to insurers in order to lower deductibles and out-of-pocket bills for low-income members.RELATED:Anthem Jumps Into Prescription Business As Amazon Speculation SwirlsUnitedHealth Signals Openness To Amazon Partnership; Earnings BeatStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLeaderboard: Daily Updates On Stocks With Potential For Big Gains

165,UNH,"Stocks rattled off an unequivocal up day Friday.The gains were not huge, with the Dow ending up 0.7%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite notched a 0.4% win. But the advance came despite some possibly worrisome political events expected over the weekend in Spain, and an election in Japan — the kind of thing which, if investors were feeling nervous, would be enough to send stocks ducking for cover.XInstead, the Dow industrials, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all clocked another set of new highs. The Dow turned its best performance in more than a month.Preliminary data showed volume mixed, up on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq, despite options expirations that normally drive volume sharply higher.More than a half-dozen Dow industrials closed with gains of better than 1%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) led the ascent, up more than 2% to breakout past a 200.09 buy point in a flat base. The stock was still in a buy range at the closing bell.Procter & Gamble (PG) tumbled nearly 4% after beating fiscal first-quarter earnings expectations by a penny, but stopping just short of targets on the revenue line. The fall stabbed below the stock's 40-week moving average, dealing the chart a serious setback.General Electric (GE) managed a minor miracle, erasing an early 6% sell-off to close 1.1% higher. The multi-industrial heavyweight missed analysts' Q3 earnings targets, then chopped back its full year earnings guidance and halved expectations for cash flow. But plans to offload $20 billion of the company's business portfolio within two years appeared to buoy some investors' spirits.It was a big week for IPOs. Internet content provider Sea Ltd. (SE) jumped 8% in its first day of trade on Friday. MongoDB (MDB) pulled back 4% Friday, giving back a small piece of the 32% gained in its opening day of trade Thursday.China-based Qudian (QD) dropped 5% for the day, but ended 36% above Wednesday's IPO price.On the IBD 50 list, Atlassian (TEAM) was the clear champion. The project-management software developer soared 25% after reporting a solid beat with its fiscal first-quarter report late Thursday. The move left shares 27% above a 39.35 buy point, a signal for investors to lock in a portion of their profit.RELATED: Looking For The Next Nvidia?

166,UNH,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) signaled openness to partnering with Amazon (AMZN), which is reportedly considering a push into the prescription-dispensing business, after beating Q3 earnings forecasts.XThe insurer's Optum business, a provider of health services, prescription benefit management and technology services, has been a growth driver and helps the company stand apart from the rest of the managed-care market.Asked about the potential for Amazon to enter the prescription-dispensing business, OptumRx unit CEO John Prince said that the company is ""willing to partner with anybody that drives value"" with the goal of meeting consumers ""how and where they want.""Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes wrote earlier in October that he sees a partnership with UnitedHealth as the most logical path forward for Amazon as it targets the prescription business.Shares of UnitedHealth jumped 5.5% to close at a record high of 203.89 on the stock market today, bouncing off support at their 50-day average and helping the Dow Jones industrial average climb toward 23,000. Amazon edged up 0.3%. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX) rose 0.7%, and drug distributor McKesson (MCK) dipped 0.1%. CVS Health (CVS), which also has a PHM unit, added 0.3%.UnitedHealth is ranked No. 3 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, behind Centene (CNC) and Cigna (CI), based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Centene rose 3.2% and Cigna 1.2% Tuesday, helped by a bipartisan deal to fund ObamaCare subsidies for insurers.IBD'S TAKE: Get ready for each earnings season day by reading IBD's daily Investing Action Plan, which highlights stocks that are in buy range or close to it. UnitedHealth's EPS surged 23% to $2.66, beating views for $2.57, as revenue climbed 8.7% to $50.322 billion, matching forecasts. Optum revenue rose 8.4% to $22.89 billion.The company raised its guidance for full-year earnings to about $10 per share vs. its prior range for $9.75-$9.90. Analysts had expected $9.87.Because the insurer has extricated itself from the ObamaCare exchanges and GOP efforts to target Medicaid have run into trouble, it's well positioned to deal with shifting political winds.In fact, UnitedHealth markets the type of short-term medical plans that Trump wants to make widely available as a less-costly alternative to ObamaCare plans.Management noted on the earnings call that they'll consult with the Trump administration as officials write rules governing short-term plans and other areas targeted by Trump's executive order last week.RELATED:Trump Executive Order Hits ObamaCare InsurersAmazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

168,UNH,"Major stock indexes held decent gains near midday Friday as weak results from General Electric (GE) didn't have much effect on the price-weighted Dow Jones industrial average.XThe Dow outperformed, rising 0.5%, while the Nasdaq composite added 0.4% and the S&P 500 picked up 0.3%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking higher than Thursday's levels in the stock market today but was skewed somewhat by options expiration.Positive sentiment was fueled in part by renewed optimism that tax reform could become a reality. The 10-year Treasury yield was up 6 basis points to 2.38%.Six Dow names were up 1% or more, helping offset a 1.5% decline in shares of GE. Earnings per share missed by a wide margin, fueling fears that GE might do away with its quarterly dividend of 24 cents a share. GE currently yields around 4%. Shares were down as much as 6%.Strong gainers in the Dow included UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan (JPM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).Inside the IBD 50, Atlassian (TEAM) dominated the action, soaring 23% to 49.57 on strong earnings. The U.K.-based software name closed just above a 39.35 buy point Thursday. The stock gapped up Friday, so new buyers might've have opted to buy near the stock's open price of 46.24.IBD'S TAKE: Atlassian has several traits seen in past market winners before big price moves. To see what they are, check out this section of IBD University.Skechers (SKX) was another winner, up 37%, on surprisingly strong earnings. Earnings per share jumped 40% to 59 cents a share, well above the consensus estimate of 43 cents. Sales hit a quarterly record of $1.09 billion, up 16% from the year ago quarter.On the downside, Celgene (CELG) was down 10% on news the biotech giant discontinued a pair of late-stage trials for a drug being investigated to treat Crohn's disease.RELATED:How To Invest In The Stock Market Using A Simple RoutineGE Earnings Miss Badly, Cash Flow Dive Adds To Dividend FearsWill Q3 Earnings Launch 'Monster' Move For This Stock?

169,UNH,"Anthem (ANTM), the second-largest U.S. health insurer, said on Wednesday that it will launch its own pharmacy-benefit management business, relying heavily on CVS Health (CVS) for both back-end processing and retail distribution.The five-year Anthem-CVS deal will take effect in 2020, after Anthem's current contract with Express Scripts (ESRX) expires.Anthem's move brings it closer to resembling the model established by UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which bought pharmacy-benefits manager Catamaran for $12.8 billion in 2015. Cigna (CI) also has established its own pharmacy-benefits management business.Amazon.com (AMZN) reportedly is close to entering the prescription-dispensing field, with several analysts speculating that Amazon might acquire a PBM to gain entry into the $300 billion business.CVS Health, the No. 2 U.S. drugstore operator, has served as a PBM since its 2006 acquisition of Caremark.Shares of Anthem closed up 2.4% at 191.79 on the stock market today, rising earlier to 199.23, briefly topping a 199.08 buy point. CVS Health gained 2% to 74.07.Express Scripts, which expressed disappointment at losing Anthem's business, opened lower but reversed higher, settling with a 1% gain at 57.77. The reason for the rebound wasn't immediately clear, though analysts have speculated that Express Scripts could be a target for Amazon.Cigna rose 1.1%, while UnitedHealth added 0.7% after hitting a record high on Tuesday following release of strong third-quarter earnings. Amazon dipped 1.2% to 997, back below the 1,000 level.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Anthem are closing in on a buy point at 199.08. That's the point at which investors have the best odds of seeing near-term gains. Anthem is ranked No. 8 among IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see who the leaders are and find out how your stocks rank in each of 197 industry groups.A PBM essentially does for prescription benefits what managed-care companies do in managing nonprescription health benefits and claims. PBMs seek to lower the costs of pharmacy benefits by using their expertise and buying power to direct the most appropriate medicines to patients at the lowest cost.While Amazon wants to get into the retail prescription business, it faces a big challenge in dealing with the regulatory-compliance and claims-processing aspects of the business. That's where a PBM's expertise and processing systems come in. However, Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes has said that the most logical path forward for Amazon would be to form a partnership with UnitedHealth, the nation's largest insurer.When asked, on UnitedHealth's earnings call on Tuesday, about the potential for Amazon to enter the prescription-dispensing business, management said they are ""willing to partner with anybody that drives value"" with the goal of meeting consumers ""how and where they want.""RELATED:UnitedHealth Signals Openness To Amazon Partnership; Earnings BeatAmazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

170,UNH,"While the major indexes moved little Tuesday, megacaps still rallied and individual stocks still moved with gusto as earnings results continued to roll in at a faster pace.XLeading the market were the managed health care and diversified medical industry groups. The main reason: a pair of megacap plays, UnitedHealth (UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), rallied sharply on positive third-quarter results. J&J gained 3.4% to 140.79 and cleared a 137.18 buy point in an excellent three-month saucer base in heavy trading.J&J's volume zoomed more than double average levels to 11.5 million shares. Over the prior 50 sessions, an average 5.1 million shares exchanged hands each day.The Dow Jones industrial average edged nearly 0.2% higher, while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 were virtually flat. Volume is running lighter vs. the same time Monday on the NYSE and is a touch higher on the Nasdaq.The Nasdaq remains the market's leading index, up 23%, vs. a 14.3% gain for the 500 and a 16.4% lift for the Dow Jones industrials.The Russell 2000 fell 0.3%. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond inched up to 2.31%. Crude oil bounced off intraday lows and edged higher, with WTI futures rising almost 0.2% to $51.96 a barrel.The Dow Jones industrial average component J&J posted a 13% increase in earnings to $1.90 a share, matching the biggest gain in 12 quarters, as revenue growth accelerated (up 10% to $19.65 billion). The pharmaceutical, medical product and personal care giant had grown sales by 2% to 4% in each of the prior five quarters.J&J's saucer base could also be viewed as a long flat base as well. Either way, the buy point is the same, 10 cents above the base's left-side high.J&J's 61 Relative Price Strength Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, may seem low on a scale of 1 (very weak) to 99 (super strong), yet for long saucer base patterns, such an RS Rating is actually par for the course.Also, watch the stock's relative strength line, painted in blue on IBD and MarketSmith charts; an RS line that rises into new high ground helps confirm a stock's ability to outperform the S&P 500 and become a new market leader.Also, within J&J's saucer pattern, the heaviest weekly volume came during the week ended Sept. 15, when the megacap health care play rallied nearly 2.7% for the week. Big gains in heavy weekly turnover point to strong institutional demand.(Read more about the elements of a great saucer base via this Investor's Corner column written by my colleague Paul Whitfield.)J&J has a market value of $377 billion.The company's after-tax margin improved by 20 basis points to an impressive 26.5%. Guggenheim Securities analyst Tony Butler told Reuters that J&J's oncology business ""is doing exceptionally well. It's really hard to figure out where that stops for both Darzalex and Imbruvica."" Both are used to treat cancer, the former for multiple myeloma, the latter for use in chemotherapy.UnitedHealth notched a fifth quarter in a row of 20%-plus EPS growth as earnings rose 23% to $2.66 a share. Revenue grew 9%, stretching a high single-digit pace for a fourth straight quarter.Elsewhere on the stock market today, Apple (AAPL) gained an additional 0.4% to 160.47 in dull volume. On Monday, shares boosted back above a 156.75 buy point in an 11-week flat base that was cleared Aug. 2. The 5% chase zone goes up to 164.59.Apple also is now back above the 50-day moving average, a bullish sign for techs and the major indexes.Since late 2016, investors have been warming up to Apple after the iPhone giant proved it can still grow.Earnings had fallen 18%, 23% and 15% in the three quarters through fiscal 2016, ended in September that year. But in the three most recent periods, Apple grew its profit 2%, 11% and 18%, and Wall Street sees Q4 profit rising 12% to $1.87 a share.Revenue is seen climbing 9% to $50.9 billion, then rising 10% to $85.91 billion in the holiday quarter ending in December.Apple has gained more than 39% since clearing a superb first-stage cup with handle, part of a long bottoming-base pattern, at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9. As seen in Stock Checkup, Apple's ratings have improved markedly as a turnaround play since the start of the year.Meanwhile, among newer issues, Azul (AZUL) (April 11 IPO) and Bright Scholar Education (BEDU) (May 18 IPO) deserve close watch as potential new market leaders.Azul, the Brazilian airline, dropped for a third straight session but shaved its loss to a measly 0.2%. At 27, the mid-cap transportation and Latin American play is testing support at the 50-day moving average for the fourth time since Aug. 30.The Street expects Q3 profit of 26 cents a share, up from a penny in the year-ago quarter. Revenue has climbed 30%, 32%, 20% and 15% in the past four quarters. Q3 revenue is expected to rise 18% to $631 million.China's Bright Scholar focuses on kindergarten to 12th grade international and bilingual education. The firm grew its revenue 34% to a record $159 million in 2016. In the May-ended fiscal third quarter, revenue jumped 24% to $60 million, a quarterly high.Wall Street expects earnings of 2 cents  a share in the fiscal fourth quarter ended in August, vs. a net loss of a penny a share in the year-ago quarter.Then, in the November-ending fiscal first quarter of 2018, profit is seen leaping 150% to 20 cents a share. The autumn tends to be a busy time for Chinese students who are preparing for exams and applying to new schools.The small cap is up 152% since its debut at 10.50 a share.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung and track intraday updates on breakout stocks, market trends and other commentary.)IBD'S TAKE: At least three of the current stocks on IBD Leaderboard are also relatively new in the market, having gone public in 2014 or later.

172,UNH,"The major market indexes were quietly higher in early morning trade Tuesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq edged higher, rising less than 0.1%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 inched slightly higher.X Among the Dow Jones Industrial components, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth (UNH) rose 1.8% and 5.3% — respectively — after upbeat Q3 earnings results.J&J was on track to reclaim its 137.18 flat-base buy point, while UnitedHealth surged to new highs.On the downside, Boeing (BA) declined 0.6% to fall back into the 5% buy range from its 246.59 flat-base entry.FANG stock Facebook (FB) reached a breakout above a 175.59 flat-base buy point. The social media giant briefly touched a record high this morning.Among companies reporting earnings, Netflix (NFLX) has hovered between positive and negative territory, after being down as much as 2.4% earlier. Late Monday, the company released strong Q3 results late Monday that saw the video streamer add more subscribers than expected. But earnings fell short of the Street's targets, coming in at 29 cents per share compared to the 32 cent-per-share estimate.Global investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) beat top- and bottom-line estimates early Tuesday, sparking early advances. But shares of Goldman turned red, falling about 1.5%. Goldman Sachs is still building a saucer-with-handle pattern with a 247.18 entry, while Morgan Stanley added over 2% to its gains from a recent cup-with-handle breakout that featured a 48.59 buy point. Morgan reached a new 52-week high.Blue-chip JPMorgan (JPM) traded unchanged as it holds onto its recent gains from a breakout above a 95.32 flat-base buy point.Recent issue Despegar.com (DESP) faltered more than 6%, triggering a sell signal from a recent breakout above an IPO-base's 33.50 entry.Within the IBD 50, Celgene (CELG) attempted to regain its 50-day line, advancing over 1%. The biotech is still below a 139.10 flat-base entry.On the downside, leading chip stock Applied Materials (AMAT) beat a hasty retreat, falling almost 1% in morning trade.

173,UNH,"The major indexes remained little changed in afternoon trading Tuesday, another dull session that nonetheless saw widely held Facebook (FB) top a buy point.XThe Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.1% while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 were down a fraction. The Russell 2000 was flat.Volume was running slightly lower compared with the same time Monday. Decliners led advancers by 7-to-5 on the Nasdaq and by 6-to-5 on the NYSE.Goldman Sachs (GS) was the weakest Dow component, off 2% after the bank's quarterly results came in above consensus estimates.Health care, retail and other consumer stocks led today's trading. Managed health care was the top industry group as UnitedHealth Group (UNH) rallied 5.5% after the HMO beat profit expectations. UnitedHealth also indicated a willingness to partner with Amazon.com (AMZN) if the online retailer makes a push into the prescription-dispensing business.Centene (CNC), a managed-care company that's in the IBD 50, rose nearly 2% as it continues to rally back. The stock slid below the 50-day moving average Friday but made a positive reversal that carried on to this week's advance. Shares also have recovered above the 88.04 buy point of a flat base.Centene and other health insurance stocks were roiled Friday on news that President Trump would end subsidies for ObamaCare coverage as part of a series of modifications to the program.Facebook climbed above the 175.59 buy point of a flat base in volume about 25% above average.

177,UNH,"According to the latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, the leading money managers appear to be focusing on building sector and related stocks like homebuilders NVR (NVR), Toll Bros. (TOL) and KB Homes (KBH), as well as construction equipment maker Graco (GGG), wood products producer Louisiana-Pacific (LPX) and steel maker Allegheny Technologies (ATI).XMastec (MTZ) and manufactured-home builder Patrick Industries (PATK) also earned a spot on the list, as did Kimball International (KBAL), which makes furniture for the office and hospitality industries, and home furniture maker Bassett Furniture Industries (BSET).Institutional investors also continued to show demand for top chip stocks, with IBD 50 members Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) making the cut, along with Cohu (COHU) and Texas Instruments (TXN).Cohu and Lam Research can also be found on IBD's latest list of stocks expecting 50% earnings growth in Q3.With tensions rising in North Korea and President Trump promising to significantly boost defense spending, it's no surprise that major defense contractors Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Heico (HEI) are also found on the list.In last month's report, top fund managers invested over $1 billion each into four stocks: United Health (UNH) ($1.39 billion), Apple (AAPL) ($1.36 billion), Electronic Arts (EA) ($1.25 billion) and Celgene (CELG) ($1.07 billion).The latest list doesn't include any $1 billion-plus bets. The largest total investment was in Boeing, with 23 funds picking up approximately $223 million of shares.Next in line was Bank of America (BAC), with 27 funds investing $178 million. The company got an additional vote of confidence from Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett, who told CNBC on Oct. 3 that he would hold BofA shares for a ""long, long, long time.""Bank of America reports Q3 earnings on Oct. 13.Boosted by recent institutional buying, most stocks on the list — including Thor Industries (THO), Winnebago Industries (WGO) and KB Homes — have already broken out and are now extended.But several remain in or near a potential buy zone, including Mastec, Boeing, Toll Bros. and the New York Times (NYT), which has pulled back in recent days and is now testing support at the 50-day line. Note that Toll Bros. is trading at the upper limit of its buy range, while Boeing is now extended.While General Motors (GM) made the list of new buys, with five funds investing $1.2 million, it also led the list of new sells. The net number of funds selling GM (16 selling minus 5 buying) was 11.Diesel and gas engine maker Cummins (CMI) had the second-most net sellers (10), followed by axle and suspension maker Dana Inc. (DAN) (9).Despite the number of funds selling, each of these stocks has been rising, and Cummins entered a 170.78-179.32 buy zone last week.RELATED:Q3 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus GrowthU.S. Small Caps, Foreign Stocks Favored By FundsFind And Track The Best Mutual FundsLooking For The Next Nvidia?

178,UNH,"TrumpCare is back and could become the law of the land next week.While the coming vote to repeal and replace ObamaCare could go either way, Wall Street is taking this latest GOP effort seriously. Investors are bailing on health insurance stocks such as UnitedHeath Group (UNH) and Centene (CNC), while hospital stocks continued to sag.The biggest ObamaCare players were the hardest hit, with Centene sinking 5.1% and Molina Healthcare (MOH) down 5.9%. Both Centene and Molina hitched their fates to ObamaCare in a significant way, as the Medicaid managed-care companies seized the opportunity to enter the individual insurance market.Both stand to be hurt if the new GOP bill from Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy can get through Congress by Sept. 30. The clock is ticking because passage depends on using budget reconciliation to avoid a Democratic filibuster. Once the 2017 budget resolution expires on the last day of the fiscal year, the GOP would have to start from scratch.While the Congressional Budget Office hasn't yet scored the bill, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that Cassidy-Graham would cut ObamaCare funding by $239 billion from 2020 through 2026, while killing the law's subsidies and sending the money to states, which would have to figure out how best to spend it, free from much of ObamaCare's regulations.On top of that, Medicaid would impose a cap on costs per beneficiary, lowering spending by $175 billion over the same span. In 2026, the total cut in funding under Cassidy-Graham would amount to $80 billion.Even insurers that don't rank as big fans of ObamaCare saw their stocks come under pressure on Tuesday. Dow component UnitedHealth slipped 1.8%, while Humana (HUM) lost 3.4% and Aetna (AET) 3.1%. UnitedHealth, Humana and Aetna all traded at or just below their 50-day moving averages, an area of key support.IBD'S TAKE: While managed-care stocks have been solid performers lately, they aren't acting well right now. Here's a good place to start to find stocks that may be setting up for near-term advances. The group of stocks that fit IBD's investing criteria on the IBD Leaderboard have outperformed the S&P 500 by 44% this year.Among hospital stocks, HCA Healthcare (HCA) fell 1.8%, close to an eight-month low, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) dipped 0.7%, losing ground for a third straight session.One stock that stands to benefit from the legislation is Healthequity (HQY), which provides technology that lets consumers manage their health savings account, whose limits would be increased under Cassidy-Graham. Shares of Healthequity rose 3.5%.Investors seem to have been caught by surprise by the sudden revival of TrumpCare's prospects.

179,UNH,"The stock market kept on rolling in September, lifting stock mutual funds along with it. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds tacked on a 4.16% gain on average in Q3 after rising 3.02% in September alone, according to Lipper Inc.XRacking up its 11th monthly gain in a row, a 2.06% advance, the S&P 500 notched a 4.48% advance for the third quarter. That was its eighth straight quarterly finish in positive territory. It got boosts from such leading stocks and Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Visa (V) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).Last month's growth for U.S. diversified stock mutual funds reversed their August performance, when they lost 0.35%. It was the sixth straight quarterly rise for the group.September's gain by U.S. diversified stock mutual funds was due largely to President Trump unveiling his proposal for corporate tax reform, says Jeremy Javidi, manager of $620 million Columbia Small Cap Value Fund (CSMIX), whose 6.51% return made it one of the top-performing small-cap value portfolios in Q3, according to Morningstar Direct.Corporate tax reform would mean expanded margins for many businesses as federal levies decline. Many investors expected lower rates to apply only to U.S.-generated revenue, although that has not been specifically proposed yet, said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of Charles Schwab Investment Management. Many investors favored small caps, he said, because they tend to derive a larger share of their revenue inside the U.S. than larger companies. If lower rates apply only to U.S.-generated revenue, small caps would benefit proportionately more, Aguilar said, seeing a rise in earnings.See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe List Of Mutual Fund Quarterly LeadersRead A Q&A With Putnam Investments' CEO Robert ReynoldsSee A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceList Of Top Mutual Funds' New Stock BuysBond Funds Give Back Gains As Yields Pick UpReflecting that expectation, small-cap value stock funds outperformed other U.S. diversified categories in September, with a 6.87% gain. Small-cap growth funds led the charge in Q3 overall with a 5.51% return.""To the extent we get certainty about what the tax code would be, that would encourage corporations to start spending money, which would fuel corporate earnings growth in general,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of Charles Schwab Investment Management.Investor optimism fueled by the prospect of corporate tax-reform enabled U.S. diversified stock mutual funds' 3.02% September gain to nearly double the 1.67% gain by world equity mutual funds.In Q3 overall, world equity mutual funds as a group did manage to outperform their U.S. counterparts with a 6.10% rise.European region funds' 3.11% return led world equity categories in September. Latin American funds' 15.30% jump was the leader for Q3 overall.Foreign stocks were fueled by the ongoing global economic recovery, especially in Europe and Japan, combined with a weakening U.S. dollar, which trended lower all year through Sept. 19. ""That set up the market for non-U.S. equities to do well (as a group),"" Aguilar said. Gains in foreign investments translate into more dollars for U.S. investors when the greenback weakens.Among sector categories, global science/technology funds led the way in Q3 with a 10.41% gain. Natural resource funds soared 10.81% in September, tops for the month.Taxable bond funds gained 1.29% on average in Q3 after eking out a 0.02% September return. High-yield bonds' 1.83% return led all taxables in the quarter. Their 0.80% gain was tops in September among major categories. Muni bond funds advanced in Q3 despite slipping in September.Aguilar expects the foreign economic recovery to have more impact than the prospect of corporate tax reform. ""So outperformance should shift back to non-U.S. equities,"" he said. That should prevail for at least three to six months, while the Japanese and European central banks continue easy money policies that support stock prices, Aguilar added.What foreign stocks reflect that type of outlook? Hoya is a Japanese supplier of high-tech and health care products. The stock was a top holding as of June 30 of $6.4 billion Matthews Asia Dividend Investor Fund (MAPIX), which is a diversified Pacific/Asia fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. It edged up 0.26% last month, lifting its year-to-date gain to 24%.Hoya's earnings per share rose 10%, 7% and 41% the past three quarters. Its 17.3% return on equity has climbed for three years in a row.What about the portion of your portfolio that will still hold U.S. stocks?Santa Clara, Calif.-based Coherent (COHR) is owned by Oppenheimer Global Opportunities Fund (OPGIX), which is a world small/midcap stock fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. The fund gained 4.05% last month, topping 88% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Direct.Coherent's EPS growth has accelerated for five straight quarters, growing 11%, 30%, 32%, 160%, 180% and 214% in the past six stanzas. Wall Street consensus is that EPS will rise 158% this year.The company makes lasers, measurement instruments, precision optics and additional photonics-related products used in computer-chip production and inspection. It is a key beneficiary of rising demand for organic light-emitting diode technology displays, or OLED, in smartphones.Coherent is a No. 1-ranked stock in its IBD industry group — Electronic-Scientific/Measuring in this case. It earned that spot by sporting strong traits such as a 99 Composite Rating from IBD. That's the highest possible rating. Scored on a scale of 1 to 99, stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.

Dynavax Technologies (DVAX) skyrocketed 123% in Q3, The firm's hepatitis B vaccine, Heplisav-B, is expected to get a green light from the FDA within weeks, Javidi says. That would likely lead the drug to market in early 2018.The vaccine could attract a licensing deal from a deep-pocketed partner that has more marketing muscle.Javidi also likes Puma Biotechnology (PBYI). Puma's breast cancer drug, neratinib, won regulatory approval in July. ""The drug launched recently and uptake (by patients) has been strong,"" Javidi said.He also likes Northrim Bank (NRIM) in Anchorage, Alaska, and Oklahoma City's BancFirst (BANF). ""Both have some of the lowest costs for deposits in the country,"" Javidi said. ""That's a key in a rising-rate environment. Banks like these, that have good relations with their communities, will keep deposit costs lower than competitors and have stronger margins going forward.""RELATED:Why Mutual Fund Managers Are Betting On Tech, 'Quality' StocksThese Leading Stocks Drove August's Top Inflows To Stock Mutual FundsYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

JPMorgan showed 42 net sellers (89 selling minus 47 buying), while GM had 29 (43 selling, 14 buying).Megacap medical stock Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) came in third, with 24 net sellers (68 selling, 44 buying).Despite the selling, Johnson & Johnson is still within buy range after retaking a 137.18 entry on Oct. 17 after reporting a 13% rise in Q3 earnings.JPMorgan has continued to climb beyond a 95.32 buy point, but after reporting earnings on Oct. 24, General Motors has been giving back a chunk of the 25%-plus gains it made from a breakout in September.

184,UNH,"Major health insurers and hospital groups sold off Friday after the White House confirmed that President Trump will cut off subsidies that make medical bills affordable for low-income beneficiaries.XWhile the timing of his action is uncertain, there is potential for it to unleash chaos in numerous ObamaCare exchange insurance markets and lead to a surge in the uncompensated care provided by hospitals — though there's also a chance such chaos won't materialize.Managed care stocks were broadly lower, though Centene (CNC), which has a leading share of exchange enrollment, closed down 3.2% on the stock market today. after plunging as much as 11%. Anthem and Molina Healthcare, which have both scaled back their exchange participation, lost 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively. Even insurers like UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Aetna (AET), which have fully extricated themselves from the exchange business lost ground, though the closed well off intraday lows. UnitedHealth slipped 0.2%, while Aetna gave up 0.9%.Among hospital groups, Tenet Healthcare (THC) slid 5.1%, Community Health Systems (CYH) 4%. HCA Healthcare (HCA) erased losses to close up 0.5%.While there's potential for serious fallout, it's also possible that Trump's move to stop funding ObamaCare's cost-sharing subsidies, which come on top of premium subsidies for households earning up to 250% of the poverty level, will be much ado about nothing.The 2010 Affordable Care Act health law requires that insurers provide the equivalent of platinum-level coverage to the lowest-income tier of beneficiaries paying for silver-level coverage. The government is supposed to make insurers whole for providing that extra level of coverage that can reduce out-of-pocket medical spending to a maximum of $1,000 or less vs. about $7,000 for silver plans. But even if the government doesn't come through, insurers are still on the hook for providing those extra benefits.To get around this threat, which could drive insurers to leave the exchanges, state regulators are allowing them to lump those extra costs onto silver plan premiums. Since subsidies are tied to the cost of silver plans, everyone who qualifies for subsidies would get a much bigger one under this scenario.The problem is that many states didn't take any precautions for the possibility that Trump would end the cost-sharing subsidies, despite his threat to do so. Because rates have already been set for 2018, insurers might be stuck paying for those extra costs, so some might just stop providing ObamaCare marketplace coverage.IBD'S TAKE: The insurer which has made the biggest bet on ObamaCare is ranked No. 1 in the IBD Medical-Managed Care industry group, based on earnings, sales and profit margin trends, as well as stock performance. Find the leaders in each of 197 industry groups at IBD Stock Checkup. There have been bipartisan discussions in Congress about funding the subsidies, which the Obama administration treated like an entitlement, funding them without an appropriation from Congress. A federal judge ruled last year that President Obama violated the power of the purse that the Constitution entrusts to Congress. While that ruling could be appealed, the Trump White House has no desire to and can legitimately say it's abiding by the law.Because the Congressional Budget Office baseline presumes ongoing funding of the cost-sharing subsidies, Congress could renew funding with no impact on the budget. In fact, CBO found that failure to renew funding would increase the federal deficit by $194 billion and boost the ranks of the insured by 1 million. The reason that deficits would go up is that killing the cost-sharing subsidies would lead to a spike in premiums, which would in turn lead to much higher premium subsidies.The late Thursday announcement that Trump will, at some point, end the cost-sharing subsidies came just hours after he signed an executive order that would expand options to buy low-cost, high-deductible insurance outside of the exchanges.While killing the cost-sharing subsidies might not end up hurting insurers, if Congress steps in to fund them or the move is delayed, insurers and health care investors are right to be nervous.Trump's actions send a signal that the White House is determined to undermine ObamaCare in any way possible, including gutting the individual mandate that's meant to get relatively young and healthy people to sign up for coverage.RELATED:Trump Executive Order Hits ObamaCare InsurersHouse GOP Wins ObamaCare Lawsuit: Key Subsidies Illegal McCain Pulls Plug On GOP Health Bill; Insurers, Hospitals RallyObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular TruthsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

188,UNH,"Six months after President Trump embraced ""our wonderful new Healthcare Bill,"" and a month after it was last left for dead, Republicans are down to just 18 days to repeal and replace ObamaCare.XWhile TrumpCare has reemerged in an undead state before, zombies don't move that fast, and the fiscal 2017 budget resolution allowing the GOP to do an end-run around a Democratic filibuster is set to expire at midnight on Sept. 30.Trump, with his focus turned to tax cuts, appears to lack enthusiasm for one last massive push. Over the weekend, he tweeted: ""Republicans, sorry, but I've been hearing about Repeal & Replace for 7 years, didn't happen!""He added: ""Republicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry!""While the final whistle hasn't blown, it seems pretty clear that two big winners have emerged from the Republicans' defeat: Bernie Sanders and his vision of Medicare for all, and — if stock prices are an accurate gauge — the health insurance industry.IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group is one of the best-performing sectors since Election Day, rising 40% compared with a 17% gain for the S&P 500 index.Centene (CNC), the biggest remaining player on the ObamaCare exchanges and a major participant in the Medicaid expansion, is currently ranked No. 1 in the managed care group by IBD based on stock performance, earnings, revenue, and profit margin trends. Centene announced a $3.75 billion deal to buy Fidelis Care, expanding its reach into New York.The four companies that had their mergers blown apart early in 2017 — Anthem (ANTM), Cigna (CI), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) — all are up in excess of 40%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the biggest of the bunch and a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, is up 38%, vs. 21% for the overall average.On Tuesday, managed care stocks lagged the major indexes, led lower by Anthem, which signaled it may pull out of more ObamaCare exchange markets in 2018. Insurers have until Sept. 27 to finalize their plans.IBD'S TAKE: Most managed care stocks are too extended to chase, meaning they're at least 5% beyond a buy point, the optimal point for acquiring shares to maximize chances for a near-term gain. Here's a good place to start to find stocks that may be setting up for advances. The group of stocks that fit IBD's investing criteria on the IBD Leaderboard have outperformed the S&P 500 by 60% this year.What is interesting is that the gains come even as support for single payer is on the rise and Sanders rails that the health care system is failing because ""it is largely designed not to provide quality care in a cost-effective way, but to make maximum profits for health insurance companies,"" as well as drug and medical equipment companies.Managed care investors aren't yet worried about single payer because it probably can't happen before 2021, may not happen at all because its financing will be controversial, and even if it does, it still doesn't rule out a big role for private insurers. After all, many states have turned their Medicaid programs over to managed care companies, and Medicare Advantage is one of the reasons profits are surging for Humana and others.On Wednesday, Sanders unveiled his Medicare-for-all legislation, and he's no longer a voice in the wilderness. Four potential 2020 contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination have signed on as co-sponsors, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and New York's Kristen Gillibrand. Even relatively conservative West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said Tuesday that single payer is worthy of consideration.The lack of popularity for the Affordable Care Act and the horrific polling for the GOP TrumpCare plans have left an opening for Sanders, whose big unveiling may even overshadow the expected release of new repeal-and-replace legislation from GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky both threw cold water on prospects for the new bill on Monday. Paul, whose state of Kentucky stands to be among the bigger losers under the Graham-Cassidy plan, said that the bill would probably be worse than doing nothing.Even as some Republicans push for one more attempt at killing ObamaCare, others in the GOP are negotiating with Democrats on a plan to shore up the exchanges to avoid a premium spike in 2018.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks Trump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman Sachs Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesObamaCare Fines Nailed The Working Class In 2017 And Other Unpopular Truths

With big-cap techs including Apple (AAPL) (still in a long-term uptrend), Nvidia (NVDA) (benefiting from fresh bullish analyst comments) and Alphabet (GOOGL) (forming a new, better base), the tech-rich composite rallied more than 0.6% in Friday afternoon trading.XThat well surpasses the S&P 500's less than 0.3% advance as of 3 p.m. ET. At 6494, the Nasdaq composite held a 1% gain for the week, vs. a 0.6% advance by the 500.The Dow Jones industrial average, weighed down in part by losses in UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and McDonald's (MCD), was still virtually flat. At 22,379, the 30-component Dow industrials still held on to a thin 0.1% weekly gain. The Dow transports looked headed for an eighth straight gain, rising 0.2%.Volume is running lower vs. the same time Thursday on both main exchanges. Winners are beating losers on both exchanges by more than a 3-to-2 ratio. That's bullish for equities.Earlier this week, McDonald's triggered a sell signal for those who bought at the stock's early-April breakout at 130.10 because the stock fell sharply below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume. Watch to see if the biggest restaurant chain by stores and revenue can regain that medium-term support level and set up in a new base.Back to Apple, the juggernaut in smartphones, personal computers, tablets and digital services has shown disappointing volume in its rebound after getting knocked by sellers hard following its debut of its next-generation phones. You'd prefer to see the stock rise in heavy volume, not in thin trading as seen Wednesday.While Apple rose 0.7% that session, volume was 14% below average. Contrast that with Apple's sell-offs on Sept. 20, 21 and 22, in which shares traded hands at paces of 88%, 32% and 62% above the 50-day average, respectively.With the pullback in Apple extending into Week 5 on Monday, chances are growing that Apple could set up a new base next to its second-stage flat base that featured a 156.75 buy point. The first base finished up in early January, and Apple broke out of a beautiful cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9.A new base forming would still keep the base count at two. Stocks tend to succeed in breakouts from first-, second- or third-stage bases vs. fourth-, fifth- or even sixth-stage ones.Google operator Alphabet is working on a new cup-shaped base after its attempt to clear a 994.09 entry in a flawed double-bottom base lasted just days.Notice how Alphabet's double bottom was formed in less than seven weeks before the breakout, a flaw. However, its latest chart action is more sound. The new base is more rounded, and the stock has held above the lows of the prior flawed double bottom.Despite getting tagged by the EU with a stiff fine for alleged monopolistic behavior related to its online shopping pages, Alphabet is likely to continue its streak of respectable double-digit growth. Earnings in Q3 are seen rising 15% to $8.32 a share on a 21% jump in revenue to $27.16 billion.In each of the past five quarters, Alphabet's top line grew 20% to 22% vs. year-ago levels.Nvidia, back above a second-stage flat-base entry of 174.66, is helping keep chip-related shares on top of the market heap in terms of five-day performance.The chipmaker for hot growth markets — including data centers, video games, self-driving vehicles, artificial intelligence and deep learning — is still on track to post significant profit and sales gains despite already delivering mind-blowing increases over the past year and a half.In March 2016, Nvidia broke out of an early-stage cup with handle at 33.16, ahead of adjusted EPS increases of 46% (in Q1 of fiscal 2017, which ended in April 2016), 720%, 89%, 183%, 126% and 124%. In the October-ending fiscal third quarter, analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to rise 13% to 94 cents a share and revenue to go up 18% to $2.36 billion.Cypress Semiconductor (CY), part of IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group, gained 1.7% and moved past a nearly nine-week cup-with-handle buy point of 14.89. However, volume is running around 9% below normal pace. You'd like to see volume surge a minimum 40% to 50% above the 50-day average, and much more for small and midcap stocks.However, in a few cases, a leading stock can show a big pickup in turnover several days, or even weeks, after breakout day.Cypress, which specializes in touch-screen microcontrollers and system-on-a-chip circuits, has marked earnings acceleration in three of the past four quarters. Earnings dropped 12% to 15 cents a share in the third quarter of 2016, then jumped 15%, 86% and 75% in the past three quarters.Revenue rose 13%, 18%, 27% and 32% over the same time frame.Cypress' IBD ratings are not as good as many of its peers in the chip sector, partly because it is a turnaround play. However, a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is positive.The profit forecasts for Cypress, based in San Jose, Calif., look sunny. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 63% to 80 cents a share this year and another 41% to $1.13 in 2018. That would send Cypress' bottom line to its highest level since it earned $1.25 a share in 2011.Applied Materials (AMAT), is No. 9 in the IBD 50. The chip-equipment giant stormed higher for a third straight session, rising more than 2% to 52.01 in huge volume and is now extended from a 47.69 early entry in a cup-type consolidation. It announced a big share buyback plan earlier in the week.Wait to see if the stock pulls back within the 5% buy zone, or up to 50.07.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Can These 5 Chip Stocks Catch Nvidia?Hot Dividend Stocks: Can This Leading Utility Stock Rise Another 10%?Smart Growth Investing: Do You Know How To Count Bases In A Leading Stock?Keys To Short Selling With Success, The IBD Way: Read Articles Here

191,UNH,"The freight train that is the stock market kept on chugging ahead in October, with the S&P 500 tacking on a 2.33% gain to make it 12 straight months of growth, according to Lipper Inc. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds jumped on board, advancing 1.70% on average, the 14th monthly gain in the past 15 months.XThe broad market got a lift from such leading stocks and Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Caterpillar (CAT), Apple (AAPL), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), 3M (MMM) and Intel (INTC).The October gain by U.S. diversified stock funds was due largely to ongoing global economic growth, increased odds of corporate tax reform with a possible lowering of the corporate tax rate, and increased likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising its short-term interest rate in the near term, said Jonathan Edwards, a manager of Invesco Value Opportunities Fund (VVOAX). The $839 million fund's 1.64% gain in October topped 69% of its large-cap value rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct.In addition, for the most part corporate earnings have been OK, said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. He added that a few individual companies logged disappointments, which helped mute investor sentiment. Sentiment was further dampened by infighting among Republican leadership. That reminded investors that corporate tax reform is not a sure thing, Samana said.With a 3.41% October gain, large-cap growth funds outpaced other U.S. diversified stock fund categories last month. Multi-cap growth funds averaged a 3.08% gain.Douglas Roman, manager of $92 million PNC Multi-Factor Large Cap Growth Fund (PEWAX), attributed outperformance by large-cap stock funds to strong economies in the U.S. and abroad. Large-cap companies are more likely to sell goods and services abroad as well as in the U.S. The PNC fund's 3.98% October gain outpaced 78% of its large-cap growth competitors.U.S. multinationals in particular got a tailwind from the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar vs. the euro, especially later in October, which helped U.S. exports, Roman said.Reflecting widespread global economic growth, world equity mutual funds rose 1.83% last month, topping the showing by U.S. diversified stock funds.India region funds led the way for foreign stock funds, jumping 5.89% last month.Global science and technology funds led the major sectors, rising 5.49% last month.General domestic taxable bond funds gained 0.29% on average in October. Loan participation funds' 0.56% return led all taxables in the month. Muni bond funds were about flat in October.The stock market got an additional lift from the hunt for a new chairperson of the Federal Reserve — who in November turned out to be current Fed Governor Jerome Powell. In October, investors appeared to welcome the prospect that the apparent leading contenders would keep the central bank on its current path of raising rates, said Charles Shriver, manager of T. Rowe Price's $2.3 billion Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) and $295 million Global Allocation (RPGAX) funds. Balanced beat 87% of its allocation peer group in October. Global Allocation topped 62% of its direct rivals.Going forward, T. Rowe Price's Shriver likes foreign stocks in general more than U.S. equities. ""Fundamentals are positive, but valuations give us a little pause. We are underweight in areas whose valuations are a little more rich,"" he said.Among foreign stocks, ""Japan is an area where we see the cheapest valuations among developed markets.""IBD'S TAKE: Tokyo-based bank holding company Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group was a top holding as of June 30 of $6.7 billion Matthews Asia Dividend Investor Fund (MAPIX), which is a diversified Pacific/Asia fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. The stock edged up 4.4% last month. Earnings per share rose 20%, 44% and 55% the past three months after having declined for five stanzas in a row.On the other hand, lower U.S. corporate tax rates would benefit U.S. stocks, said Invesco's Edwards. ""That favors economically sensitive stocks as well as financials,"" he said.Holdings he likes for those reasons include LPL Financial (LPLA). ""They are one of the largest independent financial advisory firms,"" Edwards said. ""One hundred percent of their profits are from the U.S., so they would benefit from a lower corporate tax rate. And a significant part of their earnings are from interest on customers' cash balances. As interest rates go up, they would earn more on those balances.""He also cites SVB Financial Group (SIVB). ""They're a regional bank (mostly) in California, focused on the technology sector,"" he said. ""A lot of their loans are floating rate. As (the Fed raises) short-term rates, it would increase their net interest margin."" And the large portion of their profit that is based on U.S. revenue would benefit from a lower corporate tax rate.PNC's Roman is overweight in industrials, financials and consumer discretionary. He likes industrials because of the prospects for aerospace and defense firms. Financials should benefit from rate hikes. And he likes the diversity of consumer discretionary. ""From homebuilders to dollar stores, there's always some opportunities,"" he said.As of Sept. 30, among his top holdings were aerospace giant Boeing (BA) and defense contractors Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD).He likes auto parts, travel and home furnishings. Auto-parts maker Delphi Automotive (DLPH) was another holding. Smaller holdings included Wyndham Worldwide (WYN).RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Income At Your Age And Income

193,UNH,"Stocks slumped in late-afternoon trading Monday, but the declines among the major indexes remain mild. Apple (AAPL) bucked the drop with a 2.2% lift to 166.72 and new all-time highs.XApple has now gained 41% after a Jan. 6-9 breakout from a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12.The iPhone giant, which reportedly is seeing brisk orders for its most expensive iPhone ever (the X), is also following through on Friday's breakout from a brand-new cup with handle that shows a 160.97 proper entry.General Electric (GE), meanwhile, led the Dow Jones industrial average to a 0.3% decline as the firm that goes back to the days of Thomas Edison lopped off another 38 cents, or 1.8%, to 20.41. That marked GE's sixth straight loss.The S&P 500 also slipped 0.3% despite strength across the oil patch. WTI near-term futures edged 0.4% higher to $54.13 a barrel on the Nymex. The Nasdaq composite was down slightly.Institutions were selling GE shares hard. The stock's volume finished at 95.8 million shares, 64% heavier than usual. The megacap firm's average daily turnover over the past 50 sessions is 58.2 million shares.GE slid nearly 13% in monster weekly volume last week.The Dow Jones industrial average is a price-weighted index of 30 names, and the keepers of the average replace lagging companies with higher-priced better performers. Recent new entrants include not just Apple but also Goldman Sachs (GS) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). All three trade at more than 100 a share.Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Pfizer (PFE) have the next-lowest share prices within the Dow 30, trading near 34 and 35.08, respectively.Cisco, a giant in computer networking and internet-based telecom gear, is challenging institutional buying support near a 34.20 buy point in a new cup with handle. The stock fell more than 1% to 34 in dull turnover.Apple replaced dividend-rich AT&T (T) in March 2015, when the latter traded near 33 a share. AT&T, which has been featured in IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, has made virtually no progress since then.GE had recently peaked at 33 in the summer of 2016 and now stands nearly 39% below that high. The stock's all-time peak is 60.50 back in August 2000.GE's Relative Price Strength Rating is a horrifying 7 on a scale of 1 to 99, as noted in IBD Stock Checkup. Certainly, pressure is mounting on GE's new management team, led by John Flannery, to reinvigorate growth. Flannery has served in many top posts at GE, including head of GE Capital and the India operations.The company's adjusted third-quarter earnings fell 4% to 26 cents a share, sharply missing Wall Street's view, according to data from William O'Neil + Co.Q3 revenue increased 14% to $33.47 billion, snapping a three-quarter slump. But GE has not seen a double-digit annual gain on the top line for more than nine years. The best result was a 6% rise in revenue to $182.5 billion back in 2008.Helping the Nasdaq's cause was Broadcom (AVGO), rising 8.33, or more than 3% to 261.23 in strong turnover. The chip designer for auto, telecom, data center and other markets has cleared a 259.46 buy point in a new nine-week flat base.The proper buy zone goes up 5% past that 259.46 buy point, or 272.43.Broadcom appears in IBD's real-time Stocks On The Move table, a great source for watchlist ideas and potential new breakouts. The table shows stocks moving sharply up or down in heavy volume, based on a real-time analysis of price-and-volume data, and can be seen on the home page.Back to Apple, earnings had dropped 10% in the fiscal year ended in September 2016, on an 8% slump in revenue. However, Apple has been staging a classic turnaround in fundamentals lately.In the past three quarters, the iMac maker's earnings rose 2%, 11% and 18% vs. year-ago levels, following a three-quarter slump. And in Q4 (ended in September), earnings are seen increasing 12% to $1.87 a share, which would mark a third quarter in a row of mild double-digit gains. It's slated to report Q4 results on Nov. 2 after the market close.For fiscal year 2019, the Street sees earnings accelerating 24% to $11.16 a share.Another positive for Apple shareholders: a respectable annualized dividend yield of 1.5%, with plenty of potential for  further increases in that cash payout. Apple tends to raise its dividend in the spring. But William O'Neil + Co. calculates that the company has a long-term annual dividend growth rate of 24% in recent years.IBD'S TAKE: The current yield of the S&P 500 is 1.87%. Track the yield and other vital market indicators by going to the special General Market Indicators page, available as a PDF link at Market Trend on Investors.com. The yield is posted on the top bar of the large daily chart of the S&P 500.Apple's SmartSelect Ratings have improved steadily throughout the year.On Jan. 1, the Composite Rating was dismal at 51 on a scale of 1 to 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The RS Rating, which compares a stock's 12-month price performance with all other companies in IBD's database, was equally dim at 59.But today, those two scores are now at 74 and 83, respectively. Expect the Composite Rating to be somewhat weaker when a stock such as Apple is undergoing a major turnaround in both fundamentals and in stock-price action.Elsewhere among the Dow Jones 30 components, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is making what appears to be a normal-looking pullback after breaking out of a flat base at 137.18 on Oct. 17. The diversified medical and personal-care products titan has so far rallied as much as 5.2% from that proper entry, getting briefly extended from the correct buy point.J&J has posted single- to mild double-digit EPS gains for eight quarters in a row. The Street sees Q4 earnings rising 9% to $1.72 a share.The market reacted a tad negatively on reports that Congress is considering a phase-in pace toward lower corporate taxes. It's not the first time such a plan has been reported in the media. In any case, the market appears to be unwilling so far to give up much of its strong gains over the past five weeks.One big reason: U.S. GDP rose 3% in Q3 on an annualized basis, despite the enormous damage caused by hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. That follows a 3.1% gain in Q2.While the Q3 GDP figure is bound to change in future data revisions, Eric Winograd, senior U.S. economist at AllianceBernstein, notes that investors should focus on the recent monthly data that point to an ""economy balanced among sectors.""""Each of personal consumption, private investment and net exports made a positive contribution to the headline rise, with the increase in private investment particularly noteworthy; it rose 4.2% year over year, the highest in two years,"" Winograd told IBD. ""We may not yet be back to pre-crisis levels of investment, but the news on that front is good.""Winograd also says consumption data point to an accelerating expansion in the U.S. economy.""I think of final sales to domestic purchasers, one of the subcategories of GDP, as essentially a 'core' measure — the single figure that best captures the underlying dynamics of the economy. With the (household) paycheck growing at about 4% YOY, the 4.1% YOY gain in final sales makes perfect sense,"" he added.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Apple In Buy Range; 2 New IPOs To WatchHow To Find Top Growth Stocks: Why The Cup With Handle Is A Money MakerWhen To Buy A Stock: Master This Key Growth Stock Chart PatternHow To Invest: Finding Great Stocks Inside IBD 50Top Stocks Today: Can This Chipmaker Rise Sharply Again On A New Breakout?Technology News: Nvidia Gets Another Price Target Hike

198,UNH,"The Dow industrials rallied strongly thanks to an IBM (IBM) turnaround, a Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) breakout and several other blue-chip earnings, though General Electric (GE) was a big miss. Adobe Systems (ADBE) also was a big winner on its bullish outlook. Netflix (NFLX) hit a new high on booming subscriber growth. And IPOs are hot.The Dow industrials rose 2% this week, fueled by IBM predicting a return to revenue growth. But Johnson & Johnson and UnitedHealth (UNH) were also notable blue-chip contributors, while General Electric crashed on its big EPS miss, but had little impact on the price-weighted Dow. The S&P 500 rose 0.9% and the Nasdaq 0.35%, helped by the Senate's first step toward big tax cuts. Adobe Systems soared on its outlook, PayPal (PYPL) beat, but Netflix pulled back from record highs despite high subscriber gains, while United Airlines (UAL) crashed as the carrier had few answers for questions about 2018. A few new IPOs impressed.Internet television network Netflix cheered investors with third-quarter subscriber additions that trounced expectations, though earnings growth missed views. It signed up 5.3 million net new streaming subscribers in the third quarter, beating Wall Street's target of 4.5 million.

205,UNH,"The major market indexes were all lower early Wednesday, but losses were light. The tech-heavy Nasdaq declined just 0.1%, while the other major indexes held even milder losses. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were slightly below their break-even marks.X Among the Dow industrials, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) set the pace, rising 1.3% after the potential death of ObamaCare repeal. The managed-care provider notched a fresh record high, and is well-extended from its most recent flat base with a 172.24 buy point.On the downside, Apple (AAPL) fell over 1% following Tuesday's unveiling of its new iPhone X. Shares are still holding above a 156.75 flat-base entry, but progress has been stymied in recent trading sessions.Meanwhile, Boeing (BA) dropped 1.3%.

Shares rose 0.5% to trade right at the key level, which is currently priced around 987. Amazon will have to reclaim that level before it can build the right side of a potential base.Among other analyst actions, Applied Materials (AMAT) was upgraded to buy from neutral at Goldman Sachs. Shares moved up almost 1% as they continue to approach the 47.69 cup-with-handle buy point.Meanwhile, Micron Technology (MU) was also a beneficiary of a Goldman upgrade to buy.

206,UNH,"After a long absence, Apple (AAPL) made IBD's latest monthly list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, as it gets ready to unveil its latest iPhone, with one analyst saying the launch may be delayed due to production issues.X The tech giant was joined by a slew of medical sector stocks, including managed care providers UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), as well as leading biotech companies Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN).Defense contractors Boeing (BA), Raytheon (RTN) and Heico (HEI) also made the list, as tensions with North Korea and anticipated defense spending increases are expected to drive demand.Over the last three months, top fund managers invested over $1 billion each in four stocks on the list: UnitedHealth (99 funds, $1.39 billion invested), Apple (85, $1.36 billion), Electronic Arts (EA) (76, $1.25 billion) and Celgene (96, $1.07 billion).The heavy institutional buying has helped push Apple, Electronic Arts and Celgene into new buy zones, and has already lifted UnitedHealth beyond buy range.Seeing that stocks on your watch list are being bought by mutual fund managers with a proven track record of success is a positive sign, since it means they've done their due diligence and like what they see.But it doesn't mean the stocks are necessarily in or near a proper buy zone right now. More time may be needed for them to set up a proper buying opportunity.In addition to Apple and Celgene, stocks on this month's list that are forming a base or within buy ranges also include Boeing, medical software firm Cerner (CERN), and casino operator MGM Resorts (MGM).Apple has the distinction of making the new buys screen and also topping the list of new sells this month. The net number of funds selling Apple (151 selling minus 85 buying) was 66.Mastercard (MA) had the second-most net sellers (48), followed by NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) (45) and biotech giant Amgen (AMGN) (30).Despite the number of sellers, each of those stocks continues to show strength, and Amgen is testing a new potential buy zone. On Monday, Amgen jumped past a 182.70 entry in heavy volume. The buy range extends to 191.84.RELATED: Why Mutual Fund Managers Are Betting On Tech, 'Quality' StocksFind And Track The Best Mutual Funds

207,UNH,"The end-of-summer blahs and elevated geopolitical uncertainty took their toll on the stock market and stock mutual funds in August, which notched their first losses of the year.XAfter having fallen nearly 2% around mid-August, the broad stock market in the form of the S&P 500 rallied to close the month with a 0.31% gain. It was lifted by such leading stocks and Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Visa (V) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as well as technology leader Grubhub (GRUB).Lagging, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds lost 0.35% on average. Large-cap growth funds did best, tacking on 1.47%, while small-cap value funds did worst, losing 2.44%. ""Overall, investors generally treaded water in August,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial (AMP). ""The good news pretty much offset the bad news. The market did not turn decisively either way.""The broad benchmark's modest gain extended the market's winning streak to 10 months. The S&P 500 edged up to an 11.93% gain year to date. U.S. diversified stock funds were left with a 9.05% year-to-date return.Mutual fund managers who spoke with IBD expect many of their opportunities for new gains to come from technology innovators and from ""quality"" companies — firms capable of churning out earnings growth even in a slow economic growth environment.Factors that heartened investors last month included a weak dollar, which boosted U.S. exports, said manager Daniel Strickberger, whose $211 million Touchstone Large Company Growth Fund (TSAGX) topped 95% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct in August. In addition, manufacturing showed strength, based on the monthly Institute of Supply Management report. Overall U.S. employment posted gains, though less than in July.""Retail sales and consumer sentiment were pretty good,"" Joy said.But negative factors included soft inflation numbers, which is a sign of tepid overall economic growth. The defeat of health care reform signaled that tax reform and infrastructure spending are uncertain, Joy said.And geopolitical tension involving North Korea contributed to investors' skittishness, Strickberger said.In addition, low inflation could help persuade the Federal Reserve to slow its interest-rate hikes. ""Interest rates are heading to where they were six to nine months ago,"" said Stephen DuFour, manager of $1.7 billion Fidelity Focused Stock Fund (FTQGX), which topped 97% of its large-cap growth rivals last month. ""Over the long run, falling rates usually help utilities and hurt financials.""In contrast to U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, world stock mutual funds eked out a 0.84% gain in August. Latin American funds led that charge, rising 4.35%.Many investors sought safe havens last month. Taxable bond funds in general advanced an average of 0.51%. They were led by U.S. Treasury bond mutual funds, which gained 1.93%. Muni funds also advanced on average. And precious metals stock mutual funds topped sector fund categories, racking up a 6.10% advance.Despite August's market blahs, Ameriprise's Joy is guardedly optimistic going forward. U.S. economic growth remains muted but positive, he said. Global growth, at least in developed markets, is at its strongest since the recession. Many foreign central banks are continuing monetary policies that support stocks. And he expects large U.S. businesses to continue to benefit from a weak dollar through at least year-end.Model portfolios that Ameriprise recommends to its financial advisors' clients remain overweight in the technology sector, which in general still has room to run, Joy said. Those model portfolios' weightings in emerging markets stocks have also been boosted but are still underweight.China remains strong. Latin American economies are healing, he said.Fidelity's DuFour also sees attractive trends in the tech sector. Digital advertising, electronic payments and the growth of exchange traded funds (ETFs) ""are areas to get excited about,"" he said. He cited holdings as of July 31.A digital advertising name in which he had a stake was Adobe Systems (ADBE). Its business model has morphed. It used to sell its programs via computer disks through brick-and-mortar retailers. Customers would have to upgrade by buying new disks every few years.""They've evolved into software-as-a-service, where you pay on a monthly basis, and you've always got access to the latest version of a program,"" DuFour said.Once you create your digital product, Adobe also can monitor the online traffic it attracts and help clients manage online advertising campaigns. In addition, they have a commercial image library. That multiservice approach positions Adobe to benefit from the growth of digital media and online advertising, DuFour said.""PayPal (PYPL) is growing with the growth of electronic payments around the world,"" DuFour said. ""They have done a good job of increasing the number of places that accept PayPal, and they have a higher percentage of online transactions than physical store ones. As online commerce grows at the expense of physical stores, they are net gainers.""PayPal also owns Venmo, which is a payments service that lets users divvy up payments for shared goods or services. It is popular among millennials.S&P Global (SPGI) is poised to benefit from the growth of ETFs. The company has exited education books and ownership of Businessweek to focus on three areas in which the company provides data to clients. One of those areas consists of the indexes that customers like State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) license for the ETFs that they build and operate. ""S&P Global's business is very exciting and has very substantial margins,"" DuFour said.In other sectors, Touchstone's Strickberg cites Zoetis (ZTS) as ""the sort of quality, predictable growth company we like. We want companies that will prosper whether U.S. GDP growth is 0% or 3%,"" he said.Roughly half of sales by the developer of animal medicines and vaccines are for livestock rather than pets. Commercial agricultural sales don't fluctuate much in economic ups and downs. That steadiness makes it ""the kind of business we look for,"" Strickberger said.The $9.8 billion Vanguard Primecap Core (VPCCX), a large-cap growth fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner, edged up 0.36% last month. It owns ASML Holding (ASML), a Dutch maker of lithography systems used to create computer chips. Shares have climbed 39% this year.The stock has a very strong 98 Composite Rating from IBD and an A SMR Rating. Scored on a scale of 1 to 99, stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.IBD'S TAKE: ASML's A SMR Rating means the semiconductor equipment maker is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula. Buying stocks with high SMR ratings at proper buy points increases your chances of investment success.  RELATED:Here's An Easy Routine To Get You Started In Stock InvestingWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?Some Investors Turns More Defensive Even As Market Rises Again

The net number of funds selling Visa (99 selling minus 56 buying) was 43, while the number for MasterCard was 39.Despite that selling, both stocks have continued in an upward trend.E-commerce and cloud computing services behemoth Amazon (AMZN) was also on the sell list, with 26 more funds selling than buying.Since reporting a 78% decline in earnings growth for Q2 on July 27, Amazon has been pulling back and is trying to find support at its 10-week line.RELATED:Top Fund Managers Are Buying These 4 Highly Rated StocksTop Fund's Picks Include Stocks Within Buy Ranges Like Global Payments

219,UNH,"Senate Republicans voted on Tuesday to open 20 hours of debate on repealing and replacing ObamaCare. In reality, they're not likely to do either, but they still might manage to kill off ObamaCare's individual and employer mandates.A 50-50 vote, with two Republicans opposed and Vice President Mike Pence on hand to break a tie, provided just enough to clear the bar. Yet with divisions between conservatives and moderates over how to restructure Medicaid and subsidies for buying health insurance on the individual market, it remains unlikely that Republicans will unite over either repeal or replace.But as a last-ditch strategy, the GOP may take aim at ObamaCare's two most unpopular provisions: the requirement that employers offer coverage to workers clocking at least 30 hours a week and the choice for individuals of buying coverage or paying a fine.Still, there's no certainty that even a so-called ""skinny"" plan will pass, because some moderates may fear the damage that repeal will inflict on the individual markets. Repeal of the individual mandate would increase premiums as more young and healthy opt out. Unless other fixes are offered, such as reinsurance and a legislative commitment to cost-sharing subsidies, moderates might balk. If such changes are offered, it could lose conservatives. However, the quick debate period means that there may not be time for thorough analysis.IBD'S TAKE: Big insurers like UnitedHealth and Aetna have mostly exited the ObamaCare exchanges due to losses, but one leading ObamaCare insurer has earned the No. 1 rank in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, based on earnings, revenue, margins and stock performance. Check out the top tier at IBD Stock Checkup.Major stock indexes pushed to record highs ahead of the vote to open debate. Investors may be encouraged that the GOP determination to get something passed, even if it's really skinny, will be brought to bear for corporate tax cuts by early 2018.The news came as leading ObamaCare insurer Centene (CNC) said its exchange business is performing strongly. Shares vaulted after the open but weakened throughout the session as the GOP vote neared and continued slipping. Centene closed down 1.6%.Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the nation's largest insurer, was off 0.3%. Hospital stocks including HCA Holdings (HCA) fell, but that appeared largely a reaction to HCA's earnings, which show that more care continues to move to outpatient settings. HCA sank 4.5%.RELATED:This Is How You Fix ObamaCare: Republican Principles, Democratic ValuesSenate Delays TrumpCare Vote, Pressuring Stock MarketTrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse DealUnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term Cuts

220,UNH,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings before Tuesday's market open. Revenue was about in line with analyst forecasts. The health insurer giant also raised full-year guidance. Shares rose a fraction. XEstimates: Earnings per share should rise 21% to $2.38 a share, with revenue climbing 8% to $50.082 billion. That would represent the second quarter of decelerating earnings growth and the smallest revenue gain in 10 quarters.Results: Earnings per share of $2.46 a share, up 25.5% vs. a year earlier. Revenue rose 8% to $50.053 billion. UnitedHealth's Optum services unit saw a 9.9% revenue rise.Outlook: UnitedHealth now sees adjusted full-year profit $9.75-$9.90 a share. Analysts had expected $9.81 before Q2's results.Stock: UnitedHealth rose 0.3% to 186.96 on the stock market today, hitting a new record high. The Dow Jones industrial average component has been consolidating since peaking at 188.66 on June 22, closing Monday at 186.35.Why It Matters: UnitedHealth is the first of the major health insurers to report second-quarter earnings, with Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM), Cigna (CI), Humana (HUM) and others due in the coming weeks. (The U.S. government blocked proposed mergers of Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana earlier this year on antitrust grounds.)UnitedHealth has exited the ObamaCare exchanges, with most of the other big insurers also on their way out aside from Medicaid specialists such as Centene (CNC). But it's still a huge player in Medicare and Medicaid.So Senate Republicans's late Monday decision to pull their health care bill could have a significant impact on UnitedHealth and other insurers.RELATED:Dow's Visa, American Express Are In Buy Zones Ahead Of EarningsThese 2 Drug Giants In Buy Range Just Beat Earnings ViewsDow's UnitedHealth Rises On Blowout Q1 EarningsBank Of America, Goldman Sachs Earnings Top, But Trading Weak

223,UNH,"After years of subjecting ObamaCare to the harshest criticism, the Senate GOP's struggles to come up with a replacement over the past several weeks have been a revelation: A critical mass of Republican senators seem to be saying that wresting the health care security provided by the law from their constituents is a nonstarter.That leaves Congress with two possible paths forward. The most likely path is a form of triage that would try to control the bleeding, rather than address ObamaCare's underlying problems that explain why enrollment was weak even before premiums spiked, and why the law was unpopular before ""mean"" TrumpCare came on the scene.Stabilizing insurance markets, principally by providing protection for insurers against high-claims customers, is a good idea and an important step. But let's be clear about what that won't achieve: It won't create a robust nongroup insurance market with rules that Americans can broadly support, and that work reasonably well for the finances of healthy and sick, old and young, working class and middle class.To create a robust nongroup insurance market with lower premiums that serves people well will require taking the other potential path forward: transforming the Affordable Care Act, largely by injecting the ingredient that Republicans say the law is most sorely lacking — freedom.While ObamaCare has helped the near-poor and those with chronic conditions who otherwise might be stuck without affordable coverage, it gives a bad deal to pretty much everyone else, which is why the exchanges' pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly, and premiums have soared as insurers like UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have mostly exited the markets.Simply stabilizing the turbulent insurance-exchange markets wouldn't do anything to ameliorate ObamaCare's harshest reality: Even among working-class households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, supposedly among the law's biggest beneficiaries, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting coverage that will protect them from financial disaster. Most of the other two-thirds are uninsured, either because they or a spouse work full time and don't qualify for exchange subsidies, or else they've spurned subsidized bronze plans that carry $6,000-$7,000 deductibles — despite the threat of a individual-mandate penalty.While Americans aren't crying out for the freedom to buy the skimpiest coverage that insurers can dream up, and pretty much everybody would rather have insurance than not — if the price is right — many people would benefit from greater flexibility than the ACA allows, and the entire country would benefit from a bipartisan consensus on health reform that helps those who have fallen through ObamaCare's wide cracks.That is why the very best step for public policy, within the realm of what might be possible, would be to give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have — and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need — and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for high-deductible coverage and set aside funds to cover basic medical needs.This would involve turning ObamaCare's cost-sharing support into something more akin to working-class tax cuts and removing ObamaCare's heaviest-handed mandates, while preserving the ACA's critical protections and support.A central problem with ObamaCare is that the rules stacked the deck in favor of those needing comprehensive coverage, leaving far too many in the working class with three unappealing options: a silver plan that costs too much; a bronze plan that won't pay their medical bills until long after they're in financial distress; or an individual-mandate penalty for opting against coverage that may be of little use.Think of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis with income of $40,000 (about 200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare offers pretty solid coverage but costs $2,430 — likely too much for a young family that's probably already struggling to save anything. The cheapest bronze plan, costing $1,068, might be doable, but the $13,300 deductible ($6,650 per person) could make a hospital stay financially devastating.The chasm between ObamaCare's silver and bronze deductibles — $700 vs. $13,300 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. ObamaCare provides extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink deductibles for modest-income households, but only if they buy silver plans. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers each month, even if the policyholder gets no medical care.Looking through the lens of these 30-year-olds in St. Louis, a bipartisan replacement, merging Republican principles and Democratic values, is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a low-deductible plan with a wide range of essential benefits.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option. A replacement for ObamaCare could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings for health expenses with two simple tweaks. Relax ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young, but only for high-deductible plans, keeping comprehensive plans affordable for older adults. (That could mean silver plans with a 3:1 age rating, bronze 4:1 and catastrophic 5:1.)Next, let people use cost-sharing subsidies to reduce premiums, if they prefer, effectively making it a tax cut. Those two steps would shrink that St. Louis couple's bronze premium to zero, and they'd have about $900 left to put in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses — not nirvana, but a dramatic improvement over what ObamaCare offers. Yes, this family would still be subject to very high deductibles, but no greater than under ObamaCare, and they'd have a $2,000 head start on their medical bills, giving them a chance to put aside some savings — not because their tax credits are more generous than under ObamaCare but because they would be more usable.From 100% to 150% of the poverty level (about $12,000-$18,000 for a single), roughly 90% of exchange enrollees sign up for silver coverage. Bronze-level deductibles would be almost too extreme to bother — if not for the mandate penalty — though some percentage don't bother and remain uninsured. So here's a beautiful compromise that would inject some freedom and flexibility — but not too much — into the ACA.ACA cost-sharing subsidies, which are even higher for this income tier, turn silver plans to ultra-low-deductible platinum plans. That option would still be available, but they also could opt to use their cost-sharing subsidy to cover a basic silver-plan premium and deposit the extra amount in a Health Savings Account. What's beautiful about this is that the bar on minimum coverage would rise compared to the ACA, yet people would still have more freedom to pick a plan that works for their finances and their health status.IBD'S TAKE: IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" on Tuesday, June 27, a signal to investors to exercise extra caution in buying stocks and to take some money off the table to deploy when the turbulence subsides. Make sure to read IBD's The Big Picture each day to get the latest on whether the flashing-yellow market trend turns green.We also should do something about the steep drop-off in cost-sharing subsidies that acts as a disincentive to earn above 200% of the poverty level and is an especially big deal for people with significant medical needs. A more gradual phase-out by 300% of the poverty level would provide more constructive incentives, while delivering modest tax cuts to income-tax-paying households. Premiums could essentially be free for everyone up to 250% of the poverty level — if a catastrophic-plan option is made available to people above 200% of the poverty level and they opt to apply their cost-sharing subsidy to the premium for the lowest-cost plan, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democrats.This is another compromise in which both sides win. Above 200% of the poverty level, ObamaCare's cracks widen in a serious way. The percentage of the uninsured under ObamaCare takes a big jump, and so does take-up of bronze coverage. Easing the cost-sharing subsidy cliff won't only make it more attractive for people to get coverage, albeit higher-deductible coverage, but it will allow people who need comprehensive coverage to get a better policy than they do under ObamaCare, since the bigger cost-sharing subsidy will effectively turn a silver plan to gold.Meanwhile, freedom to choose a catastrophic plan with a 5:1 age-rating should satisfy the GOP that the reformed insurance markets will provide sufficient flexibility to meet the needs of all comers. Democrats should acknowledge that it's far better to let a young adult member of the working class get a higher-deductible plan for free than pay a penalty for going uninsured, and the broader, healthier risk pool will serve to hold down premiums for everyone.As for the individual mandate, among the biggest issues of contention, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get high-deductible coverage essentially for free — and in most cases get extra cash on top — there should be no need to threaten them with fines.Above 250% of the poverty level, an alternative to the individual mandate is well worth considering. Among the reasons that the ObamaCare individual mandate doesn't work very well is that relatively young and healthy people who gamble on going without coverage can reasonably expect to win their bet and end up with a financial gain. ObamaCare encourages this kind of short-term calculation, since only those who get sick pay a price.A more logical approach would eliminate the incentive to go without coverage when one is young and healthy, then sign up when one's health starts deteriorating. Much like Medicare's late-enrollment penalties, the idea would be to very gradually shrink future tax subsidies based on how long people go without coverage. This should apply to both the individual market and employer market, or else people would have reason not to get coverage between jobs that offer insurance. The key for this to work in the constructive way intended is that subsidies must be sufficient to make coverage affordable, or else people would opt out for legitimate financial reasons and their future cost of coverage would gradually become even less affordable.Even without this more constructive incentive, it's important to give members of the middle class a better deal than they get now. Those who earn too much to receive ObamaCare subsidies — including young adults earning well below the official cut-off at 400% of the poverty level — should be treated more equitably relative to their peers covered through the workplace.A fiscally responsible solution would be to put a floor on tax credits for anyone buying coverage on the individual market equal to 25% of the cost of a silver plan, while limiting the income-tax benefit to 25% of the cost of employer-provided coverage and capping that benefit for high-income households. People in the 25% tax bracket (up to $91,151 for singles and $151,900 for married couples) who get coverage from an employer wouldn't be touched by the tax change, while there would be minimal effect on those in the 28% bracket (up to $190,150 for singles and $231,450 for couples).The sad reality today is that ObamaCare throws millions of modest-wage, full-time workers under the bus. There are some 4.5 million uninsured full-time workers who — along with their spouses — don't qualify for exchange subsidies, even if bronze-level workplace coverage costs close to 10% of income, which ObamaCare deems ""affordable"" but clearly isn't. That can amount to five times what people pay on the subsidized exchanges, sometimes even more. That's why perhaps a million other modest-wage earners — solid numbers are hard to come by — opt for ""skinny"" coverage at work that won't pay for hospitalization or surgery but will keep them from having to pay a mandate penalty. This is worth repeating: The skimpy coverage that Democrats hate is exactly the kind of insurance-in-name-only-coverage that a lot of low-wage, full-time workers are settling for under ObamaCare.The employer mandate is easy to dodge and ends up harming the low-wage workers it was supposed to help. Getting rid of it is a progressive thing to do — especially if it is done while fixing the individual insurance market.Finally, we should allow states that haven't expanded Medicaid to do so while limiting the expansion to 100% of the poverty level, easing the fiscal burden of the expansion on states, as suggested by Urban Institute scholars.The Health Care Security & Freedom Act wouldn't deliver gold-plated insurance to most people, but it is the least we can do. All of these features would create a broad, stable risk pool, with affordable coverage options and plenty of flexibility to let people get the coverage that they believe suits them best. While they entail a fiscal cost, we can tackle that while still putting the nation on a sounder fiscal course and strengthening the social safety net.Having a robust nongroup market for insurance that serves people well should be a priority for the nation. The dynamism of our economy will be better served if entrepreneurs and idealists who are willing to step out on a limb don't have to fear that their health insurance support will come crashing down. Demographic changes make it increasingly important for people to have the flexibility to step back from full-time work to help care for an aging parent or a sick child. Amid minimum-wage pressures and health care mandates, ultra-competitive markets and the advance of technology threaten to widen the cracks in our employer-centric insurance system that millions of workers, many with modest wages, are already falling into. And don't forget that we're entering the ninth year of an economic expansion. When the next recession hits, all of these pressures will multiply and millions more people will depend on insurance outside the employer system.RELATED:Senate Delays TrumpCare Vote, Pressuring Stock MarketTrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse DealHow To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social Security

Charles Schwab (SCHW) that day matched views, with shares falling below a 42.71 buy point that they had cleared in late June. E-Trade (ETFC) shares gapped up to make a new 52-week high on Friday after the company scored an overall beat Thursday. Shares are now out of buy range.Chip-gear maker ASML (ASML) and wireless-communications chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) were the first major semiconductor industry players to report June-quarter earnings this year. ASML rose to record highs after posting better-than-expected sales and earnings during the second quarter. Qualcomm disappointed with its current-quarter profit outlook that came up short of views, even though it beat estimates for its fiscal Q3. Apple (AAPL) chip-supplier Skyworks (SWKS) reported better-than-expected fiscal Q3 sales and earnings and guided higher for the current period.Drug giants Novartis (NVS) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported better-than-expected earnings Tuesday. Dow component J&J reported adjusted income of $1.83 a share, topping views by 4 cents. But sales of $18.84 billion were light. Novartis' $1.22 a share, excluding various items on $12.24 billion in sales, topped analyst views.Both drug stocks rose during the week, but were both still in buy range as of Friday's close.Goldman Sachs' fixed-income trade revenue plunged 40% in Q2, the second straight quarter that the trading-heavy bank said it misread the market. Weaker trading and net-interest income also hurt Bank of America (BAC), though Fed rate hikes have helped the bank and it said it expected net-interest income to rise in Q3. Morgan Stanley (MS) reported that trading revenue fell, but less so than rivals. JPMorgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C) have also signaled caution amid slow loan growth and longer-term bond yields, which can indicate flagging confidence over the chances for long-term economic gains. Morgan Stanley cleared a buy point while Goldman undercut its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Check Point Software (CHKP) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday, but gave weak guidance for the current Q3. Check Point tumbled 7.2% that day, falling below its 50-day moving average. Check Point on Wednesday briefly topped a buy point but closed below that trigger. So did four other cybersecurity stocks that day. Those stocks, along with Proofpoint (PFPT), retreated modestly on Check Point's warning.United Airlines (UAL) on Tuesday offered a disappointing third-quarter unit-revenue forecast as airline competition picks up heading further into the summer, sending its shares plunging 10.4%. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL), which have remained bullish on the key metric, fell significantly as well. United said it could take at least several months out for plans — like expanded service to different parts of the U.S. and the rollout of cheaper ""basic economy"" fares — to pay off.The No. 1 U.S. health insurer's earnings per share rose 25.5%, topping forecasts. Revenue grew 8% to $50.05 billion, roughly in line, though it was the smallest gain in nine quarters.  UnitedHealth (UNH) has exited the ObamaCare exchanges, though it's a big player in Medicare and Medicaid coverage. The Optum services unit saw a 9.9% revenue rise. UnitedHealth now sees adjusted full-year profit of $9.75-$9.90 a share. Analysts had expected $9.81 before Q2's results.UnitedHealth rose 2.6%, with Republicans' health care struggles also influencing shares of insurers and hospitals.RELATED: UnitedHealth Raises Full-Year Target After Q2 Earnings Jump 25.5%Top U.S. rail companies topped quarterly forecasts, but CSX (CSX) said crude oil train shipments have fallen to zero and hinted that returns to shareholders may be more cautious. Union Pacific (UNP) predicted nearly flat volumes in Q3 as coal shipments stabilize, but it still sees second-half volumes improving over the first half. Kansas City Southern (KSU) benefited from auto production and energy market reforms in Mexico. CSX fell 6.2% for the week while Union Pacific lost 4.3%. Kansas City Southern edged up 0.4%.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) stock rocketed 21% to an all-time high Wednesday on strong Phase 1 and 2 data in the trial of a cystic fibrosis treatment.

226,UNH,"The Nasdaq rebounded off early-session lows to edge slightly higher in late-afternoon trading Thursday, paced by gains in software, medical device and biotech stocks. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) continued its fresh basing process, setting up a potential new breakout.X At 150.89, Apple shares were off fractionally and essentially keeping almost all of their 5.8% gain during a nine-day winning streak. The stock is also just 3% below an all-time high of 156.65. The correction within the current consolidation resembles either a shallow cup base or a flat base.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were virtually flat, despite a 4% sell-off in Dow Jones 30 component Home Depot (HD) as four other of the 30 components rose 1 point or more, including Nike (NKE), UnitedHealth (UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Home Depot sank below its 50-day moving average, near 154, in heavy trading on June 23, triggering an important sell signal for recent buyers.Small caps had a slight edge over large-cap equities, with the Russell 2000 gaining more than 0.2% following a 1% rebound on Wednesday to all-time highs.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, hospital, diversified medical, biotech and computer hardware all rallied 1.3% or more. Shares of auto parts chains, department stores, clothing makers and diversified utilities also led the upside.Another piece of positive technical news on the market: On both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, winning issues led losing issues by a margin of 200 to 250 stocks. As noted in the latest Big Picture column, new highs continue top 200 on a combined basis in both main exchanges, symbolizing heavy institutional demand for equities. This statistic also points to the potential for more breakouts.Back to Apple, the iPhone and iPad maker is not giving up much ground, likely due to belief among institutional investors that the company will continue to deliver a sound turnaround on the top and bottom lines. This improvement, combined with the stock's tight action following an impressive run from a Jan. 6-9 breakout past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point, are two reasons why further gains by Apple may help drive U.S. equities higher.The Street sees earnings in the just-ended fiscal third quarter rising 11% to $1.57 a share, then repeating that 11% gain in Q4 to $1.85 a share. Earnings had grown 2% and 11% in the prior two quarters, ending a three-quarter profit slump.Sales estimates are following a similar path, with Q3 revenue seen rising 6% to $44.92 billion and Q4 revenue up 7% to $49.94 billion.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Apple scores an 80 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. That's not great, but decent enough for a stock that is staging a turnaround. In the same Telecom-Consumer Products industry group, Apple is one of just three companies that show a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher, meaning they have done better than 80% of all companies in IBD's database in terms of 12-month price performance. However, the other two stocks, Voxx International (VOXX) and China Techfaith Wireless (CNTF), trade under 10 a share.On Jan. 6, Apple started its move past a 118.12 buy point in an excellent 12-week cup-with-handle base. That base was part of an initial-stage bottoming base pattern, a bullish development. From the base's high of 118.69 to the low of 104.08, Apple corrected merely 12.3%. The best cup bases tend to show mild declines in the range of 12% to upwards of 33%-35%.Notice, too, how the stock found buying support at the 200-day moving average as it built the bottom of its base. In an IBD chart or MarketSmith chart, the 200-day moving average is drawn in black and tracks the average closing price of a stock over the past 200 days. It signifies the long-term price tend of a stock.When a stock breaks out, ideally it should be trading above both the 50- and 200-day moving averages.One concern on Apple is the Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is currently negative at D on a scale of A to E. It's preferable to see this proprietary rating at C+ or higher when a stock breaks out.While Apple has yet to break out of its current new base, watch to see if this rating improves. Big price gains in heavy volume over the past 13 weeks tend to trigger a higher Accumulation/Distribution Rating, as well as down days in heavy volume that grow more than 13 weeks old.Recent clues of accumulation by mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions, insurers, banks and the like came on June 19 (the stock gained 2.9% in volume bulging 16% above average) and June 23 (up 0.5%, volume 25% above its 50-day average).RELATED:Which Way Will Equities Go From Here?

Both stocks are approaching buy points. For Lam Research, the entry is 167.15 out of a cup-shaped base, while Applied Materials has formed a flat base with a 47.96 entry. Both are later-stage bases.On the downside, Medidata Solutions (MDSO) declined 2.5% after Tuesday's brutal reversal from new highs.

229,UNH,"After railing for years about ObamaCare's affordability problems, Republicans came up with a plan that would make them exponentially worse.""Few low-income people would purchase any plan,"" the Congressional Budget Office said of the Senate TrumpCare bill, either because premiums for comprehensive coverage are out of reach, or deductibles for lower-cost plans amount to an untenable percentage of income  — more than one-third of income for individuals in some cases and potentially much more for families.TrumpCare is so ""mean"" — President Trump's own characterization of the House-passed bill — that relatively moderate GOP governors and senators have rejected it. Yet if TrumpCare is about to be buried and it's possible to start looking for a path forward, let's not forget that there's a reason ObamaCare was unpopular and suffered from weak marketplace enrollment even before TrumpCare came around.While ObamaCare has helped the near-poor and those with chronic conditions who otherwise might be stuck without affordable coverage, it gives a bad deal to pretty much everyone else. That's why the exchanges' pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly, and premiums have soared as insurers like UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have mostly exited the markets.Unfortunately, the two most likely paths forward are forms of triage that would try to control the bleeding, rather than address ObamaCare's underlying affordability problems. One approach would focus on stabilizing insurance markets, principally by providing protection for insurers against high-claims customers — a good idea and an important step, but one that addresses the symptoms, not the underlying problem of affordability. After all, ObamaCare's unpopularity and weak enrollment preceded its premium spikes, so moderating premium increases isn't the answer.A second path, represented by the proposal from Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, wouldn't actually fix anything. It forces states to choose between ObamaCare, with all of its problems, and a less-regulated alternative built around Health Savings Accounts that's guaranteed to undermine Affordable Care Act protections for low-income households and older adults facing high medical costs.So here's a crazy idea: How about Congress actually trying to deliver something that Americans can broadly support, that works for the finances of old and young, working class and middle class, and that will lead to stable insurance markets with lower premiums?There's no good reason to aim lower, and ideology shouldn't stand in the way. In fact, the very best step for public policy, within the realm of what might be possible, would be to give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have — and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need — and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for catastrophic coverage and set aside funds to cover basic medical needs.This would involve turning ObamaCare's cost-sharing support into something more akin to working-class tax cuts and removing ObamaCare's heaviest-handed mandates, while preserving the ACA's critical protections and support.Here's ObamaCare's harsh reality that makes these changes so important — even if the law weren't under political attack and insurance markets weren't experiencing turbulence. Even among working-class households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, supposedly among ObamaCare's biggest beneficiaries, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting coverage that will protect them from financial disaster. Most of the other two-thirds are uninsured, either because they or a spouse work full time and don't qualify for exchange subsidies, or else they've spurned subsidized bronze plans that carry $6,000-$7,000 deductibles.IBD'S TAKE: Find out why hospital stocks rose and one analyst touted UnitedHealth and HCA Healthcare — even as Senate Republicans called for steep Medicaid cuts in a TrumpCare bill estimated to cut the ranks of the insured by 22 million. A central problem with ObamaCare is that the rules stacked the deck in favor of those needing comprehensive coverage, leaving far too many in the working class with three unappealing options: a silver plan that costs too much; a bronze plan that won't pay their medical bills until long after they're in financial distress; or an individual mandate penalty for opting against coverage that may be of little use.Think of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis with income of $40,000 (about 200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare offers pretty solid coverage but costs $2,430 — likely too much for a young family that's probably already struggling to save anything. The cheapest bronze plan, costing $1,068, might be doable, but the $13,300 deductible ($6,650 per person) could make a hospital stay financially devastating. (By the way, that bronze option would be far worse under the Senate TrumpCare bill, costing roughly $2,000.)The chasm between ObamaCare's silver and bronze deductibles — $700 vs. $13,300 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. ObamaCare provides extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink deductibles for modest-income households, but only if they buy silver plans. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers each month, even if the policyholder gets no medical care.Looking through the lens of these 30-year-olds in St. Louis, a bipartisan replacement, merging Republican principles and Democratic values, is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a low-deductible plan with a wide range of essential benefits.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option. A replacement for ObamaCare could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings for health expenses with two simple tweaks. Relax ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young, but only for high-deductible plans, keeping comprehensive plans affordable for older adults. (That could mean silver plans with a 3:1 age rating, bronze 4:1 and catastrophic 5:1.)Next, let people use cost-sharing subsidies to reduce premiums, if they prefer, effectively making it a tax cut. Those two steps would shrink that St. Louis couple's bronze premium to zero, and they'd have about $900 left to put in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses — not nirvana, but a dramatic improvement over what ObamaCare offers.We also should do something about the steep drop off in cost-sharing subsidies that serves as a big disincentive to earn above 200% of the poverty level. A more gradual phase-out by 300% of the poverty level would provide more constructive incentives, while delivering modest tax cuts to income-tax-paying households. Premiums could essentially be free for everyone up to 250% of the poverty level — if a catastrophic-plan option is made available.Families above 200% of the poverty level, who are more likely to remain uninsured under ObamaCare, despite the mandate penalty, should be able to opt for coverage with higher deductibles than bronze, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democrats.Freedom to choose a catastrophic plan with a 5:1 age-rating should satisfy the GOP that the reformed insurance markets will provide sufficient flexibility to meet the needs of all comers. Democrats should acknowledge that it's far better to let a young-adult member of the working class get a higher-deductible plan for free than pay a penalty for going uninsured, and the broader, healthier risk pool will serve to hold down premiums for everyone.As for the individual mandate, among the biggest issues of contention, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get high-deductible coverage essentially for free — and in most cases get extra cash on top — there should be no need to threaten them with fines.Above 250% of the poverty level, an alternative to the individual mandate is well worth considering. Among the reasons that the ObamaCare individual mandate doesn't work very well is that relatively young and healthy people who gamble on going without coverage can reasonably expect to win their bet and end up with a financial gain. ObamaCare encourages this kind of short-term calculation, since only those who get sick pay a price.A more logical approach would eliminate the incentive to go without coverage when one is young and healthy, then sign up when one's health starts deteriorating. Much like Medicare's late-enrollment penalties, the idea would be to very gradually shrink future tax subsidies based on how long people go without coverage. This should apply to both the individual market and employer market, or else people would have reason not to get coverage between jobs that offer insurance. The key for this to work in the constructive way intended is that subsidies must be sufficient to make coverage affordable, or else people would opt out for legitimate financial reasons and their future cost of coverage would gradually become even less affordable.Even without this more constructive incentive, it's important to give members of the middle class a better deal than they get now. Those who earn too much to receive ObamaCare subsidies — including young adults earning well below the official cut-off at 400% of the poverty level — should be treated more equitably relative to their peers covered through the workplace.A fiscally responsible solution would be to put a floor on tax credits for anyone buying coverage on the individual market equal to 25% of the cost of a silver plan, while limiting the income-tax benefit to 25% of the cost of employer-provided coverage and capping that benefit for high-income households. People in the 25% tax bracket (up to $91,151 for singles and $151,900 for married couples) who get coverage from an employer wouldn't be hurt by the tax change, while there would be minimal effect on those in the 28% bracket (up to $190,150 for singles and $231,450 for couples).The sad reality today is that ObamaCare throws millions of modest-wage, full-time workers under the bus. There are some 4.5 million uninsured full-time workers who — along with their spouses — don't qualify for exchange subsidies, even if bronze-level workplace coverage costs close to 10% of income, which ObamaCare deems ""affordable"" but clearly isn't. That can amount to five times what people pay on the subsidized exchanges, sometimes even more. That's why perhaps a million other modest-wage earners — solid numbers aren't available — opt for ""skinny"" coverage at work that won't pay for hospitalization or surgery but will keep them from having to pay a mandate penalty.The employer mandate is easy to dodge and ends up harming the low-wage workers it was supposed to help. Getting rid of it is a progressive thing to do — especially if it is done while fixing the individual insurance market.Finally, we should allow states that haven't expanded Medicaid to do so while limiting the expansion to 100% of the poverty level, easing the fiscal burden of the expansion on states, as suggested by Urban Institute scholars.The ideas here wouldn't deliver gold-plated insurance to most people, but they are the least we can do. All of these features would create a broad, stable risk pool, with affordable coverage options and plenty of flexibility to let people get the coverage that they believe suits them best. While they entail a fiscal cost, we can tackle that while still putting the nation on a sounder fiscal course and strengthening the social safety net.Having a robust nongroup market for insurance that serves people well should be a priority for the nation. The dynamism of our economy will be better served if entrepreneurs and idealists who are willing to step out on a limb don't have to fear that their health insurance support will come crashing down. Demographic changes make it increasingly important for people to have the flexibility to step back from full-time work to help care for an aging parent or a sick child. Amid minimum-wage pressures and health care mandates, ultra-competitive markets and the advance of technology threaten to widen the cracks in our employer-centric insurance system that millions of workers, many with modest wages, are already falling into. And don't forget that we're entering the ninth year of an economic expansion. When the next recession hits, all of these pressures will multiply and millions more people will depend on insurance outside the employer system.RELATED:Senate Delays TrumpCare Vote, Pressuring Stock MarketTrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse DealHow To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social Security

You could go to an (emergency room) after 6 p.m. That's what a lot of people did because they couldn't get anyone on the phone.""So Neeleman founded HealthEquity in 2002 on the concept of consumer-driven health care, which he researched in the early 2000s as a faculty member at the University of Arizona. There, he came across what were then known as medical savings accounts. This would allow patients to develop long-term savings accounts that they could take into retirement, similar to a 401(k) or an IRA, and often accompany health insurance.""It just made so much sense to me,"" he said. ""Every time I would talk to one of my doctor colleagues, I would say to them, 'Hey, what if you could have a health plan that would provide real coverage for major events, but for routine stuff you could pay for it out of your own pocket?' ""Eventually the concept also made sense to the medical arena and to the U.S. government. And in 2004, health savings accounts made their way to the market.Ultimately, HealthEquity went public in 2014. Since then, its stock has grown 260% from its initial public offering at 14. Shares now trade near the 50 mark. The stock began consolidating in January and, on June 6, broke out after hitting a 49.35 buy point. Shares have retreated slightly and were down fractionally to 49.21 in recent action.Year to date, HealthEquity stock is up 24.5%, outperforming its 28-company Commercial Services-Outsourcing industry group, which has risen just 2.7% over the same time period. Shares of its biggest rival, WageWorks (WAGE), are down 8.4% since January.Today, HealthEquity owns about 13% of the market in health savings accounts, or HSAs, says Cornelio Ash, an analyst for William O'Neil & Co., a sister company to Investor's Business Daily. The HSA market is poised to outgrow the 401(k) boom that the retirement market saw in the 1980s, he says.The 401(k) market ""went from billions after about five years and grew at a 21% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) for the first 10 years,"" he told IBD. ""It exploded. Now, it's no surprise to see over $13 trillion in 401(k)s as of 2015.""Already the HSA market is outperforming historical growth of the 401(k) market. The HSA market grew at a 36% compound annual growth rate between 2006 and 2016, and is expected to be worth $44 billion by year's end, he said. Ash expects political trends to drive HealthEquity and WageWorks.Under bills in the House and Senate, HSA contribution limits could increase to $6,550 from $3,440 for individuals and to $13,100 from $6,750 for families, Ash says. Consumers are also embracing the concept, angling to have better control over their health care destinies, he said.Another proposal in the Senate version of the American Health Care Act could expand HSA eligibility to include additional plans with large out-of-pocket expenses not currently included in deductibles. That could expand health plan coverage by 10 million, Oppenheimer analyst Mohan Naidu said in a June 9 note to clients.HealthEquity ""is well situated to take advantage of favorable regulatory changes and the current health care cost shift toward consumers,"" Naidu said. ""The one constant appears to be the push to give ownership to consumers along with the first-dollar responsibility through tax-advantaged accounts such as HSAs.""Even without Washington's help, the HSA market is still poised for 18%-20% growth through 2018, though that could be as high as 25% if contribution limits are lifted, Ash said. The biggest challenge for the market is helping consumers understand the benefits.Neeleman acknowledges the uphill education battle facing HealthEquity and its peers. Health insurance plans with copays and deductibles have been around for decades, he said. It's hard to break consumers of that mindset.HSAs are meant to work in conjunction with a health insurance plan, Neeleman said. Most consumers, though, can afford to pay for low-cost prescriptions and some checkups out of pocket, instead saving their pre-tax HSA dollars for big medical expenses. The HSA concept was — and for some remains — ""a shock.""""People were not used to it, even though that's the way the rest of our lives are,"" he said. ""If you have homeowner's insurance or renter's insurance, you're not turning in claims for a broken window. You're just paying for it even though it could cost a couple hundred dollars.""There's a wide variety of uses for an HSA, for everything from artificial limbs to bandages and a plethora of items in between. In many cases the patient needs a doctor's note, Neeleman says. But he points out that HSAs can also be used as quasi-retirement accounts. If you've not used the money by age 65, you can take it out like a 401(k).That was a hard sell when HealthEquity first got started. Even HealthEquity's employees couldn't always wrap their heads around it, Neeleman says. They included former pharmaceutical sales reps, customer service experts and even one experienced tire salesman. They all had trouble with it.""Education is so critical and it's so hard to get people to change their mindset,"" he said. ""Any time you have a brand new product in the market, it's hard to continue to galvanize your team. There were some people who said, 'Ah, this will never work out,' and left. That was a big mistake.""IBD'S TAKE: HealthEquity stock provides a strong example of why recommitting capital on a wild equity sometimes pays off. Head to Investor's Corner for a closer look at when it's safe to get back in on a stock after it dives below its buy point.Since its beginnings as an HSA provider, HealthEquity has expanded the plethora of accounts that it offers to include flexible spending accounts, health reimbursement arrangements and health incentive accounts. Recently, it began expanding into 401(k)s via its acquisition of BenefitGuard.The BenefitGuard acquisition allows HealthEquity to pair 401(k) accounts with HSAs, Oppenheimer's Naidu said in his note to clients. With retirement information on hand, the firm can crunch the numbers to offer better savings to its customers, he said.HealthEquity also partners with 20 of the top 50 largest health plans in the country and 500 employers across the nation, Neeleman said. In the recent fiscal quarter ended April 30, HealthEquity pulled in $55.4 million in sales, growing 28% vs. the prior quarter, and hitting 2.8 million HSA members.But HealthEquity is facing a tough battle — with itself. Sales growth slowed for the fourth consecutive quarter, to 26% in the first fiscal quarter ended April 30.HSA membership growth hit 2.8 million in that period, but decelerated for the fifth straight quarter, running to 27% growth.Neeleman and Ash say HealthEquity is still outgrowing the broader HSA market, which includes rivals like WageWorks, Webster Financial (WBS) and OptumHealth, a subsidiary under UnitedHealth Group (UNH). The market grew about 20% in the first quarter of the calendar year, Neeleman says.""It's getting harder (for HealthEquity) to beat,"" O'Neil's Ash said. ""But we're so, so in the early days of this. To take the baseball example, we're not even in the first or second inning. It (the HSA market) is still so small.""RELATED:This Health Savings Company Just Beat Profit ExpectationsUnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term Cuts

232,UNH,"Stocks opened mixed-to-lower on Tuesday as a heavy slate of big name earnings reports and concerns about gridlock in Washington factored into early trade.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.3%, the S&P 500 edged 0.2% lower. The Nasdaq composite backed out of thin early gains and slipped into negative trade.The weakening overnight of the Republican effort to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, and considering more strongly the option to simply repeal the ACA without any sort of replacement legislation, sent the U.S. Dollar Index to a 10-month low in very early trade Tuesday and weighed on early market action.Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) posted the Dow's heaviest opening losses, down 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively. Goldman reported a strong earnings beat and a smaller-than-expected decrease in second-quarter revenue. Trading revenue fell 17%, the bank said, led by a 40% drop in fixed-income trading — a metric that has been weak across banking sector reports so far for the second quarter.Netflix (NFLX) pounded out an 8% opening gain, after reporting a 67% rise in second-quarter earnings, just below analyst targets, while a 32% revenue gain topped expectations and management raised its third-quarter sales and earnings guidance to above consensus views. But the big number was subscriber gains: up 5.2 million vs. Street expectations for 3.2 million new paying viewers. The move sent shares above a 166.97 buy point in a flat base in very heavy trade.Other than Netflix, the FANG group of stocks fell in early trade. Amazon.com (AMZN) took the hardest hit, down 0.4%. Amazon has been trading in a tight range, below a buy point of 1,016.10 in a flat base, and above support at its 10-week moving average.Bank of America (BAC) opened 0.4% lower after reporting its second-quarter results.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) dipped 0.5%. Novartis (NVS) popped 1.2%. United Health (UNH) shed a fraction.Lockheed Martin (LMT) rose 0.8% early Tuesday. The defense contractor reported second-quarter revenue and earnings comfortably above analysts estimates, and lifted its full-year revenue guidance to above the consensus target. The gain sent shares to new highs Monday, and out of the buy range of a flat base buy point at 274.67.Among the morning's worst losses, Harley Davidson (HOG) dropped 11% and Sweden-based Ericcson (ERIC) tumbled 14% on weaker-than-forecast results for the June quarter.Beyond the earnings calendar, Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) pounced 9% higher after announcing the Food and Drug Administration had approved its Nerlynx breast cancer treatment, expected to reach the market in September. The move lifted Puma above a flat base buy point of 86.10.Oil prices jumped 2%, despite Ecuador's announcement it would abandon the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries production cap agreement this month. The group's compliance with the agreement began to weaken in June, according to Bloomberg. West Texas Intermediate traded up 75 cents to $46.77 per barrel.Prices for both imports and exports slipped 0.2% in June, the Labor Department estimated, narrower than May's 0.3% dip in import prices and a 0.7% export price dive.The National Association of Home Builders releases its July builder sentiment survey at 10 a.m. ET.

234,UNH,"Senate Republican leaders scrapped plans for a vote on TrumpCare this week, acknowledging that there's no quick fix for a bill that's opposed by both conservatives and moderates.The afternoon news wasn't much of a surprise after Sen. Susan Collins became the second moderate to oppose the bill following the Congressional Budget Office analysis on Monday showing that it would cut the ranks of the insured by 22 million.While it's not clear how much of Tuesday's selling was tied to TrumpCare, markets stumbled back in March when ObamaCare repeal looked to be in danger, diminishing investor confidence that President Trump can push through his fiscal agenda of tax cuts and infrastructure spending.On Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite led the way lower, falling 1.6% on the stock market today. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 0.5% and the S&P 500 index 0.8%.While expectations for corporate tax cuts have moderated since the spring, Wall Street strategists still expect a moderate tax cut to pass early in 2018, providing a boost to after-tax earnings estimates. But the longer the TrumpCare debate drags on, the narrower the window for passing tax cuts. Further, the conservative-moderate split over GOP Medicaid cuts may continue to cause problems, since the next step before cutting taxes will be to pass a 10-year budget that doesn't explode the debt.Other factors seemed to be influencing stocks as well. Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) fell 2.5% after the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion in an antitrust case. Google's parent company is trading below its 50-day moving average for the first time since mid-April.Meanwhile, bank stocks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM) were higher as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer both talked about high asset values, including equity valuations. Some on Wall Street think the Fed is quietly targeting stock prices with its plan to begin shrinking its balance sheet. Treasury yields rallied Tuesday on Yellen, Fischer and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi.Yellen said she doesn't expect another big financial crisis ""in our lifetime,"" a good sign for banks heading into Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will release the second round of stress-test results, including approval of buyback and dividend plans.JPMorgan Chase stock rose 0.9%, close to a buy point, helping limit the Dow's losses.UnitedHealth Group (UNH), another Dow component and the nation's largest insurer, dipped 0.35%. While UnitedHealth has mostly exited the ObamaCare exchanges, Medicaid managed care is an important market for the company. TrumpCare would kill off a health insurance tax, which UnitedHealth, Anthem (ANTM) and other insurers have lobbied to achieve. Anthem fell 0.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Although the Nasdaq's progress has stalled in recent weeks amid a tech downdraft, the overall market remained in a confirmed uptrend through Monday. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to get an immediate read on the latest market action and what it means for investors.While knocking 15 million people off Medicaid and sending them to the individual market to buy coverage with a tax credit, the Senate TrumpCare plan still manages to save $408 billion compared with the cost of ObamaCare tax credits for private insurance, the CBO said.That's because ""few low-income people would purchase any plan,"" the CBO said, either because premiums for comprehensive coverage are out of reach, or deductibles for lower-cost plans amount to an untenable percentage of income — more than one-third of income in some cases.The CBO found that the Senate bill would save about $200 billion more than the House bill, giving Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell some money to work with in trying to win over moderate support. Still, the coverage losses are so deep that it's hard to see how he'll suddenly come up with an answer that's eluded the GOP for more than seven years since ObamaCare first passed.RELATED:CBO Deals Blow To Senate's TrumpCare Bill; Sen.

235,UNH,"TrumpCare isn't going to pass, the U.S. economy won't get a Trump-fueled bounce and the S&P 500 index will end the year at 2400, slightly lower than current levels, Goldman Sachs analysts said on Wednesday.A day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scrapped plans for a TrumpCare vote this week amid growing opposition, Goldman political analyst Alec Phillips concluded, ""At this point, enactment of broad health legislation like the House passed or the Senate is contemplating seems unlikely.""Although financial markets slumped on Tuesday, with a late bout of selling after the TrumpCare news, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all recorded solid gains in Wednesday trading intraday, with technology stocks bouncing after bearing the brunt of the prior day's sell-off.The good news from Goldman is that, unlike in March, when markets dove as prospects for ObamaCare repeal dimmed in the House, investor confidence in the ability of the Trump administration and the GOP Congress to push through sweeping legislation has already been wounded.Bank stocks rallied for a third straight day on Wednesday amid a rise in Treasury yields and good news on their stress tests. (Investors expect positive results and shareholder returns approved in the second round of stress test results late Wednesday.)Bank of America (BAC) climbed 2.6% and Wells Fargo (WFC) 2.2%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rose 2% to 89.82, breaking out of a double-bottom base buy point of 89.23. That's a big change from how bank stocks behaved when TrumpCare suffered its first big setback in March, with Wells Fargo sliding 3% on March 21, JPMorgan Chase almost 6% and Bank of America nearly 6%.""At this stage, it seems fairly clear that intraparty disputes and a thin margin in the Senate have made sweeping reforms difficult,"" so there's unlikely to be an significant market fallout, Phillips wrote.Hospital stocks, which could suffer from the steep cuts in Medicaid and a rise in the uninsured projected under TrumpCare, were among the leaders on Wednesday. Universal Health Services (UHS) rose 2%, HCA Healthcare (HCA) 1.1% and Tenet Healthcare (THC) 3%.Insurers were broadly, though modestly, higher, with UnitedHealth Group (UNH) rising 0.6%. UnitedHealth, a Dow industrials component like JPMorgan, has mostly exited the ObamaCare exchanges. But UnitedHealth is a big player in the Medicaid managed care market, which could be stunted by TrumpCare. On the other hand, TrumpCare would kill off a health insurance tax, a priority for UnitedHealth and other insurers.IBD'S TAKE: IBD revised the market trend to ""uptrend under pressure"" on Tuesday, a status that means investors should exercise extra caution in buying stocks and consider taking profits to raise cash for when the turbulence clears. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to get the latest on the market trend and what it means for your investing.The less encouraging news from Goldman is that there's not much reason for investors to be excited about prospects for the broader market or economy over the next several years. Goldman's chief equity strategist, David Kostin, raised his year-end target for the S&P 500 to 2400 from 2300, but that's about 1% below Tuesday's close. He sees dismal returns in the next two years as ""late-cycle dynamics"" yield positive but decelerating sales and earnings growth. His year-end targets for 2018 and 2019 are 2500 and 2600, respectively.Goldman now sees GDP growth of 2.1% this year, 2.2% next and 1.7% in 2019.The possible silver lining in Kostin's outlook is that he's not assuming any reduction in the corporate tax rate, so there's room for an upside surprise. In that respect, his outlook seems more or less consistent with that of David Bianco, chief investment strategist in the Americas for Deutsche Asset Management, who wrote recently that the S&P should trade at 2450 — but only ""upon clear signs of a significant and simple corporate tax cut"" to a 25% rate.The potential problem is that the legislative lift doesn't get any lighter after health care. This week, the House set aside plans to release a fiscal 2018 budget resolution as conservatives and moderates butted heads over whether to require $200 billion in entitlement savings. Doing so, moderates warned, could make tax cuts much harder to pass.RELATED:Senate Delays TrumpCare Vote, Pressuring Stock MarketJPMorgan, Bank Of America Lead Bank Rally Amid Strong Payout HopesTrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse DealUnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term Cuts

237,UNH,"Republican Senator Dean Heller of Nevada just knifed TrumpCare, and it may not recover.Heller, among the relatively moderate Republicans from a state that expanded Medicaid, announced on Friday that he can't support the bill unveiled by Republican leadership a day before.Heller said that he won't vote for a bill that ""takes insurance away from tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans.""Republicans can only afford to lose two of 52 GOP senators, so Heller's strong condemnation of the bill leaves the party perched on a precipice. Already four conservative senators have threatened to oppose the bill that is facing criticism from right-wing groups.While those conservatives might be won over, that will be now harder to do without support for the bill giving way in the center.If there's a surprise, it's that Heller, who is up for re-election in 2018, voiced his opposition even before the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis of the bill's impact early next week. Most GOP senators were keeping a low profile ahead of that report, perhaps holding out hope that the increase in the ranks of the uninsured wouldn't compare to the 23 million figure CBO attached to the TrumpCare bill that squeaked through the House.A handful of GOP moderate senators had pushed for a slower phaseout of the Medicaid expansion. Among those voicing concern have been Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rob Portman of Ohio. Their response to the coming CBO report could be influenced by Heller's strong stand, because it's hard to be the first Republican to oppose the bill as being too far to the right.On the other hand, being the deciding vote that dooms TrumpCare might be even harder. For now, while there is conservative opposition, it may be safer for moderates to oppose the bill.On Thursday, as details of the bill emerged, Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief, pushing up a broad range of health care-sector stocks, including insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH), hospital group HCA Healthcare (HCA) and drugmaker Merck (MRK). UnitedHealth and Merck are both Dow Jones industrial average components. Shares of HCA and Medicaid-focused insurer Centene (CNC) pushed higher late in Friday's session, as investors possibly began to price in lower odds of TrumpCare's passage.The apparent reason health care stocks rose on Thursday was that, as Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick put it, the Senate bill wasn't as bad as the House's in the intermediate term because of a slower phaseout of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. Some on Wall Street may have been thinking, like conservative critics of the senate TrumpCare bill, that those out-year Medicaid cuts may never happen.On Friday, markets didn't react much to news of the first moderate GOP senator coming out against the bill. Back in March, when TrumpCare appeared doomed in the House, markets stumbled, with Wall Street strategists marking down their expectations for the rest of President Trump's agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. While those expectations have come down a ways, a lot of market strategists are still factoring in a modest tax cut to 2018 earnings expectations. That means TrumpCare may take center stage in the coming week and there could be some volatility ahead.RELATED:TrumpCare: Almost Everyone Gets A Worse DealUnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term CutsTrumpCare Lives: House Passes ObamaCare Repeal Bill  
"
238,UNH,"Here's the big problem facing the new Senate TrumpCare bill: Almost everybody gets a worse deal.For all the grave faults of the bill that passed the House, it did address a couple of ObamaCare's sore spots, raising the cutoff limit for subsidies and providing more support to moderate income young adults.But if you crunch the numbers on the Senate plan, the surprising thing is how hard it is to find anyone who might pay less for a TrumpCare plan than they would for a roughly equivalent ObamaCare bronze plan.Almost everyone at least 30 years old gets a worse deal. Almost everyone earning below 225% of the poverty level — including those under 30 — gets a worse deal. And people earning more than 350% of the poverty level — the new subsidy cutoff at about $42,000 for singles — get a worse deal.This is both a political and actuarial problem. The political problem is that the Republicans have spent seven years criticizing ObamaCare for high premiums, huge deductibles and a hit to the middle class, but the GOP would make those problems worse for almost everyone. As Reason's Peter Suderman put it, ""The Senate GOP's New Health Care Bill Is Just ObamaCare, But Less Of It.""While it's impossible to overstate how determined Republicans are to repeal ObamaCare — at least its tax increases and mandates — the actuarial problem is what might prove to be the bill's undoing, sending the GOP back to the drawing board and keeping the rest of President Trump's agenda on hold.Investors' initial reaction to the Senate TrumpCare bill was more or less positive, at least for the health care sector. Shares of insurers like UnitedHealth Group (UNH), hospital operators like HCA Healthcare (HCA) and drugmakers like Merck (MRK) all rose as the bill was unveiled on Thursday. (UnitedHealth and Merck are both members of the Dow Jones industrial average.)But the last thing Wall Street wants is for TrumpCare to turn into a quagmire, exhausting the narrow legislative window available for corporate tax cuts and infrastructure spending.IBD'S TAKE: Find out why Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief when Republican Senate leaders disclosed their TrumpCare bill and why one analyst emailed out this advice to clients: ""Buy UNH and HCA.""Just how big of a rewrite challenge the GOP faces will be clear after the Congressional Budget Office releases its analysis of the Senate's officially named Better Care Reconciliation Act early next week. But there's reason to think it may be pretty severe.Consider that, all else equal except subsidies, a 30-year-old earning about 250% of the poverty level would owe about $1,700 for a bronze-type plan this year under the Senate TrumpCare bill, after subsidies — almost exactly the same as the cost under ObamaCare this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation subsidy calculator. Yet this same plan would have cost only about $300 under the House GOP's American Health Care Act (including age-rating changes), based on an IBD analysis.Here's why this is a big deal: The House plan only managed to lower average premiums by 4%, per CBO, because it dramatically shifted the landscape in favor of relatively young, moderate income adults, while slashing support for older adults. The average plan cost less because young people were priced into the market, as older people were priced out of it.Brookings Institution researchers Matthew Fielder and Loren Adler calculate that the underlying increase in the cost of insurance under the House plan was 13%, but that was obscured because of the demographic shift in the covered population, among other factors.That underlying 13% premium hike is a function of expected adverse selection, triggered by the Republicans killing off ObamaCare's individual mandate. Without a mandate, the relatively young and healthy aren't going to be willing to pay much for insurance that comes with the roughly $7,000 deductibles likely under TrumpCare. The bottom line is that the Senate bill, because it does quite a bit less to price the relatively young and healthy into the market, and less to price older and low-income households out of it, may well show a net increase in premiums.A wild card will be CBO's analysis of the Senate TrumpCare bill's impact on premiums in states that opt to waive certain ObamaCare rules. That would let states increase the allowable ratio between premiums for older and younger adults, raise out-of-pocket limits, or eliminate mandatory benefits such as maternity care and substance abuse services.If the Senate bill can't stack up to ObamaCare when it comes to premiums, that would be a killer because TrumpCare's most glaring problem is that it makes ObamaCare deductibles look minuscule. That's especially true for low-income individuals who benefit from ObamaCare's extra cost-sharing subsidies that limit out-of-pocket spending on medical bills.For a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level ($23,500), the good news is that their premiums will only cost 4% of income, about $1,000, same as ObamaCare. The bad news is that instead of facing a maximum of about $2,000 in additional bills for health spending, they'll have a combined deductible of roughly $14,000.Because the bill guts ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion, millions of people earning about the poverty level or even less will have to get coverage via the individual market. The problem isn't so much that they'll have to a pay a premium equal to about 2% of income, but they'll have $7,000 deductibles equal to more than half their income.John Graves, assistant professor of health policy at Vanderbilt School of Medicine, tweeted: ""Whereas the AHCA (House bill) would cause more uninsurance, my strong sense is the BCRA (Senate bill) will be more about underinsurance.""In other words, it's possible that CBO's analysis will predict a much smaller increase in the uninsured than the 23 million seen under the House bill.But, if a lot more people sign up for high-deductible coverage, including the influx of displaced Medicaid beneficiaries, and premiums rise due to adverse selection, that could create another problem. The Senate bill would implement automatic subsidy cuts if total individual market subsidies exceed 0.4% of GDP, a much lower cap than under ObamaCare.RELATED:UnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term CutsIBD's No. 1-Ranked Insurer Just Gave ObamaCare A Big HugTrumpCare Lives: House Passes ObamaCare Repeal BillHow To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social Security

239,UNH,"XTenet Healthcare (THC) and other hospitals led a broad advance in health care stocks on Thursday as Senate Republicans unveiled their own version of TrumpCare.The short takeaway, courtesy of Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick, is that the Senate bill is ""Lots Less Worse Short-Term; Lots More Worse Long-Term,"" in comparison to the House version. In particular, Medicaid spending would suffer a smaller hit in the near term, but face even bigger long-term cuts.Among hospital groups, HCA Healthcare (HCA) rose 2.5%, Tenet Healthcare jumped 6.8% and Universal Health Services (UHS) gained 1.8%.The stock performance may have even taken management by surprise. Politico published a letter Tenet sent to employees asking them to rally opposition to TrumpCare.Investors have good reason to focus more on the intermediate term, because it's always possible that the big out-year cuts could be interrupted or delayed — if Democrats make a comeback, for example. On the other hand, the sharp eventual spending cuts relative to ObamaCare could threaten the support of moderate GOP senators. NBC News was reporting that three GOP senators planned to voice their opposition to the new legislation, enough to deny passage.Managed care companies also were solidly higher on Thursday. Centene (CNC) and Molina (MOH), both big players in the ObamaCare exchanges and its Medicaid expansion, were among the better performers. Centene climbed 3.6% and Molina 2.3%. Anthem (ANTM), the biggest ObamaCare exchange insurer, rose 0.65%. Anthem said on Wednesday that it's pulling out of the ObamaCare marketplaces in Indiana and Wisconsin.Centene is among the rare companies making a profit from the exchanges, but Medicaid is a big profit driver for the industry, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), a Dow Jones industrial average component. All insurers would stand to benefit from the GOP plan to kill a tax on health insurance plans.UnitedHealth rose 0.7% to a record high, while Aetna (AET) gained 0.55% and Humana (HUM) advanced 0.3%.Skolnick's message to investors: ""Buy UNH and HCA.""Prospects of more modest health spending cuts than feared — assuming TrumpCare even passes — also lifted shares of drugmakers and biotechs. Among Dow components, Merck (MRK) rose 0.9%, Pfizer (PFE) 0.5% and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) 0.85%, with J&J notching a record high.Johnson & Johnson would also stand to benefit from the repeal of ObamaCare's tax on medical devices. Merck, which has been rallying on good news for immuno-oncology treatment Keytruda, crossed an aggressive entry and neared a conventional buy point.

Health care stocks outperformed after the GOP released a new version of the ObamaCare repeal bill.In the stock market today, Oracle (ORCL) gapped up over a 47.09 flat-base entry, rising around 9%. Strong earnings were the catalyst. It's OK to buy a stock when it gaps up over a buy point, but it's important to buy as close to the open price as possible. Oracle opened at 51.61.

Economists had expected no change.Hourly earnings also edged higher, up 0.2%, vs. May's 0.1% gain and above estimates for another 0.1% advance.Energy names were taking some of the premarket session's hardest hits as oil prices dropped 2%, putting West Texas Intermediate back near $44 a barrel and down 4% for the week. A Platt's report forecasting rising production from Nigeria and Libya appeared to be the cause of early declines, and oil prices could see impact from Baker Hughes' (BHI) weekly rig count report, due out at 1 p.m. ET.IntelINTC surged to the head of the Dow, up 0.8%. A note from Cowen & Co. speculated that an escalating legal battle between Apple (AAPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM) could incentivize Apple to use Intel for an increasing portion of its iPhone chips.Apple advanced 0.6% and all of the FANG stocks turned positive.

242,UNH,"One of the stock market's best-performing industry groups this year comes as something of a surprise as federal lawmakers fight to launch the era of TrumpCare. XThe 18 stocks in the Computer Software-Medical group posted a collective gain of 33% for the year through Thursday. For the past four weeks, the group has ranked in the top…

243,UNH,"Anthem (ANTM), the for-profit operator of Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, has said it's exiting Ohio's market, and the law's supporters are bracing for the possibility that it will bolt from the other 13 state exchanges, leaving 300-plus counties with no nongroup insurance options.Humana (HUM) and Aetna (AET) have said they'll completely withdraw from the ObamaCare exchanges by year-end. UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's biggest insurer, set the trend by pulling out of 31 states in 2016, leaving minimal exposure. None of this has hurt their stocks, with analysts generally seeing a pullback from the exchanges as positive for earnings. Shares of UnitedHealth, Humana, Aetna and Anthem have all hit record highs in recent weeks, with IBD's Medical-Managed Care group ranked a respectable 46 out of 197 industry groups based on stock price performance.Yet the health insurer with IBD's top Composite Rating, based on earnings and sales growth, margins and share appreciation, is going the other way, diving deeper into ObamaCare. Centene (CNC) said it will add three states exchanges to its network in 2018, while expanding its footprint in six others.The Medicaid-focused insurer said it plans to offer new exchange coverage in Kansas, Missouri and Nevada, all states where it has Medicaid managed care contracts. Centene leverages its Medicaid assets to serve mainly low-income ObamaCare exchange customers as a low-cost carrier. The formula, though it has involved some controversial pricing strategies that have helped shrink the ranks of the insured, has made Centene a rare breed: a company that's actually generated a profit from its exchange business.IBD'S TAKE: Wall Street's focus has shifted from the Comey-Trump mud fight to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting this week, but the biggest near-term development for markets may be Anthem's coming decision on whether to exit ObamaCare, which could upset the White House's legislative plans.On Tuesday, shares of Centene rose 2.05% to 78.06, leading the managed care group. Centene is still in buy range from a 75.67 buy point.Centene said it's now serving 1.2 million exchange members, up a half million from a year ago. Despite the surge in enrollment as other carriers dropped out, the insurer signaled on Tuesday that no red flags have emerged from the expanded pool: ""The key demographics of these members including age, gender, financial assistance and metal tier are consistent with Centene's experience over the past three years. Ninety percent are eligible for subsidies.""CEO Michael Neidorff acknowledged the ""uncertainty of new health care legislation,"" but said in a statement that Centene ""has demonstrated disciplined execution, agility and capacity to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members, customers and shareholders.""If TrumpCare makes it across the finish line in a form that resembles the House bill, estimated to cut the ranks of the insured by 23 million, that would deliver a big hit to Centene's market opportunity. At least as of April, Neidorff was betting that any bill to emerge from the Senate would be kinder and gentler, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid, and 16 Medicaid expansion states have Republican governors.""Among other health insurer stocks, Anthem closed up 0.3% while UnitedHealth rose 1% and Aetna 0.6%.Humana advanced 1.65% to 231.86, now slightly extended from a 220.59 entry.RELATED:One Company Could Wreak Havoc On The Trump Agenda This WeekHumana Could Fetch $300 A Share, But Suitors May Surprise You: JPMorganZombie TrumpCare Is Back, But These Health Insurer Stocks Are Breaking OutObamaCare's Top Insurer Is Increasing The Uninsured

The S&P 500 edged early Friday, defending a slim gain for the week.Among the Dow industrials, upside advancers were scarce.

Shares of EA and ServiceNow fell 0.1% each.On the earnings front, the bloodbath in brick and mortar stores continued in the stock market today after Bed Bath & Beyond's (BBBY) fiscal-Q1 results late Thursday. The retailer missed both top- and bottom-line estimates, resulting a 10% plunge in the stock price. Meanwhile, Finish Line's (FINL) Q1 revenues came in below the Street's estimates early Friday, but shares still advanced nearly 9%.Leading retailers Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) and Burlington Stores (BURL) haven't been spared from the sector carnage.

246,UNH,"Stock wrestled to a positive finish Wednesday, overcoming an energy sector meltdown brought on by multiple global factors.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 climbed 0.2% apiece. The Nasdaq surged 0.4%, as NetEase (NTES), JD.com (JD) and American Airlines (AAL) led the Nasdaq 100 with gains of more than 2% each. Apple (AAPL) and the FANG stocks also had their say, with Apple up 0.6% and Amazon.com (AMZN) rising 0.7%.Preliminary data showed volume mixed, higher on the NYSE, lower on the Nasdaq, than end-of-day trade on Tuesday.In a day of whirling global news and events, oil took center stage as a Platt's survey outlined a surprise production increase of more than a quarter-million barrels per day by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, followed by a weekly inventories report from the Energy Information Administration that showed a 3.3 million-barrel increase in U.S. supplies. That number was almost 8 million barrels above the American Petroleum Institute's estimate released Tuesday, which showed a 4.6 million decrease during the same week. That estimate had helped send oil prices up nearly 2% on Tuesday.Oil was already being closely watched early Wednesday, as tensions rose in the Persian Gulf where Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain had effectively blockaded Qatar, and after reports of multiple armed attacks on official buildings in Tehran, Iran, that reportedly left at least 12 dead. News reports said the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Tehran attacks.As a result, U.S.-based oil benchmarks led the declines, with West Texas Intermediate crude ending down nearly 5% to below $46 a barrel, its lowest mark since early May.On the stock market, oil-related groups took six of the session's 10 worst losses among industries. Drilling, U.S. E&P and field services were hardest hit.Airlines had one of the day's best performances, with Hawaiian Holdings (HA) surging 12% to break out above a 56.25 buy point. The owner of Hawaiian Airlines reported stronger-than-expected passenger traffic in May. Brazil-based Gol Intelligent Airlines (GOL) jumped 5% in weak trade.Oil plays took nine of the 10 hardest falls among S&P 500 stocks. Newfield Exploration (NFX) and Helmerich & Payne (HP) each fell about 6%. Also among those tumbles was beer-maker Molson Brewing (TAP), which tanked 6.5%.Near the top of the list, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) swung up more than 3% in moderate trade. The move was enough to clear a 62.08 flat-base buy point, but volume was only 20% above average – not enough to qualify as a breakout. Volume can sometimes kick in a day or two after a stock passes a buy point, confirming a breakout after the fact.Nike (NKE), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and American Express (AXP) were among the Dow industrials to rise 1% or more. UnitedHealth hiked its quarterly dividend to 75 cents a share and Morgan Stanley initiated coverage on the stock with an overweight rating and a 202 price target.Coca-Cola (KO) dropped to the bottom of the list, down 1%, pressured by a downgrade from BMO Capital Markets to market perform from outperform.China-based stocks posted a strong session, with NetEase leading the Nasdaq 100 with a 3% gain in powerful trade. Standpoint Research trimmed the stock's rating to reduce, from buy, but also upped its price target to 360 from 345.On the IBD 50 list, New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) and TAL Education (TAL) led, up 9% and 5% respectively. New Oriental remained extended and working on its eighth-straight weekly gain.

Medical companies Merck (MRK), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pfizer (PFE), UnitedHealth (UNH) were four of the five best Dow components.Small caps performed better, with the Russell 2000 climbing 0.4%.The downward reversals certainly were not encouraging, but volume was lower across the board, according to preliminary data. That suggested that institutional investors did not sell in massive quantities. Also, the negative reversals were not severe in scale.Senate Republicans unveiled their own version of legislation to replace ObamaCare, and investors seemed to like what it could mean for the health care sector. Medical software, drug wholesalers, managed care and several other medical-sector industry groups were among the day's best performing, rising 0.7% to 2.2%.HealthSouth (HLS) broke out of a base-on-base pattern, closing above the 47.99 buy point. Volume was below average, which dampened an otherwise bullish move. Shares rose 3%.Hologic (HOLX) broke out of a flat base, rising past a 46.15 buy point. But it also suffered from weak volume.

Two days ago, the company said it won FDA approval for its Aptima herpes treatment.Bankrate (RATE) had better volume as it broke out of a pattern with a buy point at 12.05.

Some biotechs hustling higher in the past few days are still posting annual losses. While investing in a company that is losing money is not prudent, the action points to conviction for the group.Going into Thursday's market, the biotech group was No. 23 of 197 groups.

251,UNH,"Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Broadcom (AVGO) are three stocks that show why $1.7 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) is smart for using two oars rather than just one.The fund's management is divvied up between two teams, one tilting toward value-oriented stock, the other toward growth stocks. Last year, when the postelection Trump Bump lifted value-oriented stocks like energy and financials, bets in those sectors boosted the fund's value-oriented sleeve. This year it's the growth sleeve's turn to shine brighter.And with year-to-date gains of 34% for both Amazon and Facebook and 39% for Broadcom going into Thursday, those stocks have added octane to the growth sleeve's fuel. So have consumer discretionary names like Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH). And likewise for health care names like Hologic (HOLX) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).The fund aims for a 60%-40% split in assets between its growth and value sleeves. ""That split makes sense in achieving a core fund experience for our shareholders,"" said USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the teams running the two sleeves. Subadvisors from Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss run the value sleeve. An in-house team from USAA mans the growth sleeve.Most of the fund's dividend comes from the Barrow Hanley sleeve.The tandem arrangement has resulted in a 23.46% return over the 12 months going into Thursday, topping 95% of its large-cap-blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 was up 19.06%.So far this year, the fund is up 9.74% vs. 8.82% for its peer group and 9.86% for the big-cap bogey.John Jares, who runs the growth sleeve along with John Toohey, likes Amazon's strength in retail and web services. ""It's referred to as Hurricane Amazon because it's so disruptive,"" he said. Amazon Web Services' operating margin soared to 24.3% as of the first quarter, up from 3.8% in 2014. It's expected to hit 29% by the end of 2017, he says. With AWS' profit growing much faster than the overall company's, the overall company's operating margin will be pulled up by AWS, Jares adds. And its rapidly growing free cash flow will give the company ""more ammunition to invest against any of its competitors,"" he said.He's less enthused about Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods Market (WFM), wondering what role it will play in Amazon's future.His team is crunching numbers to decide whether investors have oversold other grocery chains. The fund also owns Kroger (KR).Jares likes the way Facebook has become a magnet for advertising dollars, largely by providing advertisers with sharper targeting of consumers. ""They can see the effectiveness of ad campaigns,"" Jares said. And Facebook can post additional ads at minimal cost. ""That's what attracted us to the stock,"" he said.The stock is trading around 153. Jares says 200 is not out of the range of possibility.A third cruise ship line that the fund owns is Carnival (CCL). ""The cruise lines have been on a tear this year,"" he said, referring to all three of his cruise ship stocks. ""Because of improved demand, they've had better pricing. Last year, there were problems from terrorism in Europe, fears about the Zika virus. With the improvement in employment and the future economic outlook of the U.S., cruise lines have seen rising demand. Plus, they've enjoyed easy comps (earnings comparisons) from last year.""Royal Caribbean is up 39% so far this year. Earnings per share grew 13%, 31% and 74% the past three quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Royal Caribbean ranks No. 3 in the Leisure-Services industry group. It has four straight years of annual earnings per share growth. Norwegian ranks No. 6 in the group. You can compare the two stocks fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy to use Stock Checkup tool.Norwegian, trading around 55, is up 29% this year. The stock is within its buy range for investors looking for optimal entry points.In health care, Jares says his team likes Hologic because relatively new CEO Stephen MacMillan is shifting the company to a faster growth profile serving female health, diagnostics and aesthetics.The team's view of UnitedHealth is that investors have underappreciated its Optum division, which includes a number of fast-growing ancillary businesses that improve the effectiveness of their standard insurance business.Building materials maker Owens Corning (OC), in the Barrow Hanley sleeve, is up 30% this year. EPS grew 9% and 60% the past two quarters. The stock has been driven by the housing rebound and strength in the U.S. economy.Michael Nayfa, a manager of the Barrow Hanley sleeve, said, ""Underlying fundamentals remain strong in the roofing and composite businesses, and the insulation business looks set to recover in 2017 as housing starts remain below normal and pricing is picking up. OC remains an attractive value trading at 14 times normalized earnings with a 1.2% dividend yield.""RELATED: Microsoft would surpass Amazon Web ServicesUSAA Growth & Income Fund Shows Two Heads Are Better Than OneHow To Turn A Glass Of Wine Into A $173,000 Bump In Your IRA

252,UNH,"Here are two investment ideas for those seeking to capture the Dow Jones industrial average's performance as the index reaches new highs.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) had a good day, rising 0.6% to just below a 211.69 flat-base buy point. That's the closest it's been to the entry since kicking off the base three months ago. The $15.3 billion fund advanced 6% after clearing a prior flat base in February to the start of the current pattern.
"
253,UNH,"X DIA has been trading near highs along with the underlying blue chip index, which closed at a new record best on Thursday.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) led the Dow industrials with a 2.5% gain to mark a new high. American Express (AXP) and Goldman Sachs (GS) added 1.7% and 1.8% respectively. Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates (FDRR) is drawing near a 28.47 buy point of a flat base, which began forming one month after breaking out from a prior base. The young fund, which launched in September, has attracted $113.7 million in assets.It corresponds to the same-named index, which tracks mid- and large-cap dividend paying companies that are expected to keep paying and increasing their payouts and ""have a positive correlation of returns to increasing 10-year U.S. Treasury yields,"" according to Fidelity.com.This ETF could prove to be a timely bet, given that the Federal Reserve is poised to notch up interest rates. FDRR's top holdings as of May 30 read like a who's who of Dow stocks. They included Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK) and JPMorgan (JPM). The fund pays an annualized dividend yield of 2.6%, ahead of the S&P 500's average 1.9% return.Both ETF picks featured Thursday broke out to new highs. Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI) gained 0.9%, clearing a 123.83 flat-base buy point. It remains in the buy zone. Meantime, iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor (QUAL) rose 0.6% to stage a heavy volume breakout past a 74.39 flat-base buy point. Shares are still in buy range from the entry.RELATED:Like Apple?

Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro kept his buy rating on Exact stock, but boosted his price target to 40 from 38.Updated coverage guidelines from UnitedHealthcare, a unit of No. 1 insurer UnitedHealth, will allow an estimated 30 million patients to use Exact's Cologuard once every three years.

He described the UnitedHealthcare decision as a ""major win for Exact."" The decision arrived nearly a year before it was expected.IBD'S TAKE: Exact Sciences stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 75, meaning it outperforms three-quarters of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it lags leader Corcept Therapeutics which has a CR of 97 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top biotech players.Aetna (AET), the not-for-profit Health Care Service Corp. and Cigna (CI) cover 18 million, 15 million and 14 million patients, respectively. Humana (HUM), Tricare and Centene's (CNC) Health Net unit each cover south of 10 million lives apiece, Massaro wrote.Massaro expects Exact to pull in $205 million in 2017 sales, up from earlier views for $203 million. That's at the high end of Exact's guidance for $195 million to $205 million, but below the consensus for $209.8 million prior to UnitedHealth's update.RELATED:Exact Sciences Q4 Sales Beat, Colon-Cancer Test Procedures Double

257,UNH,"If you like ""The Odd Couple,"" May was your kind of market. A mix of technology stocks and defensive sectors outperformed. The tech stocks were driven by secular themes that seem able to keep growing even if the overall economy's growth is tepid.The S&P 500 gained 1.41% last month while U.S. diversified stock mutual funds inched ahead by a more modest 0.38%. Global science/technology funds and science-technology funds led sectors, advancing 5.88% on average and 4.69% respectively.Other leading sectors were more defensive. Utility funds gained 3.43% and international real estate funds tacked on 3.12%. Consumer goods funds also did well, growing 2.00%.""The technology sector did well because of across-the-board interest in cell phones, mobile devices and software,"" said Bernie Horn, a manager of $431.8 million Polaris Global Value Fund (PGVFX), an IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner, having outperformed the MSCI EAFE over the past one, three, five and 10 years that ended Dec. 31.Some cloud computing leaders also added to tech's showing. Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) posted gains. ""They are growing their cloud services dramatically,"" said David Chalupnik, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon has a solid 97 Composite Rating. It posted a 32.1% earnings surprise last quarter. See how its additional easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Defensive sectors also did well as investors sought safety amid doubts about the strength of economic growth. ""The market was having a debate,"" Chalupnik said. ""Investors aren't sure which way the economy is headed. The economic numbers that (came out) in May were mixed. The employment number was OK, but retail sales were a little light. The CPI (inflation rate) number was low for the second month in a row."" That last item is a sign that the U.S. economy is not heating up very fast.Precious metals funds, a defensive group, inched up 0.34% due to investor jitters over Washington, D.C., Horn said. ""The weekly hysteria over Trump comments regarding Russia tends to make some people think that the Federal Reserve may not be able to increase rates as expected,"" he said. ""That puts monetary policy into flux, which usually drives money into precious metals.""Large-cap growth funds gained 2.87%, leading U.S. diversified stock mutual fund categories.World equity funds easily topped U.S. stock funds with a 2.92% gain.Taxable bond funds inched up 0.64% on average. Tax-exempt funds tacked on 1.20%.Going forward, Horn expects stock markets to benefit from improving economic growth and diminished political drama. ""Notwithstanding political volatility around the world, underlying economic growth is slowly increasing,"" Horn said. ""And there's less of the uncertainty that was holding back individual and corporate spending. The U.S. elections, Brexit (the initial decision), the French election — all are in the past. The U.S. market has seen valuations rise. But outside the U.S., there are lots of great values.""Magna International (MGA), a Canada-based maker of car and truck parts, is one such name he likes. ""In an environment where competition among parts suppliers has been reduced, surviving companies like this are well-positioned to provide components whether the world goes electric or not,"" he said.And he still sees U.S. stocks that he likes. ""Quest Diagnostic (DGX) is the largest provider of medical tests in the country,"" Horn said. ""They're doing a better job of creating efficiencies in their operations, keeping costs in line.""He also likes NextEra Energy (NEE). ""It's one of the best-run utilities in the country if not the world, with a strong presence in clean fuels like natural gas and wind and solar to a lesser extent. It's not the cheapest stock, but management makes continuous improvements in their cost structure.""Horn also expects health insurers and managed care providers Anthem (ANTM) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) to benefit from the reduction of regulatory burdens of any arrangement that replaces or reforms ObamaCare.Chalupnik sees potential for better growth from key foreign markets than the U.S. Europe, China, Japan and emerging markets are growing at decent rates, he says. ""The whole global economy is growing together,"" he said. ""It's the first time since 2010 that you could say that.""His team has overweights in materials and industrials relative to the S&P 500, although it has trimmed its overweights. It has held its energy weighting steady.Detroit Edison (DTE) illustrates his appetite for energy. ""People and businesses still need electricity,"" he said. ""It is a very well run utility. It has good management, a good regulatory environment. It delivers quarter-in, quarter-out."" In addition, the stock has a 3% dividend yield.He also likes Wal-Mart Stores (WMT). ""It's a very stable company, probably the next big growth company out there. It's one of the few retailers that's growing same-store sales. And its e-commerce business is tremendous. And it's trading at an attractive multiple.""Share price is up 15% so far this year, including a 5% gain in May. But the stock has a weak 59 Composite Rating from IBD, on a scale from 1 to 99.Douglas Burtnick, a manager of $1.8 billion Aberdeen U.S. Small Cap Equity (GSXIX), an IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner for topping the S&P 500 over one, three, five and 10 years, likes Ellie Mae (ELLI). ""They sell software and services to banks, which help them create more efficiency around the mortgage origination process,"" he said.Ellie Mae's systems are helping to transform what has been a paper-oriented industry into a digitally focused one. ""That makes the process faster and easier,"" Burtnick said. ""Banks are willing to pay for that efficiency.""And Chalupnick likes the outlook for Lamb Weston (LW), a producer and distributor of frozen foods that was spun out of ConAgra (CAG) late last year. ""It is a relatively new company, and it is under-followed,"" he said. ""They are one of the few packaged-goods food companies that is growing its unit volume. General Mills unit volume is down (in its North American retail segment).""RELATED:Mutual Fund Managers Look For Winners In Industrials, Materials, Tech, BanksThe Painless Way To Add $140,000 To Your Retirement Account

"
270,UNH,"Anthem's (ANTM) reported plan to withdraw from many of the ObamaCare markets where it does business is the clearest sign that the exchanges face a near-term crisis.Such a move by Anthem, which was the only insurer that offered any semblance of support for RyanCare, may raise suspicion that its real motive is to curry favor with the Trump administration to salvage its merger with Cigna (CI).Yet even before Thursday's news about the for-profit operator of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, there was plenty of reason to expect a white-knuckled, high-stakes showdown over ObamaCare's future this summer between Democrats and the Trump administration. Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) have already withdrawn from most ObamaCare exchanges, with Humana (HUM) planning on a full exit for 2018.Shares of Anthem fell 1 on the stock market today. UnitedHealth, Cigna and Humana edged lower while Aetna rose 0.5%.The official exchange sign-up data for the 2017 open enrollment period that ended Jan. 31 tell part of the story. The exchange population this year is smaller and tilts older than it did last year, both bad signs for the overall health of the risk pool and 2018 premiums.As the number of people signing up for exchange coverage unexpectedly fell by 463,000, or 4%, from 2016, the number of young adults (18 to 34) shrank by 230,000, while enrollees 55-and-up rose by about 19,000, an IBD analysis finds.IBD'S TAKE: ObamaCare repeal was supposedly the big holdup for the rest of President Trump's economic agenda, but now that he's moved on, the White House is seemingly at a loss for how to proceed on tax cuts.What happens in the ObamaCare-compliant off-exchange market is almost as important as what happens on the exchanges. The Congressional Budget Office says there are about 8 million individuals with unsubsidized off-exchange coverage, and most of those are lumped in the same risk pool as those why buy on the exchange. (Those who have grandfathered policies or buy from carriers that don't offer exchange policies are in a separate pool.)Even before President Trump's election created uncertainty about the future of the exchanges and individual mandate penalty, the off-exchange market was set to take a hit in 2017 as premiums for the lowest-cost bronze plans in major HealthCare.gov markets spiked by 28%. An informal survey of some carriers by health insurance consultant Robert Laszewski finds that insurers have seen their off-exchange enrollment fall by 15% to 35% this year.In one important respect, President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan seem misguided when they say that the ObamaCare exchanges are in a death spiral. The average after-subsidy premium owed by people who qualified for tax credits and signed up via HealthCare.gov in 2017 was $106 per month, exactly the same as in 2016. ObamaCare mostly shields subsidy-eligible individuals from rising premiums, though the government portion of premiums jumped 32% to $383 per month.The Congressional Budget Office, Standard & Poor's and other outside analysts have been saying they expect the exchanges to stabilize after a big, one-time jump in premiums this year. Yet those predictions look increasingly unrealistic. The combination of a somewhat smaller, older exchange membership, shrinking off-exchange group and added pressure from Trump administration policies has created a potentially explosive situation and enormous risk for insurers.Besides pulling the plug on advertising to encourage people to enroll in late January and using his bully pulpit to criticize ObamaCare at every turn, Trump has taken one action that fundamentally undermines the operation of the exchanges.As reported by Reason's Peter Suderman in February, the IRS acted on Trump's executive order to ease compliance with ObamaCare regulations by undoing its rule to reject tax forms on which individuals fail to declare whether they had insurance coverage during the prior year.The Obama administration had put in place that rule to begin in the current tax-filing season, believing that more aggressive enforcement of the mandate could give a boost to weaker-than-expected enrollment.Now that lax enforcement has been embraced by the Trump administration and publicized by the news media, the big risk for insurers is that ObamaCare will come to resemble the failed markets in states that passed rules requiring insurers to offer the same price to the sick and healthy but didn't have a mandate to compel people to get coverage.Insurers likely already have felt some impact from lax enforcement of the mandate as customers who signed up for coverage opted not to pay their premiums.There's little question that the exchanges were in need of shoring up, regardless of who was elected, but now the situation has become more dire. The Kaiser Family Foundation's Cynthia Cox noted that there are 200 counties — where Anthem is the only insurer — that could be left without an exchange option if it exits.The big fight that seems to be just around the corner is over what happens in markets where no insurers participate. Republicans are now pushing a bill that would let people in such markets use their subsidies to buy coverage that doesn't comply with ObamaCare rules. That's a nonstarter for Democrats, who fear such a fallback would give insurers reason to bail from markets to play by more profit-friendly rules.Most Democrats will likely want to lift income restrictions on Medicaid in such markets or offer some kind of related public option, which Republicans will surely fight. A third potential solution, following Alaska's example, would have states try to entice an insurer to participate by extending reinsurance that covers a big portion of expenses for the costliest plan members. Alaska did that by passing costs onto other health plans, which is a hard pill for states to swallow. It's probably a good time for someone to come up with a Plan D.RELATED:CBO Reveals RyanCare Trick To 'Save' $600 BillionTrump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesWhy Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One ChartObamaCare's Individual Mandate Bites Hardest In These CitiesObamaCare's Individual Mandate Works Like A Payday Loan

272,UNH,"House Republicans narrowly passed the American Health Care Act on Thursday in a 217-213 vote, keeping alive their bid to repeal and replace ObamaCare after a near-death experience in March.Yet the future for TrumpCare is far from clear. If the GOP bill, which would slash Medicaid funding by $800 billion, reduce the ranks of the insured by 20 million-plus and cut taxes by about $600 billion, emerges from the Senate, it won't look anything like the bill that just passed.As CEO Michael Neidorff of Centene (CNC), the second biggest insurer on the ObamaCare exchanges with 1.1 million members, explained in a conference call last week, ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid, and 16 Medicaid expansion states have Republican governors.""Any bill that backtracks from major Medicaid cuts, which at least a half dozen GOP senators oppose, may have an even tougher road in the House.Centene shares closed down 0.2% on the stock market today after the vote but remains near a buy zone. Anthem (ANTM) slipped 5 cents. Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) rose 0.9%. Hospital group Tenet Healthcare (THC), which faces the prospect of more customers who can't pay their bills, climbed 2%.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite, which all sold off when TrumpCare looked dead in March, barely budged after the vote, closing little changed.RELATED:Zombie TrumpCare Is Back, But These Health Insurer Stocks Are Breaking Out

273,UNH,"Molina Healthcare (MOH), one of the biggest participants in the ObamaCare exchange markets and Medicaid expansion, fired its two top executives on Tuesday, sending the underperforming stock surging nearly 18% on takeover buzz.Molina's board of directors blamed the insurer's ""disappointing financial performance"" and said a leadership change would help ""drive profitability through operational improvements.""The company said it sees ""opportunities for sustained growth,"" though it wasn't immediately clear if the board is mulling a pullback from the ObamaCare exchanges for 2018. Molina has more than 4 million insured members, including about 750,000 on the exchanges.Dr. J. Mario Molina, the dismissed CEO and a son of the company founder, has been a vocal critic of GOP efforts to repeal ObamaCare. He'll remain on the board.Molina Health, scheduled to release earnings after Tuesday's close, preannounced Q1 EPS of 53 cents, below the 57-cent estimate at Zacks Investment Research.Molina shares rose 17.6% to 59.75, soaring as high as 60.98 on the stock market today, the best since mid-February.IBD'S TAKE: The GOP effort to revive TrumpCare hasn't kept health insurance stocks from breaking out into buy zones, helped by some strong earnings reports.Meanwhile, Aetna (AET) shares hit a record high on Tuesday on the strength of its better-than-expected quarterly profits and higher guidance for 2017 results. Still, Aetna signaled that it may further shrink its ObamaCare exchange presence in 2018 amid continued losses in that area of its business. Aetna rose 1.6% to 138.91.Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) retreated modestly on news that the Justice Department filed suit, accusing the company of submitting inaccurate diagnosis codes to receive excess payments for Medicare Advantage patients. The company asserted that it complied with all rules, and the shares recouped their losses.UnitedHealth traded down 0.3% to 174.14 but off intraday lows of 170.27.RELATED:Zombie TrumpCare Is Back, But These Health Insurer Stocks Are Breaking OutTrump Is Right: The ObamaCare Exchanges Are Racing Toward A Crisis

276,UNH,"X Stocks deepened their losses into the close on Wednesday, as the latest accusations against the White House stirred deepening uncertainty in the nation's capital.The Nasdaq sliced 2.6% lower, its worst loss since June. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 each lopped off 1.8%, the worst session for both since the Sept. 9 sell-off that followed comments from Federal Reserve officials that all but assured a rate hike that month.Volume roared, up significantly on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq exchanges.The trigger appeared to be news reports that notes by former FBI Director James Comey during a February meeting with President Trump, just after National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had resigned, portrayed the president pressing the director to drop the agency's probe of Flynn. Trump fired Comey on May 9. The White House has so far given conflicting reasons for Comey's firing.Markets in Europe carved out sizable losses, with the CAC 40 in Paris ending down 1.6% and Frankfurt's DAX taking a 1.4% loss.Fiber-optic stocks had some of the day's worst losses.

The comment, which valued the personal products company near $88 billion, reportedly was made during a conference with institutional investors.Chipmakers scored the worst losses among S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 stocks. Micron Technologies (MU) dived 7% to mark the bottom of both lists. Nvidia (NVDA) also dropped 7%, ending a five-day breakout rally.

277,UNH,"Health care coverage is in constant flux, but one thing that remains steady is the rising cost of medical care. As a result, both individuals and employers are seeking a flexible and tax-efficient way to manage their health care costs.One instrument: Health savings accounts, which let consumers set aside tax-free money to use for allowable medical expenses and investment, while gaining an additional way to save for retirement.Finding the best HSA account for your needs can be a challenge. Out of hundreds of HSA providers, we've compiled a list of the Investor's Business Daily Best HSAs based on criteria such as the fees they charge, the available tools to pay for medical expenses, and the investment options they provide for investors. Companies on the list of the best HSA providers cater to both employers and individuals, except for Fidelity Investments, which specifically targets large employers with more than 2,000 eligible employees.Keep in mind that picking an HSA provider is not just for employers, the self-employed or retirees. Individuals can choose their own HSA administrator even if a plan is offered at work.The nine Best HSA administrators, not ranked in any order, are:• HSA Bank
"
278,UNH,"• HealthSavings Administrators
"
279,UNH,"• Avidia Bank
"
280,UNH,"• Optum Bank
"
281,UNH,"• Bank of America
"
282,UNH,"• HealthEquity
"
283,UNH,"• Fidelity Investments
"
284,UNH,"• SelectAccount
"
285,UNH,"• Saturna Brokerage ServicesBesides the overall list, we highlight the Best HSAs in three categories: low fees, investment options and flexible account access.The companies were selected by IBD editors based on their account features, benefit consultants' input as well as customer reviews and ratings of the HSA providers' service and product offerings.""Various HSA providers have different value propositions,"" said Jon Robb, senior vice president at Devenir, an HSA research firm. It's important for HSA account holders to know how they want to use a health savings account. ""Some account holders are really focused on using this as a retirement vehicle, so they're really focused on investment options and the fees around investments. And maybe they don't really care about how easy it is to withdraw money from their account or what the interest rates are.""The other category is comprised of account holders who use their HSA for medical expenses and slowly accumulate their dollars, ""so they tend to be more focused on the monthly maintenance fees and looking at their interest rates,"" he added.When looking at fees, Robb points to three categories of providers: those that charge no fee but don't have too many HSA features, such as online access, investment options or even CDs. Usually they cater to a particular market and tend to be credit unions or community banks.A second category includes providers that charge some fees and provide a variety of options. Finally, there are those that have various levels of accounts and types of investment options.One top pick among low-fee providers is Avidia Health, a division of Avidia Bank, a bank in Hudson, Mass. Despite it originating in a community bank, Avidia Health operates and has accounts in all 50 states.For someone looking for a no-fee HSA provider that still offers various features, Avidia is it. It has a $0 setup fee, no monthly service fees, no online transaction fees, a no-fee online bill pay feature and a no-transaction-fee debit card. The account holder also benefits from free checks, a debit card, mobile app and a new, no-fee eClaims Manager feature, which enables the account holder to link his or her health insurance to the online HSA.""Once you reach $1,000 in the account, you have the option to be able to invest,"" said Lynda Westbrook, Avidia Bank's vice president of health care solutions. Avidia uses the Devenir investment platform and offers 13 mutual funds for self-directed management of the account. The only fee that comes into play is a pass-through fee of $2.50 that Devenir charges for the use of its portal. That fee is waived when the balance is $3,000 or greater.Investments take up ""less than 10% of a portfolio, and that's industrywide,"" said Westbrook. ""I think that is going to change if legislation changes and they allow (people) to put more money in. ... Younger people are the ones who are asking more for the investments, because they realize that between this and the 401(k), that's all they're going to have when they retire. There may be not be Social Security.""Some large, well-known financial institutions recently exited the health savings account business, mainly because the profit potential isn't big enough compared to their other businesses. But the potential for growth in HSAs has kept giants Fidelity Investments and Bank of America (BAC) in the game.Fidelity's HSA offering has no monthly fees and gives access to the full array of investment options available to its regular clients. In addition, account holders get access to all the third-party research available through online access to their HSA accounts.Recently, Fidelity lowered its commissions to $4.95 per trade. Account holders can use bill pay, a debit card or a check to pay for their medical expenses, just like a regular Fidelity client. And while its HSA offering is only available to large employers, Fidelity plans to expand this offering to individuals in the coming years.""One of the distinctions is that there's often two different accounts: a bank account for liquid HSA assets and then maybe a brokerage or some other type of account for invested assets. And our account is one,"" said Eric Dowley, senior vice president of HSA product management at Fidelity Investments.Optum Bank, which is part of UnitedHealth Group, holds over $7 billion in assets, and its fees are low. It gives investors a choice among 26 mutual names from companies such as Vanguard, Pisco, Oppenheimer (OPY), T. Rowe Price, American Funds, BlackRock (BLK) and Fidelity. All funds either have no load or their load is waived.Another low-cost option: HealthEquity (HQY) is among the largest administrators with 2.7 million account holders and $5 billion in assets. Members can choose from 26 mutual funds. There's a $3.95 monthly maintenance fee but no trading fee.""Often, some of the investment lineups offered by other providers are certainly more limited, but also often can have higher-expense investments, and in the long run that can erode the performance. If that's the boat that you're in, in terms of investing for the long run, I would pay attention to what those fees are with the investments and if there's a fee even to get invested, which I know exists with some providers,"" Dowley said.Indeed, not everyone is in an HSA to pay for current medical expenses. Those accounts are more and more used as an addition to people's 401(k) plans, to save on a tax-free basis for medical expenses at retirement — or even add to their retirement assets. In those cases, they may not care about how easy it is to withdraw money from the account or what interest they can earn on lower-balance thresholds.A popular choice among investors is Saturna Brokerage Services. Its offerings include nearly all mutual funds and ETFs. Investors have access to Saturna's proprietary mutual funds — Amana, Sextant, Saturna Sustainable — for which it is the advisor. Saturna also offers access to stocks, bonds and a wide variety of non-Saturna affiliated funds.Trading fees are higher than other providers — $14.95 per online trade and $25 per broker-assisted trade. But if, say, you plan to make a single transaction yearly to transfer funds from your employer-based HSA to your individual account where you might have better investment options, Saturna could be a good pick.If you plan to make many trades a year, try another provider like HSA Bank, SelectAccount,  Fidelity or HealthSavings Administrators.HSA Bank, owned by Northeast regional banking company Webster Financial (WBS), is an industry veteran, holding more than $5 billion in assets. It offers many investment options, but charges monthly and yearly maintenance fees. Account holders can trade mutual funds and other securities via various platforms, including TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Devenir's self-directed mutual fund program.SelectAccount, whose custodian MII Life is a subsidiary of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, offers a self-directed brokerage account with Charles Schwab (SCHW) for account holders who have more than $10,000 in an investment account. It charges $4.95 per online trade.Another provider with a wide variety of investment options is Fidelity, with more than 5,000 instruments, including stocks, bonds, ETFs and mutual funds.HealthSavings Administrators is a smaller firm, with about $500 million in assets. But it has been around since the beginning and has a huge selection of investment options via companies such as Vanguard, Dimensional, Franklin Templeton Investments, T. Rowe Price and others. However, the accounts charge fees.Unlike many smaller providers, Bank of America has a nationwide network of branches, should you need to walk in and actually speak to someone about your HSA. Also, while it does not offer checking services for HSAs, you can get to your money through online banking and a debit card.Fidelity also provides wide access through the use of a debit card, checking, electronic funds transfer and online banking.

Shares are up 3.1% so far this week, rebounding from their 50-day moving average. Netflix's recent rallies from the 50-day and 10-week lines created a secondary entry around 140, putting the stock at edge of that chase zone.Apple, meanwhile, edged up just 0.2%, but as a member of the Dow industrials, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq it was a broad-based contributor. Apple hit a new record 144.49, closing at 144.12, still in range from a three-weeks-tight buy point of 141.12.Most Asian markets were in the red Thursday. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index 0.4% and China's Shanghai composite 1%.In European morning trading, the U.K.'s FTSE rose about 0.1%, Germany's Dax climbed 0.2% and France's CAC was just above break-even.RELATED:Lululemon Athletica Plunges Late On Earnings Miss, 'Slow Start' In 2017FANG's Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon Started At Buy

290,UNH,"X The stock market traded mixed in afternoon trade — ranging from minor gains on the Nasdasq to light losses on the S&P 500 — heading into the final hour of the session. The tech-heavy composite moved up 0.2%, while the S&P 500 declined 0.2%.The Dow Jones industrial average inched lower. Volume was tracking slightly higher across both exchanges vs. the same time Monday. Among the other Dow industrials, IBM (IBM) paced the advancers with a 1.2% rise, while Microsoft (MSFT) and Home Depot (HD) followed up with gains of 1.1% and 1.0%, respectively.On the downside, medical components UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Pfizer (PFE) pulled the Dow into the red, declining 2% and 1.9%, respectively.Among the S&P 500, two chip stocks were among the leaders on the day. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged over 10%, while chip equipment stock Qorvo (QRVO) followed up on Monday's 5.5% advance with a 3.4% rise. Qorvo surged past a 72.52 flat-base entry, but remains within proper buy range.The S&P 500's laggards were once again retail stocks as they drastically underperformed the general market. Apparel companies Under Armour (UAA) and Hanesbrands (HBI) pierced their 50-day lines, falling 4.2% and 3.2%, respectively, while Ralph Lauren (RL) and VF Corp (VFC) dropped over 2% each.Leading retailer Burlington Stores (BURL) gapped below its 50-day line early Tuesday, down 3.3%. Gains from a 92.77 cup-base entry had been as much as 13% just five days ago, but a four-day losing streak has brought the stock's gains to just 3%.China-based stocks drastically outperformed in the stock market today. Internet portal Sina (SINA) and so-called 'Twitter of China' Weibo (WB) reported early Tuesday, causing them to shoot 18.5% and 25% higher, respectively. Both companies topped analyst estimates. Sina surged out of a long consolidation that featured a 85.34 buy point. Weibo is now up 35% from its 57.57 cup-with-handle entry.Chinese e-commerce giants JD.com (JD) and Alibaba (BABA) moved up 0.9% and 2.1%, respectively. Chinese internet giant Tencent (TCEHY) will report its Q1 results before the open Wednesday.

291,UNH,"Even as House Republicans began to sound optimistic on Wednesday about a near-term vote to repeal ObamaCare, a raft of health insurance stocks are either breaking out into buy zones, approaching buy points or setting new highs.Shares of Anthem (ANTM) surged 3.8% to 179.03 on the stock market today, still just within the 5% chase zone from Tuesday's breakout from a short, flat base above a 170.79 buy point. On Wednesday, the stock finally cleared its prior high of 173.59 set in June 2015 on the strength of its first-quarter earnings. Before the open, Anthem reported a profit of $4.68 per share, sailing past estimates of $3.86. Revenue rose 10.3% to $22.32 billion, topping estimates of $21.27 billion.Among other insurers, Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) hit an all-time high of 175.10 but closed up 0.2% at 174.38. Aetna (AET), which will report earnings before the open on Tuesday, flirted with a breakout above a cup-with-handle base buy point at 134.76, but pulled back to up 0.1% at 133.99. Humana (HUM), which previewed its earnings results and raised guidance after the close on Monday, also was bumping up against a buy point on Wednesday, rising 0.6% to 219.35.Cigna rose to its highest point since July 2015, but pulled back to a 0.2% decline. Anthem said it expects an appeals court to rule in the very near future about whether the Department of Justice was wrong to block its acquisition of Cigna (CI). Cigna wants out of the deal. Anthem said it will clarify its intentions after the appeals court decision.Centene (CNC), one of the insurers most closely tied to ObamaCare, fell 0.9% after making a run to the crest of a six-month trading range.On Tuesday, Centene reported a profit of $1.12 a share, 7 cents ahead of estimates, while revenue of $11.7 billion surpassed expectations of $11.4 billion.IBD'S TAKE: President Trump's bid to deliver the biggest tax cut in history looks likely to deliver a whole lot less. JPMorgan called the plan ""virtually impossible to pass,"" while Wells Fargo said the long-run costs of deficit-funded tax cuts will outweigh short-term benefits.Centene CEO told analysts not to overreact to headlines about ObamaCare repeal, noting that the GOP's American Health Care Act replacement still divides conservatives and moderates and has yet to make it out of the House. CEO Michael Neidorff noted that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid, and 16 Medicaid expansion states have Republican governors.""However, some key House Republican groups backed the latest repeal-and-replace legislation, suggesting at least some momentum.The GOP plan was estimated to cut 14 million people from Medicaid and reduce the ranks of the insured by 24 million overall, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis. Shares of Centene and Molina Healthcare (MOH) have moved higher since the plan backed by President Trump as ""wonderful"" first appeared dead on March 24.Molina Health fell 1.2%.An agreement among House Republicans to let states opt out of ObamaCare's rules requiring insurers charge all comers a single rate regardless of health status (though with adjustments for age) appears to have shored up the support of conservatives. Yet even if the legislation can survive the House, it appears unlikely to satisfy moderate GOP senators in Medicaid states.Anthem said it saw its insured membership grow by 1.2 million from a year ago, led by a 507,000 gain in Medicaid membership. The company, which sells Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states, said it is evaluating its plans for the ObamaCare exchange for 2018 and will make an announcement no later than July.Centene said its ObamaCare exchange membership soared by a half million to 1.2 million, which was more than expected. While the first quarter didn't reveal any negative trends to worry about among new customers, Centene management said the current quarter would give it a better idea about cost trends among its own customers and those of rivals. Both are important, since ObamaCare provides for risk-adjustment payments to those with a sicker patient pool from those with relatively lower-cost customers.Humana preannounced earnings of $2.75 a share, up from $1.98 a year ago and estimates of $2.49. The insurer, which has already said it will fully exit from the ObamaCare exchanges in 2018, said that all businesses performed well in the quarter and ""early indicators are positive relative to management's initial expectations around medical utilization.""RELATED:Dow's UnitedHealth Rises On Blowout Q1 EarningsTrumpCare Is Back: Dow Inches Ahead As Pivot To Tax Cuts Is Put On HoldTrump Is Right: The ObamaCare Exchanges Are Racing Toward A Crisis

292,UNH,"XExchange traded funds tracking major stock indexes were broadly lower Tuesday as investors digested mixed earnings from Dow industrial stocks and a surprise call for a snap election in Britain.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) booked a 0.5% loss as three of its 30 stock holdings delivered earnings results.Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS), the largest stock in this price-weighted exchange traded fund, dived more than 4% after the company missed views on both the top and bottom lines.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) lost nearly 4% as underwhelming revenue offset an earnings beat.However, United Health (UNH) climbed as much as 1% after the nation's largest health insurer smashed earnings estimates and raised full-year guidance.A fourth Dow industrials member, IBM (IBM), reports later today.The Dow ETF is up 5% year to date through Monday, lagging a 5.4% gain for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) as Dow stocks surrender their postelection leadership.Both exchange traded funds sit 2% below their March 1 highs.Meanwhile, international stock ETFs retreated amid British Prime Minister Theresa May's call for a June 8 election.

293,UNH,"A mishmash of industries helped guide the key indexes higher, and the Dow Jones industrial average indicated that demand for large-cap names may still be undiminished. Meanwhile, new-issue Zayo Group (ZAYO) broke out sharply.The specialist in leasing dark fiber and building cellphone towers shot up more than 5% to 34.77 and rallied past a 34.11 buy point in a five-month cup with handle. The base shows an example of fine institutional support at the important 200-day moving average during a test on Feb. 10. At least nine names in the 30-component Dow industrials rose 1 point or more, including tech services play IBM (IBM) and insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH).IBM, expected to report Q1 results after the close on Tuesday, rallied more than 10% after it cleared a 164.76 saucer-with-handle entry in early December, but the stock has now faded below the 10-week line for more than five weeks. Analysts see profit flat at $2.35 a share and just rising 1% to $13.78 a share for the year.UnitedHealth, up 1.4% to 167.18, is making its third general test of the 50-day line since January. The managed care firm broke out of a flat base at 144.58 once in October, then again on Nov. 10 in strong volume.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.9%, just a nose ahead of the nearly 0.9% gain in the S&P 500. The Nasdaq composite was up almost 0.9% while the Russell 2000 gained 1.2%. Volume fell on both main exchanges, according to early data.Top-performing industry groups included wireless telecom services, diversified operations, movies, travel booking and internet-based retail. But money-center, tobacco, car retail and computer-systems stocks also flourished, with groupwide gains of 1% or more.The U.S. dollar wilted. Near-term U.S. crude oil futures sank more than 1% to $52.61 a barrel.Returning to Zayo, the Boulder, Colo., member of IBD's Computer-Networking industry group has lost money every year since 2010. But last year the net loss shrank to 31 cents a share, and Wall Street expects Zayo to earn 35 cents in 2017 and 57 cents in 2018.Revenue jumped 28% to $1.72 billion in 2016, accelerating from a 20% gain in 2015.The 5% buy zone in shares of Zayo following the breakout goes up to 35.82.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Snap (SNAP) continued to slump after a promising rebound in late March gave the stock the appearance that it could work on the right side of its very first base pattern. While the market rose, Snap shares fell 1.3% to 19.93 and could close below 20 for the week for the first time since the week ended March 17.Despite some rosy comments by some Wall Street analysts, the Snapchat operator must deal with the primary challenge of proving to investors it can in fact make money in the long haul. Analysts have cut their estimates, and the company is expected to lose 55 cents a share in 2017 and 33 cents in 2018.These expected net losses are substantial, given that Snap has 1.16 billion shares outstanding. The float is 364 million.Fundamentally, one critical issue is whether Snap can rein in its ballooning operating costs. Revenue jumped a magnificent 590% to $404 million in 2016, but research and development costs more than doubled to $184 million, while sales and marketing expense rocketed 357% to $124.4 million.Full-year operating losses came to $520.4 million, up from a $382 million operating loss in 2015.The Street sees Snap losing 20 cents a share in the first quarter of this year.Snap's RS Rating of 9 is meaningless because this rating is based on 12-month relative price performance. So, for now, watch to see if institutions come in and shore up support for the stock near 20. It came public March 2 at 17 a share.Key earnings results on Tuesday include a batch of financial firms, such as Charles Schwab (SCHW) (earnings per share seen up 28% to 37 cents), Bank of America (BAC) (EPS seen up 25% to 35 cents, following an 11% drop and gains of 8% and 48% in the prior three quarters), and Goldman Sachs (GS) (EPS up 98% to $5.31).Traders will also be eyeing data on U.S. housing starts for March on Tuesday and the Federal Reserve's beige book survey of regional economic activity on Wednesday.RELATED:The Income Investor: Should You Own These 4 Dividend-Rich Utilities?Stock Market Today: Is It Time To Hold These Dow 30 Stocks Longer?Inside The IBD 50: Which Names Hold Terrible Accumulation Ratings?How To Invest Like A Pro: Lessons On Focus On Risk Control From A Master Race PilotWhich Sectors To Invest: The Top 3 Among 33 Broad Sectors Are All From Tech Land

294,UNH,"U.S. stocks were lower Tuesday morning as earnings reports kicked into full swing. The Dow Jones industrial average fell the most as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) weighed.The Dow shed 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were down 0.2% each. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 0.5%. Volume was higher across the board vs. the same time Monday.Medical, bank and oil issues led the downside in today's stock market action. Airline, food and retail stocks were among the few gainers.Dow stocks were active as four components reported earnings. IBM (IBM) is slated to report after the close.Goldman Sachs gapped down and fell 3% in heavy volume to a four-month low after the big bank's Q1 results missed views on both the top and bottom lines. Shares have been consolidating below the 50-day moving average for the past few weeks.Bank of America (BAC) rose nearly 1% in fast trade after it topped quarterly views. The stock has also been consolidating below the 10-week moving average.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) dropped 3%, gapping below its 50-day line in high turnover and back below the buy point of its last base. The Dow component and drug and medical device maker reported Q1 earnings that beat, but revenue that missed, analyst targets.Cardinal Health (CAH) gapped down and plunged 12%, breaking below its 50-day and 200-day lines in massive volume. The medical products distributor said it's buying Medtronic's (MDT) medical supply units for $6.1 billion. It also guided full-year earnings estimates lower.Back to the Dow, UnitedHealth Group advanced 1.5% in healthy trade after the health insurer delivered Q1 results that topped consensus forecasts and boosted its full-year outlook.

296,UNH,"The broad stock market outpaced JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) in three of 2016's four quarters. But the market has turned into a brisk tailwind for the fund this year. That's a boon for investors holding the fund in retirement accounts and other portfolios.The $12.5 billion fund's 9.07% advance year-to-date going into Friday topped 87% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its direct rivals averaged only 7.52%.That recent run contrasts with the past 12 months, when the fund's still-enviable 21.40% gain lagged 55% of its peers.The fund's recent spring got a boost from chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), an IBD Leaderboard stock and part of the IBD 50. The stock is up 19% so far this year.IBD'S TAKE: Despite reversing lower Thursday, Broadcom is generally acting well after clearing a 208.85 three-weeks-tight entry Feb. 17. Shares have notched a 20% profit since their initial breakout. Many stocks pull back or start a new base after this level, so investors may want to consider locking-in some profits, as IBD's Leaderboard notes. Investors with more conviction may decide to hold for further gains before taking profits.The fund also got a lift from electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA), a smaller holding that is up 20% this year. On Wednesday, Tesla said its aggressive production plan for its mass-market Model 3 sedan was still on track. But the car- and battery maker reported a fourth-quarter loss of 69 cents per share, which was more than the 42-cent loss expected by analysts. Earnings per share rose 88%, beating the consensus estimate.Tesla also released information about development of its battery factories.Tesla shares' fall on Wednesday and Thursday triggered the stock's move from IBD's Leaderboard to the Cut List. The pullback left shares well below an alternative buy point of 269.44 and mildly below a regular 258.57 entry.Facebook (FB), a top-10 holding as of Jan. 31 and part of the IBD 50, was another top performer for the fund. The social media giant, which the fund has been trimming in recent disclosures, is up 18% this year.Facebook is ranked No. 4 in IBD's Internet-Content industry group. It has a good 89 Composite Rating from IBD. And its annual pretax margin is 60%.Amazon (AMZN), another top-10 holding, is up 14% so far this year.The online retailer and provider of cloud services sports a so-so 78 IBD Comp Rating, but that has not prevented mutual funds from boosting their stakes as a group for eight quarters in a row. The estimated earnings per share growth this year for the company is a solid 48%.Among other holdings, five of seven top new buys as of Dec. 31 had Comp Ratings in the 80s or 90s.Those included UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Southwest Airlines (LUV), MercadoLibra (MELI), Morgan Stanley (MS) and FedEx (FDX). UnitedHealth and FedEx are forming basing patterns. The others are extended from recent buy areas.UnitedHealth, a health care insurer and benefits provider, has posted EPS growth of 17%, 13% 23% and 51% the past four frames. It is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, thanks in part to four straight years of annual EPS growth.Southwest has seen two quarters in a row of declining EPS, with another decline expected for the current quarter. Still, its three-year average annual EPS growth rate is 56%. And its annual EPS have grown for five straight years.Argentine-based MercadoLibra is Latin America's No. 1 e-commerce company. It is often referred to as the eBay (EBAY) of Latin America. It is ranked No. 3 in IBD's Internet-Retail group. It boasts a good 94 Comp Rating, and four consecutive years of annual EPS growth.Morgan Stanley, with a strong 98 Comp Rating, is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Banks-Money Center industry group. Revenue grew 14% and 22% the past two quarters. EPS is expected to rise 17% this year.Delivery service FedEx is another No. 1 ranked stock in its industry group, Transport-Air Freights in its case. Still, EPS growth has slowed for two quarters, growing 24%, 20% and 9% the past three stanzas. Its three-years average annual EPS growth rate is 23%. And it has delivered three straight years of annual EPS growth.Several of the fund's top holdings are household names like Apple (AAPL) and MasterCard (MA). In addition, four top-10 holdings have Comp Ratings in the 80s and 90s, including Home Depot (HD), Nvidia (NVDA) and Comcast (CMCSA).Graphics chipmaker Nvidia, for example, has a top-notch 99 Comp Rating — the highest possible — and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration. Sales shot up 55% last quarter.RELATED:Reynolds American Bolsters JPMorgan Large Cap Growth FundWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 2017

297,UNH,"Shares of hospitals and Medicaid-focused health insurers took another leg down on Friday as the divide among House Republicans over the bill to replace much of ObamaCare appeared to narrow.Among hospitals, Tenet Healthcare (THC) slid 5.3%, Universal Health Services (UHS) 1.7%, HCA Holdings (HCA) 1.3% and Lifepoint Health (LPNT) 1.8%. Medicaid-focused insurer Molina Healthcare (MOH) lost 2.5%, falling close to a 28-month low, while Centene (CNC) slipped 1.6%.Other insurers were faring better on Friday, with Anthem (ANTM) rising 0.1% and Dow industrials component UnitedHealth (UNH) 1.2%.After sinking on Tuesday after the release of the House Speaker Paul Ryan's American Health Care Act, hospital stocks had recovered the past few days. Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick noted that the apparent willingness of President Trump to back conservatives who want a faster phaseout of the Medicaid expansion might get the bill over the top in the House.The White House clarified Friday that it supports phasing out the Medicaid expansion after 2020, as the current AHCA would do. But that didn't help health stocks.Drug companies and biotechs including Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) also sold off on Tuesday as Ryan's bill was scrutinized. But that was likely due to a Tuesday morning Trump tweet: ""I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down!""On Friday, Teva shares were up 1.3% Friday on the stock market today, while Mylan edged up 0.4%.Overall, markets were holding onto modest gains after a sizzling February jobs report. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq were all up 0.2%-0.4%, although the Dow and other major indexes were on track to break a string of four straight weekly gains.In a research note, Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick said the upbeat assessment from House Majority Whip Steve Scalise offers something of a wake-up call to health care investors.""It has become clear that hospital investors were assuming that there was very little chance of a draconian repeal bill passing,"" Skolnick wrote.IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.That still leaves plenty of doubt about how anything resembling the House bill can get enough support in the Senate. Five GOP senators have expressed serious concerns about unwinding the Medicaid expansion, let alone on the expedited basis that House conservatives want to see.Skolnick notes that Trump's support will carry a lot of weight in the House, but that may not be as true for senators in states like Maine and Colorado, where Hillary Clinton beat Trump. In Ohio, GOP Sen. Rob Portman far surpassed Trump's vote tally.Yet Skolnick is sticking with her bottom line that repeal and replace gets done. ""To be clear, we don't think the GOP can go home in 2018 without passing repeal, no matter how bad, no matter whether it's full repeal or not.""And Skolnick does think that any bill that emerges will be bad for the hospitals she covers: ""We see increased adverse selection in the individual market, reduced Medicaid funding in the long term, collapse of exchanges that currently work and soaring numbers of uninsured as creating real potential for pressure on hospital cash flows that likely hit hospital valuations in the next two years.""RELATED:Three Reasons TrumpCare Isn't Killing Hospital, Insurer Stocks Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesThe Biggest Puzzle About Paul Ryan's ObamaCare Repeal

298,UNH,"More high-growth companies issued sell signals on their daily and weekly charts Thursday as the Nasdaq composite lagged the NYSE indexes. The Russell 2000 lost 0.7%, cutting its year-to-date advance to 2.8%.Nvidia (NVDA), which initially showed signs of overheating back in the final week of December as it staged a climax run, dropped 9% and fell sharply below its key 50-day moving average for the first time since its huge run began with a cup-with-handle breakout at 33.16 in mid-March of 2016.A few analyst downgrades sparked the increased selling pressure.The chip designer and leader in graphic processors still hasn't fallen that much from its all-time peak of 119.93.At a little more than 16% below that former peak, the stock could end up forming a new base, but it would also be good to see Nvidia undercut its recent low of 99.11. Why? That would serve to reset the base count.According to IBD's proprietary Stock Checkup tool, Nvidia's RS Rating remains a nearly perfect 98 on a scale of 1 to 99, but don't use the RS rating as a selling gauge. This rating keys off action over the past 12 months; when you decide whether to hold a good stock or sell it, first assess the most immediate price-and-volume interaction on both the daily and weekly charts. Fellow tech InterDigital (IDCC), meanwhile, got trampled by sellers as the wireless technology expert gapped down and lost 13%. By day's end, the stock's volume exceeded 2.3 million shares, easily the highest so far this year.InterDigital also sliced through the 50-day moving average, triggering a major sell signal to take profits and cut losses. The weakness came after the company reported its second straight quarter of triple digit earnings and sales growth. Yet, the Street still sees a massive drop in earnings for 2017, down 62% to $3.30 a share.The Nasdaq composite, burdened by heavy selling in Chinese internet and semiconductor names pared a 1% intraday loss to 0.4%. As noted in today's Big Picture column, volume edged higher on the Nasdaq, translating into another mild day of distribution, or intense professional selling, on the tech-dominated market benchmark.The S&P 500 inched slightly higher and the Dow Jones industrial average gained nearly 0.2%.Some defensive sectors, including utilities, fared better; the Dow Jones utility average rose 1% for the day. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, gas distribution, water supply and electric power utilities helped pace the upside.Dow 30 components Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth (UNH) outperformed with gains of more than 1%, reflecting renewed demand within the medical sector.J&J has been forming a saucer-like base for nearly eight months with an early buy point of 122.60, 10 cents above the 122.50 spike in the middle of the base. The saucer is more clearly visible on a weekly chart.In the case of UnitedHealth, a very shallow flat base has emerged, furnishing a 164.10 entry point, a dime above the base's left-side peak of 164.Yet while more medical service and device companies have cropped up on IBD's screened new high list in recent weeks (see the latest list via the IBD Data Tables page on the ""Stock Lists"" section at the home page of Investors.com), biotechs are still lagging in general.Fast food chain Jack In The Box (JACK), meanwhile, kept slumping. The former market leader crumbled nearly 7% and slid below its 200-day moving average in fast trade, another key sell signal. Q4 earnings grew 27% on an adjusted basis but still missed the consensus forecast. On Wednesday, the burger and taco chain flashed an earlier sell signal by falling further below its 50-day line in heavy turnover.Q4 sales rose just 4% after a flat performance in the year-ago quarter.RELATED:When Did Nvidia Show Signs A Correction Is Imminent?Stock Market Today: Can Nvidia's Fundamentals Turn It Into The Next Apple?Where To Follow IBD's Tech CoverageHow To Sell Stocks: Why A Drop Below The 50-Day Line Matters

299,UNH,"The stock market closed higher as a burst of buying in the final minutes gave gains for all three major indexes.The Nasdaq composite led with a 0.4% gain. Amazon.com (AMZN), one of its largest components, inched to a new high. The S&P 500 added 0.2%. The Russel 2000 was flat but pared losses.The Dow Jones industrial rose a fraction. UnitedHealth Group (UNH), a member of the Dow industrials, was mostly responsible for the average's lag. The health insurer slid 4% on news that the Department of Justice joined a whistleblower suit accusing UnitedHealth of overcharging for Medicare.Volume rose on the NYSE but fell on the Nasdaq, according to early numbers. Friday was an options-expiration session, which may have explained the last-minute surge in trading.New issue Impij (PI) tumbled 12%, falling below the 50-day moving average, after the the maker of RFID chips beat Q4 expectations but gave weak earnings guidance for the current quarter. Impinj had been forming a faulty pattern, in which a handle was too low in the base.Granite Construction (GVA) slid 3% to the lowest level since Nov. 8 but trimmed a much larger loss. The heavy construction company missed Q4 profit estimates.

"
300,UNH,"The Department of Justice joined a whistleblower suit accusing UnitedHealth (UNH), a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, of overcharging Medicare by at least hundreds of millions of dollars. It's the latest case in which the DOJ has taken a harder line vs. the nation's health insurance giants.""We reject these more than five-year-old claims and will contest them vigorously,"" UnitedHealth spokesman Matthew Burns said in a statement Thursday.UnitedHealth fell 3.7% to 157.62 on the stock market today, a drag on the Dow industrials. UnitedHealth undercut its 50-day moving average after attempting a breakout earlier in the week.The lawsuit, filed in 2011 by former UnitedHealth executive Benjamin Poehling, was unsealed Thursday. It claims UnitedHealth overstated how sick its Medicare Advantage members were, according to the law firm Constantine Cannon.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group. See which health insurer is No. 1 and how both stack up vs. objective fundamental and technical criteria, at IBD Stock Checkup.Poehling accused 15 companies, including Humana (HUM), Aetna (AET), WellCare Group (WCG), Health Net and others.

The stock was briefly halted in the afternoon for Aetna to announce an additional $4 billion buyback and doubling its quarterly dividend to 50 cents a share.Humana lost 2% and WellCare 2.6%. Centene (CNC), which has acquired Health Net, skidded 3.5%.Aetna and Humana recently broke off their merger agreement after a federal judge sided with the DOJ's claims that the deal would unduly limit competition. Another federal judge blocked an Anthem (ANTM) merger with Cigna (CI), with those two insurers divided over their next course of action.RELATED:UnitedHealth, The Amazon Of Health Care, Isn't Sweating Trump

303,UNH,"Health Reform: ObamaCare backers are grinning at a new survey that shows the law is more popular than ever. But this is likely to be the calm before the storm.A Gallup survey out this week finds that ObamaCare has never been more popular, with 55% saying they approve of the law. That, as Gallup notes, ""is the first time a majority of Americans have approved of the health care law."" The big change comes from independents, who've largely shifted into the ""approve"" column.Gallup's findings come on the heels of the April IBD/TIPP poll, which finds that just under half (48%) of those following the story closely believe ObamaCare is unsustainable and will collapse if left alone. And a plurality (43%) say they'd be less likely to support candidates who vote to repeal ObamaCare, while only 30% say they'd be more likely to support such candidates.There's no doubt that at least some of this newfound ObamaCare love is the result of the drumbeat of biased news coverage touting its many supposed benefits, while attacking the House replacement plan.But even as the public grows to like ObamaCare more, it is hurtling toward disaster. Last year's massive hikes in premiums and insurance defections are turning out to be just a prelude for what's in store this year.Humana (HUM) got the ball rolling in February when it announced plans to exit all the ObamaCare exchanges next year. Humana had already pulled out of most states last year after getting hit with massive losses.Humana's exit will leave the 40,000 people in the Knoxville, Tenn., area with no ObamaCare insurer.Then last week, news came out that Anthem (ANTM) might leave most of the exchanges after losing $374 million on its ObamaCare business last year.Anthem covers 800,000 people in 14 states, largely through its Blue Cross Blue Shield affiliates, and is the only insurer offering ObamaCare exchange plans in almost 300 counties. So if Anthem makes good on this threat, hundreds of thousands of people in Kentucky, Colorado, Missouri and Ohio could also end up with no ObamaCare insurers.(These folks will still be able to buy individual health insurance policies outside the ObamaCare exchanges, but that means they won't be eligible for any of ObamaCare's subsidies.)ObamaCare is teetering on collapse in other parts of the country where the Humana, Aetna (AET), UnitedHealth Group and others already dropped out, leaving just one insurer behind.The news site Axios did an analysis showing that ObamaCare enrollees in Mississippi, Tennessee and West Virginia could find themselves out of choices if insurers like Centene (CNC), Cigna (CI) and Highmark decided to drop out.None of this, mind you, has anything to do with the GOP threat to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The ObamaCare death spiral was well underway long before President Trump was elected.The problem is that the Republicans aren't telling people why ObamaCare is failing, and are instead proposing to keep the very ObamaCare regulations that are causing the collapse in the first place — namely, the law's unworkable protections for those with pre-existing conditions.This nice-sounding reform has failed everywhere it's been tried, with ObamaCare being only the latest example. (IBD recently provided a detailed explanation of why ""guaranteed issue"" keeps failing.)The initial House GOP bill retained ObamaCare's ""guaranteed issue"" rule, and any attempt by conservatives to water it down is being met with stiff resistance from liberal Republicans who have made it clear that they want to keep ObamaCare almost entirely intact.Public support for ObamaCare might tumble again later this year in the face of more market defections and a new round of shocks about premium rates. But that won't matter much if the GOP can't explain to the public why it's happening or offer a real alternative.RELATED:Republicans Cave On ObamaCareObamaCare And The Myth Of Democratic ModeratesRepealing The ObamaCare Train Wreck Has Become A Train Wreck2 Words That Spell Doom For The GOP's ObamaCare Replacement Plan

"
305,UNH,"It was just a year ago that the formula seemed right for Biogen (BIIB), the fourth-largest company in its industry, to mix up a biotechnology megamerger.Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise — a lineup of six drugs that includes Tecfidera and Tysabri — was growing. Tecfidera, Biogen's most important drug, brought in $3.97 billion in 2016, up 9%.Further, hemophilia sales, though small, grew 53% in 2016 to $847 million between just two brand-name drugs, Eloctate and Alprolix. And Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug, grabbed FDA approval just days before Christmas.The plot thickened when Biogen's chief executive, George Scangos, resigned in July, leaving the company susceptible to takeout by the likes of Merck (MRK), Allergan (AGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Pfizer (PFE). Takeout rumors abounded, and Biogen stock ended 2016 down 6.2%, making it a cheaper asset to buy.""I thought last year was really the time for it to happen,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. ""What Biogen offered last year was a relatively stable MS business that was still growing, a robust cash flow scheme, the opportunity for Spinraza and the hemophilia franchise. So an acquirer could say, 'I get all of that.' ""Fast-forward to today, and the picture is entirely different. Biogen is seeing increasing competition in the MS market, payers are balking at Spinraza prices, and the company has already taken its hemophilia drugs out of the equation.Now, only 24% of Wall Street sees Biogen as a potential takeout candidate in 2017, according to a Mizuho survey. And Porges says Biogen will probably have to wait until 2020 to see the deals roll in, if ever.""I think it has become significantly less likely,"" Porges said.So, what happened?After an incredibly successful 2016 in multiple sclerosis — including the launch of Zinbryta with AbbVie (ABBV) — Biogen's MS unit is facing looming competition from the likes of Roche (RHHBY) and Celgene (CELG), Porges told Investor's Business Daily.In a note to clients on April 7, Porges called Roche's Ocrevus a ""game-changer."" Ocrevus was approved in late March to treat both relapsing-remitting and primary progressive forms of MS, separating itself from the pack that is only approved for the relapsing-remitting form.""Both the MS physician and patient communities have been eagerly awaiting the Ocrevus launch,"" Porges said. ""The drug's high efficacy, reasonable safety profile and convenient six-month dosing schedule are all major factors in the drug's positive reception.""That spells trouble for Biogen, as Tecfidera had comprised 40% of total product sales as well as 76% of the MS unit. Biogen is actually partnered with Roche on Ocrevus, but the royalty won't be enough to offset erosion to its own MS franchise, analysts say.Porges expects Ocrevus to get 60% of the primary progressive MS market within three to four years. In the relapsing-remitting MS market, Porges sees 40%-50% erosion of Tysabri, and 30%-40% erosion of Tecfidera and Novartis' (NVS) Gilenya sales.Meanwhile, Celgene is working on an MS drug called ozanimod in Phase 3 testing. In function, ozanimod is closest to Novartis' Gilenya, though it could also rival Tecfidera or Sanofi's (SNY) Aubagio. Tecfidera, Gilenya and Aubagio, respectively, lead the MS market in terms of sales.""If Celgene wanted to buy a sales force and have something overnight to help sell ozanimod, Biogen could be that company,"" Porges told IBD. But with Biogen likely to suffer erosion from Roche competition in MS, that's looking less probable.The silver lining? Biogen won a patent and an interference case against Forward Pharma (FWP) over Tecfidera, though it was out a $1.25 billion settlement fee. Forward stock toppled 22.5% on the decision as it now loses out on a major royalty.Biogen's Spinraza has a different set of troubles. Developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), Spinraza is the first and only drug approved for the rare neurological disorder that causes muscle weakness and wasting in infants and children.Wall Street largely thought of Spinraza as a slam dunk. It had ""profound efficacy"" in two August 2016 studies in infants and children. The drug was so effective that Biogen and Ionis ended the studies early, Ionis Chief Executive Stanley Crooke told IBD in December.Spinraza was approved Dec. 23 with a fairly broad label. It's approved for use in children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy and remains the only drug approved for the disease that Crooke called ""catastrophic.""""This drug, of all things, should be rapidly adopted and widely reimbursed,"" Porges said. ""And what may have happened was what appeared to be good fortune with the label may have turned into a liability because payers became concerned too many patients would start on the drug so they restricted access.""Mizuho analyst Salim Syed calls 2017 ""largely a Spinraza story."" Biogen is set to report its first-quarter earnings on April 25. That will be particularly telling following the launch of Spinraza earlier this year. Analysts say, though, that payers are pushing back hard on reimbursements of the drug.Insurers Anthem (ANTM) and Humana (HUM) are only reimbursing patients on Spinraza with the most severe form of the disease, Type 1. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has a broader policy, covering Type 1, 2 and 3 patients. That could be because Spinraza costs $125,000 per treatment, or $750,000 in the first year, and $375,000 in subsequent years, making it a pricey drug.The consensus is projecting $15 million in first-quarter Spinraza sales, Syed said.Porges lowered his expectations for Spinraza for 2017 to $266 million from $400 million. Sales results for the first quarter will be especially telling, he told IBD. North of 100 patients on the drug would be ""pretty good — as long as they're seeing continued starts.""Then there's Biogen's hemophilia drug lineup.In February, Biogen spun off its hemophilia franchise into Bioverativ (BIVV). Since then, Bioverativ shares are up 27%, which is great — for Bioverativ. But any company considering a Biogen takeover might think again without that unit, Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Bioverativ isn't your standard biotech startup. Head to The New America to find out why.Bioverativ has yet to announce any quarterly results, having only been public since early February. The company is set to release its first-quarter earnings results on May 3. In its last full quarter with Biogen, that hemophilia unit brought in $242 million, up 11.5% year over year.Now, Porges says it would be smart for Biogen to also spin off its multiple sclerosis unit and turn its focus toward Alzheimer's. In Alzheimer's Biogen is following Eli Lilly and Merck, both of which had notable failures in December and February.Biogen's Alzheimer's play is the strongest in the sector, analysts say.In March, RBC analyst Michael Yee told IBD that Pfizer and Merck are the likeliest players to make a bid on Biogen. They would be ""interested in more branded drugs and particularly the Alzheimer's pipeline.""Biogen is working on two classes of Alzheimer's drugs — one that works to remove plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's and another called a BACE inhibitor with Eisai. BACE inhibitors aim to prevent the plaque buildup.Porges says Biogen will likely have to wait until 2020 to see renewed takeover interest. In 2020, Biogen is expected to release the results of two Phase 3 trials of aducanumab. Its BACE inhibitor, elenbecestat, is also in a Phase 3 trial with results expected after September 2020.Eli Lilly's solanezumab worked on the theory that it would remove plaque buildup — called beta amyloid — in the brain. Merck's verubecestat was a BACE inhibitor. But both failed, and there are only a handful of potential Alzheimer's drugs in development now.Meanwhile, Axovant Sciences (AXON) is working on a different theory of treatment that doesn't involve beta amyloid. It expects to have Phase 3 data of its drug, intepirdine, later this year. That, too, could change the Alzheimer's landscape and potentially further dent Biogen's chances of a merger.Still, Biogen's board will place a high premium on its Alzheimer's pipeline if it ever comes to the acquisition table, Porges said. That's because everything else has failed and development costs for aducanumab and elenbecestat have headed toward the billions of dollars, Porges said.""If you're willing to take the risk on Alzheimer's, it still makes some sense as an acquisition, but what I've heard from people in and around the industry is they're struggling to bridge the gap,"" he said. ""The board wants to be paid for Alzheimer's as if it's going to work.""RELATED:How Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, NovartisBiogen Dives As Takeover Buzz Fades, Drugs Hit SnagsCan This Small-Cap Biotech Take On Gilead, Celgene, Biogen In Alzheimer's?

307,UNH,"Stocks bets against a successful Trump presidency did nicely on Monday after his first big legislative initiative ended in massive failure.After the flop of RyanCare, which died on Friday before it even came to the House floor for a vote, hospital operators HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) were the best-performing S&P 500 issues.Shares of HCA jumped 5.2% and Universal Health surged 3.35% on the stock market today, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) closed up 1.4%, amid relief that House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to slash Medicaid spending has been tabled. Centene (CNC), a Medicaid-focused insurer with a big presence on the ObamaCare exchanges, gained 2.2%, and rival Molina Healthcare (MOH) rose 2.75%, as it continued to recover from a 30-month low hit early last week.But health care stocks weren't the only group expected to suffer under Trump's policies that were shining on Monday.Gold miners also rose as the precious metal appreciated to a one-month high on Monday. Newmont Mining (NEM) gained 1.3% and Royal Gold (RGLD) 2.4%. Gold prices perked up as the dollar and 10-year Treasury yield extended their recent declines amid doubts about President Trump's ability to deliver the promised fiscal fuel of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. IBD'S TAKE: The quick and sudden flop of RyanCare proved that President Trump knows how to cut losses. Expect him to do the same with deficit-neutral tax reform and quickly shift to old-fashioned, deficit-increasing tax cuts.Meanwhile, industrial commodity stocks were among the bigger losers amid concerns that faster growth might not materialize to improve the supply-demand balance.Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) fell 4.7%, while oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) lost 3.3%. Morgan Stanley (MS) shed 2.1% as falling market interest rates weighed on the entire financial sector.Most big health insurer stocks were lower on Monday, which might seem surprising after the demise of Ryan's plan that was estimated to shrink the ranks of the insured by 24 million.Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) slipped 0.2%, while Anthem (ANTM) lost 0.3%. The investor reaction may be because health insurers would have benefited from the repeal of ObamaCare's health insurance tax and a further delay of its 40% tax on employer sponsored insurance plans that exceed a so-called ""Cadillac"" threshold. Further, health insurers pay tend to pay high tax rates and stand to benefit from a big cut in the corporate income-tax rate.RELATED:Stocks End Off Lows: ObamaCare Repeal Dead, Long Live Tax Cuts?Health Care Stocks Socked Again After CBO RyanCare ScoreFreeport-McMoRan Restarts Huge Mine; Rival Miners DiveThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

"
314,UNH,"President Trump on Monday called the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare ""unbelievably complex"" and said that his tax cut plans will have to wait in line.But Trump sounded all fired up to begin making good on his campaign plans for a massive infrastructure spending boost. That may be the easiest lift because of the bipartisan appeal of creating more construction jobs while making investments in highways, bridges and other productivity-enhancing projects.Trump's comments on Monday lit a fire under infrastructure stocks. Caterpillar (CAT) rose about 2%, U.S. Steel (X) 3.2%, Fluor (FLR) 1.9% and Vulcan Materials (VMC) 2.4%. Those stocks got hammered last week when reports emerged that the White House was thinking of pushing an infrastructure bill to 2018.Yet there still might not be a green light for Trump's infrastructure plans. With the repeal-and-replace plan for President Obama's signature program running into trouble on multiple fronts, it's looking increasingly possible that Republicans will have to signal a retreat before the rest of their economic agenda can advance.According to Trump, everything is under control. He said on Monday that the White House has arrived at a ""really, really good"" solution to ObamaCare that he will discuss Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress.""I think you'll like what you hear,"" he told insurers at the White House on Monday, including UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM).Investor confidence in President Trump may be riding on his Tuesday speech. High hopes for tax cuts, a surge in infrastructure spending and regulatory reform have helped fuel an explosive postelection stock market rally, but doubts have been creeping in about his ability to deliver.Still, the Dow Jones industrial average has rallied for 11 straight sessions as of Friday, the longest winning streak in decades.Trump's vow to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% or 20% may hinge on the House GOP proposal for a 20% border tax that faces serious opposition in the Senate because it pits big importers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Best Buy (BBY) against exporters like Boeing (BA) and General Electric (GE).No hint of a Plan B has emerged, and Trump signaled that he won't provide any details that might help investors gauge the prospects for tax reform advancing while ObamaCare is dominating the agenda. Trump's explanation was that tax reform would have to take into account the budget effect of repeal and replace.While there's good reason to expect regulatory reform to ease compliance costs across a wide array of industries, big banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) also have been lifted by hopes for a lower corporate tax rate and a steeper yield curve, which boosts net interest margins. Yet diminished confidence that a Trump economic package will do much for growth over the next year have led Treasury yields to sag in recent weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Backers of a 20% border tax say that the dollar would rise about 25%, effectively negating the higher tax bill faced by importers. Yet, if that were to happen, the stronger dollar would hurt the U.S. tourism industry — including Trump hotels.The White House seems to have gone back and forth on whether it will support a border tax, which would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade and offset the cost of a lower corporate tax rate. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News that he has only just begun to study the border tax proposal. Last week, Mnuchin said the goal was to pass tax reform by August but acknowledged that the timetable could slip.Trump has made clear that figuring out what to do about ObamaCare is the top priority in the short term, but dissension among Republicans about how to replace the law raises the risk of a drawn-out effort, at best, with some risk of a quagmire. A preliminary Congressional Budget Office score of the House's approach to repeal and replace much of ObamaCare reportedly showed a big increase in the ranks of the uninsured, which runs counter to White House promises.Republicans are considering holding a vote to repeal big parts of ObamaCare, even if a victory is uncertain. That may be the best outcome for investors. Win or lose, ObamaCare would fall off the top of the agenda, clearing the way for more growth-oriented policies.RELATED:Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon Rally As Trump Seeks Defense Budget BoostInfrastructure Stocks Jump As President Trump Vows To Spend 'Big'Steel, Materials, Mining Stocks Dive As Trump Mulls Infrastructure Delay To 2018Will Heavy Construction's Rebound Receive A Trump Infrastructure Boost?If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May Collapse

317,UNH,"Michael Clarfeld has helped steer $5.6 billion ClearBridge Dividend Strategy Fund (SOPAX) to solid performance by pursing high-quality stocks that provide price appreciation with improving dividends.The fund he co-manages has returned an average annual 8.89% in the three years ended Jan. 31, topping 80% of the diversified income-oriented stock mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. The fund's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.12%.His bull's-eye is dividend growth, not high dividends. He and co-managers Harry Cohen and Peter Vanderlee favor stocks that are financially healthy enough to pay dividends that rise. They avoid those with yields that are inflated either by companies desperately trying to attract investors or by falling share prices.The bonus is that the financial strength that provides a launchpad for dividend growth inoculates stocks against the risks of a rising interest rate environment, he says.""Stretching for yield is risky,"" he warns. ""Dividend growth is the place to be. That growth can offset the negatives of rising rates.""Dividends can be shock-absorbers, smoothing investors' rides during market turmoil. Yet their stock holdings still offer the potential of price gains, the thinking goes.Just look at some of his fund's holdings. Among the fund's four holdings with the highest Composite Ratings from IBD, Texas Instruments (TXN) is up 43% in the past 12 months ended Jan. 31; it has an annual dividend growth rate of 15.3% in the past three years, according to dividend.com. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is up 42%; its dividend growth rate is 10.6%. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is up 22%; its dividend growth rate is 6.8%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is up 41%; its dividend growth rate is 31.2%.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Medical Care industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its strong 87 IBD Composite Rating and four straight years of earnings per share (EPS) growth — stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.That volatility antidote of dividend-paying stocks might come in handy sooner rather than later. The market has traded sideways since mid-December as investors wait to see how the newly installed president's policies play out and whether a Republican-controlled Congress makes good on the business friendly actions investors expect from it.Stocks offering dividend growth also might fare better than bonds if the Federal Reserve makes good on its signals that it intends to raise rates multiple times this year.From his office in Manhattan, 39-year-old Clarfeld talked with IBD about whether it's wise to own a dividend-paying portfolio in a rising rate environment and his fund's overall investment approach.IBD: Do you ever give in to temptation and buy high-yield stocks?Clarfeld: If you buy only stocks with high current dividends, you miss out on some good stocks. We own American Tower (AMT), for instance, which is a wonderful business. (Its share price is up 34% since the end of 2012. Its dividend yield is 2.2%.) But it only began to pay dividends in 2012. So you have to be open-minded.We used to own Heinz (now part of KraftHeinz (KHC)). Several years ago it was much easier to find great companies with solid growth and high dividends like Heinz. But then it got taken over. We couldn't find a replacement that was as good a company with a good growth rate and a high current yield, so we ended up tilting more toward dividend growth and a little less toward high current yield as the impacts of quant easing became more pronounced over the last many years.IBD: Dividend growers are among the most stable companies. Why not buy shares in them directly and avoid a fund's expenses?Clarfeld: There are a couple of reasons. One is diversification. It would not be particularly efficient for an individual to buy 4o to 50 stocks. The broker commissions would add up.And the average person who has a job and a family does not have time to follow 50 different companies, industries, competitors and figure out which to buy, the correct time to buy, and so on.IBD: You began a stake in JPMorgan Chase (JPM) not long ago, but well before its recent Trump bump. What's your thesis?Clarfeld: We bought it early in the year when it was yielding north of 3%. (Yield now is 2.3%.) Pre-election, there was so much investor fatigue toward large banks, prices were very beaten down. And the prospect of interest rates going up, it seemed like it would never happen. And it seemed like regulatory pressures would persist forever. We just thought the valuation was too pessimistic. And JPMorgan has lots of franchises that are valuable.IBD: Texas Instruments' (TXN) earnings per share growth has accelerated for four straight quarters. What's driving it?Clarfeld: We like their emphasis on analog chips. If you think about Texas vs. Intel (INTC), which we also own, Intel makes the brains of computers. They are high performance, high dollar value. Texas focuses on the other end of the spectrum. Their chips sell for 10 to 20 cents. They are basic but high quality. And they're attractive because they are the largest player in that space.Anyone designing a new alarm clock or refrigerator or car and needs basic chips knows that Texas Instruments has them. And once those chips are designed into something, it rarely changes. So they provide a recurring revenue stream like an annuity.High performance chips require huge R&D spending. Texas Instruments' chips are much less capital intensive. So they can direct 100% of their free cash flow to shareholders.IBD: Automatic Data Processing (ADP) got a nice Trump bump. But you've owed this for years, right?Clarfeld: It's been a core holding for 10-plus years. It's a business we think can compound earnings for years. And payroll processing provides recurring revenues. Once you get a company's payroll, the business is sticky. This company benefits from job growth in the economy. It is taking share. And it provides ancillary services. They help companies deal with Affordable Care Act compliance, although a potential repeal or replacement is now a risk for them. Still, the ACA is not a core driver of this business.And recently it's benefited like a lot of financials from rising interest rates. They earn a float on payrolls they handle. Rising rates mean that float will increase.IBD: You reopened your stake in Alphabet (GOOG) after closing it. What brought you back?Clarfeld: We're a dividend portfolio. We don't go looking for nondividend-payers, but we don't want to be overly dogmatic. We wanted this exposure and there is no other way to get it.Over the past 10 years, we've owned three nondividend-payers: Apple (AAPL), Berkshire Hathaway (BERKB) and Alphabet. There is no search company like Google. There is no company like Berkshire Hathaway, which won't initiate a dividend while Warren Buffett is alive. After he's gone, who knows? And we think Alphabet will likely initiate a dividend in the future. We're not forecasting that, but we think they will.IBD: You trimmed your Waste Management (WM) stake. Why is that?Clarfeld: Actually, it's an example of a business we like. The business is stable and predictable. It's cyclical with the economy. There's been enough consolidation to make the industry rational. In fact, they've been able to drive prices higher despite a relatively weak economy. We have trimmed some just on valuation.IBD: What distinguishes Walt Disney (DIS) from other media names?Clarfeld: Their ability to create properties and then monetize them. They make movies, then turn it into a theme park attraction and then sell merchandise from it to kids. They show an ability to do that in a way few other companies can.And they own ESPN, which is dominant in sports. The biggest piece of ESPN is monthly subscription income, not advertising, and their paid subscribers are growing. So their revenue is stable and predictable. They have multiyear contracts with (cable) systems, with built-in (price) escalators.IBD: Is Home Depot (HD) a play on an expected pickup in economic growth?Clarfeld: What we like about it is not what's going to happen to the economy in 2017. We don't own a lot of retailers because they're hard to understand. And they have a fashion element, which can become unpopular suddenly. Home Depot is not like that. They're not trying to call a fashion fad. And they don't need to spiff up their stores, which are warehouses. It took a huge step down in the financial crisis. We bought it back then. Our cost basis is below 30. (Now it's trading around the high 130s.) It's a play on people spending on their homes.IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has trended higher since the election. Is this a play on the expectation of reduced health care regulation?Clarfeld: They have diversified their operations. The stock has done well because people expect reform or changes under the new administration that will be market based.

318,UNH,"Anthem (ANTM) easily topped fourth-quarter profit estimates Wednesday, following upside earnings surprises from Aetna (AET) and UnitedHealth (UNH), in a sign that insurers are generally thriving despite piling up losses in the ObamaCare exchanges and uncertainty about what will happen under President Trump.The largest Blue Cross Blue Shield operator earned $1.76 per share, 15 cents ahead of the consensus. Revenue rose 7.3% to $21.5 billion, topping estimates of $20.9 billion.Benefits as a share of premiums rose to 87.2% from 87.0% a year ago, reflecting high costs among Iowa Medicaid customers and individual market policyholders.The insurer offered earnings guidance for 2017 of ""greater than $11.50"" per share vs. current estimates of $11.53.Anthem had about 1.7 million members with individual insurance policies in December out of a total of 39.9 million. Medicaid is its fastest growing segment, adding 613,000 members over the past year to reach 6.5 million.Shares rose 4.3% to 160.79 on the stock market today, hitting an 18-month high. Aetna rose 2.5% Wednesday after climbing 1.6% on Tuesday following its earnings report. Cigna advanced 1% while UnitedHealth edged 0.4% higher.IBD'S TAKE: Read why UnitedHealth is fast becoming the Amazon of health care and why it isn't sweating forthcoming policy changes under President Trump.Anthem's earnings call may signal its plans for the ObamaCare exchanges in 2018. The company warned in early November that it wanted to see moves by Washington to strengthen those markets, or else it might bolt.Yet uncertainty about the future of the exchanges has grown as Republicans move toward repealing key features of ObamaCare, without any clarity on replacement.Meanwhile, Anthem is awaiting a judge's ruling on the fate of its $54 billion merger with Cigna (CI), which got a thumbs-down from the Justice Department under President Obama. A federal judge recently blocked the planned Aetna-Humana (HUM) merger, following DOJ objections.Despite major doubts that the merger will close, Anthem shares have surged since the election, helped partly by prospects for a big corporate tax cut. Anthem will have to pay Cigna a $1.8 billion break-up fee if the deal doesn't go through.RELATED:Aetna Plans Full ObamaCare Exit, Mulls Humana MoveUnitedHealth Earnings Beat As ObamaCare Exchange Costs ImproveTrump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?'

331,UNH,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) beat fourth-quarter earnings forecasts Tuesday, helped by reduced cost pressure from its ObamaCare exchange business.Earnings of $2.11 per share were up 50.7% from a year ago and 4 cents ahead of the consensus. Revenue rose 9.0% to $47.52 billion, topping views of $47.13 billion.The company stood by its financial outlook for 2017: Revenue of $197 billion-$199 billion and adjusted EPS of $9.30-$9.60. Wall Street analysts see revenue of $198.3 billion and EPS of $9.51.Shares eased by 0.7% to 160.66 on the stock market today, despite the positive tone of the earnings and analyst call.UnitedHealth appeared to be caught up in a downdraft triggered by President-elect Donald Trump's weekend comments that clouded the prospects for corporate tax reform. Aetna (AET) was off 1% to 121.04, Anthem (ANTM) lost 1.2% to 146.75, Cigna (CI) dropped 1.1% to 144.77, while Humana (HUM) shares managed a 0.6% gain to 204.04.While other insurers' shares have been volatile amid ObamaCare woes and the antitrust outlook, UnitedHealth has been a standout stock, driven by its fast-growing Optum health services unit. UnitedHealth, whose shares vaulted above a buy point on Nov. 10 on the way to a 13% postelection rise, had been carving out a tight, constructive consolidation base before Tuesday's volatile session.Optum unit revenue growth temporarily slowed in Q4 due a 4.8% decline in revenues at the OptumRx pharmacy benefit management services unit. That decline reflected a loss of business that had been anticipated when UnitedHealth bought Catamaran.As the first big health insurer to report, UnitedHealth said its medical costs as a share of premium revenue fell 1.9 percentage points to 80.8% in Q4, helped by ""reduced individual market pressure.""While exchange losses were basically in line with expectations in Q4, the real improvement came vs. a year ago when UnitedHealth had recognized a premium deficiency reserve due to its ailing exchange business.UnitedHealth remains in a handful of ObamaCare exchange markets in 2017, but management said it has virtually no earnings exposure to the exchanges this year.The company added 2.2 million insured members in 2016, including 585,000 Medicaid beneficiaries. It expects its expects its Medicare membership to grow by 1 million in 2017.RELATED:UnitedHealth, The Amazon Of Health Care, Isn't Sweating Trump

332,UNH,"Hospitals and insurer stocks were hammered yet again on Tuesday, a day after the Congressional Budget Office said that the GOP ObamaCare repeal plan could cut the ranks of the insured by 24 million by 2026.Even more startling, since the biggest changes wouldn't take effect until 2020, is that the uninsured population could jump by 15 million next year alone if the individual mandate is killed, CBO said.For hospital groups like Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA) that could mean a lot more uninsured patients who can't pay their bills, even though the House bill would provide some extra funds for hospitals that treat a disproportionately high share of low-income patients. Tenet fell 3.3% and HCA 1.5% on the stock market today.Insurers also fared poorly, and this time the losses extended beyond Medicaid-focused insurers Molina Healthcare (MOH) and Centene (CNC) to big players like Anthem (ANTM) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). Molina sank 2.3%, hitting its lowest level since October 2014, while Centene lost 2.8%, Anthem 1.2% and Dow component UnitedHealth 0.7%.The overall market saw more modest losses, with the Dow Jones industrial average off 0.2%, the S&P 500 index 0.4% and the Nasdaq composite 0.4%. (UnitedHealth is a Dow component.)IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.The negative reaction of investors to the CBO report wasn't a given, because several GOP senators used the occasion to criticize the American Health Care Act put together by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Yet Ryan said he was encouraged by CBO's analysis. It's possible that the report showing more than $300 billion in budget savings will help him win over enough conservatives to pass his bill.Still, it's unclear that anything resembling RyanCare can survive the Senate, where at least five moderate Republicans and a couple of conservatives have expressed opposition. It follows that anything which can survive the Senate may not survive the House. But if the Senate can pass an ObamaCare repeal bill through budget reconciliation, which is by no means certain, there will be tremendous pressure on all concerned to get a deal done.RELATED:CBO Reveals RyanCare Trick To 'Save' $600 BillionTrump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else Hates

333,UNH,"The stock market continued to struggle in a broad decline in late afternoon trading Tuesday as the Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting on interest rate policy.Amid the Dow Jones industrial average, at least four stocks were at one point down 1 point or more each: Chevron (CVX), 3M (MMM), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and DuPont (DD).Among these four, only Chevron is trading below its key 50-day moving average, which can act as an important sell signal. Watch to see if the integrated oil major can keep its head up above the long-term 200-day moving average. UnitedHealth, as seen in either a long-term daily chart or a recent weekly chart, has clearly benefited from the Trump effect as the insurer and its peers are likely to face fewer obligations in handling coverage as mandated by the Affordable Care Act.UnitedHealth shares, up 5.7% year to date, have also climbed 17% past a 144.58 flat base entry that followed the stock's earlier breakout in 2016 from a long saucer base that featured a 126.31 entry. Be sure to see a weekly chart to fully view such long basing patterns.3M has rallied nearly 7% since moving past a 180.16 saucer-with-handle entry on Feb. 13. DuPont, despite cracking a four-day streak of gains with 1% drop to 80.42, has been gliding rather smoothly to 52-week highs since the agriculture, construction and electronics diversified giant hopped out of its aircraft-carrier-sized saucer with handle with a 71.19 entry in late November.DuPont shares have since gained as much as 14% and have not triggered any offense or defense-related sell signals.While a 25-basis point hike in the fed funds rate has long been considered in the bag for several weeks now, equity trading desks will focus on the statement that the U.S. central bank is set to issue after its meeting concludes at around 2 p.m. ET Wednesday.With producer prices in February higher than expected (up 0.3% month over month vs. the Econoday estimate for a 0.1% lift), the market will focus on whether the Fed shows more concern about inflation, which could lead to a quickened rebound in interest rates.On Dec. 15, the Fed raised short-term interest rates for only the second time in two years, sending the rate that large lenders get charged for overnight loans to a target rate of 0.5%-to-0.75%.Meanwhile, oil prices continued to fall as there appears no relief in the bulging supplies seen in the U.S.April-delivery West Texas Intermediate futures slumped more than 1.4% to $47.70 a barrel. Oil is in correction mode, now having sunk as much as 12% below the Feb. 23 high of $54.45.The Dow Jones industrial average is seeing the smallest decline among the major indexes, down just 0.2%, as strength in Apple (AAPL) and a solid 0.7% gain to 112.31 by entertainment titan Walt Disney (DIS) helped buffer the slide. Disney has built a superlong saucer with handle and is effectively breaking out past a new buy point of 112.09, 10 cents above the handle's high of 119.99.Near the session close, the Nasdaq fell 0.3%, as did the S&P 500, while the small-cap S&P 600 lost almost 0.5% and the Russell 2000 nearly 0.6%. Volume cooled off in the final hour yet appeared to still rise on the NYSE vs. the same time Monday and was lower on the Nasdaq.IBD's TAKE: Learn more about the saucer with handle base, a moneymaker for patient growth investors, by reading this Investor's Corner column by markets writer Paul Whitfield.Returning back to the Dow-30 components, IBM (IBM) is down 0.4% to 175.75. While volume is running more than 30% lighter than normal, shares are now testing buying support at the critical 50-day moving average near 175.37, which has been rising since the fourth quarter of last year.You'd prefer to see a stock not only rise, but keep an air pocket above its 50-day moving average. Big Blue is testing the 50-day line for the first time since clearing a four-month flat base at 165.05 in early December.That flat base could be seen as the finishing touch on a monster-size bottoming-base pattern that began after IBM peaked at 215.90 in 2013.IBM's fourth-quarter earnings rose 4% to $5.01 a share, breaking a six-quarter spell of shrinking profits. Revenue dipped 1%. However, IBM's net margin improved to 21.9% from 21.3% in the year-ago quarter.IBM earns a mediocre 60 Composite Rating by IBD Stock Checkup, just 20th best within the Computer-Tech Services industry group. Topping the industry group are CDK Global (CDK) (93 Composite out of a maximum 99) and CDW (CDW) (92 Comp).Fellow Dow industrials component Intel (INTC) pierced its 200-day moving average but recouped most of its early losses, down just 0.06 to 35.10. Watch to see if the 200-day line also acts as a floor of support.Intel shares have slumped after its decision to pay $15 billion to acquire the advanced driver assistance tech expert Mobileye (MBLY) of Israel. On Jan. 24, Intel broke out of a 15-week cup with handle at 37.44, but the rally lasted just four days and the breakout gain was limited to just 3%.A drop to 34.44 would mean Intel has fallen 8% from that precise entry, triggering the golden rule of selling.Apple, meanwhile, is holding steady after rising more than 18% past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point. Apple cleared this new base on Jan. 6-9 and has led its own 50-day moving average sharply higher.While shareholders who bought Apple at the first cup-with-handle breakout at 110.33 on Sept. 14 could decide to sell shares now, based on IBD's ""sell on the way up"" technique by taking gains at 20% to 25%, the excellent relative strength, low volume in recent down days, and prospects for a continued rebound in fundamentals serve as sound reasons to keep holding with conviction.A potential sell target for Apple would be if the stock were to reach a 30% to 40% gain from that bottoming-base breakout at 110.33, or 143.43 to 154.46.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Is It Time To Take Profits In Apple?Why The Bottoming Base Pattern Matters For Stock Investors TodayThe Bottoming Base, Part II: How Apple Formed One During The 2009 Market BottomWhen To Sell A Stock: Learn Key IBD Sell Rules Based On The Facts, Not OpinionsIBD News Coverage: Why Walt Disney Got An Upgrade From Wall Street

335,UNH,"If there's one thing that Republicans agree on about health insurance, it's that the federal government shouldn't tell people what kind of insurance they can buy. The seemingly ironclad GOP principle is that people should be able to buy the kind of coverage they want.So one of the most curious aspects of House Speaker Paul Ryan's new American Health Care Act is that it limits ""eligible health insurance"" to plans that provide ObamaCare's list of essential benefits. It is even more curious because, as Washington and Lee School of Law Professor Timothy Jost notes in his Health Affairs write-up, the original leaked version of the House plan eliminated federal benefit requirements.Here's the puzzle: If House GOP leaders are trying to keep conservatives on board with their ObamaCare repeal plan, why would Ryan add back this provision that would only appeal to Democrats?IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.One possible reason for the change is that the Congressional Budget Office has said that it won't count anything but major medical coverage in figuring how many people are insured under an ObamaCare replacement. That means that lifting restrictions on what kind of insurance is acceptable might make insurance coverage losses under Ryan's plan look worse. It's possible that Ryan made the change, reinstating essential benefits, to get a better score from the CBO on the plan's coverage impact.The other possibility has to do with budget scoring. The decision to preserve ObamaCare's coverage restrictions may go a very long way in lowering the cost of providing subsidies under the American Health Care Act. That's because, realistically, the only way that most low-income shoppers would be able to use their much smaller tax subsidy under the GOP plan would be to buy low-value insurance that isn't available under ObamaCare and won't protect them from a real health emergency.Already, there are an estimated 6 million uninsured who are leaving their ObamaCare subsidies on the table. Despite the risk of paying an individual fine for going without coverage, many people have spurned bronze plans that carry $6,000-$7,150 deductibles, contributing to a spike in premiums and leading insurers including Humana (HUM), Aetna (AET) and UnitedHealth (UNH) to exit most of their exchange markets.Standard & Poor's estimates that Ryan's new health plan will increase the ranks of the uninsured by 6 million to 10 million. On the low end, including the 6 million subsidy-eligible uninsured under ObamaCare, Ryan's subsidies might go unclaimed by 12 million people. With subsidies ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year, taking the midpoint as a rough average, that's $36 billion in unused subsidies each year.""Decreasing tax credits for low-income people without changing benefit requirements will lead to a substantial reduction in enrollment and takeup of the subsidies,"" said Larry Levitt, health policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation.Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, chairman of the Freedom Caucus of conservative lawmakers, told the Washington Post that Ryan's replacement for ObamaCare amounted to ""subsidies for unaffordable health care, subsidies for unaffordable premiums — not just policies that Republicans had opposed, but policies voters would reject.""If the essential benefits requirements were axed, health policy experts believe that insurers would inevitably offer people coverage that costs no more than the value of their tax credit under the GOP plan. As the CBO notes, ""low-income people might prefer coverage for preventive services and routine physicians' visits to keep their monthly expenses low, even if such a policy did not cover more costly services such as hospital care."" In other words, people would find a way to use their tax credits, even if they couldn't afford to buy very much.That's exactly what Ryan outlined in his Better Way policy paper last summer: ""The new fixed credit would be large enough to purchase the typical pre-Obamacare health insurance plan."" And if people choose to buy insurance that costs even less than their credit, presumably even the barest bones insurance imaginable, ""the difference would be deposited into an HSA-like account.""That latter feature — being allowed to keep tax credits in excess of premiums — is part of Ryan's new bill, but that won't do anything to help low-income people who won't be able to afford any insurance on offer.Ryan's age-based tax credits — a sharp departure from ObamaCare's design that provides the most help to lower-income and older adults — would replace a modified system of subsidies starting in 2020. Because legislation's budget impact is scored over a decade, the new subsidies would be in force for seven of those years during which uninsured Americans could leave roughly $250 billion on the table. That's more than 40% of the cost of the $600 billion in tax cuts that Ryan's bill would provide.RELATED:Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesHow To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social SecurityThe House GOP ObamaCare Repeal And Replace Plan: 7 Key PointsThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

336,UNH,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were flat to slightly higher early Friday morning as White House aides told GOP lawmakers that President Trump is done negotiating and wants a House vote on the ObamaCare replacement bill on Friday.It could be a key day for bank stocks such as Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Dow components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS).But big-cap techs Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) face key technical tests. All five are big S&P 500 index stocks.Dow industrials futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 index futures climbed less than 0.1% above fair value while Nasdaq 100 futures were break-even. All were off late Thursday highs.During Thursday stock market trading, the Dow Jones industrial average erased intraday gains and closed just below break-even  after the House delayed a planned Thursday evening vote due to a lack of support. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite fell 0.1%.It's unclear if the House actually will vote Friday, especially if the American Health Care Act lacks sufficient support.Markets are worried that a health care defeat could derail Trump's tax cuts and other pro-growth agenda items. That's what triggered Tuesday's big stock losses. But some analysts argue that a quick American Health Care Act defeat could speed up tax cuts.The CBOE Volatility Index, the market's so-called fear gauge, hit a 2017 high on Thursday. But that's a little like saying Shaquille O'Neal is having a career year for making free throws — it's not that high. The ""VIX"" has been trading near excessive bullish levels for months.Bank stocks were searching for direction. Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs clung to slim gains Thursday, while JPMorgan and Wells Fargo (WFC) edged lower. But all are trading below their 50-day moving averages after losing that key support line in recent days.Alphabet also undercut its 50-day line Thursday, as its YouTube advertising woes are becoming a real problem. The stock fell 1.3% to 839.65. It's down nearly 4% this week, dropping below an 867.10 buy point along the way. Google's parent had climbed for nine straight sessions before that, setting a record high last Friday.Meanwhile, Netflix and Amazon are on the other side of the 50-day and 10-week lines, looking to find support there. Netflix has been rebounding from its 10-week line for a while, creating an alternative buy point around 140.Amazon fell 0.1% to 847.38, continuing a four-weeks-tight pattern with an 860.96 entry. Amazon is still in range from a prior 821.75 buy point.Hospital stocks and health insurers are among those most affected by the GOP health plans. But hospital stocks have been on the sick list for some time, while Medicaid-focused insurers such as Molina (MOH) also have struggled. Keep an eye on health insurer giants such as UnitedHealth (UNH). UnitedHealth has fallen for six straight sessions, closing Thursday at 165.29. That's pulling back to a 164.10 buy point as well as its 50-day line.Japan's Nikkei rose 0.8% intraday as the yen dropped against the dollar for the first time in several days.

337,UNH,"House Republicans introduced their proposal for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, with age-based tax credits at its centerpiece. The legislation would also eliminate the individual and employer mandates as well as expand health savings accounts.The legislation is the GOP's biggest effort yet to remake the health care system, one that could have an impact on a wide variety of industries, from health insurance to hospitals and drugmakers. But shares of companies such as UnitedHealth (UNH), Pfizer (PFE), and Tenet Healthcare (THC) seemed little changed late Monday. (UnitedHealth and Pfizer are both on the Dow Jones industrial average.)Republicans would offer tax credits that are based on age, not income-based as they are for the ObamaCare exchanges. But they would be phased out starting with individuals earning more than $75,000 and for households making over $150,000. There would be no credits for individuals earning more than $215,000.The legislation would keep the Medicaid expansion program running until 2020. As of Jan. 1, 2020, rolls would be frozen and Medicaid would be funded on a per capita basis vs. the fee-for-service model.Plan repeals ObamaCare taxes on upper-income earners, capital gains, insurance plans and medical device manufacturers. It would not tax employer-based coverage, as an earlier version had proposed. It does keep the ""Cadillac Tax"" on high-end insurance plans, but would delay implementing it until 2025.The legislation would keep the ban on denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. It would repeal the individual mandate to get insurance, but would charge those who don't keep continuous coverage a one-time renewal fee of up to 30% more. The plan would also eliminate the employer mandate to provide coverage.The GOP bill would expand the annual contribution limit on health savings accounts tied with high-deductible insurance plans to $6,550 for an individual or $13,100 for a family. Health Equity (HQY), a major pure-play HSA provider, rose 1.5% in late trading.The plan also would bar federal funding for Planned Parenthood. That provision could run afoul of some GOP senators.Republicans do not say how many people would likely add or lose coverage as a result of the plan. The Congressional Budget Office has not released any estimates on costs.The House Republican plan is currently in two bills, one from the Energy and Commerce Committee and one from the Ways and Means Committee.It's unclear if President Trump backs the legislation or whether the plan could win support in Congress, especially in the Senate.RELATED:How To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social Security

338,UNH,"The Republican plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare was finally unveiled late Monday, and analysts say it could lead to big drops in the number of insured.Under the proposed changes, 6 million-10 million Americans could lose coverage, according to estimates from S&P Global Ratings.Yet investors apparently saw little to fear from the House GOP plan that President Trump hailed as ""wonderful."" Among insurers with a big presence on the exchanges, Anthem (ANTM) closed 0.1% higher on the stock market today, while Centene (CNC) slipped 0.6% and Molina (MOH) fell 1.6%.The Dow Jones industrial average, Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index closed down.Anthem, Centene and Molina, along with Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH), also compete in the Medicaid managed care business and have profited from ObamaCare's expansion of the program for the poor and near-poor. UnitedHealth shares fell 0.2%.Hospital stocks did see a downdraft on Tuesday, with Tenet Healthcare (THC) tumbling 7.1%. But Universal Health Services (UHS) fell a more-modest 2.2% and HCA Holdings (HCA) shed 1.3%.Given the substantial future curtailment of government funding for health coverage built into the GOP plan, one might have expected more jarring losses. Insurers will no longer stand to benefit from ObamaCare's individual and employer mandates, which would be repealed.The House plan also would revive the so-called Cadillac tax on expensive health insurance plans in 2025, with a 40% tax on insurance the exceeds a certain cost threshold. Meanwhile, the rate of growth of Medicaid spending would be curtailed to the rate of the consumer price index for medical care, down one percentage point from a preliminary version of the House bill.So why are investors taking things more or less in stride? Here are three likely reasons:1) The chances of the bill ever becoming law appear to be fairly small. Both the relatively moderate and conservative wings of the GOP have signaled problems with the House approach. It's far from clear that the Ryan and Trump plan to thread the needle.IBD'S TAKE: The fight over ObamaCare is likely to increase doubts about President Trump's ability to enact the rest of his economic agenda including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. 2) For the insurers on the ObamaCare exchanges, the GOP changes might actually stabilize things in the near term, since the bill would lower the cost of coverage for younger adults and raise it for older adults.3) The House bill keeps the Medicaid expansion intact through 2020 and only gradually phases it out afterward. While the long run matters, investors are generally more focused on earnings within the next several years. That makes sense, given uncertainty about what Washington will do. Further, the House bill would restore government funds for hospitals that treat a disproportionate share of indigent patients.RELATED:The House GOP ObamaCare Repeal And Replace Plan: 7 Key PointsHow To Replace ObamaCare And Save Social SecuritySupernus, Valeant, Endo Stocks Lose Big After Trump Drug-Pricing TweetThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

"
340,UNH,"President Trump in a Tuesday tweet embraced the new House plan to repeal and replace much of ObamaCare as his own.In doing so, Trump has launched what is likely to be a tumultuous phase of his presidency that threatens to sidetrack the rest of his economic agenda.""Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster — is imploding fast!""While Trump may overstate just how fragile the ObamaCare exchanges are, there's little question that the GOP has to act fast to avoid an exodus by insurers waiting for clarity about the rules for 2018 ahead of a June deadline to set premiums. Humana (HUM) has already said it will exit the exchanges in 2018, while Aetna (AET) and Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) have one foot out the door, and Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH) won't commit to sticking around.Trump promised throughout his campaign that he would ""take care of everybody."" Speaking before Congress last week, he vowed that his plan would ""bring cost way down and provide far better care.""""Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.""Yet the gap between those promises and the American Health Care Act legislation unveiled by House Republicans on Monday appears to be massive. A better read on the consequences of the bill will be available when the Congressional Budget Office weighs in, but analysts on the center-left and right are estimating that TrumpCare would reduce the ranks of the insured by 15 million to 20 million.The coverage losses would result from dramatically shrinking the subsidies available for older adults and lower-income Americans to buy coverage, phasing out ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion starting in 2020 and repealing ObamaCare's individual and employer mandates.So far, the Republican plan has managed to unite the left, center and right in opposition, though for disparate reasons.Some people who don't get a very good deal from the exchanges today would be better off under TrumpCare, which replaces ObamaCare's income-based subsidies with tax credits that vary only based on age. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a 27-year-old earning $40,000 would get a $100 subsidy from ObamaCare but a $2,000 subsidy from TrumpCare in 2020.Young adults with moderate incomes, many of whom have shunned ObamaCare plans despite the individual mandate penalty, also would benefit from the GOP's lifting of restrictions on how much insurers can charge older adults. Now, insurers on the exchange can only charge a 64-year-old three times as much as a 21-year-old, but Republicans would lift that restriction, raising premiums for older adults and lowering them for young adults.Some in the middle class who don't get any subsidies would be better off too. A 40-year-old earning $75,000 would get nothing from ObamaCare, but a $3,000 subsidy from TrumpCare.Yet the gains in coverage for those who get a better deal would likely be swamped by coverage losses, a range of analysts across the ideological spectrum have concluded. One reason is the replacement, with a relatively minor late-enrollment penalty, of ObamaCare's penalty for not buying coverage. People who let their coverage lapse would have to pay insurers a one-time penalty equal to 30% of annual premiums in the year they renew coverage, even if they go without coverage for a decade or more.Another reason for the expected rise in the uninsured is that many people might not be able to afford to take advantage of the subsidies under TrumpCare. Here's why, using the stark example of a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level, or about $25,500 in 2020:For this older couple, a silver-level ObamaCare plan would cost roughly $1,150, with maximum out-of-pocket costs likely limited to about $2,000 to $3,000, an IBD analysis finds. Under TrumpCare, the same plan would likely cost the couple between $15,000 and $20,000 in premiums, after subsidies. The increase reflects much smaller subsidies and a roughly 16% increase in premiums due to TrumpCare's age-rating change. The wide range also reflects uncertainty over how states would deploy the extra ""stability"" funds in the Republican plan, with the low end of the range assuming that the entire sum would go to help low-income insurance shoppers attain more comprehensive coverage.IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.One likely red flag for a couple of GOP senators is that TrumpCare's subsidies don't vary according to geography, even though health insurance costs can vary widely by state and county. For example, the lowest-cost ObamaCare bronze premium this year averages $272 per month in the biggest metropolitan area of each state using the HealthCare.gov platform. But the lowest bronze plan in Alaska costs $626 before subsidies, while the cheapest plan in West Virginia costs $332.Not surprisingly, perhaps, Republicans Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia are seen as among the most likely to vote against repeal. Both senators, along with Rob Portman of Ohio and Cory Gardner of Colorado, warned in a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday that they won't support a bill that ""does not meet the test of stability for individuals currently enrolled"" in ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion.It's not clear if they'll be won over by the House provision that would grandfather people who enroll in the Medicaid expansion through the end of 2019. After that, the GOP would stop covering 90% of costs for new enrollees, so states would likely change the parameters of the program, shifting newcomers to the federal tax credits under TrumpCare.One negative fallout of that grandfathering provision is that people may be even more determined to hang onto their Medicaid coverage, or else they'll face an extremely hard time affording coverage in the individual market. Ironically, these are the kind of work disincentives that have led the GOP to oppose ObamaCare's income-based subsidies in the first place.Legislative prospects would look somewhat better for TrumpCare if it were only centrist Republicans on the fence, but conservative groups are coming out in opposition too, such the Heritage Foundation and the Club for Growth. The Club for Growth warned on Tuesday, ""If this warmed-over substitute for government-run health care remains unchanged, the Club for Growth will key vote against it.""RELATED:The House GOP ObamaCare Repeal And Replace Plan: 7 Key PointsTrump, GOP Will Create New ObamaCare Winners, LosersThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

After clearing a flat-base entry at 160.17 in early February, shares are now 14% extended. But on Thursday, the stock reversed lower off a new all-time high in above average volume, which could be a bearish signal.Apple (AAPL) is continuing to power higher with the strong market uptrend, and is now 18% extended past its 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point. That's near the 20% profit-taking zone. But watch for continued resistance around the 140 price level.Meanwhile, UnitedHealth (UNH) is back in buy range after an ugly gap-down in heavy volume on Feb. 17 sent shares below the 50-day line. But the stock has since recovered and is now tracking above a 164.10 entry.And financial stocks, considered one of the biggest ""Trump trades"" since the election, are still hot.

342,UNH,"Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) stock seesawed Wednesday after the biotech guided to north of $80 million in 2017 sales for its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug Exondys 51, lagging Wall Street estimates by 40%.Sarepta stock was up and down a couple times on the stock market today, but it ended the session down 2.4%, at 30.38. Shares hit a 14-year high above 63 in September when the FDA approved Exondys 51, but are down more than 50% since then and now trade below both their 50-day and 200-day moving averages.The FDA's approval of Exondys 51 was met with widespread disapproval as payors like Anthem (ANTM), Humana (HUM) and United Healthcare (UNH) have pushed back against covering the costly drug, with doubts as to its efficacy. Analysts note the Duchenne market is small, in the thousands of patients.For the first quarter, Sarepta guided to $13 million to $15 million in Exondys 51 sales, in a late Tuesday conference call with analysts. Sales would accelerate from $5.4 million in the fourth quarter, when Exondys 51 had been on the market for about a month.IBD'S TAKE: For the best among biotechs, Incyte has a slew of potential blockbusters, analysts say. Head to The New America for more on the company.Analysts had broadly expected $14.9 million in first-quarter sales of Exondys 51, Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz wrote in a research note, cutting his price target on Sarepta stock to 27 from 32. He still has a market perform rating on shares.""Therefore, it comes as a negative surprise that management expects just $13 million to $15 million in revenue in Q1,"" he wrote in a note. ""This leaves us to wonder whether compliance, discontinuations and/or slower new patient adds are contributing to the shortfall.""Guidance for 2017 Exondys 51 sales was more disappointing. For the year, Sarepta guided to more than $80 million. RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis says the guidance is overly conservative. Exondys 51 has a monopoly on a market with a significant unmet medical need, he wrote.""The debate of whether the drug works or not is irrelevant at this point; the FDA has put the drug on the market,"" he wrote in a report. In the long run, payors will likely reimburse Exondys 51 ""after exhausting their usual tactics of placing obstacles and buying as much time as possible.""Simeonidis cut his price target on Sarepta stock to 91 from 98 to reflect the updated financials, guidance and Sarepta's sale of its rare pediatric disease priority review voucher to Gilead Sciences (GILD) in a $125 million deal.Needham analyst Chad Messer cut his 2017 Exondys 51 sales expectations to $109 million from $183 million. He also lowered his price target on Sarepta stock to 75 from 78, though kept his outperform rating.""We stress that this is simply a change in the slope of the ramp, not a change in peak estimates,"" he wrote in a research report. ""We still believe a majority of the about 1,400 Duchenne muscular dystrophy boys in the U.S. will ultimately be on therapy.""Messer expects broad adoption to occur in the second half of 2018 as opposed to his earlier view for year's end 2017.RELATED:Sarepta Muscular Dystrophy Drug Interrupts 5-Day Biotech SlumpAnthem, Humana, United Pack Back On Sarepta's FDA-Approved DMD DrugSarepta's Costly Muscular Dystrophy Drug Flirts With Big Pharma M&A

346,UNH,"LAS VEGAS – Wearable fitness tracker maker Fitbit (FIT) is looking to get people exercising more using financial incentives and gameplay, Fitbit CEO James Park told IBD at CES 2017, the annual consumer electronics show.Fitbit has accomplished a lot by providing users of its devices with automated words of encouragement and vibrations for reaching activity goals, such as 10,000 daily steps. But now it is looking for ways to get people moving by providing tangible benefits.For instance, Fitbit is participating in a wellness program offered by UnitedHealth (UNH) that gives members up to $4 a day in rewards for meeting activity goals.Participants can earn up to $1,500 a year in Health Savings Account (HSA) or Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) credits. And employers can obtain premium savings based on participants' combined results.IBD'S TAKE: CES is the tech industry's biggest show by far in the U.S., providing a start-of-the-year way to gauge what's ahead on the tech front, and IBD, as always, was there with print and video coverage of CES 2017.Fitbit is offering a customized Fitbit Charge 2 wristband for UnitedHealthcare Motion program participants.The Motion program ""is the first insurance company initiative … where people are being paid money for physical activity,"" Park said Friday. ""That's a big step forward.""The program marks a ""pivotal moment in the health care insurance industry,"" Park said. ""We anticipate that other insurers will look at the details of this partnership and announcement to figure out what their play is.""In November, Fitbit announced a partnership with Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) involving its ""NBA 2K17"" basketball video game. Players who achieve 10,000 steps in a day tracked with their Fitbit device will receive a temporary attribute boost to their MyPlayer in ""NBA 2K17,"" enhancing their character's performance in the game.Park said he hopes to see more Fitbit partnerships with game companies in the future.Providing incentives is a good way to prod people to be more active, Park said.""Fitness and health a lot of times is really tedious for people and so there's a lot of different motivations – gamification is one, incentives are another, support of the community is a third,"" he said.Among the software updates Fitbit announced for its devices at CES is a Community feature. That feature allows users to share more activity accomplishments on Facebook (FB) and Instagram and connect with friends and groups for added support and inspiration.Fitbit stock was down 1.4% to close at 7.79 on the stock market today, and amid ever tougher competition it's been trading below 10 for two months.RELATED:Winners And Losers From CES 2017: Nvidia, Amazon, Apple, Qualcomm

351,UNH,"A key House committee has proposed delaying any changes in Medicaid funding until 2020 to win over moderate Republicans as the effort to repeal and replace the major parts of ObamaCare runs into trouble.Although the ability of Republicans to bridge a wide divide between moderates and conservatives still looks iffy, especially in the Senate, the signal of retreat on Medicaid cuts had the health care sector breathing a sigh of relief.While the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite were slightly negative as of early afternoon in the stock market today, health stocks were mostly higher.Among hospitals, HCA Holdings (HCA) closed up 1.4% at 88.53, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) jumped 10% to 20.99 and Universal Health Services (UHS) gained 2.2% to 125.58.Among insurers, Molina Healthcare (MOH) was unchanged at 49.99, and Aetna (AET) climbed 0.9% to 130.69, while Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) edged up 0.5% 168.20.Drugmakers, which also have benefited from President Trump backing away from earlier threats of an intervention to bring down the high cost of prescriptions, were mixed. Dow component Merck (MRK) rose 0.8%, but Pfizer (PFE), another Dow member, ended flat.IBD'S TAKE: The difficulty of Republicans in settling on a replacement for ObamaCare is threatening to sidetrack the rest of President Trump's economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending.The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which plays a key role in shaping health reform, will release a plan next week maintaining Medicaid funding levels until 2020, before cuts would take effect, the Wall Street Journal reported.The retreat by the House comes as GOP governors have been making their voices heard about preserving ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who has embraced the Medicaid expansion, met with Trump a week ago and has been among the leaders of the effort.RELATED:Biotechs Leap On Trump's Calls For Innovation, Speedy FDA ApprovalTrump's Big Speech Leaves Investors With Hope, Not Much Else

352,UNH,"The stock market behaved generally fine Thursday, one day after a rousing post-Fed rally that saw the major indexes climb between 0.5% and 1%. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.2% at 20,906, following a 0.5% advance Wednesday after the Federal Reserve hiked short-term interest rates by a quarter-point.The Nasdaq composite, beaming from a 0.7% rebound, was off just 0.1% with less than an hour to go in Thursday's trading session. The S&P 500 edged nearly 0.3% lower; the Russell 2000, Wednesday's big winner with a 1.5% splash higher, added 0.1%.Notice on a daily chart how the Russell 2000 also hoisted itself back above the 50-day moving average, a positive sign for a market uptrend that got triggered by a Day Three follow-through on June 30 last year.IBD's TAKE: To monitor these extremely critical junctures in the market, please read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to learn the concept of follow-throughs at market bottoms and heavy distribution at market tops.Meanwhile, big and megacap stocks, as viewed from the prism of the 30-member Dow Jones industrial average, continue to perform well and underscore the argument for favoring equities over bonds.While long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds in fact rose in price on Wednesday, following strong hints from the U.S. central bank that it desires to raise interest rates cautiously, rather than aggressively, the plain fact remains: The 2.51% yield on the 10-year bond still is inferior to the earnings yield of greater than 5% for S&P 500 companies.The earnings yield compares the current level of the S&P 500 with Wall Street's expectations for earnings over the next 12 months.In the Dow, companies such as Goldman Sachs (GS), Boeing (BA), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), DuPont (DD), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Visa (V) and Microsoft (MSFT) are showing relative strength in the market. That is, all seven of these firms hold decent IBD Relative Price Strength ratings that range from 69 (Microsoft) to 87 (Goldman).An 87 RS Rating means that Goldman is outperforming 87% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.(Please see the RS Rating of any stock by using IBD's premier time-saving tool, Stock Checkup).From a chart perspective, Goldman has been acting fabulously since it broke out past a 172.52 buy point within a long bottoming-base structure back in the fourth quarter of 2016.Notice how the expert in fixed income and commodities trading, and money center bank for large corporations, has found nice support during tests of the 50-day moving average. At its recent peak of 255.15, Goldman has risen as much as 47%.Wall Street sees Goldman's revenue slipping 12% in 2017 to $33.22 billion; however, earnings are seen rising 17% to $19.14 a share, following a disppointing 11% drop in 2016. And the Street also sees 2018 profit rising 13% to $21.63 a share.Boeing (89 Composite Rating at Stock Checkup; 93 Earnings Per Share Rating; FY 2017 EPS estimate +28%) also poses as a top-flight Trump-bump play, rising long before President Trump's unveiling on Wednesday of a budget that emphasizes the rebuilding of the U.S. military.Boeing shares are down just fractionally and not far off an all-time high of 185.71, up 33% past an aircraft carrier-sized saucer-base buy point of 139.55.UnitedHealth, Cisco and Microsoft have also performed well since their recent breakouts.UnitedHealth, the managed health care insurance giant, spent just three days below the 50-day moving average during a brief hiccup of a decline from Feb. 17 to 21. Shares, down roughly 0.6% to 170.87, are up 20% past a 141.88 early buy point within a 13-week flat base.That flat base formed from July 20 to Oct. 17 of last year. One could have waited for the stock to move more than 10 cents past the base's left-side high of 144.48.On Nov. 9, notice on a daily chart how UnitedHealth tested shareholders' resolve with a wild session, falling as much as 4.7% to a session low of 136.22. Yet, that price did not trigger the golden rule of selling.Visa is up nearly 10% since clearing an 82.59 entry in a shallow saucer-with-handle base Jan. 24. Notice how the volume on that breakout day was watery thin, 21% below its 50-day average volume. The stock didn't make much headway, and soon tested that 82.59 buy point.Yet no sell signal was triggered. After a breakout, you only sell when the stock falls 7% to 8% below the proper entry in a good base.However, demand exploded for shares after the global consumer spending play gapped up 4.6% on Feb. 3, a day after Visa reported a 25% jump in fiscal Q1 adjusted profit, nearly matching the prior quarter's EPS gain of 26%. Q1 revenue surged 25% to $4.46 billion, the highest in more than four years.RELATED:How To Trade Snap: Why This New Stock Could Test Its IPO PriceStock Market Today: Why Are Homebuilders Leading The Market Upside?Stock Market Today: Should You Sell These 7 Stocks In The Dow Industrials?How To Invest: Why The Bottoming Base Pattern Matters For Investors TodayHow To Invest: Timeless Tips Of Stock Wisdom From a Wall Street Great

Volume fell modestly across the board vs. the same time on Tuesday.Among the Dow industrials, UnitedHealth (UNH) and Caterpillar (CAT) paced the leaders with gains of just above 1% gains, while global banks JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) moved up 1% apiece.On the downside, Intel (INTC) continued to slide since announcing the acquisition of Mobileye (MBLY). Shares fell 0.7%. Analysts are concerned about the hefty $15 billion price tag. On Wednesday morning, Credit Suisse downgraded Intel to neutral from outperform, while lowering its price target to 35 from 45.Electric auto maker Tesla (TSLA) fell nearly 1% in the stock market today. On Tuesday, the stock jumped almost 5% on a report that the company was planning to launch a small SUV in 2018. Shares reclaimed the 50-day moving average in heavy volume Tuesday.Market leader Apple (AAPL) inched up 0.7% after receiving a price target hike. The iPhone maker's price target was raised to 155 from 140 by RBC Capital on expected increased strength in Apple's services business.Among other price-target changes, Netflix's (NFLX) target was raised to 135 from 95, while its stock was upgraded to hold from underperform by Jefferies.Nvidia (NVDA) edged higher after Bosch, a German technology company, said it had partnered with Nvidia to develop self-driving systems. Nvidia will provide the chip for the system.Among leading growth stocks, Nutrisystem (NTRI) and HealthEquity (HQY) led the IBD 50 higher, while leading China-based companies underperformed.Nutrisystem jumped 3.5% to notch a new 52-week high. Today's gain comes after the 18% rise when the company surged past earnings estimates on Feb. 27. HealthEquity traded up nearly 3% as it builds the right side of a potential base. After spending several weeks consolidating under the 50-day line, the HSA leader has reclaimed that key support level.On the downside, Alibaba (BABA) fell further under its 104.67 cup-with-handle buy point in early trading. Shares were down 1.3%.

355,UNH,"Stocks expanded their midday gains Wednesday after the Federal Reserve, as expected, hiked short-term interest rates by a quarter-point but hinted that it would continue to act prudently before engaging in further increases in the cost of money.Meanwhile, oil stocks got a much needed lift after getting slammed in recent days as crude oil futures rallied. West Texas Intermediate futures rose more than 2%, to $48.79 a barrel. Meanwhile, the metals, medical, heavy industrial and transport sectors also showed resilience.For instance, airline industry leader Southwest Air (LUV) is halting a seven-session losing streak and reversed off its lows, with a 2% gain, to 53.90, in fast turnover. Watch to see if the consumer- and business-spending play can climb back above its 50-day moving average. Shares are still up 8% year to date, better than the S&P 500's roughly 6% advance. Randgold Resources (GOLD) surged 3.3%, to 86.97, and is trying to retake its 50-day line. AngloGold Ashanti (AU) jumped 7.1%, to 10.54, but remains far depressed from its 52-week highs.Meanwhile, in the steel sector, Leaderboard name and industry top dog Nucor (NUE) rallied more than 3%, to 62.72, in low volume; watch to see if it can keep climbing and pierce through the top of its three-week handle with a 65.50 buy point.Nucor is seen growing Q1 profit by 230%, to 76 cents a share. Earnings have rebounded 28%, 43%, 144% and 63% vs. year-ago levels in the prior four quarters. A fifth sector, banking, is also regaining some lost ground; Bank of New York Mellon (BK) rose 0.6%, to 48.56, and is close to surpassing a 48.88 buy point within a nine-week cup-with-handle pattern.Small-cap issues are leading the stock market today with the Russell 2000 up 1.2%, vs. a 0.6% lift by the Nasdaq composite and 0.7% for the S&P 500.The Dow Jones industrials lagged, up 0.4%, but at least five of the 30 components rose at least 1 point or more, including Caterpillar (CAT), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and United Technologies (UTX).  J&J has cleared a 122.60 early buy point within its long saucer construction. The left-side high of 126.07 also offers an entry point at 10 cents above that price.J&J has now risen slightly more than 5% past the early buy point. Be sure not to chase breakout stocks more than 5% past the proper entry. The reason: often a stock will pull back and try to shake out weak holders as it test support at or near the proper entry. IBD founder Bill O'Neil's study of the greatest market winners found that rarely does a leading stock market winner fall more than 7%-8% below the proper buy point in a cup, double bottom, flat base or other bullish pattern before a stock charges to new highs.Notice how, on the weekly chart, in six straight prior up weeks, J&J rose in above-average turnover in five of those weeks. That bodes well for the diversified medical products giant as it indicates surging demand for shares by mutual funds, hedge funds, insurers, banks and the like. J&J's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is now a sprightly A-; the proprietary grade goes from E (heavy distribution) to A+ (heavy accumulation).J&J's 66 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 relects the big cap's long basing action and is sharply improved from as low as 26 just eight weeks ago. Among small and mid-cap names, focus on those with RS ratings of 80 or higher before they break out.Even with the move by the Fed to increase the fed funds rate to a 0.75%-1% target range, observers applauded the U.S. central bank's decision to maintain a careful and gradual approach to ""normalizing"" the bond markets.""The weaker dollar itself is a reflection of the Fed's policy path,"" Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, told IBD. ""Markets see the Fed keeping a lid on the dollar and providing a bid for U.S. exporters, commodities and emerging markets.""The U.S. dollar fell against both the euro and the Japanese yen.In the meantime, keep an eye out for the reaction by European equity markets on Wednesday's Dutch elections, which are being perceived as a test of Europeans' tolerance of immigrants, particularly from the Middle East. The Dutch elections could also have ramifications for the future of the eurozone. In June last year, Britons shocked the world by voting to leave the single-currency region.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Should You Sell These 7 Dow Industrials Components Now?How To Invest: Why The Base-On-Base Pattern Makes Money For InvestorsThe Top Market Sectors Today: See IBD's Smart Research Tables

356,UNH,"The reviews for President Trump's speech to Congress were strongly positive, from pundits, the public and, so far, investors. But does the speech really matter.The Dow Jones industrial average soared above 21,000 for the first time at Wednesday's opening bell, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also jumping to record highs. On Tuesday, the Dow industrials slipped 0.1% to end a string of 12 straight gains, while the S&P 500 index dipped 0.3%, the Nasdaq composite 0.6% and the small-cap Russell 2000 1.5%.If Trump is right that the stock market's impressive rise since his election has been driven by his policies, then what he didn't say in his speech matters a whole lot more than anything he did say. (Some of Wednesday's early gains may reflect shifting views and Treasury yields regarding a possible Federal Reserve rate hike at the March 14-15 meeting.)He didn't say how he would pay for or when he would advance his trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, a potential boon to Caterpillar (CAT), steel makers like U.S. Steel (X) and Nucor (NUE), engineering and construction firms like Fluor (FLR) and construction aggregates suppliers like Vulcan Materials (VMC). Could last week's report that the plan will be delayed until 2018 be true? Not clear, but there's more reason to think so after Tuesday night.However, Nucor, U.S. Steel, Vulcan Materials, Caterpillar and Fluor were up 2%-3% in morning action.In any event, there appears to be a logjam of contentious issues blocking the road to more spending on highways and bridges. Trump managed to successfully turn the page after a rocky first five weeks in office in part because he stayed above the fray, declining to take any clear positions on the two issues that could largely determine whether his economic agenda rises or falls: ObamaCare and tax reform.Now he's about to enter a potentially hazardous stretch of his presidency in which he'll have to take firm policy stands that may divide his narrow governing majority in the Senate.On ObamaCare, the issue that Trump said must be addressed before tax reform, the clock is ticking for him to come up with a replacement that can unify Republicans, something that has proved impossible in the seven years since the law's passage. Humana (HUM) has already said it will exit the exchanges in 2018, while Aetna (AET) and Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) have one foot out the door, and Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH) won't commit to sticking around.Shares of UnitedHealth and other health insurers rose 1%-2% intraday.Come April, if Republicans haven't gotten their ducks in a row, insurers faced with setting premiums for 2018 will be in full panic mode and may start to pull the plug on their participation in the exchanges, leaving swaths of the country with no insurers for 2018.IBD'S TAKE: Despite growing doubts about the timing and size of President Trump's tax and spending stimulus plans, markets are pricing in higher odds of the Federal Reserve hiking rates again as early as this month. Tax reform doesn't look to be any easier. Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% or 20%, but the House proposal for doing so depends on raising $1 trillion with a 20% tax on imports that's being fought by Wal-Mart (WMT) and the entire retail sector. Now General Motors (GM) is calling the tax ""problematic,"" and a growing number of GOP senators oppose the idea.Trump stuck to vague generalities in his speech, saying, ""We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers.""Who would oppose that? It's only when he arrives at a plan to pay for it — if not with a border tax then by taking away valued corporate tax subsidies — that the effort will turn into a mud fight.Trump is off to a slow start in clarifying how he will put his economic agenda into action. That's not surprising, because his agenda tackles major problems that have long defied solutions, but it should make investors nervous, regardless of what Trump said last night.RELATED:

"
361,UNH,"Anthem's proposed merger with Cigna would reduce health care competition and raise costs for consumers, U.S. antitrust lawyers will argue Monday when the government goes to court to block the transaction.Their $48 billion merger — the biggest in the history of the American health -insurance industry — would likely give the enlarged company the power to raise prices for insurance, cut payments to doctors and reduce the quality of service, the Justice Department has said in court papers.Anthem (ANTM) counters that by buying Cigna (CI) it would be able to lower reimbursement rates to health care providers. Those savings would be passed on to employers and policyholders, the Indianapolis-based company says.The Justice Department's lawsuit opposing the Anthem-Cigna merger is one of two health care antitrust cases going to trial in the waning days of the Obama administration as it tries to prevent that industry from shrinking to three national carriers from five. The second case, against the $38 billion tie-up of Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), opens before another judge in Washington on Dec. 5. The fifth major carrier, and largest, in the U.S. is UnitedHealth Group (UNH).By challenging the deals earlier this year, President Barack Obama's administration seized an opportunity to further shape the future of health care after passage of the Affordable Care Act.President-elect Donald Trump has said his administration will be more pro-business than his predecessor's, but he has also said he would block AT&T's (T) plan to buy Time Warner (TWX). Trump, who is to take office on Jan. 20, said Friday he would nominate Senator Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. The Alabama Republican doesn't have a clear track record on antitrust issues, leaving his approach to competition preservation unclear.The government said in its complaint that Anthem's deal for Cigna would hurt competition for millions of consumers who receive commercial insurance from national employers as well as large-group employers in at least 35 metropolitan areas, including New York.The run-up to the Anthem-Cigna trial was marked by acrimony between the companies, with each accusing the other of breaching terms of their deal. Cigna stands to collect a $1.85 billion break up fee if the merger is blocked. Last month, the U.S. won an order compelling the companies to turn over written correspondence between the two, which the government argued was relevant to combating the carriers' claims that their combination would create a more efficient company. The U.S. could use those letters as evidence during the trial.""Governance disputes between defendants have escalated, and the firms are now accusing each other of breaching the merger agreement,"" the U.S. said in court papers. ""Because the breach letters reveal the current state of hostility between defendants, the letters evince barriers to integrating these firms and are relevant"" to the defenses raised by the companies.The trial is scheduled to last more than a month, in two phases. In the first, the U.S. will attempt to prove that the combined company would hurt large national employers. The second phase, set to start Dec. 12, will focus on the proposed tie-up's effect on local markets.Backing the Justice Department are 11 states, including New York, California and Connecticut, plus the District of Columbia.Anthem had pushed the judge for a trial scheduled to finish by the end of the year so it has time to get state regulatory approvals by the merger deadline of April 30.
"
362,UNH,"Perhaps no group carries more weight in the health care debate than the American Medical Association, and on Wednesday the physicians group put a big hurdle in front of the Republican plan to quickly repeal ObamaCare and figure out how to replace it later.The doctor's group demanded in a letter that the GOP offer a detailed plan that can be compared to existing law before any vote to repeal large parts of the Affordable Care Act. Further, the AMA called it ""essential that gains in the number of Americans with health insurance coverage be maintained.""While it's not clear whether the Republican-led Congress and President-elect Donald Trump will slow down and detail their ObamaCare replacement plan or charge ahead with a repeal vote as soon as February, some of the stocks that have fared the worst since the election showed signs of life on Wednesday.Members of IBD's Medical-Hospitals group, which had been ranked No. 196 out of 197 based on recent stock-price performance, were big winners Wednesday. Tenet Healthcare (THC) jumped 8.8% to 16.75 on the stock market today, while HCA Holdings (HCA) climbed 3.6% to 77.13.Centene (CNC) and Molina Healthcare (MOH), two beaten-down insurers with major exposure to ObamaCare's exchange business and Medicaid expansion, also rallied. Centene rose 3.3% to 60.25, while Molina perked up 3.6% to 55.52.UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), which have already exited most of the ObamaCare exchange markets where they were doing business, saw more modest gains, rising 0.3% and 0.9%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Read why UnitedHealth is fast becoming the Amazon.com of health care and why it isn't sweating forthcoming policy changes under Donald Trump.Republicans have made clear that they plan to use a procedure known as reconciliation that requires only majority support in the Senate to quickly repeal critical parts of ObamaCare, but keep the law operating for a few years as they design, pass and implement a replacement. Vice President-elect Mike Pence promised an ""orderly transition"" from ObamaCare, with House Speaker Paul Ryan stressing that a priority will be maintaining patient care.Trump, in a Twitter post Wednesday, cautioned Republicans ""to be careful"" about repeal. While Trump has insisted he'll replace the health law with something ""terrific,"" since his election he has hinted that he might keep various provisions.In the letter to leaders of both parties in Congress, the AMA wrote, ""before any action is taken through reconciliation or other means that would potentially alter coverage, policymakers should lay out for the American people, in reasonable detail, what will replace current policies.""The doctor's group added: ""Patients and other stakeholders should be able to clearly compare current policy to new proposals so they can make informed decisions about whether it represents a step forward in the ongoing process of health reform.""The AMA came out in support of Trump's nomination of Rep. Tom Price, a physician, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Price has been a leading advocate of ObamaCare repeal and has laid out his own plan. So it comes as something of a surprise that the AMA now appears to be a significant obstacle to repeal of ObamaCare.The group's support was seen as critical before passage of the 2010 health law officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Wednesday's letter clarified its current stance: ""We continue to embrace the primary goal of that law — to make high quality, affordable health care coverage accessible to all Americans. We also recognize that the ACA is imperfect and there a number of issues that need to be addressed. As such, we welcome proposals, consistent with the policies of our House of Delegates, to make coverage more affordable, provide greater choice, and increase the number of those insured.""The AMA's directive that GOP plans don't reduce the number of insured is consistent with what Speaker Ryan and Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway have pledged. Yet, the trick will be to offer detailed policies that achieve and pay for those goals without a divisive intraparty battle.RELATED:The Only Way For TrumpCare To Be 'Terrific'Trump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?'

367,UNH,"The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the House GOP plan to repeal and replace most of ObamaCare would increase the ranks of the uninsured by 24 million by 2026.Because the GOP bill would mostly retain ObamaCare coverage rules, insurance would be unaffordable for lower-income and older adults with the new, smaller tax credits on offer, so some 30 million people wouldn't claim the GOP tax credit averaging $3,000 in 2020 and rising with inflation. That would add up to more than $600 billion in unclaimed subsidies through 2026, or roughly the same $600 billion amount by which House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan cuts taxes. Those unspent subsidies go a long way to explaining why CBO found that the American Health Care Act would reduce deficits by $323 billion over a decade.Concerns about coverage losses, particularly under Medicaid, have weighed on the shares of hospital groups like Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA), and Medicaid-focused insurers like Centene (CNC) and Molina Healthcare (MOH). Other major insurers including Anthem (ANTM), one of the biggest exchange players, and UnitedHealth (UNH), have fared better amid the ObamaCare repeal debate.(Tenet Healthcare fell 3.1% on the stock market today, ahead of the CBO report released after the closing bell. HCA slid 0.9%. Centene shares rose 1.5% but Molina's sank 1%. Anthem advanced 0.5% and UnitedHealth 0.1%. Health stocks did not move much in late trading.)The increase in the ranks of the uninsured under the plan put together by House Speaker Paul Ryan would come as 14 million lose Medicaid coverage, the number of people covered by employer plans falls by 7 million and individual market coverage drops by 2 million.The budget scorekeeper's view that the American Health Care Act will substantially reduce the deficit and eventually lower average insurance premiums — by about 10%, due to rules that favor young adults, less comprehensive coverage and a reinsurance fund — may provide House GOP leaders enough encouragement to keep pushing their plan. Yet the official score of RyanCare provides reason to the think that the GOP bid to repeal ObamaCare faces high odds of failure.While the House bill easily passes the budget test, it does so by dramatically increasing the ranks of the uninsured in a way that several moderate GOP senators have criticized. That means there may not be a great deal of flexibility in improving health insurance outcomes without violating the deficit-neutral hurdle required for Senate passage via reconciliation.IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.Any bill passed via reconciliation will have to be at least deficit-neutral in the 11th year and beyond. CBO's score of the House bill in the 10th year shows a hefty $92 billion surplus. That's partly due to the inclusion of the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% tax on the cost of employer health insurance above a set threshold.The Cadillac tax has faced bipartisan opposition, which eventually led Congress to put it on ice until 2020. Including the tax may make the budget numbers add up but may risk losing support among both moderates and conservatives.The key point is that, even with the Cadillac tax, there may be less room than it appears for higher subsidies or less stringent Medicaid cuts that will still allow the budget numbers add up. With conservatives complaining about RyanCare because it does too much to preserve ObamaCare, there's also a risk that RyanCare could lose support on the right if the GOP makes significant concessions to moderates.For perspective, the additional 24 million uninsured under the GOP plan, on top of an estimated 6 million who don't claim subsidies they are eligible for under ObamaCare, would leave more than $100 billion in tax credits unclaimed in 2026 alone, an IBD analysis finds. That's more than the $92 billion in net budget savings that year. Increasing subsidies to entice or enable many more people to get coverage could wreck the plan's budget score.One last point: Republicans are talking about a multiphase process that would eventually include a relaxing of ObamaCare benefit requirements. That's to be expected, since the one thing Republicans seem to agree on about health care is that the government shouldn't tell people what kind of health insurance they have to buy.If ObamaCare's essential benefits requirements were axed, health policy experts believe that insurers would inevitably offer people coverage that costs no more than the value of their tax credit under the GOP plan. In other words, people would find a way to use their tax credits, even if they could only afford to buy the skimpiest coverage — too little in many cases to be considered insured under CBO's assessment. Still, if that's the GOP's eventual plan, it means that the CBO is underestimating the true cost of RyanCare by about $600 billion.RELATED:Trump Hails 'Wonderful' GOP Health Plan That Everyone Else HatesThe Biggest Puzzle About Paul Ryan's ObamaCare RepealTrumpCare Has Momentum: These Health Stocks Are Scrambling

369,UNH,"Social Security's day of reckoning is a dozen years away, according to the Congressional Budget Office. ObamaCare may be headed for crisis as early as next year. Here's how to save both, offering more affordable coverage and preserving the old-age safety net — without breaking the Treasury.ObamaCare was sick and in need of major surgery no matter who won the election, but with the Trump administration unwilling to promote enrollment or step up enforcement of the individual mandate, the exchanges could be headed for a crisis.Humana (HUM) said on Feb. 14 that it's making a complete exit. UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) already have one foot out the door, while Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH) won't commit to sticking around in 2018.Democrats may be tempted to stand aside, watch ObamaCare unravel and let the GOP reap the whirlwind, but they have an obligation to play a constructive role. Even before this year's enrollment decline, the pool of customers was too small, too old and too costly, and premiums have soared as a result.Here's ObamaCare's harsh reality: Even among working-class households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, supposedly the law's big beneficiaries, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting coverage that will protect them from financial disaster. Most of the other two-thirds are uninsured, either because they or a spouse work full time and don't qualify for exchange subsidies, or else they've spurned subsidized bronze plans that carry $6,000-$7,000 deductibles.Yet here's the truth about Republican repeal-and-replace plans: They all give a better deal to young, healthy and middle-class insurance shoppers by making health care unaffordable for older, higher-cost and low-income individuals. For a 64-year-old, low-income couple, the same plan that costs $1,000 under ObamaCare could cost $18,000 under new Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price's Empowering Patients First plan.So this is the key question: Can't we come up with a more uplifting approach that doesn't treat health insurance markets as a zero-sum game, creating millions of losers as well as millions of winners?Yes, definitely. If enough Democrats are willing to be honest about ObamaCare's flaws and the extent of our budget challenges, and enough Republicans are willing to acknowledge that taking away ObamaCare's protections for millions who depend on it is not a good idea, it just might be possible to change the debate and accomplish some big things.Politics aside, there are two big hurdles standing in the way. The first is a hurdle of understanding. No one on Capitol Hill seems to realize that the best step forward for public policy, within the realm of what might be possible, is to give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have (and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need) and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for catastrophic coverage and set aside funds to cover basic medical needs.The second hurdle is one of resources. Replacing ObamaCare with something that works much better and gives people more freedom to choose options that work for their finances won't be free. Yet, realistically, any bipartisan plan put forward can't raise tax rates and must deliver big budget savings. Some of those savings can be found within the health care system, as explained below.There is also very good reason to marry Social Security reform with a health insurance fix that keeps care affordable for people under 65. RomneyCare, the model for ObamaCare, reduced work among adults age 55 to 64, the Boston College Center for Retirement Research found.Health insurance subsidies that rise as income falls encourage people to claim Social Security benefits early, replacing a bigger paycheck. Spending a bit less on early retirement — without pulling away the floor of support for those who really need it — would give people a nudge to work longer. That would lead to better personal financial outcomes, limiting penalties people will face for retiring early — a lifelong 30% hit to annual benefits for those who claim Social Security at age 62 — and averting the need to cut Social Security benefits in very old age to restore the program to solvency.The plan here would close more than half of Social Security's financing hole without raising the retirement age or cutting any benefits for the very old, while creating a stronger minimum Social Security benefit for modest-wage workers to keep them from falling into poverty late in life — something policymakers on the left and right have wanted to do forever.A central problem with ObamaCare is that the rules stacked the deck in favor of those needing comprehensive coverage and gave a bad deal to pretty much everyone else.Think of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis, Mo., with income of $40,000 (about 200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare offers pretty solid coverage but costs $2,430 — likely too much for a family that's probably already struggling to save anything. The cheapest bronze plan, costing $1,068, might be doable, but the $13,300 deductible could make a hospital stay financially devastating.The chasm between silver and bronze deductibles — $700 vs. $13,300 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. ObamaCare provides extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink deductibles for modest-income households, but only if they buy silver plans. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers each month, even if the policyholder gets no medical care.Looking through the lens of this 30-year-old St. Louis couple, a bipartisan replacement, merging Republican principles and Democratic values, is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a low-deductible plan with a wide range of essential benefits.IBD'S TAKE: The difficulty of Republicans in settling on a replacement for ObamaCare is threatening to sidetrack the rest of President Trump's economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. That's been good for gold prices.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option. A replacement for ObamaCare could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings for health expenses with two simple tweaks. Relax ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young, but only for high-deductible plans, keeping comprehensive plans affordable for older adults. (That could mean silver plans with a 3:1 age rating, bronze 4:1 and catastrophic 5:1.)Next, let people use cost-sharing subsidies to reduce premiums. Those two steps would shrink that 30-year-old St. Louis couple's bronze premium to zero, and they'd have about $900 left to put in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses — not nirvana, but a dramatic improvement over what ObamaCare offers.Families above 200% of the poverty level, who are more likely to be uninsured, should be able to opt for coverage with higher deductibles than bronze, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democrats. These steps could make premiums essentially free for everyone up to 250% of the poverty level.Third, give people fair treatment. There are some 4.5 million uninsured full-time workers — and their spouses — who don't qualify for exchange subsidies, even if workplace coverage costs close to 10% of income. They shouldn't be denied the help given to people buying coverage on the individual market.Further, members of the middle class who earn too much for ObamaCare subsidies should be treated more equitably relative to their peers covered through the workplace. A logical solution would give a tax credit equal to 25% of the cost of a silver plan, while limiting the income-tax benefit to 25% of the cost of employer-provided coverage and capping that benefit for high-income households. People in the 25% tax bracket (up to $91,151 for singles and $151,900 for married couples) wouldn't be hurt by the tax change, while there would be minimal effect for those in the 28% bracket (up to $190,150 for singles and $231,450 for couples).Fourth, get rid of the mandates. The employer mandate is easy to dodge and ends up harming the low-wage workers it was supposed to help. As for the individual mandate, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get coverage essentially for free, and most will get extra cash on top, there's probably no need to threaten them.Above 250% of the poverty level, post-ObamaCare rules should eliminate the incentive to go without coverage when one is young and healthy, then sign up when one's health starts deteriorating. A logical approach, much like Medicare's late-enrollment penalties, would very gradually shrink future tax subsidies based on how long people go without coverage. This should apply to both the individual market and employer market, or else people would have reason not to get coverage between jobs that offer insurance.Republican plans would steer people who develop costly conditions while their coverage has lapsed to separate subsidized high-risk pools. The idea is understandable, since a small number of high-cost patients can substantially raise premiums for the whole pool, particularly in relatively small markets. Yet, if these separate high-risk pools are supposed to offer good and affordable coverage (as they should), the availability of this option could provide peace of mind for the uninsured and encourage people to go without coverage. That's just one of the reasons why it makes more sense to hold down premiums in the individual market through another mechanism that accomplishes the same goal.That would entail an ongoing federal reinsurance program that recoups a portion of insurer expenses for the highest-cost patients, much like Alaska is doing to keep its individual market viable (while asking the federal government to foot the bill). Republican governors should be in favor of federal reinsurance, or else states with an older population or less-healthy pool of customers could end up bearing a disproportionate share of the cost of repairing and replacing ObamaCare. Reinsurance may have come under attack as part of overall opposition to ObamaCare, but it's hardly a partisan idea. It's a feature of Medicare's Part D prescription drug benefit that came into being under President George W. Bush.Allowing states to expand Medicaid but limit the expansion to 100% of the poverty level, as suggested by Urban Institute scholars, also could be a popular option among Republican governors.All of these features would create a broad, stable risk pool, with affordable coverage options and plenty of flexibility to let people get the coverage that suits them best.So how would Social Security change? One provision called Old-Age Risk-Sharing, introduced in the 2010 book ""A Well-Tailored Safety Net,"" reduces benefits in the first year of retirement, with progressively smaller cuts for lower earners, and the cuts steadily diminish over 20 years, falling to zero at age 82 for someone who claims benefits at 62.As longevity rises — though in a very unequal fashion across income groups — and people face growing risk of outliving their savings, it's sensible to carefully scale back support for early retirement. Yet because many people don't have a choice about when they stop working, it's critical to include a fail-safe function, and in this case there will be three:No. 3 involves another idea introduced in ""A Well-Tailored Safety Net,"" called a progressive saving offset. Everyone would be required to save an additional 1.5% of income per year, with the funds going into a personal account rather than to the Treasury. For low earners, two-thirds of this savings will go to an early-retirement account, with the other one-third deposited in an account that will eventually fund 5% of annual benefits, offsetting the amount by which benefits are reduced. For average earners, one-third of the 1.5% savings would go into an early-retirement account, with the other two-thirds eventually used to fund 10% of annual benefits.Here's why this mandated savings shouldn't be considered a tax hike. First, people are going to need more retirement income than Social Security will be able to afford. People can always choose to save less outside of Social Security or hold riskier investments outside of Social Security to compensate for the extra mandated savings that would likely be invested in Treasuries. Second, this is money people will own. If they die, the account is transferred to their estate. Lastly, the 1.5% of income will be matched by Social Security, though in a notional account (meaning it won't require government borrowing). This will give modest-income workers the chance to leave an inheritance via Social Security — now only possible if they die when their children are still minors — without undercutting income security.RELATED:

371,UNH,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has put payday loans in its cross hairs as it rewrites the rules for short-term loans that carry an interest rate in excess of 36%.Maybe it should investigate ObamaCare, which effectively charges more than 100% interest to members of the working class for accessing their own cash because they only see unaffordable options under the law and opt to remain uninsured.There were noble intentions behind the mandate as a cog in ObamaCare's machine for making coverage affordable and accessible to those who were priced out of it due to income or a pre-existing condition. Yet the reality of the coverage options and the way the law is administered have undermined those high-minded goals and often made income inequality worse.The individual mandate is looking like a failure in its goal to make coverage affordable by coaxing the relatively young and healthy to get coverage. Premiums for the cheapest HealthCare.gov bronze plans are set to spike 28% in 2017 to cover the costs of the exchange pool that is disproportionately old and unhealthy. UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET), and Humana (HUM) are bailing out of most of the state exchanges where they do business this year. Now Anthem (ANTM), which runs Blue Cross Blue Shield in many states, says it may follow suit.This year, roughly 8 million people faced ObamaCare individual-mandate penalties totaling more than $3 billion, even before the penalty jumped from a minimum $325 to at least $695 in the coming tax season. It's now clear that the actual impact of ObamaCare's individual-mandate tax penalty is far worse than the benign intent that the Obama administration claimed when it made the case for it.""What we're talking about is a penalty for the few people who will refuse to buy health insurance — even though they can afford it — and who expect the rest of us to pick up the tab for their care,"" a September 2009 White House defense of the individual mandate states.Consider, by contrast, the perspective of diner cashier Wylene Gary of Yazoo City, Miss., who dropped her coverage in 2014 when she discovered it had a $6,000 deductible, enough to torpedo her finances if she landed in the hospital. ""This ain't worth a tooth,"" she told Kaiser Health News.Democratic politicians rail against income inequality. Yet they defend ObamaCare, when the individual mandate in 2017 will tax away something like 3% of pretax income from modest-wage earners unless they buy coverage that may prove of little use to them.IBD'S TAKE: News that the Justice Department is investigating generic drug makers for price collusion is just the latest sign of the growing political risk facing the health care sector as cost growth ramps up again.Although ObamaCare's problems run much deeper, consider for a moment how the administration of the mandate penalty undermines the law and has a negative effect on the working class.The Obama administration likes to tout affordability by saying that most people eligible for subsidies can get a plan for $75 a month (or less). But paying around $900 a year for a bronze plan that carries deductibles as high as $7,150 in 2017 may seem like too much of a stretch for many.That first $75-a-month payment comes due in December 2016, while the penalty of $695 isn't paid until March or April 2018.The option of keeping your $75 a month is akin to letting ObamaCare be one's payday lender on a loan that averages $450 over the course of the year and charges $695 in interest.And like payday loans, people who have their finances sapped in this way are more likely to pay the mandate penalty again. That's because $75 a month may seem even less affordable the following December if they're about to have $695 taken out of their tax refund in April.ObamaCare's mounting problems should only serve to intensify questions about the wisdom and fairness of the individual mandate, even as some on the left are arguing that the fines need to be strengthened.RELATED:Why Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One ChartObamaCare's Individual Mandate Bites Hardest In These CitiesObamaCare Enrollment Sinks Again, Now Trails Worst-Case Scenario

372,UNH,"American Century Ultra (TWCUX), a marquee name in the mutual fund industry, had a dynamite third quarter. Its 6.49% gain popped past the 5.59% average surge of its large-cap growth rivals as tracked by Morningstar. And the fund soared above the S&P 500, which tacked on a relatively modest 3.85% advance.So far in Q4 the $8.2 billion mutual fund is down 1.93%, going into Thursday. A lot of that is due to a slide by technology and tech-related names that dominate the fund's top holdings. They have been out of investors' favor in recent weeks. Until this past week, that is.A sustained rebound by those names could give a nice boost to the fund — Tuesday and Wednesday those names showed signs of doing that.Four tech or tech-related names are top-10 holdings that have IBD Composite Ratings of 80 or higher. So does top new buy Xilinx (XLNX).IBD'S TAKE: The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating.Apple (AAPL), the top holding as of Aug. 31, was down 7% since Oct. 24. Alphabet (GOOGL) was down 7%. Amazon.com (AMZN) was down 11%. Facebook (FB) was down 17%. All had portfolio weightings of 8% to 4% as of Aug. 31Three gained ground Tuesday and Wednesday. Facebook and Xilinx rose on Tuesday.They had sold off amid investors' worries that multinational companies like those are high-profile targets for retaliation by foreign governments if President-elect Donald Trump sparks a trade war.One big change for the fund since IBD last profiled it in May: While information technology remains its largest sector, now with a weighting of 33%, consumer discretionary has replaced health care in the second slot with a 22% weighting. Health care still has a 17% weighting but has fallen to the sixth position.Amazon — which combines online retailing with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-services platform — is the biggest consumer discretionary name. Starbucks (SBUX) is another. The coffee-shop chain has a modest 70 Comp Rating. Shares recently retook their 10-week moving average, a sign its recent downtrend may be ending.Meanwhile, some health care holdings have already provided lift for American Century Ultra, with runs that began in the days before the election.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and biotech Celgene (CELG) are among the fund's top 10 holdings and have Comp Ratings of 88 and 97 respectively. They benefited as investors rotated into health care stocks amid expectations that a Republican Congress and White House will ease pressure for new pricing rules for drugs. Investors also expect ObamaCare to be reformed.In addition, the market reacted favorably to UnitedHealth's profitable third quarter reported last month — earnings per share rose 23% — and to its raised guidance for 2016.Celgene's Q3 revenue jumped 28% as EPS grew 28%. In addition to productive products Revlimid, Pomalyst, Otezla and Abraxane, Celgene got multiple sclerosis treatment ozanimod in its 2015 acquisition of Receptos. It's also being tested for treating ulcerative colitis. And mongersen is being studied for treatment of Crohn's disease.Wall Street analysts are forecasting 22% earnings growth over the next five years.Donaldson (DCI) also got a postelection boost. The maker of air and liquid filtration systems is up on expectations that a Trump administration will seek infrastructure improvements. EPS grew 16% and 2% the past two quarters after four stanzas of slowing growth.Scripps Networks (SNI), which runs six national media networks and has an 86 Comp Rating, broke out above a flat-base buy point of 68.54 Monday. AT&T's (T) pursuit of Time Warner (TWX) — whether a Trump administration would green-light the deal or not — shows the value of media content.IBD's TAKE: Take a look at IBD's Stock Checkup to learn how four consecutive years of EPS growth and annual return on equity of 44.3% help make Scripps the No. 1 stock in IBD's diversified-media industry group.Xilinx in October pulled back 12% after setting a 52-week high, but has since regained most of the loss. The chip designer, which has a 90 Comp Rating, had EPS growth of 8%, 11% and 27% the past three quarters. Those steps up followed five frames of declining EPS growth. The most recent results, for Q2, beat many analysts expectations. The stock also has a 2.5% dividend yield.The California-based chipmaker's industrial-defense division — whose sales rose 11% in Q2 — could benefit from a boost in defense spending under Trump.RELATED:How A Top Mutual Fund Plays This Volatile MarketAmerican Century Ultra Stays Focused On Leaders

373,UNH,"Anthem (ANTM) said Wednesday it may join other major U.S. health insurers in largely pulling out of ObamaCare's markets in 2018 if its financial results under the program don't improve next year.Anthem retreating from the Affordable Care Act would mean almost all major American for-profit health insurers have substantially pulled back from the law. The other big insurers — UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) — have already scaled back, after posting massive losses. The retreats threaten to further destabilize coverage in the markets for individual coverage, known as exchanges, that provide insurance to millions of Americans.""If we do not see clear evidence of an improving environment and a path toward sustainability in the marketplace, we will likely modify our strategy in 2018,"" Anthem Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish said on a call discussing third-quarter results. ""Clearly, 2017 is a critical year as we continue to assess the long-term viability of our exchange footprint.""Anthem sells health coverage under the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand in 14 states. The company will continue offering plans for next year in the new markets created by the Affordable Care Act. If it pulls back in 2018, it will leave mostly regional and not-for-profit firms on the markets.Swedish said that the U.S. needed to help insurers get better prices under the law, as well as improve the regulations that govern the sale and administration of plans. He also said that too few people were signing up. The company said Wednesday that it had 889,000 people signed up under individual ObamaCare plans at the end of the third quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Anthem shares have been steadily declining since reaching an intraday peak of 173.59 in June 2015. Shares touched a two-year low during opening trades on Wednesday but then recovered and closed up nearly 4% from Tuesday's nine-month low. Anthem is the second-biggest insurer in the U.S., just behind UnitedHealth, but UnitedHealth is tops among managed-care providers in IBD rankings, while Anthem is eighth.""The financial performance in individual ACA-compliant products has been disappointing as membership has been short of our original expectations,"" Swedish said. The company could also pull back from some states and not others, executives said on the call.Earlier Wednesday, Anthem reported third-quarter earnings that fell short of estimates as medical spending increased, driven in part by costs in the company's business serving poor people through Medicaid.Net income fell to $617.8 million, or $2.30 a share, from $654.8 million, or $2.43, a year earlier. Revenue increased 7.5% to $21.4 billion. Anthem spent 85.5 cents of every premium dollar on medical costs, compared with a medical loss ratio of 83.6 cents per dollar a year earlier. Medical membership rose to 39.9 million people as of Sept. 30 from 39.8 million three months earlier.Adjusted profit was $2.45 a share, Anthem said Wednesday in a statement, compared with the $2.47 average of analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Full-year adjusted profit will be about $10.80 a share, Anthem said, compared with the company's forecast earlier this year that it would report more than $10.80.Anthem, which agreed more than a year ago to buy Cigna (CI) for about $48 billion, is now facing a court battle to win U.S. approval of the deal. The Justice Department sued to block the takeover on antitrust grounds in July, saying the combined firm would control too much of the market for health insurance sold to big employers.While the company added more customers in its Medicaid business, costs there rose as well, which hurt profitability in the quarter. Anthem said expenses also rose in its individual business, which includes plans sold under ObamaCare.Anthem's stock has declined 16% this year, the second-worst performance among the six biggest U.S. health insurers.

374,UNH,"Like the proverbial dog who just caught the car he's been chasing, Republicans are about to gain control of ObamaCare's fate, but with no clear idea what to do with it — or how to bury it.The GOP says that it will take several years to put what would inevitably be called TrumpCare in place, but they don't want the responsibility for overseeing and enforcing ObamaCare — individual mandate and all — in the interim.Republicans have settled on what might be called a hurry-up-and-wait solution to this awkward spot they're in: Repeal ObamaCare as soon as January but wait to sunset most of its provisions until perhaps 2020. Yet a range of policy experts, including some Republicans, and health care industry players have warned that repealing the law without simultaneously replacing it could blow up the individual insurance market operating under ObamaCare rules.After a repeal vote, even if the GOP were to keep the individual mandate, relatively young and healthy people may be even less likely to sign up for coverage. Under such conditions, health insurers which have already grown weary of taking it on the chin in the ObamaCare exchanges might not stick around. UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) already are exiting most of the ObamaCare markets where they did business in 2016. Anthem (ANTM) has warned that it might do the same.The risk is that large swathes of the country could find themselves with zero individual market insurers in 2018. That would be an emergency, which might prompt the government to try and fill those gaps by essentially bribing insurers to offer coverage or perhaps temporarily removing income limits for Medicaid.IBD'S TAKE: Read why UnitedHealth is fast becoming the Amazon of health care and why it isn't sweating forthcoming policy changes under Donald Trump.There are two apparent motivating factors behind the GOP repeal-now strategy: 1) Republicans can claim to have done something substantive for those who oppose the law; and 2) They can justify a vote to cut some ObamaCare taxes immediately, including  a 3.8% tax on investment income.With a 52-48 majority, Republicans would need to keep all but two senators on board to repeal ObamaCare provisions through a procedure known as reconciliation that is limited to tax and spending measures. That means many of ObamaCare's key provisions, such as those guaranteeing coverage to everyone at a price unrelated to health status, would stay in place until there's a bipartisan consensus to get rid of them.At least two Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, have said the GOP should have a replacement plan lined up before repeal, so there's some possibility that a repeal of ObamaCare's major tax and spending provisions won't make it to Donald Trump's desk.Repealing the Medicaid expansion, which provided coverage up to 138% of the poverty level, would be more straightforward to do through reconciliation. The GOP has long sought to deliver Medicaid funding to states in the form of block grants that provide greater flexibility but which are likely to increase at a rate below health care inflation to curb government spending.Hospitals were already in a bad place before the election, but the outlook is even bleaker now. IBD's Medical-Hospitals industry group is ranked No. 195 out of 197 based on price performance, trailed only by gold and solar power.Outright appeal of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion and individual market subsidies could cost hospitals $400 billion in revenue and $165.8 billion in income over the coming decade, an analysis for the Federation of American Hospitals and American Hospital Association found.Yet Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick, who downgraded Tenet Healthcare (THC) to underperform on Nov. 21, has warned of further downside for hospitals from Medicaid block grants that push states from traditional fee-for-service Medicaid into adopting Medicaid managed care programs. Skolnick estimates that hospitals get 48% less in revenue per patient from Medicaid managed care than fee for service. Likewise, she says, Medicare Advantage pays 17% less per patient than traditional Medicare, suggesting more downside if Republicans turn Medicare into a premium-support program as House Speaker Paul Ryan has advocated. Health insurers, on the other hand, might stand to gain from GOP-style Medicaid and Medicare reform, which could bring an influx of new customers.RELATED:The Only Way For TrumpCare To Be 'Terrific'

All five of these stocks have more than doubled that performance.Heavy construction and mining equipment giant Caterpillar has led with a 39.1% gain year to date. Shares rose 0.2% to 94.55 Tuesday after taking off since Election Day.After battling weak international demand from construction and low commodity prices, Caterpillar is among the many companies that could see more business come its way if Trump's promise to upgrade the U.S.' aging roads, bridges and buildings goes forward as planned, not to mention increased mining activity.Caterpillar has suffered several quarters of sharply declining earnings and revenue, so easier comparisons and hopes for the future have definitely fueled Caterpillar's stock.RELATED:Caterpillar: 2017 Earnings Estimates Too OptimisticUnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, has surged more than 38% so far this year. Shares fell 0.2% to 162.64 on the stock market today. The stock touched an all-time high on Dec. 16.Many on Wall Street expect Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress to act quickly in dismantling much of the Affordable Care Act, whose exchanges haven't delivered the profits or stability many health insurers had hoped for. UnitedHealth, whose profits this were also dented by a tax implemented by the law, already had planned to largely walk away from the exchange marketplaces next year.United's stock-market gains also come as more people get older and spend more on health care.

The Consumer Confidence Index is at a 15-year high. Wall Street expects Trump and the GOP to cut away regulations the Obama industry placed on the financial industry in attempt to prevent another Lehman-esque crisis. Steven Mnuchin, Trump's choice to run the Treasury Department, has said he wanted to ""strip back parts of Dodd-Frank that prevent banks from lending.""Trump's plans to cut taxes and potentially boost infrastructure spending could boost demand. Increased demand has raised expectations for more inflation, which has pushed up longer-term bond yields as investors try to compensate for the dollar's declining buying power over time.The spread between short- and long-term bond yields has widened on expectations of a Trump fiscal boost and Federal Reserve rate hikes. That should boost banks' net interest margins. But rising short-term bond yields also may boost banks via credit card debt and other borrowing tied to the short end.JPMorgan climbed 0.1% to 87.13 Tuesday. Goldman Sachs, whose big fixed-income, currency and commodities desk could get a boost from extra volatility, inched up 0.2% to 241.56.RELATED:If These Blue Chip Banks Offer New Entries, Block Out Emotions; They Add RiskChevron, up 31.4% this year, has risen sharply since October as oil prices recover as world producers show more willingness to cut production. Shares fell 0.2% to 118.22 Tuesday.Exxon Mobil (XOM), the other Big Oil member of the Dow, has gained more than 16%.Goldman Sachs and some other analysts have argued that Chevron is in a better position than Exxon to boost production with crude prices back above $50 a barrel.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) is the Dow's biggest stock, but it's been a relative laggard, up more than 11% so far in 2016. But over the last six months, Apple has shot up roughly 28%, and is nearing a buy point. Nike (NKE) and Coca-Cola (KO) are the only two Dow stocks that are down this year.RELATED:Donald Trump: A Man Of Steel?Nucor's Q4 Warning Bends Steel Stocks, But They Don't BreakBoeing CEO To Trump: Air Force One Project Will Cost Under $4 Billion

376,UNH,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) agreed to buy Surgical Care Affiliates (SCAI) for about $2.3 billion in cash and stock to add an outpatient surgery chain that will help the biggest U.S. health insurer diversify its business.UnitedHealth is paying $57 a share, with 51%-80% of that in stock and the rest in cash, the companies said in a statement Monday. The price is 17% above the closing level Friday of Surgical Care's shares. Surgical Care shares ended trading Monday up 16.2% to 56.65 while UnitedHealth eased 0.3% to 161.95.The private-equity firm TPG, which owns 30% of the target, has agreed to tender its stock.Surgical Care, based in Deerfield, Ill., serves about 1 million patients a year and will be combined with UnitedHealth's OptumCare unit, which provides urgent care. The enlarged business will also offer primary and surgical care, expanding OptumCare's offering in outpatient surgical procedures.The transaction is expected to close in the first half. It will probably have no effect on UnitedHealth's outlook for adjusted net earnings per share this year, and boost them modestly next year, the company said.Shares of Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealth rose 36% in 2016, making it one of the best performers in the Dow Jones industrial average during a difficult year for health stocks.

377,UNH,"New Year predictions last almost as long as New Year's resolutions. A year ago, the Federal Reserve was forecasting four rate hikes in 2016 and Hillary Clinton was the favorite to win the presidency.The unknowns for 2017 start with the tone set by Washington. Will investors see ""good Trump"" or ""bad Trump""? Will Republicans repeal and replace ObamaCare?On the economic front, will OPEC and allies carry out oil production cuts — and how fast will U.S. shale companies boost output? Tesla (TSLA) is supposed to begin deliveries of its Model 3, but the roads are getting crowded with electric vehicles. Apple (AAPL) hopes the iPhone 8 will wow consumers and revive sales. Snapchat is set to go public; will Uber and other big unicorns follow?This new year may be as unpredictable as any, but here are 10 key issues and challenges to watch that will affect your investments and the economy.Investor's Business Daily's Ed Carson, Jed Graham, Allison Gatlin, Elaine Low, Gillian Rich, Patrick Seitz, Brian Deagon and Bill Peters contributed to this article.Donald Trump promises an ambitious agenda: a 15% corporate tax rate; repealing ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank and other regulations; and a $1 trillion infrastructure program. The U.S. economy has been stuck in second gear for years, with businesses reluctant to invest. The prospect of a Trump administration already has revived ""animal spirits,"" and the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index and other business surveys show soaring confidence.But the populist president-elect has a zeal for conducting ad hoc industrial policy in public. He's used Twitter and TV to target United Technologies (UTX), Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) as well as drug prices.And his protectionist instincts could have serious consequences, given a president's broad authority on trade. Trump could adopt a few anti-dumping duties on China, expanding on actions by Presidents Bush and Obama. Or he could withdraw from Nafta or trigger a full-blown trade war with China that roils the global economy.So far investors are betting that Trump's pro-growth, low-tax agenda will carry the day. Stocks have rallied strongly since Election Day. But some sectors — banks, steel, mining — have fared better than others.Before the election, the Federal Reserve worried that slow growth had become a chronic condition for the U.S. economy. In 2017 the Fed will shift to the role of traffic cop, trying to keep the economy from blowing past its speed limit.If Trump's fiscal fuel sparks inflationary pressures, the Fed could raise rates by more than the three quarter-point hikes that the central bank is predicting. But a positive scenario could play out if Trump's policies boost productivity, essentially raising the speed limit so the economy can drive faster without an upsurge in inflation.The Fed will likely follow financial markets' lead. In recent years, the Fed has spoken loudly but carried a Wiffle bat. Policymakers' goal of four rate hikes in 2016 was whittled down to one quarter-point move at year-end, in large part due to concerns about global markets.The Fed in 2017 will include two new Trump appointments to fill vacancies. Trump's appointees may be especially open to the idea that his deregulation and corporate tax cuts can help revive productivity growth and increase labor-force participation. And by year-end Trump likely will nominate his choice for Fed chief; Janet Yellen's term ends in February 2018.RELATED:In 2017, Fed Will Play Traffic Cop As Trump Hits Fiscal AcceleratorRepublicans appear intent on kicking off 2017 with a vote to repeal ObamaCare but may delay actually replacing the system for years.The health exchanges have been struggling, with younger and healthier people declining to sign up, even with the individual mandate. Republicans can get rid of the law's sweeping tax and spending provisions. But with only 52 votes in the Senate, GOP leaders couldn't overturn coverage mandates without at least some Democratic support.Republicans could repeal ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion, perhaps via block grants that would give states much more flexibility over federal funds.Yet many health policy experts and industry players have warned that a repeal without replacement could blow up the individual insurance market operating under ObamaCare rules. Many health insurers such as UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) are already pulling out of most exchanges, tired of suffering losses.They and their peers may throw in the towel entirely if the law is largely repealed without a long-term replacement. If wide swathes of the country lack an individual market insurer for 2018, what will the government do?RELATED:Trump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?' ObamaCare MomentAfter a rough 2016 with drug prices under the campaign spotlight, a slew of potential FDA approvals and big trial data, particularly in the cancer arena, could catalyze biotech stocks.The FDA is slated to examine PARP inhibitors from Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) to treat ovarian cancer. The duo will compete in a multibillion-dollar market with already-approved Lynparza from AstraZeneca (AZN). Celgene (CELG) has a multiple myeloma drug under FDA priority review. The FDA will also look at Ariad Pharmaceuticals' (ARIA) brigatinib, which fights non-small-cell lung cancer.Kite Pharma (KITE) is expected to seek approval for its refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma drug, an early CAR-T treatment. Seattle Genetics (SGEN) aims to change traditional Hodgkin lymphoma therapy when it unveils phase-three data.Meanwhile, Axovant Sciences (AXON) and Biogen (BIIB) each have data on Alzheimer's treatments due in 2017. Drugs that significantly slow cognitive decline would be huge blockbusters.Some biomed companies may make announcements about drugs or financials at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January.RELATED:Which Top 5 Biotech Stocks In 2016 Are Slated For Triple-Digit Gains?Seattle Genetics CEO Angles For Hodgkin's Lymphoma EurekaOil stocks have rallied since crude prices bottomed in early 2016, and the industry has reason for cautious optimism. After a two-year effort to drive out U.S. shale producers largely failed, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries — along with top non-OPEC producers — agreed to cut production by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day starting in January to prop up oil prices. But cartel members have a history of breaking production quotas.Russia already has said that it will only gradually lower production, and analysts expect Iraq to be the first OPEC member to cheat on its output target. Even if OPEC's plan fails, the International Energy Agency sees oil markets balancing in the second half of 2017, helped by rising demand.But will crude prices, which more than doubled from early 2016 lows, continue to climb? That may depend on how quickly U.S. shale production revives. U.S. crude output started to climb as the number of oil rigs in use rose sharply in recent weeks and months. Many shale players have cut their costs and can profit at lower oil price levels.Trump's pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson, is another bullish sign for U.S. oil companies headed into 2017, given Tillerson's experience with international energy trade deals.A lot rides on Apple's 11th-generation smartphone due out in the fall. Unofficially called the iPhone 8, the 10th anniversary model could sport a radical redesign, with a glass sandwich look, borderless OLED display, invisible home button and wireless charging.Bullish analysts believe the iPhone 8 could create a ""supercycle"" of upgrade activity after three generations of similar-looking iPhones. IPhone shipments fell 8% in Apple's fiscal 2016 ended Sept. 24 vs. a 4% decrease for the overall premium smartphone market.Many analysts see Apple returning to smartphone sales growth next year, thanks to the iPhone 8. Apple's fast-growing services business — which includes Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud and more — is another expected bright spot for 2017.Others are more pessimistic. Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz has predicted that ""Apple is about to embark on a decadelong malaise."" Apple's fortunes are over-reliant on the iPhone, and the company ""lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging),"" he said.Initial public offerings are expected to rebound in 2017 from a seven-year low. Among the first high-profile new stocks is likely to be Snapchat owner Snap, one of the widely watched tech ""unicorns"" valued above $1 billion. Snap's IPO, expected in the first quarter, could raise $4 billion and value the company at $25 billion.Snapchat is growing rapidly, but the parent company has struggled to turn a profit. And it faces competition from Facebook (FB), whose photo-sharing Instagram site is adopting Snapchat-like features.Other unicorns expected to go public in 2017 are music service provider Spotify, software maker AppDynamics and data analytics company Palantir. Uber, valued at $68 billion, is not expected to IPO in 2017. Neither is Airbnb.Renaissance Capital believes activity will pick up significantly in 2017, ""breaking the long IPO recession"" that started in August 2015.In 2016, 105 IPOs raised $18.8 billion. Both the number and dollar value fell 38% from 2015. The top-performing IPO of 2016 was optical components supplier Acacia Communications (ACIA), which is up 168.5% from its May IPO price of 23. But it has lost more than half its value since early September, ending the year at a five-month low.The overall stock market trend will be critical to IPO activity and success. If the postelection rally continues, more companies will go public and will likely fare well. But if the stock indexes move sideways or correct, unicorns will be rare.RELATED:IPO Outlook For 2017: Amid Mixed Predictions, Focus On The Chart ActionThe electric-car race will intensify when Tesla Motors introduces its long-awaited Model 3 in the second half of 2017. It will be Tesla's most affordable car, with a base-model cost of about $35,000, far less than the more-upscale Model S sedan and Model X crossover SUV.Tesla is on track to deliver about 80,000 vehicles in 2016 and aims to ramp up auto production to 500,000 deliveries a year by 2018.Tesla has a history of missing deadlines and cutting production targets, though CEO Elon Musk will strive to get at least some Model 3 vehicles out the door next year. Musk also will be busy integrating recently acquired SolarCity as well as completing Tesla's battery Gigafactory.Meanwhile, General Motors (GM), Ford (F), Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) are selling or planning to introduce all-electric vehicles that target many of the same potential buyers as the Model 3. Like the Model 3, they will have self-driving features.Tesla also faces threats from tech giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple. Alphabet has spun out its self-driving car efforts into its own unit, Waymo. But the Google parent has backed off plans to create vehicles with no steering wheel or pedals in favor of partnerships with existing carmakers.Apple, which has never acknowledged its Project Titan efforts, reportedly has shifted from making a self-driving electric car to developing operating systems for autonomous vehicles.Mobileye (MBLY) and Delphi (DLPH) will showcase their turnkey autonomous-driving technology at CES 2017 in early January.It's still unclear if electric cars are ready for mass adoption. They are more expensive than gas-powered vehicles — and federal tax credits will soon expire for new Tesla buyers. And charging takes far longer than filling up the tank.Fears of cord-cutting — pay-TV subscribers canceling their cable packages — continue to abound in the media space. But a recent PwC survey, which found that 76% of respondents were pay-TV subscribers in 2016 vs. 79% the year before, suggests that ""cord-cutting may continue at a much slower rate than predicted.""Still, subscriber losses at ESPN, owned by Walt Disney (DIS), raise concerns about the power of live sports programming to discourage viewers from dumping their all-inclusive cable packages.Hulu — owned by Disney, 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast (CMCSA) unit NBCUniversal and Time Warner (TWX) — plans to roll out a live-streaming service in the new year that will include broadcast and cable networks. Google's YouTube is also said to be working on a streaming TV service that could go live in 2017.The two players would join a crop of over-the-top TV competitors including Sling TV (Dish Network (DISH)), PlayStation Vue (Sony (SNE)) and DirecTV Now (AT&T (T)).After a long slog through years of low rates, weak economic growth and post-crisis regulation, banks appear set for a better 2017. Trump's transition team has said the incoming president will ""dismantle"" Dodd-Frank. His tax-and-spending programs could boost demand but also lift inflation, triggering more Federal Reserve rate hikes. Wider yield spreads should expand banks' net interest margins.All this sent bank stocks soaring along with Treasury yields in late 2016, especially after the presidential election. Bank of America (BAC) is seen as the most U.S.-exposed of the big banks, meaning it is most likely to benefit from any rate hikes from the Fed and faster U.S. economic growth.Meanwhile, Citigroup (C) still has significant international operations that could be hurt if Trump sets U.S. trade deals ablaze.Dozens of smaller banks have hit multiyear highs. Bank investors are pricing in aggressive Fed and Trump moves in 2017 with bond yields continuing to climb. But if those actions do not occur, bank earnings and stocks may disappoint.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market Review

Analysts have expected $5.43. WellCare Health targeted 2017 EPS of $6-$6.25, below views for $6.31. The insurer sees GAAP premium revenue of $15.225 billion to $15.9 billion, in line with views.WellCare, a Medicaid and Medicare insurer, said GAAP and adjusted premium revenues should rise 9% and 11%, respectively, reflecting organic growth in its Medicaid and Medicare plans and the acquisition of Care1st Arizona.WellCare Health shares fell 0.5% to 135.77 on the stock market today.

381,UNH,"The stock market's newfound enthusiasm about a Donald Trump presidency isn't the only reason that the Dow industrial average has hit a record high and the S&P 500 is in striking distance. With most of the third-quarter earnings season in the books, it's now clear that the earnings recession is finally over.Not only did profit growth turn positive in Q3 after four straight quarters of year-over-year declines, but fourth-quarter earnings are shaping up to be best in two years. The first quarter of 2017 looks better still, at least for the moment.Pockets of weakness remain. But key industries are back on track.Financials are one driver of the earnings rebound. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) led the way in the third quarter as adjusted earnings per share surged 20% from a year ago, fueled by strong growth in trading, investment banking and lending.Bank stocks continue to soar as long-term Treasury yields have skyrocketed since the presidential election. A steeper yield curve should widen banks' net interest margins.The technology sector is on pace to post Q3 earnings growth of 11%, says Thomson Reuters. That would be the best since the fourth quarter of 2014, thanks partly to 91% earnings growth at Facebook (FB) and 23% at Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and less of a profit-decline headwind from falling profits at Apple (AAPL). The iPhone and iPad innovator saw profit slide 15% from a year ago, after a deeper 23% slide in the second quarter.The improved profit picture is coming just in time. The Federal Reserve is set to start hiking interest rates again next month, meaning that the days of investors seeing bad news for the economy as good news for stocks may be behind us for now.""I think the secular bull market in stocks is transitioning from an interest-rate-driven bull market to an earnings-driven bull market,"" wrote Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, in a Nov. 4 commentary.IBD'S TAKE: The materials sector is one of the early winners from Donald Trump's surprise election. Shares of Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials have surged above buy points. Nucor is the early stages of a breakout above a 57.18 buy point. Visit IBD University for a primer on timing stock buys and keep an eye on IBD Leaderboard to find leading stocks primed for a breakout.Overall, with about 90% of S&P 500 companies reporting, the big-cap index is on track to post Q3 earnings growth of 4.1% and revenue growth of 2.6%. A combination of cost-cutting and share repurchases helps explain that gap.""Aggregate earnings continues to benefit from a reduced share count, and slightly more so than during Q2,"" noted Joe Abbott, chief quantitative strategist at Yardeni Research. ""Shares outstanding is down 1.2% year over year in Q3 compared to a 0.9% decline at the same point in Q2.""The biggest gap between profit and revenue growth came in the materials sector, with profit up 10.8% and revenue down 0.8%. Copper producer Freeport McMoRan (FCX) swung from a 17-cent per-share loss a year earlier to a profit of 14 cents per share on cost cutting and a recovery in commodities prices. Shares of Freeport McMoRan rose to a buy point on Thursday with a lift from Trump's plan to fund a massive infrastructure package.The health care sector was near the head of the pack for Q3 revenue growth as sales rose 7% and profits 7.5%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was among the sector standouts, with earnings per share up 23% and sales 12%, driven by growth at its Optum health services unit.Consensus analyst projections point to an acceleration in over S&P 500 profit growth this quarter to 6.4%, the best since 7.0% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Profit growth is currently seen leaping to 13.7% in the first quarter of next year.Keep in mind, though, that estimates for fourth-quarter earnings have been trending lower in recent weeks, Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks Investment Research, told IBD. The good news is that the ""magnitude and pace of declines (in earnings targets) is not as severe"" as it has been in recent quarters, he said.Facebook earnings growth is expected to slow from 91% to 65%, as revenue growth decelerates to 45% from 56%. The social media company said after it reported strong Q3 results that it expects ""to see ad revenue growth rates come down meaningfully.""Overall, tech earnings growth is expected to slow to 7.1% in Q4 from 10.7% in Q3, before re-accelerating at the start of 2017.Shares of Apple, Facebook and other tech giants have retreated recently amid a major sector rotation out of techs, defensive stocks and gunmakers into banks, drug and materials firms.The biggest shift in fourth-quarter earnings is expected to come in the energy sector, thanks to a relative stabilization in oil prices. Earnings are expected to rise 8.2% from a year ago after sinking 66.5% in Q3. Exxon Mobil earnings are expected to rise 12% to 75 cents a share from the fourth quarter of 2015 while remaining well south of the $1.56 a share earned in the final quarter of 2014.Some third-quarter reports are still on the way.

382,UNH,"Aetna (AET) narrowly beat third-quarter earnings estimates despite wider losses in its ObamaCare exchange-related business.The insurer earned $2.07 per share, up from $1.90 a year ago and analyst estimates of $2.03. Operating revenue rose 5% from a year ago to $15.74 billion, squeaking past estimates of $15.71 billion.Aetna updated its full-year guidance, narrowing both the bottom and top ends of the range to $7.95-$8.05 per share vs. the $7.90-$8.10 range offered in August.Aetna shares fell 0.2% to close at 110.83 on the stock market today, but had been down as much as 4.1% earlier. The stock is in the middle of a consolidation zone after hitting an all-time high on June 26, following a big run-up that started in the fourth quarter of 2014.On an earnings call with analysts, Aetna management sounded optimistic about finalizing the proposed merger with Humana (HUM), despite the Justice Department's antitrust case that will go to trial on Dec. 5, with a decision expected in mid-January.  The deal would make Aetna the largest Medicare Advantage provider and largest purchaser of prescription drugs. If it doesn't close before Dec. 31, Aetna is supposed to pay Humana $1 billion.In August, Aetna announced it would pull out of most of the ObamaCare exchanges where it is doing business this year, citing growing losses in the business and structural problems with the exchanges' pooling of risk. Still, the company recorded an additional $20 million premium deficiency reserve, on top of $65 million in the second quarter, to account for losses in ObamaCare-compliant policies sold on and off the exchange.IBD'S TAKE: Wall Street analysts are warning that Centene and Anthem, two big insurers that are keeping their big ObamaCare presences, may see take a profit hit in 2017 due to increased exchange enrollment. Overall, the company expects to lose $350 million this year in its ObamaCare individual market business. However, pulling out of most exchanges may provide a tailwind for 2017 earnings.Aetna had about 775,000 exchange customers at the end of the third quarter, down from 838,000 at the end of June.Aetna management highlighted its Medicare and Medicaid business as its strongest growth segment: ""Operating results in our government business in particular remain robust,"" the earnings announcement said.Still, the company discussed the loss of some state Medicaid contracts. Lost contracts in Missouri and Nebraska will be a $750 million hit to revenue. Aetna is challenging its loss of a Pennsylvania contract that could cost another $1 billion in revenue. Those will be offset to some degree by wins in Virginia and Nevada.Aetna is the No. 5 ranked stock in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group, but the group is a market laggard, ranked No. 166 out of 197 industry groups based on stock performance. UnitedHealth (UNH), fueled by growth in its Optum health services division, is ranked No. 1.Molina Healthcare (MOH), a Medicaid managed care company with a big ObamaCare exchange presence, topped quarterly forecasts after Thursday's close. But it also cited ObamaCare exchange woes. Molina Health, which closed down 0.55% at 57.70 during the regular session, slid 56 after hours.RELATED:UnitedHealth Stock Surges Close To Buy Point On Earnings, GuidanceHealth-Services Spending Takes Off, Raising Political Risk

383,UNH,"The Obama administration's worst-case scenario for 2016 ObamaCare exchange enrollment now looks too optimistic.Third-quarter earnings reports from Aetna (AET) and UnitedHealth (UNH) showed that their combined exchange enrollment totals fell by 113,000 to 1.6 million from the end of June through September, a decline of 6.6%.These two big insurers account for nearly one in six exchange enrollees, and UnitedHealth has tended to see less net enrollment attrition than others, possibly because midyear enrollees tend to be sicker and prefer its broader networks.Bottom line: These enrollment declines provide a strong indication that national enrollment has fallen from an official 10.5 million total as of June 30 to less than 10 million — likely around 9.8 million — at the end of September.On top of that, the fourth quarter appears headed toward big enrollment declines as it has in the past, as people take advantage of the law's 90-day grace period that leaves insurers on the hook even after customers stop paying their premiums. IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Anthem (ATHM) and Centene (CNC) are being dogged by concerns they'll get more unhealthy ObamaCare exchange customers, while shares of UnitedHealth, which is exiting most exchanges, are sitting near a buy point after trouncing earnings estimates.In last year's fourth quarter, enrollment fell by about 530,000, or 5.7%, to 8.8 million.Taken together, it now looks like the Obama administration's worst-case scenario of 9.4 million enrollees at year's end has become the best outcome possible. But the trend from UnitedHealth and Aetna, along with last year's fourth-quarter slide, point to a year-end level of 9.25 million enrollees.If that turns out to be true, that would fall well short of the Department of Health and Human Services prediction from last October when it dropped some jaws on how negative 2016 enrollment would be. Despite the ramping up of the individual mandate penalty in 2016 to a minimum of $695 per adult from $325 in 2015, HHS predicted that enrollment would rise only slightly, offering a range of 9.4 million to 11.4 million enrollees at the end of 2016.While the Obama administration set out the lowest of bars for claiming success, it now looks likely to come up short even by its own generous measure.Do You Use An Online Broker? Now's the chance to tell how well your needs are met. IBD's annual investor survey on brokers' performance is underway. Click to take the survey now. The news that premiums will spike in 2017 — ObamaCare's cheapest plans will cost 28% more — most of the commentary has focused on people with middle-class incomes that earn too much to qualify for subsidies.The Obama administration and the law's defenders emphasize, in rebuttal, that most exchange shoppers are eligible for subsidies. Yet poor enrollment even among those who qualify for subsidies, even though millions will be subject to ObamaCare's individual mandate fine, offers powerful evidence that exchange plans offer a bad deal.Here's why Obama is wrong about ObamaCare: Even among those with working-class incomes at 150% to 250% of the poverty level, lacking insurance from other sources and who were supposed to be big beneficiaries of ObamaCare, two in three are either uninsured or seriously underinsured, an IBD analysis finds.RELATED:Aetna Tops Profit Views Amid Wider ObamaCare LossUnitedHealth Stock Surges Close To Buy Point On Earnings, GuidanceObamaCare Subsidies To Explode As Cheapest Bronze-Plan Costs Surge 28%ObamaCare's Individual Mandate Bites Hardest In These Cities

The S&P 500 ended down 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrials slipped less than 0.1%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in higher than Thursday's levels.Before the open, a worse-than-forecast 19% drop in November housing starts and a 5% decline in issued building permits set the market on shaky footing.Oil ended higher on news that Saudi Arabia and several other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had told some customers they would reduce deliveries beginning in January. West Texas Intermediate rose 2% to $51.90 a barrel, ending up less than 1% for the week. The number of U.S. rigs working rose for a seventh-straight week to an 11-month high, according to weekly data reported from Baker-Hughes (BHI).Dow components UnitedHealth (UNH) rose 2% and General Electric (GE) added 1.7%. UnitedHealth received positive ratings on its upcoming debt issue. GE earned a Bernstein upgrade to outperform from market perform and a price target hike to 40, from 33. GE is working to get some breathing room above a 31.59 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe Systems (ADBE) were two of the day's most closely-watched plays.Adobe reversed an early gain and dropped 2% after disappointing guidance overtopped a solid fiscal fourth quarter performance reported late Thursday. The stock is working on a flat base, but has been hitting resistance at its 50-day line.Oracle dropped more than 4%, after a mixed fiscal Q4 report late Thursday.Rebounding stocks posted some of the strongest gains on the stock market today.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) bounced 3% to lead the Nasdaq 100.

386,UNH,"Payers like Anthem (ANTM), Humana (HUM) and United Healthcare (UNH) are either broadly denying or in UNH's case restricting coverage of Sarepta Therapies' (SRPT) FDA-approved Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, Jefferies analyst Gena Wang said Wednesday.Wang slashed her price target on Sarepta Therapies stock to 32 from 46. She has a hold rating on Sarepta stock, which crashed 5.8% to close at 29.98 on Wednesday. Shares are down 17% this year and have traded under their 50-day moving average since late October.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Sarepta's Exondys 51 in September. The drug targets 13% of the DMD population with confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping.But the drug is costly. Sarepta estimates average annual cost at about $300,000 per patient. The majority of patients would be covered by Medicaid and benefit from a 23.1% discount. Private plans would likely get the same discount, Wang said.""There appears to be no legal consequence, according to KOLs (key opinion leaders) for payers (Medicaid and private) to restrict/deny coverage, citing clinical benefit as No. 1 criteria for coverage decisions and FDA approval status as secondary,"" she wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Sarepta might be diving, but fellow biotech Regeneron has a bright future ahead on eczema drug dupilumab, an analyst said Tuesday. What takeaways are there for the broader biotech sector. Head to IBD Industry Themes for the bigger picture.Outside the Medicaid and private arenas, though, Wang says three of five national and eight of 15 regional managed care organizations (MCOs) have said they would largely deny coverage of Exondys 51.Anthem denies coverage of Exondys 51, saying the drug ""failed to show it improves health outcomes."" Humana has said it would cover Exondys 51 on ambulatory patients provided they remain able to walk. The drug will be approved every six months or as determined through clinical review.Wang notes that it's ""largely unprecendented"" for an FDA-approved drug to be denied or restricted.Aetna (AET) requires the drug be initiated before age 14 and patients be able to average a six-minute walking distance.United Healthcare is mostly unrestricted, but will only cover the drug for the initial four weeks and likely require monitoring after the first month, Wang said.Only certain Cigna (CI) plans cover Exondys 51, she wrote. CVS Health's (CVS) Caremark would cover the drug for 12 months, but then look for improvement in dystrophin levels or a six-minute walking distance before renewal. Express Scripts (ESRX) hasn't disclosed its plans for Exondys 51.Most pediatric hospitals and clinics administering Exondys 51 would be eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, Wang said. Home infusion could potentially cut down on costs, but Wang sees that as a long shot outside of private insurance plans.Editor's Note: Clarifies first paragraph to note the United Healthcare restricts, but does not deny, coverage of the Sarepta DMD drug. Sixth-to-last graph corrects to show that Anthem does not cover Exondys 51 and explains why, and clarifies Humana's coverage of Exondys 51.RELATED:Sarepta Muscular Dystrophy Drug Interrupts 5-Day Biotech Slump'Blockbuster Franchises' Spark M&A Fever For Sarepta, Ariad, Biotechs

387,UNH,"There are a number of huge problems with Republicans repealing ObamaCare now but putting off a fix for several years as they figure out how to replace it.The first is that repeal without replace risks blowing up the already-ailing exchanges. The news that ObamaCare has been repealed, even if the fine print says the individual mandate penalties stay in force, will lead the young and healthy to abandon the exchanges in droves for the same reason that relatively few signed up in the first place: ObamaCare offers them a pretty unattractive deal.UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have already mostly exited the exchanges. If ObamaCare were repealed now but kept on life support while the GOP figures out how to replace it, other insurers like Anthem (ANTM) would be crazy to keep offering coverage — short of a government backstop that ensures they'll do no worse than break even. Without such a commitment, it's reasonable to expect huge swathes of the country to have zero insurers left on the subsidized exchanges, and Republicans would reap a backlash.What would happen then? The GOP would likely have to resort to what is effectively an emergency public option, with the government filling the void via Medicare or Medicaid — just as occurred in Massachusetts in 2014 because of that exchange's temporary technical glitches. Wouldn't it be ironic if ObamaCare repeal turns out to be a big step to single payer?While avoiding this disruptive scenario is critically important, that's hardly the only reason why it's essential to replace ObamaCare without delay. Even if Republicans can buy time by removing insurer risk, there's another huge reason to move forward without delay.Much of the reason is embedded in this first chart, which shows that ObamaCare hasn't only been a failure for middle-class households, which get little or no help buying coverage, but it's failing a wide majority of working-class households too.The chart shows that 2 in 3 members of the working class (with incomes from 150% to 250% of the poverty level) who lack coverage from other sources remain uninsured or, to a lesser extent, are getting bronze coverage that won't protect them from a devastating financial hit if they land in the hospital.Republicans were hired to replace ObamaCare with ""something terrific,"" as Donald Trump promised to do, not to kick the can and do nothing for far too many millions of people who are getting a bad deal from ObamaCare. And Republicans should remember something that Democrats too easily forgot: Millions of full-time low-wage workers get perhaps the worst deal of all from ObamaCare, since they are excluded from subsidies, but may still be subject to penalties.Also, don't forget about those 2.6 million low-income Americans in states like Texas and Florida who earn too little to qualify for Medicaid but can't get exchange subsidies. That's because the Supreme Court created a coverage gap when it ruled that states must be able to opt out of the Medicaid expansion.IBD'S TAKE: Despite the uncertainty over what will happen to ObamaCare and Medicaid in the Trump era, shares of UnitedHealth have surged to a record high since the election. Here's why the company is well on its way to becoming the Amazon of health care.These problems are far too urgent for Republicans to waste several years trying to come up with a plan that has eluded them for the nearly seven years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.The reality is that Republicans are not ready for prime time when it comes to health care. They have no actual plan to replace ObamaCare with either something that is terrific or even that comes close to Paul Ryan's pledge to leave no one ""worse off"" while giving most people a better deal.To see just how far the GOP is from keeping faith with Ryan's word, all you really have to do is look at one chart that exposes the weakest link in the Empowering Patients First plan put forward by Tom Price, Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.The chart shows that a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level (about $24,000) would have to pay about $18,000 a year for the same low-deductible coverage that costs less than $1,000 under ObamaCare.The reality is that Republicans are at a loss about how to proceed, but that doesn't provide a legitimate excuse for, at best, letting ObamaCare's very serious problems fester while the government soaks up insurer losses or, at worst, blowing apart the exchanges. Repeal and replace later is a bridge to nowhere.It should be clear that repealing without replacing ObamaCare will inflict great damage for no good reason. Republicans don't need moral victories. They're in power and need to show they can govern. So what is the GOP to do? Monday's piece will explain a surprisingly logical path to making TrumpCare terrific without an individual mandate — and without delay.RELATED:Trump, GOP Will Create New ObamaCare Winners, LosersWhy Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One Chart

391,UNH,"The coming presidency of Donald Trump and the near-certain prospect he will try to unravel President Obama's Affordable Care Act sent shares of hospital stocks into cardiac arrest in Wednesday trading, while major insurers were mixed and drug wholesalers enjoyed a revival.Most of the nation's biggest hospital operators plunged by double digits, led by the likes of Tenet Healthcare (THC) and troubled Community Health Systems (CYH). Tenet stock lost a quarter of its value, dropping to 15.21. Community plummeted by 21.6% to 4.66.The nation's biggest hospital company, HCA Holdings (HCA), fell nearly 11% to 72.16, while LifePoint Health (LPNT) plunged 13.5% to 52.80. Universal Health Services' (UHS) drop was paltry by comparison, 6.9%, but still that gouged nearly $9 out of its shares, bringing it to 119.26.Hospitals are expected to take the brunt of an expected drop in federal health care funding. The demise of the ACA, commonly known as ObamaCare, could leave millions of Americans uninsured and unable to pay for hospitalization, thus cutting into the profits of major health care facilities' operators.Mizuho Securities analysts Sheryl Skolnick and Ann Hynes said in a note to clients that Trump's victory, along with Republicans managing to retain control of the House and Senate, does not bode well for health care companies.""(A) GOP Triple Play, the worst possible outcome for (health care) stocks, is a reality,"" the analysts said in a note to clients. ""We see extreme risk of ACA repeal-replace, loss of the Medicaid expansion, a primary driver of results for both hospitals and health plans, and reversal of the many value-based regulations that promote home health care.""Insurers, however, were beginning to cut ties with the ambitious health-coverage plan even before Trump's surprise victory in Tuesday's election, so the effect on them was mixed. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares were down fractionally to 141.90 while Aetna (AET) jumped 4.7% to 118.02. Anthem (ANTM) was down early but swung to a gain of 1.5% to close at 128.75. Cigna (CI) shares jumped 5.5% to 135.80.Humana (HUM) surged nearly 4% to 186 as it seems the carrier's Medicare-heavy business would be largely shielded from any ObamaCare repercussions.Drug wholesalers reveled in Trump's election as it appeared they — along with pharmaceutical companies — would bask in a more pressure-free environment now that Democrat Hillary Clinton has been dispatched. Clinton had vowed to combat exorbitant drug pricing.McKesson (MCK), which fell sharply late last month on a disappointing earnings report, recovered some of that in Wednesday trading. Shares surged 8.6% to close at 141.68. The rapture extended to its main rivals, as AmerisourceBergen (ABC) also jumped more than 9.5% to 75.61 and Cardinal Health (CAH) climbed nearly 6% tp 69.25.

"
393,UNH,"President Obama weighed in on Thursday with two ideas that he says will make the ObamaCare exchanges work: Subsidies for the middle class and a public option to keep insurance companies honest and premiums in check.No doubt, providing subsidies to households earning just above the income cutoff at 400% of the poverty level would make some difference. But Obama's prescription is fundamentally flawed because he has overlooked ObamaCare's harsh reality: It's giving a bad deal not just to the middle class but to a wide majority of working-class households.Just 1 in 3 people earning between 150% and 250% of the poverty level, who lack insurance from other sources, are getting silver-level coverage that will protect them from financial disaster if they have a costly medical emergency, an IBD analysis finds. That's based on official enrollment data as well as estimates of the uninsured population by the Department of Health and Human Resources and Kaiser Family Foundation.Households in this modest-income group were supposed to be among the big beneficiaries of ObamaCare because they're eligible for both premium subsidies to help pay for insurance and extra cost-sharing subsidies to keep their deductibles low and their medical bills manageable. Yet 2 in 3 in this group either are uninsured or woefully underinsured, and — even worse — a few million people with working-class incomes are being forced to pay individual mandate penalties, giving up 2.5% of their income or more. In other words, for many modest wage-earners, ObamaCare makes income inequality worse.The Obama administration said this week that exchange enrollment had sunk to 10.5 million at the end of June, down from the 12.7 million people who selected, but didn't necessarily pay for, plans during the open-enrollment period that ended in early February. During the third-quarter, enrollment likely slid to 10 million or lower, consistent with the experience of UnitedHealth (UNH), which reported that its exchange enrollment fell by 6%, or 50,000, to 770,000 between June and September.Given that the fourth-quarter has previously seen big enrollment declines, as people who plan to switch plans take advantage of the law's grace period, it now looks like the Obama administration's worst-case scenario (9.4 million enrollees at year-end) has become the best outcome possible.IBD'S TAKE: While UnitedHealth and other insurers are reducing their exposure to ObamaCare, here's why the sector faces increased political risk as cost growth ramps up again.The extent of the decline, though due to many factors including people getting new employer coverage, is troubling because it's even worse than in 2015, despite the fact that ObamaCare's penalty for going uninsured got steeper. The problem is that millions of modest-income people see the available plans as either unaffordable or such a bad deal that they're willing to pay a fine during the next tax season (more than a year away) rather than paying premiums right away.Using the best and most up-to-date data, IBD estimates that, among those earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, there are about 2.6 million people who are getting silver-exchange coverage. Meanwhile, roughly 600,000 in the same group are getting bronze coverage; 2.5 million are eligible for subsidies but remain uninsured; and another 2 million are uninsured but ineligible for subsidies because they work full time and have an offer of coverage from their employer.**(These estimates may be on the conservative side. The Kaiser Family Foundation says 4.5 million uninsured people who earn less than 400% of the poverty level are ineligible for subsidies because they're offered employer coverage. Meanwhile, the Obama administration said last year that 40% of the 10.5 million uninsured people eligible for subsidies earned between 139% and 250% of the poverty level.)Let's take the last group first. Probably nobody gets a worse deal from ObamaCare than modest-wage, full-time workers. Many employers have figured out that they can keep a lid on health insurance costs and still dodge ObamaCare's employer mandate penalty by offering ""affordable"" coverage that modest-wage workers find unaffordable. Consider single workers earning $20,000 a year, about 170% of the poverty level. For such workers, bronze-type coverage with a $6,000-plus deductible is deemed affordable in 2016, even if it costs $1,900 — just under 10% of income. That's about five times as much as it costs workers at the same income level to buy subsidized bronze-level policies via HealthCare.gov. The decision by ObamaCare's crafters to exclude modest-wage, full-time workers is both extremely unfair and really bad for the sustainability of the exchanges because it narrows the potential risk pool.Other decisions by the law's architects also shot ObamaCare in the foot. They were so intent on making sure that no one was underinsured that they made cost-sharing subsidies exclusive to people who buy silver coverage. This makes no sense. If people can't afford to pay after-subsidy silver-plan premiums — about $1,500, or 6.4% of income, for a single worker earning $23,500 or about 200% of the poverty level — it's a good bet that they won't be able to afford to pay bronze-plan deductibles of up to $7,150 in 2017. As a result, millions of working-class households have been left with the choice of buying coverage that won't do much to protect their finances in a pinch or paying a fine.On a related nanny-state note, the law's crafters decided to pay the cost-sharing subsidies directly to insurance companies. The size of ObamaCare's subsidies are big enough, but there is no flexibility in how they are used. Depositing some portion of the cost-sharing subsidy in a Health Savings Account to offset some out-of-pocket costs, or using it to reduce premiums, could have achieved much greater enrollment and a healthier risk pool.ObamaCare premiums are set to surge by about 25% this year, not including subsidies, as the high cost of ObamaCare's stunted exchange population is leading UnitedHealth, Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) to abandon most of the state exchanges where they're doing business in 2016. Ironically, though, higher premiums will mean stable after-subsidy silver-plan costs and outright cheaper bronze plans for most of ObamaCare's subsidized customers.The logical inference, backed up by the weak enrollment seen even before premium increases got serious this year, is that a more economical public plan isn't the answer to ObamaCare's unattractive value proposition for consumers.RELATED:ObamaCare's Invisible Uninsured Hordes Work Full-Time ObamaCare Is Ill But Hasn't Entered Death SpiralObamaCare Mandates Are Dead — Even If Hillary Wins

396,UNH,"ObamaCare exchange enrollment has tumbled from 12.7 million people who signed up for plans as of early February to 10.5 million at the end of June, the Department of Health and Human Services said on Wednesday.Even worse, an early snapshot of third-quarter enrollment on Tuesday from UnitedHealth (UNH) -- which saw its exchange enrollment slide by 50,000, or 6%, to 770,000 from June to September — suggests that national enrollment has fallen to 10 million, perhaps lower.The fact that the big drop in enrollment in the first half of the year even exceeds the attrition rate seen in the first half of 2015 should be a major concern, given that the cost of going uninsured jumped in 2016 with the ramping up of ObamaCare's individual mandate penalty to a minimum of $695, from $325 last year. This year, about 8 million people paid ObamaCare's penalty for going without coverage. When so many millions of people see the available plans as either unaffordable or such a bad deal that they're willing to risk paying a fine, ObamaCare's mounting problems should only serve to intensify questions about the wisdom and fairness of the individual mandate.What is more, the Obama administration is only expecting modestly better enrollment in 2017. The official estimate released Wednesday predicts 13.8 million people will select plans during the open enrollment period, with paid monthly enrollment averaging 11.4 million. Still, that's better than some outside analysts expect. Goldman Sachs predicted recently that enrollment could drop by 20% from 2016 levels amid surging premiums and the exit of major carriers including UnitedHealth, Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) from most of the exchanges where they do business this year.Other research analysts have warned investors that companies like Anthem (ANTH) and Centene (CNC) could take a profit hit in 2017 as they capture some of the enrollment from exiting players. JPMorgan Chase downgraded shares of Anthem to neutral from overweight this week, citing the company's exposure to the ObamaCare risk pool due to averse selection, as higher prices lead healthier customers to drop coverage.Political opponents of ObamaCare have hailed its run of really bad news, including some jaw-dropping rate hikes, as evidence that the exchanges are close to blowing up. The irony, though, is that the spike in premiums may help to temporarily stabilize the exchanges.IBD'S TAKE: While UnitedHealth and other insurers are reducing their exposure to ObamaCare, here's why the sector faces increased political risk as cost growth ramps up again. Here are three reasons why the near-term outlook for the exchanges may not be as disastrous as many critics expect, even though everyone should be against the status quo in which ObamaCare is failing far too many millions of Americans who could really use a better deal.Few insurance markets are more expensive than New York for young adults because the state is alone in imposing a 1:1 age rating on individual market insurers, meaning that 24-year-olds pay just as much as 64-year-olds. In most states before ObamaCare, insurers could charge a 64-year-old five times as much as a young adult. Some ObamaCare critics have blamed the law's age-rating restriction, allowing insurers to charge older adults only three times as much as a young adult, for the exchanges' failure to attract a younger, healthier risk pool.Yet New York is so expensive that subsidies actually make ObamaCare coverage relatively inexpensive — at least bronze-level coverage. Take the cost of a bronze plan this year for a 30-year-old earning about $32,500. For a full year, the bronze plan costs $3,577 in Albany, N.Y., but just $2,459 in Miami — before any subsidy. But a young adult at that income level gets no subsidy in Florida, even as the New Yorker gets a subsidy of $1,836, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation health insurance marketplace calculator. Bottom line: The individual in Albany saves $60 a month vs. the one in Miami.BlueCross BlueShield of North Carolina is boosting its ObamaCare premiums by 24.3% in 2017. That's higher than its original request of an 18.8% increase, which the insurer revised after UnitedHealth's exit from the market. But the bad news may turn out to be good news for many of its customers. Because of the way ObamaCare subsidies work, 72% of its customers will pay either the same or less than they're paying this year, the company explained.Those who don't qualify for subsidies because they earn more than 400% of the poverty level may get badly hurt by the coming premium hikes. That seems unfair because there is no income cap for getting tax-subsidized health insurance through one's employer. Still, about 85% of exchange customers get subsidies, and the Obama administration explained recently that 2.5 million of 6.9 million off-exchange customers have incomes low enough to qualify for subsidies. Many may be in the same situation as the young adult in the Miami example: unsubsidized because of the way age and income interact in ObamaCare's subsidy formula.Yet many people who get little or nothing in the way of subsidies this year may find that they qualify for substantially more in 2017. That's not to say that higher premiums and bigger subsidies will fix ObamaCare — they won't.  Many will qualify for bigger subsidies for policies that they still don't want. There's little doubt that the subsidy structure and coverage rules are failing a majority of those with income above about 175% of the poverty level — including millions of full-time workers who are ineligible for subsidies if their employer offers coverage that costs them close to 10% of income.With the increasing likelihood that Hillary Clinton will be the next president and she'll have to work with a Republican House of Representatives, there's a strong chance that the individual and employer mandates will be repealed in order to pave the way for the next chapter of health reform.While the ObamaCare exchanges are good for the near-poor and those with pre-existing conditions who qualify for big subsidies, there's little doubt that the subsidy structure and coverage rules are failing a majority of those with income above about 175% of the poverty level — including millions of full-time workers who are ineligible for subsidies if their employer offers coverage that costs them close to 10% of income.Here's one data point that drives home one of ObamaCare's biggest and most important failures. Back in 2013, the Obama administration set a first-year target of 2.7 million enrollees age 18 to 34 — and enrollment was expected to keep ramping up in a big way in subsequent years — but the best evidence suggests that young adult enrollment is currently south of that first-year goal, likely around 2.5 million.That inference is pretty clear because young adults made up just under 28% of signups in 2016, but the paid ObamaCare insurance pool gets older as the year progresses. Among the 5.6 million people who renewed their HealthCare.gov coverage this year (out of 6.3 million who held policies at year-end), just 1.35 million, or 24%, were age 18 to 34.RELATED:ObamaCare Individual Mandate Fine Hit 8 Million People This Year ObamaCare Mandates Are Dead — Even If Hillary Wins

397,UNH,"GoPro (GPRO), and Universal Health Services (UHS) were downgraded while TripAdvisor (TRIP) and Wayfair (W) had their price targets cut.GoPro was downgraded to neutral from outperform and its price target dropped to 9 from 12. GoPro announced late Tuesday that it would recall some 2,500 of its Karma drones sold amid a handful of reports of power failure. Last week GoPro missed on third-quarter revenue and gave weak guidance for the holiday quarter, signaling that the Karma drone and its new Hero 5 action camera were not going to be hits.GoPro plunged 4.1% to 10.41 in the stock market today. GoPro hit 9.75 intraday.RBC Capital Markets lowered his price target on TripAdvisor to 50 from 55 with a sector perform rating. TripAdvisor reported third-quarter earnings after the market close Tuesday that missed on the top line, sending shares falling. TripAdvisor ended the quarter with 390 million monthly active users, up 11% year over year. TripAdvisor plummeted nearly 16.2% to 52.95.Universal Health Services was downgraded to neutral from buy with its price target lowered to 135 from 150. Shares tumbled 6.9% to 119.26, but also climbed back from session lows. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to repeal ObamaCare. At the very least, he's unlikely to take aggressive action to shore up the faltering ObamaCare exchanges.Anthem (ANTM) last week said it may join other major U.S. health insurers in largely pulling out of ObamaCare's markets in 2018 if its financial results under the program don't improve next year.Anthem retreating from the Affordable Care Act would mean almost all major American for-profit health insurers have substantially pulled back from the law. The other big insurers — UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) — have already scaled back, after posting massive losses.Maxim Group lowered its price target on Wayfair to 45 from 49 but maintained a buy rating. Wayfair reported third-quarter earnings Wednesday, beating estimates on the top and bottom line. Revenue rose 45% to $861.5 million year over year. It reported earnings per share minus items of a 54-cent loss, vs. a 15-cent loss.Wayfair rose 5.4% intraday after falling 4.1% on Tuesday.

398,UNH,"Window shopping for 2017 ObamaCare plans has just opened on HealthCare.gov, and an IBD analysis of next year's deductibles and premiums — both before subsidies and after — reveals some surprising findings.Overall, the cheapest bronze-plan premium will spike by an average 28.2% before subsidies, based on a review of prices in the biggest market in each of the 38 states utilizing the federal government website. That follows a 12.7% rise in 2016. For a 30-year old, a bronze premium will rise to $272 per month from $212 this year,Six markets will see increases of more than 50%, including Nashville, Tenn. (54%); Columbia, S.C. (54%); Charlotte, N.C. (55%); Chicago (65%); Oklahoma City (80%) and Phoenix (177%).The huge premium hikes will be a shock for middle-class households that earn too much to qualify for ObamaCare subsidies restricted to those earning up to 400% of the poverty level ($47,520 for a single person). But for those who get subsidies, the premium hikes look like much ado about exactly nothing.IBD's analysis looked at how subsidies would change for individuals earning 257% of the poverty level, or $30,539. Here is the shock: Subsidies are set to explode by 99%, to an average $121 per month vs. $61 this year. Once the bigger subsidies are factored in, the average cost of a bronze plan will be $152 per month — exactly the same as in 2016.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Anthem and Centene are being dogged by concerns that they'll get more ObamaCare exchange customers, while shares of UnitedHealth, which is exiting most exchanges, are sitting at a buy point after trouncing earnings estimates.President Obama last week called for subsidies for the middle class who are excluded from the law's help. Yet IBD explained why Obama's ObamaCare prescription misses the law's most fundamental problem: Two in three people who earning a working-class income from 150% to 250% of the poverty level remain either uninsured or woefully underinsured.Even consumers who are eligible for subsidies and don't face a premium increase may find other reasons to be unhappy about the new offerings at HealthCare.gov. Plan choice is down dramatically as UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) exited most exchanges where they are doing business this year, and many nonprofit co-ops went out of business. Even if people can get a plan at the same after-subsidy cost, it may force them to change doctors.UnitedHealth lost 0.5% to 144.69 on the stock market today. Aetna gained 0.7% to 112.02 while Humana ticked up 0.2% to 176.27.The average deductible for the cheapest bronze plan in each of these 38 markets will rise to $6,358, up 5% from $6,045 this year. But that's nothing compared to the rise in deductibles among the cheapest silver plan, which will jump 18% to $4,261 from $3,613 in 2016. That jump is no small part due to the impact of Ambetter plans from Centene (CNC), which carry silver-plan deductibles of up to $7,050. Although the plans do offer some predeductible benefits, most big-ticket items aren't covered until the deductible is exhausted.Centene was up 1.5% to 63.05.The cheapest silver plan is set to rise 25%, IBD finds, to $322 a month from $258 this year. Taking into account the subsidy increase, the cheapest silver plan will cost an average $202, up 2.3% from $197.There are lots of reasons that ObamaCare is poorly designed to attract relatively young and healthy enrollees, even with a mandate penalty for those who go uninsured. A huge increase in subsidies to offset soaring premiums isn't going to make ObamaCare popular all of a sudden, but it may keep most exchanges from entering a death spiral.RELATED:Why Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One Chart ObamaCare Is Ill But Hasn't Entered Death SpiralNew ObamaCare Shock: $7,050 Silver-Plan Deductible

405,UNH,"The bitter, long-running fight over ObamaCare's individual and employer mandates is all over but the shouting.The problems plaguing the ObamaCare exchanges as enrollment lags, premiums spike and insurers from Aetna (AET) to UnitedHealth (UNH) head for the exits have reached a critical stage, even as the penalties are about to spike for far too many millions of people who get a bad deal from the law. This year, 8 million people paid the individual mandate penalty — not too far from the 10.6 million who had coverage via the exchanges at the end of June. The status quo won't survive the inevitable political backlash, nor should it. ObamaCare is like a car with a bad muffler: It can keep traveling down the road, even as everyone it passes begs the driver to pull over and get it serviced. The only prospect for preserving ObamaCare, in something that closely resembles its current form, requires not just a victory for Hillary Clinton but a clean sweep for Democrats. Yet continued GOP control of the House now looks increasingly assured, and Republicans are given a solid chance of retaining the Senate as well.Even Clinton has conceded that ObamaCare is in serious need of repair. She has proposed increasing premium subsidies; providing an extra $2,500 per-person tax credit to offset medical expenses; and fixing ObamaCare's family glitch that denies subsidies to the spouses of full-time workers who are eligible for coverage from an employer. Those fixes would cost $103 billion in the first year, according to a new analysis from the Commonwealth Fund.Suffice it to say that there is zero chance that Clinton will get any of those wish-list items from a Republican Congress to help keep ObamaCare — mandates and all — afloat. Clinton's choice, then, will be to deal with Republicans by putting everything on the table — especially the mandates — or to stubbornly cling to ObamaCare's achievements at the expense of 10-plus million people who are getting a raw deal from the law.Those millions include full-time low-wage workers who are denied ObamaCare exchange subsidies if employer coverage is deemed affordable under ObamaCare, even if it is far from affordable. This year, a $20,000 earner who is eligible for ObamaCare subsidies can get a bronze plan for $359 per year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But someone at the same income level who is offered insurance at the workplace might have to pay as much as $1,600 for bronze-type coverage — about 8% of income — or else face an ObamaCare fine. A couple of million spouses of full-time workers, as Clinton has acknowledged, also get a raw deal from the family glitch.ObamaCare has been effective in expanding comprehensive coverage for those earning up to about 150% of the poverty level, but the exchanges' results, even in the modest income tier above that near-poor group, are really disheartening. IBD has estimated, using a variety of think-tank and government data, that only about 1 in 4 people from 150% to 250% of the poverty level are getting silver-level ObamaCare exchange coverage. The other 75% either have bronze coverage with $6,000-plus deductibles that leaves them at risk of financial distress if they get sick; have chosen to remain uninsured even though they are eligible for subsidies; or they're uninsured because they work full-time but can't afford employer coverage.Then there are a few million middle-class individuals who get little or no subsidy from ObamaCare because they earn more than 400% of the poverty level, or earn less but still don't get much help because of a formula that gives little or nothing to relatively young adults earning close to 300% of the poverty level.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Managed Care group is ranked 173 out of 197 industry groups based on stock performance by IBD, but there have been plenty of health-related winners this year, like Veeva Systems and Intuitive Surgical. Use IBD Research Tools to identify potential winners and read this primer from IBD University on timing stock purchases and protecting downside risk.Yet a stubborn embrace of the status quo, as unappealing as that is, may not even be an option for Clinton. That's because by early next year, a federal appeals court is expected to hand down a ruling in the government's appeal of U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer's ruling that Obama administration funding of key ObamaCare subsidies violates the House's constitutional power of the purse. Without those cost-sharing subsidies, which dramatically cut deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income exchange customers who buy silver plans, insurers might have to substantially hike premiums yet again.The reality is that ObamaCare subsidies — both premium and cost-sharing subsidies — are big enough to give most modest-income people a good enough deal that no individual mandate would be needed to compel them to buy coverage. The key is giving people the flexibility to buy coverage they want and can afford — even if it's not always the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have — with some limitations so that the near-poor don't unnecessarily put themselves on the brink of bankruptcy if they get sick. There are also alternative incentives that would work to keep the middle class from going uninsured. The option of buying the coverage one wants and depositing what's left of the subsidy in a Health Savings Account is one that Republicans support and could actually lead to an increase in coverage among the relatively young and healthy.Likewise, extending equitable subsidies to low-wage, full-time workers that they can use in the individual market, as Republican policymakers have proposed, could expand the ranks of the insured. That approach would naturally go along with the end of employer mandate penalties that are triggered when a full-time worker buys coverage via the exchanges.If Clinton takes office next January, when ObamaCare's next enrollment period is falling flat, as it inevitably will, the writing will be on the wall and Clinton will have to dangle the law's controversial mandates to bring Republicans to the table. That means the only way that the mandates will survive is if Republicans are unwilling to deal. That can't be ruled out, but it's not the most likely outcome. To understand why, just recall the outcry when ObamaCare was about to launch, and millions of people started getting notices that their plans were being canceled. GOP policymakers understand that they can't take away the coverage that 10 million people, many relatively old and not in robust health, have come to count on. That's why they crafted a GOP plan to kill ObamaCare softly, vowing that if you like your ObamaCare plan, you can keep it.

406,UNH,"The Obama administration is illegally ignoring the text of the 2010 health law to overpay insurers by $3 billion and counting through ObamaCare's reinsurance program, the Government Accountability Office said Thursday.The Department of Health and Human Services ""may not use amounts collected for the Treasury to make reinsurance payments,"" the legal opinion from GAO General Counsel Susan Poling concluded.The finding could jeopardize a portion of reinsurance payments due to exchange participants to cover a portion of the bills for their costliest ObamaCare individual market customers in 2016.Even though financial losses are already driving UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) out of most ObamaCare exchanges next year, their earnings might take an incremental hit from reduced reinsurance payments. Likewise, Anthem (ANTM), Centene (CNC) and Molina Healthcare (MOH) also could see smaller reinsurance payments than they expect.Centene's latest earnings report says it has $217 million in reinsurance payments coming as of June 30, while Anthem received $753 million in reinsurance payments for the 2014 year. The program is temporary, with payments gradually covering a reduced share of costs in each year and phasing out altogether after 2016.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Managed Care group is ranked 173 out of 197 industry groups based on stock performance by IBD, but there have been plenty of health-related winners this year, like Veeva Systems and Intuitive Surgical. Use IBD Research Tools to identify potential winners and visit IBD University to learn how to time stock purchases and protect downside risk.The GAO opinion adds weight to the argument that Republicans in Congress have made that the Obama administration is ignoring the letter of the law. The 2010 law, officially the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, required insurers to submit a fee, $63 in 2014 and gradually declining, for each individual and small-group customer. Those fees were expected to tally up to $12 billion in the first year, but came in short of $10 billion.Part of those funds, including $2 billion in the first year, were supposed to be directed to the treasury, according to the law, which was likely done as a way to keep the cost of the law down in the contentious period leading to its passage.The GAO opinion notes that HHS ""received $7.9 billion in reinsurance claims (in 2014) and paid these in full, leaving approximately $1.7 billion in collections, which it carried over for reinsurance payments in subsequent benefit years. As a result, HHS did not deposit any amounts collected from issuers into the Treasury.""What happens next isn't exactly clear. Anthem's most recent annual report notes that it received its full 2014 reinsurance payment in the third quarter of 2015, so full payment for the 2015 year may already have been made. In that case, only 2016 payments might be jeopardized.The disputed reinsurance funds add to the huge amount of uncertainty already facing ObamaCare. Not only are premiums set to spike next year, but the government has said its risk-corridor program has no funds to cover insurer losses. Further, a federal judge ruled in May that the Obama administration violated the House's constitutional power of the purse by funding ObamaCare cost-sharing subsidies without an appropriation. That case will next be heard by a federal appeals court.UnitedHealth fell 1.5%, Anthem 1.9% and Centene 2% on the stock market today. Aetna fell 1.1%, Molina 1.5%, while Humana fell just 0.4%.

407,UNH,"President Obama pushed the Affordable Care Act as the end of a long debate over recasting U.S. health care. ""I am not the first president to take up this cause,"" he told a joint session of Congress in September 2009. ""But I am determined to be the last.""Seven years later, it's clear that Obama was wrong about that. No matter who wins in November, health care reform will be back on the front burner in 2017.The ObamaCare exchanges have grown increasingly unstable as huge losses lead insurers — including Aetna (AET), UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana (HUM) -- to abandon the market.The latest news is that Blue Cross Blue Shield is pulling out of Nebraska's exchange and dropping plans in three of the biggest regions in Tennessee. Before this news hit, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that enrollees in almost a third of the counties in the U.S. will have only one insurance company from which to choose. Insurers that are staying are asking for, and getting, massive rate hikes to cover substantial losses. Phoenix Health Plans of Arizona wants an average 123% rate hike on its ObamaCare plans.Do You Use An Online Broker? Now's the chance to tell how well your needs are met. IBD's annual investor survey on brokers' performance is underway. Click to take the survey now. Overall enrollment in the ObamaCare exchanges this year was half what was expected — and young people aren't signing up at the levels needed to keep the market stable. Nobody expects that to change during open enrollment, which starts in November. Public support for the law is at all-time lows.Even ObamaCare's biggest fans, after years spent denying that anything was wrong, now admit that the heavily regulated insurance markets ObamaCare tried to create are at serious risk of failure.But what form ObamaCare 2.0 will take — and what it will mean for patients, providers, insurers, hospitals and investors — depends entirely on who occupies the White House in January, and who is in control of Congress.Although the issue rarely comes up on the campaign trail, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have vastly different plans for how they will deal with ObamaCare's many shortcomings.In the presidential debate on Sunday, Clinton said she will ""fix"" ObamaCare and that ""reining in the costs...has to be the highest priority of the next president."" But she would keep in place ObamaCare's marketplace regulations and add new benefit mandates to the menu. That includes a requirement that every health plan provide three free ""sick"" visits every year and a ban on charging out-of-network prices for any emergency medical procedures.Analysts say that these new mandates risk adding still more upward pressure on insurance premiums, which are skyrocketing by double digits. Yet at the same time, Clinton says she will crack down on ""unreasonable health insurance rate increases.""The combination of the two will likely drive still more insurers out of the ObamaCare exchanges.To deal with the high and rising deductibles in ObamaCare plans, Clinton wants to add a new income-based refundable tax credit of up to $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families for any out-of-pocket costs that exceed 5% of income.Other aspects of her plan would vastly expand government's role in providing direct coverage — at the expense of private health insurance.Clinton wants to push the remaining 19 states to expand Medicaid, which she said would add 3 million people to that government insurance program.""Some states adopted it, and those states have indicated some really interesting public health advances,"" said Patrick Riley, senior health care industry analyst at Frost & Sullivan. ""Hillary will push for that to move forward."" She's also advocated opening up Medicare to anyone 55 and older. An analysis by Avalere Health found that this would make 13 million people eligible for Medicare overnight.To deal with the lack of competition in the ObamaCare exchanges, Clinton wants to resuscitate an idea that liberal Democrats pushed when ObamaCare was being drafted — called the public option for health care. This would be a Medicare-like plan available to anyone in the ObamaCare exchanges.Centrist Democrats scotched this in 2009 out of concern that the public option — which would pay doctors discounted Medicare rates — would drive out private insurers from the market.  And, indeed, liberal reformers saw the public option as a steppingstone to a single-payer health care system.The net effect of all these government expansions would be to shift tens of millions of people from private to public health insurance programs that already cover nearly half the population.Clinton also has the pharmaceutical industry in her sights. She says that, if elected, she would deny tax write-offs for direct-to-consumer advertising, attack ""excessive"" profits, let the government set drug prices for Medicare Part D, and push for more generics.The industry argues that whatever savings these steps might produce would come at the cost of future drug innovation.Overall, Clinton's plans would add about $450 billion in ObamaCare subsidies over the next decade, according to the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget. That would come on top of the $1.9 trillion ObamaCare is already on track to spend.Donald Trump has been far less detailed in his reform plans than Clinton. So far, he's issued only a brief two-page outline.Trump says he will repeal ObamaCare and replace it. ""It will never work,"" he said at the Sunday debate. But Trump is sketchy on what he'd replace it with, other than to say he'd push ""Congress to make sure we have a series of reforms ready for implementation that follow free market principles"" and ""create a patient-centered health care system."" In the debate, Trump said his replacement plan would be ""absolutely much less expensive and something that works.""Republicans in the House have already produced a consensus plan, which include getting rid of ObamaCare's complex subsidy scheme and replacing it with an age-based refundable tax credit.Both Trump and the GOP plan have endorsed expanding Health Savings Account plans. HSAs let people put money aside, tax free, to pay for out-of-pocket costs. Since approved by Congress in 2005, they've exploded in popularity. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that this year almost 30% of workers are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan that includes an HSA, up from 17% just five years ago. The Employee Benefit Research Institute estimates that more than $30 billion worth of assets are in HSA accounts.Trump also says he'd allow insurance companies to sell across state lines. This idea has been a fixture of GOP health reforms for some time, but neither the insurance industry trade group — America's Health Insurance Plans — or the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association have endorsed the idea. And there is some question as to whether it would actually affect choice or prices.Rather than expand Medicaid, Trump and the GOP plan would turn it into a fixed block grant. As it stands, Medicaid's costs are open ended. The federal government shares costs with state governments, giving the states little incentive to hold down Medicaid spending. The block grant approach would give states a set amount of money but also provide them far greater flexibility on how they provide health care to their poor.Hospitals that fought for Medicaid expansion are likely to fight against such changes, analysts say. They backed the expansion believing that it would mean fewer unpaid hospital bills and a better bottom line. But a new Medicaid report from the Congressional Budget Office suggests that hospitals aren't getting much benefit from a bigger program. The CBO found that the additional revenue hospitals get from expanding Medicaid ""is not large enough relative to their revenues from other sources to substantially alter the projected aggregate margins.""Trump has also endorsed fixes that are anathema to the drug industry, including letting the government set drug prices for Medicare and allowing the sale of imported prescription drugs.On the latter point, Trump says that ""allowing consumers access to imported, safe and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more options to consumers.""The industry — as well as the FDA — has criticized drug importation on safety grounds. The FDA says there's no way for consumers ""to know whether drugs sold outside the U.S. meet FDA standards.""Whatever the candidates promise, the political realities they would face once in the White House mean neither Trump nor Clinton likely could do much without some sort of bipartisan agreement.Clinton would almost certainly face a Republican House and possibly a GOP-controlled Senate that would still want to repeal the law, not expand it. That means the public option, expanded subsidies, Medicare buy-in and other features are unlikely to go anywhere.If Trump is elected, Democrats in the Senate could filibuster much of his health care agenda. Republicans showed they can repeal most of the law without needing to overcome a filibuster, but getting Democrats to agree to the GOP replacement plan would present a huge hurdle.""The overriding issue is that there has to be bipartisan agreement,"" said Robert Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates.That means things like the hugely unpopular Cadillac Tax will likely be overturned, as well as the medical device tax, which even far-left liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren opposes because of the harm it's done to this industry.Beyond that, the two sides aren't even in agreement on what's wrong with ObamaCare, let alone what needs to be done to fix it.Plus, anything more than tinkering will take time to put in place.""It took three years for the administration to get ObamaCare up and running,"" Laszewski says. ""It's going to take that long to launch something different.""Note: This story was updated to include quotes from the Sunday presidential debate.RELATED: Is Obama Pushing Another Illegal ObamaCare Insurance Bailout?ObamaCare Death Spiral: Even Blue Cross Plans Are Bailing OutObamaCare's Working-Class Pill: 70% Marginal Tax Rate
"
408,UNH,"Roughly 8 million people faced ObamaCare individual mandate penalties this year totaling more than $3 billion, an analysis of the latest IRS data reveals.Despite the controversy and high-stakes legal battle that has surrounded the individual mandate, the scope of the penalties paid this year has gone unreported by major news outlets as attention has focused on ObamaCare's latest and most glaring problems: weak enrollment, surging premiums, and insurer losses that have provoked the exit of UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) from most state exchanges.Yet ObamaCare's mounting problems should only serve to intensify questions about the wisdom and fairness of the individual mandate. The root of all of those ObamaCare problems is that far too many people — even those eligible for big subsidies — see the plans as either unaffordable or such a bad deal that they're willing to risk paying a fine.Another reason for the lack of coverage may be that IRS Commissioner John Koskinen issued two ObamaCare reports to Congress on the extent of penalties paid last year, including one in July 2015, but has been silent about this year's mandate fines.Yet the IRS Taxpayer Advocate Service included some preliminary statistics on 2016 ObamaCare mandate payments, officially called the Individual Shared Responsibility Payment, when it issued its below-the-radar annual tax season review on July 7. As of April 30, 5.6 million tax returns included mandate payments averaging $442 per return, compared with 6.6 million tax forms including average payments of $190 at the same point in 2015.More recent data from the IRS wrapping the past tax year show that the final tally for 2015 ObamaCare Mandate fines included payments on 8.1 million tax returns averaging $210 for a total of $1.7 billion.If the final stats for 2016 reflect a similar increase after April due to filings past the initial deadline, that would mean ObamaCare individual mandate payments on 6.8 million tax forms in 2016, averaging $489. Some share of those tax returns will include fines for more than one adult or a parent and child, just as ObamaCare exchange applications often seek coverage for more than one individual. A conservative estimate of less than 1.2 penalties per return yields a rough estimate of 8 million people paying the fine this year.The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that about two-thirds of the people paying the individual mandate fines will have incomes below 400% of the poverty level, the cutoff for subsidies.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Managed Care group is ranked a lowly 175 of 197 industry groups by IBD based on stock performance, but there have been plenty of health-related winners this year, including Intuitive Surgical and Veeva Systems. IBD helps investors identify the best stocks before they stage a breakout in features and lists such as The New America and the IBD 50. IBD also will help you find the best buy point and teach you rules for selling.When the individual mandate has gotten attention recently, it has been because both the law's supporters and critics alike have noted that ObamaCare penalties are too weak to compel healthy people to enroll. In fact, some of the law's proponents on the left are calling for a harsher ObamaCare individual mandate.Yet it's now clear that the actual impact of ObamaCare's individual mandate tax penalty is far worse than the benign intent that the Obama administration claimed when it made the case for it.""What we're talking about is a penalty for the few people who will refuse to buy health insurance — even though they can afford it — and who expect the rest of us to pick up the tab for their care,"" a September 2009 White House defense of the individual mandate states.Even as politicians rail against income inequality yet defend ObamaCare, the individual mandate in 2017 will tax away close to 3% of pretax income from modest-wage earners unless they buy coverage that may prove of little use to them.On average, the cheapest bronze coverage this year costs $930, or nearly 4% of income, for 28-year-olds earning $24,000 a year, just over 200% of the poverty level. For someone of modest means, that's a lot to spend for a plan that won't cover much before the deductible is met. Many of the cheapest bronze plans will carry the maximum ObamaCare deductible of $7,150 in 2017.That's why many people may end up turning down coverage that's not much more than next year's mandate penalty of at least $695 per adult in 2017, up from a minimum of $325 this year. Another reason is that the bill for deciding to go uninsured starting in January doesn't come due until the tax-filing deadline 15 months later, so people who are struggling to set aside extra money may put off taking any bitter medicine.Although the individual mandate was tested on a small scale in Massachusetts, that mandate actually bore little resemblance to ObamaCare's. In 2013, the Massachusetts penalty was a lot smaller: $240 up to 200% of the poverty level and $468 up to 250% of poverty. But the RomneyCare mandate didn't need to be as forceful because modest-income households were mandated to buy policies with $0 deductibles, so the coverage was likely to provide real benefits.By far, the people who get the worst deal from ObamaCare and its individual mandate are modest-wage full-time workers, who are ineligible for the law's subsidies if they are offered what the law deems to be affordable care, even if it is in no way affordable.This year, a $20,000 earner who is eligible for ObamaCare subsidies can get a bronze plan for $359 per year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But someone at the same income level who is offered insurance at the workplace might have to pay as much as $1,600 for bronze-type coverage — about 8% of income — or else face an ObamaCare fine.The Taxpayer Advocate Service also reported that 11 million tax returns claimed exemptions from the ObamaCare individual mandate through April of this year, up from 10.7 million a year earlier. Exemptions are allowed for a variety of reasons, including income below the tax-filing threshold, unauthorized immigrant status and coverage deemed unaffordable because it costs more than about 8% of income.

409,UNH,"At least two, and likely more, ObamaCare co-ops are on death's door after the Obama Administration revealed last week how much the insurers owe to rivals who had sicker members in 2015.ObamaCare's risk-adjustment program is meant to take away the financial reward of cherry-picking low-cost customers, so insurers focus instead on delivering the best, most efficient care. But while the idea behind risk adjustment makes good sense, implementation of the program has come under fire from the biggest insurer, UnitedHealth (UNH), to the smallest, including the 10 remaining nonprofit co-ops out of the original 23. Now the outcry is getting louder, though the biggest problem is that the entire group getting coverage via the exchanges is relatively high cost.IBD's Take: UnitedHealth is exiting most ObamaCare state exchanges in 2017, but that never was a big part of its business. UNH rose 0.5% to 141.56 on Tuesday, hitting a new all-time high. But how does it stack up vs. other managed care firms? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupOn June 30, just before the Department of Health and Human Services informed the Land of Lincoln co-op of its $32 million risk-adjustment bill, the Illinois Department of Insurance fired off a letter to the Obama administration saying that the assessment could precipitate the immediate liquidation of the insurer.To avoid marketplace disruption and ""extreme financial harm"" to the company's 49,000 plan members, the state's acting insurance director, Anne Dowling, said Illinois would prohibit any payment until policyholder claims are settled for 2016.Dowling further asserted that Land of Lincoln wouldn't pay its risk-adjustment assessment until after the U.S. Court of Claims has ruled on whether the government must pay insurers what was owed under ObamaCare's risk-corridors program. That temporary program was designed to recoup 50% of insurer losses beyond a certain level, but the Obama administration belatedly informed insurers that full payment might be subject to appropriation, and Congress refused to foot the bill.In Connecticut, a $13.4 million risk-adjustment assessment for 2015 appears to have pushed finances of the state co-op beyond the brink. On Friday, Connecticut's insurance department declared that the ""continuance of its business (would be) hazardous to its policyholders.""Risk-adjustment assessments also have put at least two other co-ops on death watch. Maryland's Evergreen Health Cooperative proposed by far the cheapest premiums in the state for 2017 before hearing from actuaries that it could face a $22 million risk-adjustment payment, equal to 26% of 2015 premium revenue.Evergreen sued the Obama administration last month to try and block it from collecting the payment, warning that the sum could prove fatal. Yet Evergreen learned last week that it owes even more than feared: $24.2 million.Health Republic of New Jersey faces a $46.3 million payment, biggest among the co-ops. That's far more than the $17.1 million payment that the co-op anticipated when it reported a $17.6 million loss for the year, according to Politico.Minuteman Health likely has the wherewithal to survive its $16.6 million risk-adjustment assessment after tapping $100 million in federal loans earlier this year. But the co-op warned that its New Hampshire premiums, which are the lowest in the state this year, could have to rise by more than 40%.Last week, IBD reported that Molina Healthcare (MOH), a fast-growing insurer that grew out of the Medicaid managed care market, owes a $254 million risk-adjustment payment, about $20 million more than expected.

Young models $14 million in 2016 sales and $217 million in 2017 sales. Part of that is tied to reimbursement from payers. Cigna (CI) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) are on board. Anthem (ANTM) has said no, but Young sees room for Sarepta to renegotiate.""Ultimately, we think that it will be hard payers to deny an approved therapy to patients who are looking for potential disease-modifying therapies,"" she wrote in a research report. ""We also think the heavy involvement and motivation in the patient community will spread awareness in the community.""Young assumes a 70% probability Sarepta will be successful getting European approval for Exondys 51 and a 5% royalty payment. Though the European Union could require additional testing which might push back the launch dateIn her most bullish stance, Young sees the potential for Sarepta stock to hit 68 to 100. The lower end assumes 100% success for Exondys 51 in the U.S. At the upper end, investors would have to bet on success for the entire eteplirsen line in the U.S. and Europe.Sarepta is in Phase 3 testing for mutations affecting 16% of the DMD population.

413,UNH,"UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's largest insurer, sailed past third-quarter earnings estimates Tuesday, raised its 2016 earnings forecast, and indicated that it would likely boost 2017 guidance next month.Earnings per share climbed 23% to $2.17 vs. the expected $2.08, due to a drop in medical costs as a share of premiums and strong growth in its Optum health services unit, which has seen revenue growth of 34% year to date. Overall revenue rose 12% from a year ago to $46.3 billion, topping estimates of $46.09 billion.The company said it now expects to earn $8 per share for the full year, up from the prior guidance range of $7.80-$7.95 and above consensus estimates for $7.90. And CEO Stephen Hemsley also said 2017 earnings could top consensus views if 2016 ends on a strong note.UnitedHealth shares surged 6.9% to close at 143.39 on the stock market today, nearing a 144.58 buy point.Aetna (AET) rose 2.7%, Humana (HUM) added 2%, Anthem (ANTM) rallied 4.1%, Centene (CNC) rose 2.8, and Molina Healthcare (MOH) gapped up 3.1%.IBD'S TAKE: While UnitedHealth and other insurers are reducing their exposure to ObamaCare, here's why the sector faces increased political risk as cost growth ramps up again. UnitedHealth stock has outperformed its peers and is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Medical-Managed Care group. Generally, investors will maximize their chances for success by focusing on leading stocks in top-tier industry groups.Still, UnitedHealth's earnings reflect a company that is much more than an insurer. It also has a leading position in the pharmacy benefit management industry, as well as a provider of population health and revenue management technology services. And UnitedHealth's Optum unit is building walk-in clinics in 75 markets.The sum of its businesses is greater than the parts, allowing it to deliver better health at a lower cost, UnitedHealth management says, and so far its results are proving its value.The earnings release offered no update about the impact of the ObamaCare exchange business on the bottom line because things didn't get any worse. Previously, the company said it expects ObamaCare-compliant policies to be an $850 million drag on earnings this year. But with UnitedHealth set to exit all but three of the 34 state exchanges where it's doing business at year-end, 2017 earnings will get an automatic boost.Aetna and Humana also are scaling back their ObamaCare footprint in 2017 and may get an earnings lift as a result. On the other hand, Anthem, Centene and Molina Healthcare are likely to see their ObamaCare business grow, which some analysts think may be a negative for earnings.In the earnings-call question-and-answer portion, UnitedHealth management said that its ObamaCare exchange enrollment slipped from 870,000 at the end of June to 820,000 at the end of September. If exchange enrollment attrition was similar among other carriers, total exchange enrollment is likely around the 10 million mark, down from 12.7 million signups in February. UnitedHealth also has an additional 110,000 off-exchange members in ObamaCare-compliant products.The company said it will ""lean into"" subsidized markets that are working better, noting new Medicaid contract wins in Virginia and Missouri and the rollout of a new nationwide product for the Medicare prescription-drug market, though one analyst noted that some states are cutting Medicaid reimbursements.""Our growth indicators are positive as we conclude 2016, and we expect to be well-positioned in 2017 to better serve consumers and deliver more value to the health system overall,"" CEO Hemsley said in a statement.RELATED:UnitedHealth Profits To Jump As It Exits ObamaCare ObamaCare Medicaid Costs Rocket 49% Above Estimates

414,UNH,"Stocks firmed up their advance on Tuesday as stocks in the tech, health care and consumer sectors all contributed to the upside. Netflix (NFLX), meanwhile, presented a breakaway gap and an early entry point for aggressive traders.The Nasdaq composite powered 1.1% higher, easily recouping Monday's 0.3% loss. Volume was a tad higher vs. the same time on Monday. The tech-centered index is trying to climb back above the key 50-day moving average.Meanwhile, NYSE turnover bulged as the S&P 500 rallied nearly 0.8%. The Dow Jones industrial average lagged with a 0.5% gain; three Dow 30 components rallied at least 1 point or more, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Boeing (BA). But on the Dow's downside, IBM (IBM) got scorched with a 3.6% loss, gapping down to 149.26 and back below a prior 115.58 buy point within a long saucer with handle. Big Blue reported a 1% drop in both Q3 profit and revenue.Small caps also rallied, with the Russell 2000 up 0.8%.Netflix, fresh from reporting a 71% leap in Q3 earnings to 12 cents a share, surged more than 18% to 119.03 and gapped up to as high as 119.40 in volume running more than 10 times its usual level. Netflix on average has traded 8.5 million shares each day over the past 50 sessions.The move, inspired by the video streaming firm's excellent third-quarter results, was not only a big gap up in price, but it also sent shares throttling base a legitimate 111.95 early entry within a 10-month cup-style base. That price derives from adding 10 cents to the April 15 intraday high of 118.85. The stock opened at 116.63, and investors should try to buy as close as possible to that price.On Dec. 2, Netflix broke out from a 16-week cup base at 129.39 that featured no downward-slanting handle and was flawed because it showed numerous wild price swings. The breakout failed three sessions later, and Netflix dived not only 8% below that base's pivot point but sank to as low as 79.95, undercutting the cup base's low.That actually turned out to be a blessing in that the deep decline reset the base count. Plus, the latest base has shown relatively calmer, tighter price action — a sign that institutions are quietly accumulating shares.Netflix currently shows a positive Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B on a scale of A (high accumulation) to E (high distribution), as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. Revenue grew 31% to $2.28 billion, accelerating from gains of 23%, 24% and 28% in the prior three quarters.Why didn't a handle buy point emerge at 107.07, 10 cents above the Oct. 5 intraday high? The eight-day handle showed a proper downward slope across its lows, and the decline was mild. However, that handle failed the midpoint test (102.30 for the handle vs. 106.61 for the base).In the health care sector, UnitedHealth spearheaded the insurers with a more than 6% gain to 143.42 in fast trading. That put the big-cap managed care firm, which is exiting the insurance marketplace created by President Obama's Affordable Care Act, within arm's length of a potential breakout from a three-month flat base at 144.58.UnitedHealth reported a 23% jump in Q3 profit to $2.17 a share on an 11% increase in revenue to $46.1 billion.Generic drug, hospital and medical research gear stocks also rose more than 1% as a group.Only one stock in IBD's Medical-Generic Drugs group hosts a Composite Rating of 90 or higher -- thinly traded ANI Pharmaceuticals (ANIP), which has a 50-day average volume of just 189,000 shares. However, the Baudette, Minn., small cap earns a 98 Composite Rating, and Wall Street sees Q3 earnings climbing 36% to $1.09 a share and revenue up 75% to $35 million.After years of losses, ANI has posted big earnings gains over the past three years, from 4 cents a share in 2013 to $2.59 last year. Full-year profit is seen climbing 59% this year to $4.12 a share.ANI pulled back in recent days after attempting to clear a 69.10 pivot point in a narrow seven-week cup with handle base.RELATED:Do You Know How To Capitalize From The Bottoming Base Pattern?Profit From The Long Cup With Handle PatternNetflix Results Wow The Street: 5 Takeaways

415,UNH,"Stocks edged higher by noon time in New York on Wednesday, bolstered by strength in the oil patch. Banking and restaurant names also gained ground. Small caps outperformed.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) advanced 1.5% to 175.20 in heavy turnover as it broke out of a long, deep double bottom with a 172.52 buy point.The Nasdaq composite erased small early-morning gains to practically break-even levels. At 5244, the tech-rich index is still around 5 points shy of retaking its critical 50-day moving average.The NYSE composite gained nearly 0.4% as oil drilling, steel, oil and gas field services, super regional bank and money center bank stocks paced the upside. The S&P 500 edged 0.2% higher. Gains in Goldman, UnitedHealth (UNH), Boeing (BA) and Chevron (CVX) helped hoist the Dow Jones industrial average up around 0.3%.The Russell 2000 was up 0.5%.Goldman, as highlighted in this Oct. 10 Stock Market Today story, had been forming its bottoming-style base since shares started a steep decline in October 2015. After two sell-offs that led to two lows of 139.05 and 138.20 in February and June, respectively, the stock made an impressive rebound during the summer as Federal Reserve officials began warming up more to the idea of raising interest rates again in a gradual manner.Goldman posted a strong third quarter on Tuesday as earnings rocketed 68% to $4.88 a share on reported revenue of $8.2 billion. The bank saw assets under supervision rising to a record $1.35 trillion, including net inflows of $14 billion in long-term assets. Investment banking net revenue was virtually flat, while securities underwriting revenue grew 18%, thanks in large part to debt deals.The permissible buy zone in Goldman shares goes up to 5% past the proper 172.52 entry, or 181.15. Buying higher than that price can subject an investor to taking a fast loss if the stock stages a normal pullback following a breakout. As many as four out of 10 great stocks will ease back to or near the proper breakout level before rebounding.Goldman rival Morgan Stanley (MS) rose 1% to 32.57, edging past a 32.47 entry in a long cup with handle after reporting strong Q3 earnings of 80 cents a share, up 135% on a 14% climb in revenue. The earnings growth was boosted partly by an easy comparison; in the third quarter a year ago, profit slumped 52%.Also in the stock market today, the energy sector still ranks in the bottom half of IBD's daily ranking of 33 broad sectors at No. 20. Yet the gigantic sector is seeing pockets of strength.Parsley Energy (PE) jumped 3% to 37.10, good for a new high in heavy turnover. The oil and gas explorer is extended following multiple tests of support at or near its 50-day moving average since May.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) stretched its gains after robust Q3 results issued on Tuesday. The Leaderboard name gained 2% to 163.33 and is now up nearly 16% past a 114.90 buy point.Starbucks (SBUX), in the same restaurants industry group, gained 1% to 53.20 in heavy trading but is still well below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. The coffeehouse chain announced a new CEO of its China division.RELATED:Why Del Taco Is Now A Leader Among Restaurant StocksWhy The Bottoming Base Pattern Is Relevant TodayStarbucks Aims For Big Growth In China

416,UNH,"Investors could toast the third quarter, the strongest of the year, but September alone was about as exciting as a bottle of bubbly that gone's flat.In the third quarter, the S&P 500 rose 3.85%, lifting U.S. diversified stock mutual funds by 4.8% on average. The broad market advanced despite barely breaking even in September, nosing upward a modest 0.02%. Stock funds edged ahead a mere 0.22% last month.That raised stock funds to a 6.38% gain year to date.The stock market's start-and-stop motion in the third quarter has prompted many fund managers to plan ahead by sticking with names driven by strong trends, such as the shift to cloud computing, and with companies that seem capable of grinding out growth no matter how blah growth may be in the broader economy.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Quarterly Leaders""The first half of the year saw more of a defensive-led rally,"" said Lew Piantedosi, a manager of seven Eaton Vance funds with $3.8 billion in total assets. ""But in Q3 that reversed. Cyclicals like tech and industrials did better.""Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersWorld equity funds advanced 6.42% in Q3, outperforming U.S. diversified stock funds. Last month, world equity funds rose 1.33%. China regional funds, which gained 11.36%, led the world equity market. In September they racked up a 2.39% return.If cyclical sectors stay hot, then stocks tied to transportation of industrial goods and commodities could continue their third-quarter gains. Piantedosi held Norfolk Southern (NSC), which gained 14% in the third quarter, in his Focused Growth Opportunities Class I (EIFGX) as of July 31.His Tax-Managed Growth 1.1 (EITMX) held Union Pacific (UNP), which rolled to a 12% gain.But what if most cyclicals lose their head of steam? Piantedosi prefers the long view.""I focus on big-picture growth trends that are sustainable despite shifting macro noise,"" he said.Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are sustainable growers.""They benefit from great secular tailwinds,"" he said. ""While those names have done well — especially Amazon — there's still a runway for them.""IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Brian Deagon analyzes the tailwinds driving Amazon. In the ""Buys & Sells"" column, Julie Mak points out that some leading mutual funds have been selling Alphabet and Amazon.Another plus for the tech sector is that acquisitions seem to be picking up, he says.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformancePiantedosi says investors should brace for volatility until the elections. A Democratic White House, with the Senate and House in Republican hands would mean continued gridlock, he says. Still, his impression is that support for tax reform is growing in both parties. ""That would be a huge positive,"" he said.In health care, he's wary of many drugmakers due to political calls for price regulation. Still, he likes Celgene (CELG), Vertex (VRTX) and Biogen (BIIB).""Biotechs feel a little safer (than non-biotech drugmakers),"" he said. ""They are doing wonderful things to cure big diseases. They combine positive reward-to-risk. And they're beaten up and trading at valuations at attractive valuations.""Within retail, he likes a few names.""It's an area to watch as we head into the holidays, especially some more apparel-oriented stocks,"" Piantedosi said. ""This is a short-term theme.""Macy's (M) has gone through markdowns after having to discount last year's overstock, he says. The mild winter dampened consumer demand for warm clothes. And competition is stiff from Amazon.""The company has done a great job managing inventories going into the holidays this year,"" Piantedosi said. ""Expectations are low. And they've been monetizing real estate"" by selling or closing unneeded locations.And he continues to like home-improvement giants Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD).""Housing is still strong,"" he said. ""Interest rates are still low. Consumers are OK. And (stock) prices have come in a little over fears of a housing slowdown.""Jeff Rottinghaus, T. Rowe Price manager of $1.6 billion Growth & Income (PRGIX) and of $314.1 million U.S. Large-Cap Core (TRULX), says stock prices in general seem fairly priced. But he likes some names in health care, where prices have been pushed down.He calls Becton Dickinson (BDX), Medtronics (MDT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) ""quiet"" because none is under political pressure over drug pricing. Becton develops medical supplies, Medtronic develops implantable cardiac devices and other products and UnitedHealth is the industry's biggest managed-care provider.Yet Rottinghaus is shopping among biotechs because prices are so beaten down.He is underweight in the tech sector. But he likes companies benefiting from the secular trend of cloud computing's growth. Those include Alphabet and Microsoft (MSFT). He also likes the sustainable secular growth of Visa (V) and Facebook.Rottinghaus also likes NextEra Energy (NEE), which has a 2.9% dividend yield.""It's the largest renewable-energy generator in the U.S.,"" he said. ""Its dividend yield is roughly 3%. But we wouldn't own it without the low-double-digit earnings growth we expect from them.""Growth-oriented sectors led stock funds' third-quarter charge. Science-technology funds zoomed ahead 13.21% for the quarter on top of a 2.89% September gain.Health-biotechnology funds were also strong, manufacturing gains of 6.84% and 5.83% in the quarter.Small-cap growth funds gained 8.19% on average, leading all U.S. diversified stock fund categories. That left them up 6.84% for the year. Their September gain was 1.16%. RELATED:Stock Fund Managers Seek Scarce Profits In Durable-Growth StocksMarket Treaded Water In August As Investors Shifted To Growth Stocks

417,UNH,"The Obama administration told insurers on Friday that, as expected, they will get a big fat zero from ObamaCare's risk corridor program to offset billions in 2015 losses. But in a surprise twist, the Department of Health and Human Services essentially invited insurers to join in lawsuits against the government so that talks of a financial settlement can get started.That might be positive news for the likes of UnitedHealth (UNH), Anthem (ANTM) and Aetna (AET), which have been treating their risk-corridor receivables as a lost cause, and for Humana (HUM), which says it's owed $542 million under the program. HealthNet, acquired this year by Centene (CNC), is owed $212.5 million for excess losses suffered in 2014 and 2015.The biggest beneficiaries would be Blue Cross Blue Shield plans that have sustained massive losses and the nonprofit health cooperatives that have been driven out of business.HHS confirmed in the memo that any money collected under the risk corridor program for 2015 will be used to shrink its massive $2.5 billion shortfall in 2014, ""and no funds will be available at this time for 2015 benefit year risk corridors payments.""The twist came at the end: ""We know that a number of issuers have sued in federal court seeking to obtain the risk corridors amounts that have not been paid to date. As in any lawsuit, the Department of Justice is vigorously defending those claims on behalf of the United States. However, as in all cases where there is litigation risk, we are open to discussing resolution of those claims. We are willing to begin such discussions at any time.""Yet the prospect of a settlement is sure to stir a backlash among Republicans in Congress. Further, there's reason to doubt whether the U.S. faces much litigation risk based on past precedent. Lastly, HHS has been warning insurers that all risk corridor payments were ""subject to the availability of appropriations"" since early 2014 — well before 2015 premium prices were finalized. To the extent that the U.S. faces any risk of losing in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, that risk would seem to be limited to debts incurred in 2014.Health Republic of Oregon filed a $5 billion class-action lawsuit on behalf of insurers stiffed by the Obama administration risk corridor program, but the court hasn't yet granted class-action status, which would allow all insurers to sue as a group.The risk-corridor program, in its third and final year, transfers funds from firms that make ""excessive"" profits to those with excessive losses. (Excessive is defined as more than 3 percentage points of premiums net of administrative and related costs.)Those profits and losses were originally expected to balance out, but because ObamaCare customers turned out to be older and more costly than expected, few ObamaCare plans have been earning excess profits. For 2014, the roughly 50% of excess profits paid to the government came to just $362 million, while the 50% (or more) of excess losses amounted to $2.9 billion.While a number of analyses have found that ObamaCare losses deepened in 2015, and 2016 is shaping up to be a bad year as well, the Obama administration is still calculating how much insurers will have to pay out in excess profits for 2015 and how much they'll be owed for excess losses.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Managed Care group is ranked No. 172 out of 197 industry groups by IBD based on stock performance. But there have been plenty of health-related winners lately. Find out how Veeva Systems helps drug giants get new treatments to market.

418,UNH,"As it has been doing since the spring of 2014, HHS continued to send mixed messages about making good on its promises. On one hand, HHS said that in the event of a shortfall, the department ""will explore other sources of funding for risk corridors payments, subject to the availability of appropriations. This includes working with Congress on the necessary funding for outstanding risk corridors payments.""That sounds iffy, at best, which is why UnitedHealth said in its latest 10-K filing with the SEC that ""We have not recorded any receivables under the temporary risk corridor program for 2014 or 2015 due to uncertainty over the level of government funding for this program and the ultimate collectability of these funds.""On the other hand, the memo suggests that the government can't duck its liability: ""HHS recognizes that the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary to make full payments to issuers. HHS will record risk corridors payments due as an obligation of the United States Government for which full payment is required.""While insurers have plenty of reason to be upset that risk corridors hasn't lived up to their promises, legal precedents raise a big doubt that those insurers are entitled to a court judgment.The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service studied the question and found a somewhat similar case involving plaintiffs who were entitled to funds under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program but were denied their fair share because the appropriated funds had been spent. The court found that plaintiffs couldn't be made whole by funds from the government's Judgment Fund and the only recourse was for the overseeing agency ""to seek additional appropriations from Congress.""RELATED:Health-Services Spending Takes Off, Raising Political RiskGovernment Survey Confirms Slowdown In U.S. Health Insurance GainsAetna's Exit From Most Exchanges Is Ominous For ObamaCare

Meanwhile Japan's SoftBank (SFTBY) announced it will buy U.K. chip designer ARM Holdings (ARMH), while the Justice Department blocked two big health insurance merger deals.The S&P 500 and Dow hit fresh highs while the Nasdaq set new 2016 bests as all three rose modestly for a fourth straight weekly gain. Facebook (FB), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) were among a slew of stocks hitting buy points, though Facebook's low-volume breakout struggled. Several other highly rated big names are close to entry points. Oil prices retreated to below $45 a barrel.Internet television network Netflix attracted just 1.68 million new customers in the second quarter vs. its target for 2.5 million. For Q3, Netflix expects to add 2.3 million new subscribers, vs. analyst estimates for 3.7 million. Netflix blamed the slowing subscriber growth on increased churn related to price increases for longtime subscribers. It also said the Summer Olympics will put the brakes on new subscriber gains in August. Netflix topped profit views, but shares sank nearly 13% for the week.Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk unveiled his ambitious, long-term plans for the electric car company in combination with SolarCity (SCTY), which Tesla aims to acquire in a $2.8 billion offer. Plans include a new kind of pickup and minibus, as well as a compact SUV and a commercial truck. All of this as Tesla struggles to meet its production goals. The expansive report gave no indication about when Tesla will be consistently profitable. Tesla stock fell more than 3% on Thursday after the ""masterplan"" was released, but rose close to 1% for the week, holding above the 200-day line.Tesla will hold a ""grand opening"" event July 29 for its Gigafactory, though the Reno, Nev., battery plant is far from finished.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla stock is still trying to recover and the company has report several quarters of losses.

Microsoft shares rose 5.3% to 56.57 this week, close to a buy point of 56.87.Japan's SoftBank will pay $32 billion to acquire ARM Holdings, which designs chips for the Apple (AAPL) iPhone, as well as for most other smartphones and the booming Internet of Things market. The deal occurred after the Brexit vote caused the British pound to tumble vs. the yen. SoftBank plans to expand ARM's overseas headcount over the next five years. But some analysts wonder: Can SoftBank maintain ARM's vendor-neutral approach?ARM shares have soared 40% so far this week. SoftBank fell nearly 11%. Sprint (S), majority-owned by SoftBank, slid 7.6%.Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) Q2 EPS sank 80% to 87 cents, while revenue fell 17% to $998.4 million. Both missed views.

Shares fell Thursday but rose 2.3% for the week.EBay (EBAY) gapped out of a base, spiking 16% for the week to a record high after reporting Q2 EPS growth of 2% to 43 cents, beating views by a penny. Revenue rose 6% to $2.2 billion, also topping. Top- and bottom-line guidance for Q3 was light, but eBay's full-year projections were strong. Yahoo (YHOO) Q2 EPS missed by a penny but revenue and Q3 revenue guidance easily beat forecasts. Reports say Verizon (VZ) may announce a Yahoo buyout deal within a few days.Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) reported mixed earnings. Intel's $13.5 billion and 59 cents earnings per share ex items for Q2 edged and topped the consensus, respectively. But Intel shares fell from an 18-month high on weaker-than-expected data center sales, though they closed the week down just 1.2%. Qualcomm reported $6 billion in sales and $1.16 EPS ex items for fiscal Q3, beating Wall Street expectations for a respective $5.58 billion and 97 cents. Qualcomm shares rose nearly 12% to a nine-month high. For fiscal Q3, Skyworks reported $751.7 million in sales and $1.24 EPS minus items, both down 7% vs. the year-earlier quarter but narrowly beating consensus expectations. Skyworks slid 8.6% on Friday and 3.8% for the week.After a long review, the Justice Department filed to block the Aetna (AET)-Humana (HUM) and Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) mergers, saying they would hurt competition and consumers. Shares rose on the news though, as investors had priced in skepticism that the deals would win approval. Meanwhile, Humana raised its EPS guidance and said it will exit many ObamaCare exchange markets next year. UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care firm, topped EPS views and said 2017 profit will improve from exiting nearly all exchanges.United Airlines (UAL) beat Q2 estimates and cut full-year carrying capacity growth, as international uncertainties weighed. The carrier also said it would reduce winter flights to the U.K. Delta Air Lines (DAL) said in the prior week that it would do the same following the nation's Brexit vote. Southwest (LUV) forecast a Q3 unit revenue decline, which would be its first this year. The carrier also missed Q2 estimates, and, like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), indicated that heavy lower-fare competition persists -- good for customers, but bad for airlines' financial results. American Airlines (AAL) reported a Q2 profit drop that wasn't as bad as expected. American also said the Brexit may help, not hurt, global carriers.The Q2 season kicked off with three solid reports from big-cap drugmakers. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat estimates and raised guidance, driven by the strength of its pharma division. Novartis (NVS) also beat Q2 estimates, but its stock fell as it warned of rising expenses related to new drug launches, and also said the FDA had rejected its biosimilar version of Amgen (AMGN) drug Neulasta. Biogen (BIIB) rose after its beat and raised, but its CEO George Scangos said he was quitting after six years.J&J stock rose modestly to a fresh high. Novartis advanced slightly, and Biogen jumped nearly 11% as biotech stocks tried to recover.General Motors (GM) reported strong Q2 profit growth, topping estimates.

Ford (F) reports next week. Volkswagen (VLKAY) is mulling building an electric vehicles plant either at its Chattanooga, Tenn., site or in Mexico.General Electric (GE) reported a 65% EPS gain for Q2, much better than expected, but industrial orders fell 16%, and core organic revenue fell too. Honeywell (HON), another diversified industrial giant, topped EPS views but missed on sales. Honeywell cut its full-year organic revenue forecast to a small drop. GE and Honeywell shares fell Friday after hitting long-term highs earlier in the week.Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year outlook after reporting Q2 results above analyst estimates, but management warned it can't sustain its current level of F-35 spending unless the defense giant gets another production contract from the Pentagon soon. The attempted coup in Turkey isn't expected to weigh on the fighter's sales or production. Textron (TXT), maker of Cessna planes and Bell helicopters, reported a 10% jump in EPS, beating analyst expectations and revenue that climbed 8.1%, also above Wall Street views. It sees full-year EPS of $2.60 to $2.80. The midpoint is under analyst estimates for $2.72.Lockheed stock hit a record high during the week, closing the week up 0.1%. Textron rose 2.8%.

The industrial sector inched up but no other S&P sector managed a gain.However, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) struck a fresh closing high of 185.42.The ETF holding 30 industrial leaders has gained 1.2% in the past five trading sessions vs. 0.6% for SPY, a proxy for the broad market.Two top stock holdings in DIA -- UnitedHealth (UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) -- outperformed after delivering quarterly reports. Both stocks surged to all-time highs.UnitedHealth, the nation's top insurer, reported healthy customer adds in its pharmacy benefit unit. Johnson & Johnson beat on the top and bottom lines. The maker of medical and consumer products also boosted its full-year guidance.Other major earnings have disappointed, including Netflix (NFLX). The online TV streaming service dumped 13% Tuesday after it reported lackluster subscriber growth.The mixed corporate reports are putting investors on edge.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) eked out a mild gain in choppy trade Tuesday.The ETF tracks the price of gold and sits 3% below its 52-week high. Gold prices have recently come under pressure from higher risk appetite among investors and robust economic data that could potentially give the Federal Reserve the gunpowder it needs to raise interest rates. Higher rates weigh on gold, a nonyielding haven asset.PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP) gapped up Tuesday to reclaim the 200-day moving average.The dollar hit its high level since March against other major world currencies buoyed in part by strong U.S. housing data.

422,UNH,"The Dow Jones industrial average has reclaimed the ground it lost after the U.K.'s vote last month to leave the European Union -- and then some. The blue-chip index rose to record highs in the past week.But some Dow stocks have been dogs. Apple (AAPL), Goldman Sachs (GS), Boeing (BA), Nike (NKE) and American Express (AXP) are the biggest year-to-date laggards.Goldman Sachs is down 10.3% so far this year, the worst on the 30-stock Dow. A turbulent trading environment weighing on the bank's financial performance. But Goldman is up 8.8% so far in July. Fellow Dow financial JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported strong second-quarter results on Thursday. Goldman Sachs reports its Q2 results on Tuesday.Cheap fuels also has hurt aircraft maker Boeing, the Dow's second-worst performer. Cheap fuel has given airlines less of an incentive to order new jets and allowed them to hold onto older, less-fuel-efficient planes for longer. That environment, however, could change as some carriers, like Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL), begin to see higher fuel costs.But Airbus (EADSY) easily trumped Boeing for jet orders at the Farnborough Airshow in the past week.Boeing shares are down 8.4% year-to-date.American Express, the third-worst Dow performer, is down 8.3% year to date. The credit card issuer's partnership with Costco (COST) ended this year, and other partners like JetBlue (JBLU) and Fidelity have also bailed. Amex's stock price was gutted in January after the company forecast a difficult road ahead. The company had also been contending with low gas prices and the strong dollar.IBD's TAKE: Not all Dow stocks are laggards. UnitedHealth (UNH) is up about 20% so far this year. UNH cleared a short base pattern on June with a 135.21 buy point. The stock is just in range up to 141.97. United Health, the largest health insurer, reports Q2 earnings on Tuesday.Nike has suffered as Under Armour (UA), its much smaller but very ambitious rival, steps up competition in apparel and sponsorships. Nike shares have slid 7.4% so far this year.Meanwhile, Apple is down 6.2% year-to-date amid concerns of slowing iPhone sales. Apple has lost more than 20% since it joined the Dow in March 2015.On the bright side, shares have risen for three straight weeks and retaken the 50-day line.The tech giant holds its fiscal third-quarter earnings call on July 26. Expect another profit and sales decline after Apple reported its first revenue drop in a decade in the prior quarter.

424,UNH,"Big- and mega-cap stocks continued to rally broadly at lunchtime Tuesday, while utility stocks declined. With 8 of the 30 components rising at least 1%, the Dow Jones industrial average struck an all-time high.The Dow rose 0.7% after hitting an intraday high of 18,363.72, eclipsing the prior all-time peak of 18,351.36 set on May 19, 2015. The Dow, up more than 5% since Jan. 1, has now rallied 184% from its February 2009 low of 6469.89.Financial and commodity-related stocks helped lead the Dow. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) each rallied more than 1%. Both stocks have been struggling to reassert their leadership amid stale top- and bottom-line results. In Goldman's case, Q2 profit is forecast to shrink 36% to $3.02 a share.JPMorgan, which issues results Thursday, is expected to see only a 7% EPS decline as it continues to benefit from strength in consumer-oriented lending. Research from S&P Global Market Intelligence notes that industrial companies within the S&P 500 are expected to grow profits in the second quarter by 6.5%, second only to the consumer discretionary sector (+9.4%).The Nasdaq composite rallied 0.7%, helped by tech giant Apple (AAPL), which rose 0.4%. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, while the small-cap S&P 600 jumped 1.4%. The Dow utility average slipped nearly 1%, but it was still up more than 22% since Jan. 1.In terms of Tuesday's gains, DuPont de Nemours (DD) led the blue chips in the Dow, rising more than 3% to 66.26 and rebounding back above its 200-day moving average in heavy volume. The chemicals titan has been forming a long, deep base since peaking at 80.65 in March last year. While earnings are seen falling 6% in the second quarter, the consensus estimate has been revised higher.DuPont's 65 Relative Price Strength Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, reflects the stock's long sideways motion. Within the Dow, five components hold a healthy RS rank of 80 or higher, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Chevron (CVX), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and 3M (MMM).Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, No. 1-ranked data center operator CoreSite Realty (COR) fell in heavy volume for a second straight session, down almost 1% to 87.29. But the stock still has a comfortable price cushion above its rising 50-day moving average.As seen in Monday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend. This means an investor has a higher probability of making money when buying breakouts of high-quality growth stocks at proper buy points.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

425,UNH,"Humana (HUM) shares slid nearly 10% Thursday, its worst one-day loss in years, on reports that the Department of Justice is seriously concerned about the planned $37 billion takeover by Aetna (AET).A report in antitrust trade publication MLex also said a meeting had been set up for the Department of Justice and the companies to discussed the proposed merger. The report noted that investigators are mostly concerned about whether the merger could limit consumer choices for Medicare Advantage health plans for seniors. Bloomberg also reported that Aetna will meet with top DOJ officials Friday.Aetna was prepared to sell several billion dollars of assets to meet regulatory requirements for the merger, Bloomberg last week reported. That report, citing sources close to the situation, said that Aetna had identified assets that it believed would reduce overlap between its operations and those of Humana. Humana is a big player in the growing market for Medicare Advantage insurance, making it an appealing target for Aetna. The development comes amid a consolidation wave in the health insurance industry.Cigna (CI) last year reportedly turned down multiple takeover offers before reaching an agreement with Anthem (ANTM). In recent weeks reports have said regulators are skeptical.Humana revenue growth has slowed over the last three quarters from 12% to 9%, 8% and 0% last quarter.Shares closed down 9.6% at 162.74 in the stock market today, crashing through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Aetna fell 4%.IBD'S TAKE: Humana's IBD Composite Rating is down to 46, meaning that 54% of all stocks have performed better on key criteria such as earnings and share price performance. See how HUM and AET stack up vs. rivals in IBD Stock Checkup.UnitedHealth (UNH), world's largest health insurer with about $165 billion annual revenue, stands to gain as Aetna-Humana -- and Anthem-Cigna --- negotiations drag out. The merger would create a company that, although still not as large at UnitedHealth, would be a more serious rival.UnitedHealth slid 1.1% after hitting a record high on Wednesday. Anthem fell 2% and Cigna lost 1%.

426,UNH,"They're leaving!After weeks of U.K. public opinion swinging back and forth, on Thursday the United Kingdom shockingly voted to leave the European Union. The outcome forced the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron.Early Friday, the British pound plunged as much as 11% and the euro sagged as much as 4%. U.S. markets were expected to be highly volatile Friday. The turmoil was expected to put the kabosh on any Federal Reserve interest-rate hike in the near term.Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said, ""There is little point in investors taking precipitate portfolio action, as selling what you wish you had sold yesterday is rarely the right reaction in markets dominated by position-adjustment and recalibration of expectations. Better to wait for opportunities to be revealed by volatility than to be part of it.""Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy, State Street Global Markets, said, ""In the three months before the referendum it was noticeable that international investors increased their holdings of U.K. equities ... in spite of the uncertainties created by the vote. The only place where investor behavour changed was in the currency market where investors hedged their currency risk. While this hedging has proven prescient given sterling's depreciation following the vote, the key question now is whether international investors will now seek to reduce their underlying holdings of U.K. assets. If the uncertainty following the leave vote persists and because investors bought rather than sold U.K. assets before the vote, there is a heightened risk of outflows from both U.K. equities . . .""So how should U.S. investors play the situation?Mutual fund managers and investment strategists with whom Investor's Business Daily spoke advised investors to stick with their long-term investment plans. Still, some say they had hedged their exposure to the pound and euro.Several said that within their overall strategy they are tilting toward U.S. stocks, especially those that draw little if any of their revenues from abroad. Some are tilting toward emerging markets.A key question facing U.S. investors is: Should you trim your weightings to stocks, mutual funds or ETFs with exposure to the U.K. or the rest of Europe? That would cut your losses if U.K. or other European stocks lose more ground.But what if you get out and the market rallies without you?""You can miss a lot of whatever rally takes place,"" said David Tannehill, head of the investment group of Regions Wealth Management.And the question does not become moot now that the voting has concluded. The vote for Brexit starts a two-year process in which the U.K. and EU would renegotiate a bevy of trade pacts. Prospects for U.K. and continental stocks almost certainly would rise and fall like a teeter-totter on every little stock market news report.""Markets will not stop functioning during those two years,"" said Alessio de Longis, who is a manager of four OppenheimerFunds with assets totaling $1.6 billion. ""It will be a period of extended volatility.""De Longis, who also leads macro strategy for the global multi-asset group at OppenheimerFunds,  thinks it will not be a seismic disturbance for which investors must reshape their investment plans.""We don't expect it to be a (systemically disruptive) event with catastrophic market action,"" he said. ""We may get one month of volatility and noise and erratic action. But at the end of the day, it won't be a Lehman Bros.-type event. It won't force the rest of the market to make fire sales, stop trading and disrupt capital flows.""Late last year, de Longis' team hedged all of its British pound sterling and almost all of its euros by shorting currency forwards. In addition, his team went long on the Japanese yen with currency forwards, betting that it will appreciate as investors seek non-European safe havens.Since Dec. 31, De Longis' team has also more than doubled his $1.5 billion Global Allocation Fund's (QVGIX) weight in emerging markets stocks.As of April 30, its emerging markets stocks included China's internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), India's real estate lender Housing Development Finance and its media company Zee Entertainment Enterprises, Korea's cigarette seller KT&G, chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Brazil's stock exchange operator BM&F Bovespa, according to Morningstar Inc.At this point, de Longis cautions investors, it is probably too late to hedge the pound or euro.""With the pound sterling, volatility is insanely high and bid-ask spreads -- for, say, one-week or one-month options -- are very expensive,"" he said. Over the long term, it would typically take just a 0.5% drop in value for a hedge to become profitable. By Tuesday, it took a 2.5% move.Bob Doll, a manager of nine Nuveen Asset Management funds with $1.1 billion in assets, intends to stick by his broader, overall investment plan.""There is more economic weakness and more uncertainty outside the U.S. than inside,"" he said. ""Therefore, I have chosen companies that get most of their revenues here. With or without Brexit, this is the best house in a bad neighborhood.""Doll, who who is also Nuveen's chief equity strategist, has lightened his exposure to multinationals. Also, he lightened exposure to financials in April.His flagship $250 million Large Cap Core Fund (NLACX) had 99% of its shareholders' money at work in North American stocks as of May 31. The balance of its holdings were in Asian emerging markets.Apple (AAPL), Home Depot (HD), Cisco (CSCO), Intel (INTC) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) were his top five holdings.Like Doll, Anna Rathbun, director of research for CBIZ Retirement Plan Services, tilts toward U.S. stocks as safer than U.K. and EU equities. She also favors small caps.Aside from the Brexit question, she has been waiting for emerging markets stocks to rally. She says they are undervalued and have become one of the few options for yield-hungry investors in a low-rate world.She's also keeping an eye on beaten-down European stocks.If Brexit had been defeated, her team intended to add that market to the mix of undervalued securities. Natural resources producer Glencore is one such name.""Europe has benefited from the recovery in commodity prices,"" Rathbun said. ""They suffered from a quick drop. But they are diversified and positioned to do well.""The dollar has trended down since February, which has buoyed commodity prices. The downside risk for Glencore is that commodity prices are tied to the price of the dollar. If the Federal Reserve raises rates, that would strengthen the dollar, putting downward pressure on commodity prices.Among U.S. stocks, she likes paint maker Sherwin-Williams (SHW).""We have seen delayed spending by consumers since the 2008 crash and recession,"" Rathbun said. ""But if they can spend on things that build equity like homes, they do. We've seen a lot of home improvement projects.""
"
427,UNH,"Financial markets and the Federal Reserve have been giving a preview of the fallout from a U.K. vote to leave the European Union: lower stock prices, lower Treasury yields and a higher dollar.The vote tally late Thursday pointed to the Leave camp winning. U.S. stock futures are selling off very hard overnight, but analysts generally agree that U.S. stocks would likely be much more attractive under Brexit than U.K. or European equities.Morgan Stanley has said it expects European equities to sink 15% within six months of a Brexit vote, while the euro sinks 11.5% vs. the dollar.""While the U.S. won't be immune if the world turns more nationalistic and protectionist, it will be less adversely affected than most other countries,"" wrote Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. ""That's because the U.S. economy is more resilient, diversified and self-contained than all other ones.""Retail, food and utility stock groups have been among the market's top-performing industries in recent weeks. Some homebuilder stocks are near breakouts, with lower-for-longer rates providing support to the housing sector.Health care can be attractive as a steady growth sector. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is trading near highs, outperforming the general market for months.More domestic-focused companies may be an even surer bet for two reasons.First, upward pressure on the dollar is a drag on the earnings of multinationals such as General Electric (GE) that derive a large percentage of sales and profits from exports and overseas operations.As Citigroup strategists noted: ""The dollar's relative weakness in 2016 has been important for broader (second-half of 2016) S&P 500 EPS expectations, and thus a strengthening of the buck would imply that downward earnings pressures could be revived and act as a new restraint on share prices.""Further, a Brexit vote is seen as possibly tipping the U.K. into recession and acting as a drag on already-tepid growth in the EU and around the globe.Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said earlier this month that if Brexit becomes a reality, the firm will cut its 2017 growth forecast from 2.4% to zero for the U.K., and to 1.0% from 1.8% for the euro zone.That would mean ""another year of the global economy being stuck in low gear,"" Behravesh said.With emerging markets, commodities prices and U.S. multinationals' foreign earnings taking a hit from Brexit, Ram Gandikota, senior portfolio manager at Ativo Capital Management, expects U.S. consumer-focused stocks and defensive areas like utilities to benefit. Gold is likely to rise as investors ""flock to safety assets in the short term,"" he said.Gold and gold-related stocks and ETFs also have done well.The severity of the economic consequences from the pro-Brexit vote are hard to predict. One concern is that Brexit reflects broader discontent with centralized European institutions, including the euro monetary regime that the U.K. never joined.The economic and financial market disruption from the Brexit the will put more pressure on remaining EU members to make their fiscal, banking and immigration agreements more effective and palatable. Otherwise, anti-European-establishment political parties may continue to strengthen and follow the U.K.'s lead.Without the U.K. paying its membership dues, countries like Spain and Germany will be called on to pay more, Gandikota said. He sees prospects for further European integration ""getting worse and worse"" as public sentiment deteriorates. If the U.K. manages to endure Brexit without much hardship, the outlook for the eurozone will become even worse, because it would make leaving the EU seem less scary, he said.A Brexit vote would put more pressure on central banks to do more. The European Central Bank reportedly has promised to backstop financial markets if U.K. votes to ""Leave."" Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen noted last Wednesday that a pro-Brexit vote would likely impact Fed policy in the months to come. The Bank of Japan may also have to take more extreme measures to limit an expected further rise in the yen.Lower interest rates for longer may be a positive for the U.S. housing and auto sectors. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged just 3.56% in the past week, Freddie Mac said on Thursday.But automaker stocks have been weak, partly on global sales concerns but also on fears that U.S. demand is near a peak.Housing looks a like a more attractive opportunity than autos, Yardeni said. Health care is another domestic-focused area where investors can find healthy growth relative to ""a world of secular stagnation,"" he said.On the other hand, U.S. banks will continue to face a tough environment with low rates contributing to narrow net interest margins. Bank of America (BAC) reportedly will lay off as many as 8,000 employees in its consumer division.Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods expect an earnings hit to JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and other big banks from weaker capital markets activity in the U.K.A pro-Brexit vote would likewise hurt American Airlines (AAL) and other global carriers, such as United Continental (UAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL). It would disrupt business travel in the short run as companies put decisions on hold. Slower economic growth in Europe would be a longer-term problem.
"
428,UNH,"ObamaCare's employer mandate has largely struck out when it comes to getting employers in low-wage industries to provide health coverage to their workers, new Labor Department data confirm.Private service-occupation employers paid even less for employee health benefits in the first quarter of 2016 -- just 89 cents per hour of work -- than they paid before ObamaCare became law in 2010. That compares to health benefits of $2.71 per hour for workers in production occupations and $3.81 per hour of work for managers and professionals.The data help shed light on one of ObamaCare's harshest, though little-discussed, realities: The law has thrown millions of low-wage, full-time workers under the bus.Full-time workers are ineligible for exchange subsidies if their employers offer ""affordable"" coverage that costs much more than their modest-wage workers are likely to pay. The rules don't just hurt workers; they also narrow the potential pool of exchange members, leaving a sicker group of customers that has swamped the likes of UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana (HUM) with losses and forced them to the exits in a number of states.The accommodation and food service industries still pay just 65 cents per work hour in insurance benefits, up a mere six cents in the past six years. Wendy's (WEN) initially expected its health insurance tab to jump by $25,000 per restaurant, but cut that to $5,000 before the law got off the ground in 2013 because the fast-food chain found few interested employees.Retailers now pay $1.25 per hour of work on employee insurance benefits, virtually unchanged from $1.24 per hour in early 2010. While Wal-Mart (WMT) said it faced $500 million in extra health benefit costs in 2014 (and responded by eliminating coverage for some part-time workers), other companies whose employment policies don't face such intense scrutiny have had a relatively easy time escaping the law's costs.The real fear about the ObamaCare employer mandate was that employers would cut workers' hours below 30 per week to dodge the fines for failing to offer suitable coverage. As Goldman Sachs pointed out this week, that's happened to at least a modest extent and partly explains why 2 million more people are stuck working part-time than a decade ago.Still, companies haven't had to resort to cutting workers to part-time in a major way because employers have figured out how to minimize their liability under the law. The New York Times reported that insurance takeup by fewer than 10% of low-wage workers is commonplace. While some may call it gaming the system, ObamaCare rules have invited such strategies despite their serious consequences. A few million full-time, modest-wage workers -- and their spouses -- have remained uninsured, with many liable for ObamaCare individual mandate penalties. Another roughly 1 million low-wage workers have opted for the kind of coverage that ObamaCare was supposed to do away with: skinny plans that won't cover hospitalization or surgery but will let them avoid paying an individual mandate penalty.Many other full-time, modest-wage workers are getting more comprehensive coverage via their employers -- but with $5,000-plus deductibles that could easily torpedo their finances in a health emergency.These are the direct effects of rules that deny full-time workers access to ObamaCare subsidies and let employers escape a fine -- if they offer bronze-level coverage costing a worker close to 10% of wage income for premiums alone. For a full-time worker earning $17,500, paying $1,690 for bronze coverage qualifies as ""affordable."" That's $1,000 more than someone at the same income level would have to pay for an exchange plan that caps total out-of-pocket expenses at about $550 in 2016.The fact that low-wage industries are relying more on part-time workers, who get almost nothing in health benefits, is one reason that their health insurance compensation costs per work hour have stayed roughly flat. Still, it's becoming increasingly clear that ObamaCare is of basically no help to low-wage full-time workers, and it is an outright negative in cases where those workers owe a fine for going uninsured.This is not at all how Democrats envisioned the future when the law passed. In fact, ObamaCare includes a provision that requires companies to provide the same coverage to rank-and-file workers as they do to the CEO. More than six years later, the IRS has yet to translate that pie-in-the-sky goal as a workable regulation.

429,UNH,"Target (TGT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) raised their quarterly dividends Wednesday, following in the footsteps of FedEx (FDX), which pumped up its dividend by 60% on Tuesday.Many U.S. companies have been accumulating cash as wage inflation remains low and the economy continues a slow, steady improvement, and are now moving to increase returns to investors.Big-box discount department store operator Target hiked its dividend 7.5% to 60 cents a share after holding its dividend steady at 56 cents a share for the prior four quarters. The increase will mark the 45th straight year that Target has increased its dividend.Target stock formed a nearly seven-month-long cup-with-handle base from mid-2015 to late April when it edged above an 84.10 buy point to touch 84.14. But it failed to break out and has fallen about 18% from that point.Shares closed up 0.6% in the stock market today. UnitedHealth shares climbed 2.5%. FedEx dipped less than 0.1%.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest managed-care health insurer, lifted its dividend 25% to 62.5 cents a share, up from 50 cents, to be paid on June 28. UnitedHealth Group President and Chief Financial Officer David Wichmann said in a written statement the company is paying the dividend ""while remaining focused on costs and value.""No. 2 U.S. package delivery service FedEx late Tuesday raised its dividend to 40 cents a share from 25 cents, payable on July 1. FedEx stock has been forming a flat base for a little more than a month, with a 169.40 buy point.

430,UNH,"Stocks held modest gains in afternoon trading Wednesday, as Dave & Buster's (PLAY) and Lululemon Athletica (LULU) soared following their quarterly results.The Dow rose nearly 0.4%, topping 18,000 intraday for a second straight session. The blue-chip index last closed above 18,000 in late April. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% as well, reaching 2,120, at least intraday, after finding resistance there Tuesday. The benchmark index is less than 1% from its all-time high.

Meat products, gaming software and oil stocks lagged, despite a nearly 2% rise in West Texas Intermediate crude to above $51 a barrel amid a supply disruption in Nigeria.Lululemon Athletica rose 5% to about 71.50, stretching past a 69.83 handle buy point in robust trade to its highest level since December 2013. The yoga apparel maker reported Q1 earnings that missed views but revenue that beat. Same-store sales climbed 3%, or 5% on a constant dollar basis. The midpoint of its Q2 profit and sales guidance fell just short of consensus forecasts.Is your stock one of the best in its group?

The tech-leaning index has recently been dawdling like Lincoln's Civil War army under General McClellan — within striking distance but afraid to attack. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 cleared resistance at 2100 Monday and is adding to the cushion. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each rose 0.4%.Volume in the stock market today was running modestly higher on both major exchanges.Blue chips were mostly up. In the Dow, winners led losers by a 5-to-2 ratio. Dow member UnitedHealth Group (UNH) popped almost 3% in heavy volume. The stock broke out Thursday in volume 30% above average. Bigger volume didn't kick in until today. The stock carries an IBD Composite Rating of 87, putting it in the top 13 percentile among the stocks in IBD's database. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number.The IBD 50, a proxy for leading stocks, was relatively quiet. Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) broke out with a 9% gap up in torrid volume. The proper buy point was 42.22, 10 cents above the long handle's high. The handle began forming in mid-April.

432,UNH,"The Obama administration moved Wednesday to crack down on one of the only alternatives to buying an ObamaCare plan in the individual health market.Sales of short-term insurance, for periods of less than a year, have surged in the past few years as relatively young, healthy and middle-class households found they could save a bundle on coverage -- even while paying the individual mandate penalty.Now the Department of Health and Human Services plans to effectively eliminate that alternative to ObamaCare-compliant plans by narrowing the allowable length of short-term coverage to under three months.That seems likely to largely close the door on insurers who saw this lightly regulated segment as an opportunity to make money in the individual market. UnitedHealth (UNH) has sought to tap this opportunity, even as it plans to pull out of almost all of the 35 ObamaCare exchanges where it's operating this year.But UnitedHealth may be more pleased about another Obama administration effort to stabilize the exchange-related markets as insurers are proposing double-digit rate hikes for 2017.HHS said it will revise its risk-adjustment program that’s meant to neutralize the risk that some insurers will rack up losses because they attract higher-cost members, even as others with low-cost members reap profits. By all accounts, the program has done a poor job. As a result, insurers offering broader networks and lower deductibles have taken a financial hit.The risk-adjustment model was based on the experience of the large-group employer market. Yet the ObamaCare exchange market is far different, with a large percentage of customers buying policies for only part of the year and often dropping coverage after running up big bills.UnitedHealth and Aetna (AET) were among the insurers who have complained about short-term customers. On the other hand, Centene (CNC), with typically high-deductible plans and narrow networks, has said it experienced no such issues. Now, HHS says that risk-adjustment will be changed in 2017 to factor in the behavior of partial-year enrollees. Then, in 2018, it will start taking into account prescription drug utilization.In announcing the plan to cut the allowable length of short-term plans to under three months, the Obama administration criticized insurers in that market for engaging in abusive practices.""Some issuers are now offering short-term limited-duration plans to consumers as their primary form of health coverage for periods that last nearly 12 months, allowing them to target only the healthiest consumers while avoiding consumer protections,"" the HHS press release said.Such policies don't have to abide by ObamaCare (Affordable Care Act) rules. As HHS put it: ""They can be priced based on health status ... can discriminate against consumers with pre-existing conditions, and do not have to cover essential health benefits.""To the extent that more attractive short-term policies keep the young and healthy out of the exchange risk pools, rates inside the exchange will be higher, and HHS warned that the problem could grow over time.But the fact that the administration is taking action to stop people who pay the individual mandate penalty from buying plans to their liking also should raise serious questions about ObamaCare. The growth of the short-term insurance market -- by more than 100%, according to a Wall Street Journal report -- is an indication of just how bad a deal many people think they get from ObamaCare.

433,UNH,"Shares of Aetna (AET) spiked nearly 4% to a nine-month high in the stock market today after the health insurance giant said it plans to issue some $13 billion in bonds to help pay for its purchase of Humana (HUM). Meanwhile, rival UnitedHealth (UNH) touched a new high.Aetna's big planned debt issuance is a sign that it expects to be able to close its Humana deal ultimately, despite tough regulatory scrutiny. Aetna in July said it would buy Humana for $37 billion, amid a wave of consolidation in the health care industry spurred in part by the Affordable Care Act.Aetna rose 4.1% to 120.03 on the stock market today. Aetna continues to climb out of a consolidation begun a year ago. But the midpoint of the handle is slightly below the midpoint of the base -- making the formation less than ideal for buying. The stock may form another, proper entry point as it builds the right side of its base.Humana followed Aetna's lead Wednesday, jumping 5.6%.UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's largest health insurer, broke out of a five-week flat base above a prior base, rising 1.1% to 136.04. It hit a record 136.15 intraday.How healthy is UnitedHealth stock, and how does it compare to rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupUnitedHealth last month said it would pull out of most Affordable Care Act exchanges next year after struggling, like others, to find profitability in the marketplaces. However, exchange enrollment has comprised a small portion of the UnitedHealth's overall business.Managed care and several other medical groups rallied Thursday. Medical stocks often do well in markets that are choppy or grinding higher because they offer growth that is largely insulated from economic swings.
"
434,UNH,"Humana (HUM) wasn't kidding when it hinted last week of big premium hikes for 2017 in those ObamaCare markets where it remains.This year, the nation's fifth-largest insurer offers the cheapest bronze and silver plans in Michigan's largest market, including Detroit. But Humana has filed for a 50% premium hike for its low-cost silver plan.The unsubsidized cost for a 40-year-old will jump from $210 a month to $315, if approved. On top of that, the maximum out-of-pocket cost for plan members will rise 9%, to $7,150 from $6,300 in 2016.Meanwhile, Humana wants a 38% premium increase for its lowest-cost bronze plan, from $178 a month to $246.Rate requests for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, an important player in the state, aren't yet available. But Humana isn't the only exchange participant eyeing massive premium hikes. Health Alliance Plan, a subsidiary of the Henry Ford Health System, has requested 30% premium hikes for its least expensive bronze and silver plans.But one carrier, so far, stands out as an exception. Molina Healthcare (MOH), is seeking just a 2% premium hike for its lowest cost bronze and silver plans. Even so, Molina's requested premium for its lowest-cost silver plan is 11% higher than Humana's this year, $234 per month vs. $210 for a 40-year-old. Also, while keeping its bronze premium hike to a minimum, Molina is boosting its deductible by one-third, to $6,650 from $5,000.Still, it appears that Molina, which was already one of the lowest-priced insurers in the state, may have an opportunity to grow by leaps and bounds in Michigan.Molina and Centene (CNC), another Medicaid managed care provider that established an individual market presence with the launch of ObamaCare, have seen exchange enrollment surge. Molina said its ObamaCare exchange membership more than doubled to 630,000 in the first quarter from 266,000 a year ago. But Molina's management said on its first-quarter earnings call that the customer growth was far more than it expected and acknowledged being overwhelmed by customer gains from Medicaid, exchanges and acquisitions. Earnings slipped to 43 cents per share from 56 cents a year ago.Molina seemed to indicate that its higher-than-expected costs stemmed from Medicaid enrollees, saying that the company expects 2016 exchange customers will tend toward the healthy side based on demographics that are similar to 2015 customers. Still, the recent slip-up and the huge premium hikes being sought by rivals raise a question of whether Molina has a secret sauce that's letting it deliver care much more efficiently or whether it risks getting swamped by unexpectedly high costs.Another unknown for Molina is how it will be impacted by ObamaCare's evolving risk-adjustment program. That program is supposed to balance risk among all insurers by transferring funds from carriers which attract low-cost customers to those that are a magnet for the sick. Risk adjustment hasn't worked as intended for a variety of reasons, including the failure to consider customer use of prescription drugs in weighing an insurer’s risk, but there seems to be growing recognition that the deck has been stacked against insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH) and nonprofit Blue Cross Blue Shield, with plans which have attracted sicker customers.UnitedHealth has said it will exit all but a handful of state exchanges for 2017. Humana, which is aiming to close its merger with Aetna (AET) in the second half of 2016, has already declared its intention to pull out of the exchanges in Alabama, Wisconsin, Virginia and Kansas.So far only Oregon, where insurers are requesting an average 27% premium hike, and Virginia, where insurers want an 18% hike, are the only two states to make all rate filings available. 
"
435,UNH,"This year's teeter-totter market has posed special challenges for all investors. The managers of $1.3 billion USAA Aggressive Growth (USAUX) are no exceptions.Over the past year going into Wednesday, the fund has outperformed 72% of its rival large-cap growth mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. by losing less than most of them. The fund has gained 4.99% in the volatile past three months, but that only tops 28% of its peers.The fund could be primed for strong performance when the stock market strengthens if the quality of its top holdings are an indication. Aggressive Growth's top 10 holdings as of March 31 included six stocks with IBD Composite Ratings of 80 or higher. The highest Comp Rating is 99. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating.In addition, holdings include Adobe Systems (ADBE), which sports a 92 Comp Rating.Trading around 95, Adobe is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 98.10 buy point. Volume has dried up as the handle forms, which is positive. But as IBD's Leaderboard analysis of the stock points out, Adobe's earlier breakout past an 88.65 handle entry within the base was successful, and from that point of view the stock is extended. Still, you could make a case that the right side of the base needed more work.Adobe has succeeded in morphing into a company that lets customers receive products through the cloud and pay a subscription fee.Is Adobe a buy or a sell? Take a free trial of IBD Leaderboard today to find outRevenue growth has sped over the past three quarters, from 9% to 21%, 22% and 25%. The fiscal second quarter ends this month. Wall Street currently expects earnings to rise 42% to 68 cents a share. That would extend the slowdown in EPS gains of 30%, 93%, 59% and 50% in the prior four quarters. It's still vigorous profit growth.Facebook (FB), another Leaderboard stock, is one of those top holdings. It has a 99 Composite Rating.EPS gains are accelerating, rising 16%, 33% 46% and 83% the past four quarters. The 83% earnings jump to 77 cents a share easily beat Wall Street estimates as did the 52% jump in revenue to $5.4 billion. The stock responded to the upbeat results by gapping up 7% April 28 and clearing a 117.09 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. It got as high as 121 before easing to just below the buy point.Facebook has gifted investors with a big 300%-plus return since it broke out past a 29.17 buy point of a double-bottom base in the week ended July 26, 2013, as IBD pointed out recently.Electronic Arts (EA) is a top new buy, which has a 95 Comp Rating.The video game publisher delivered better-than-expected earnings and sales growth last week.Q4 EPS rose 28%. That profit got a boost from EA's growing digital sales, which made up over 70% of all fourth-quarter revenue, as IBD reported on Tuesday.Also, EA had no debt last year and a solid 32% return on equity. That, plus a 46% average annual EPS growth rate over the past five years, has attracted a rising number of funds as investors. Two typically better-performing funds own shares in Electronic Arts: $12 billion Fidelity OTC (FOCPX) and $12 billion MFS Growth (MFEGX).Among other holdings, Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH) has a 99 Comp Rating and is up 16% so far this year.The maker of orthopedic and dental reconstruction implants, trauma products and related surgical products has seen EPS rise in each of the past four quarters, climbing from -2% to 30% in that span. Revenue grew 59%, 58% and 68% in the past three stanzas. The company beat consensus estimates for both EPS and revenue in Q1.The company was born from last year's $14 billion merger of Zimmer Holdings and Biomet. That created a global leader in musculoskeletal health care, which does business in more than 100 countries, IBD recently reported.Last month, Zimmer said it would take over Cayenne Medical to strengthen its sports medicine offerings.Trading near 117, the stock is within 1% of the 117.87 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base.The portfolio is run by two separate subadvisors. Winslow Capital and Wellington Management each manage about 50% of the fund. When one side's outperformance skews the split by too much, USAA rebalances by funneling inflow into the lagging portion. It also takes any shareholder redemptions from the larger portion.Winslow's Clark Winslow, Patrick Burton and Justin Kelly are somewhat more aggressive in their style, says USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the subadvisors. Wellington's manager is Paul Marrkand. ""Wellington is more conscious of valuation,"" Latif said.The subadvisors' sleeves share many names. ""But Winslow has more FANG stocks,"" said USAA analyst Julius Barnes, referring to 2015 high-flyers Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, now Alphabet (GOOGL).As of Jan. 31, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Starbucks (SBUX) were in the Winslow sleeve only.Going into Thursday, UnitedHealth was up about 11% for the year. It had an 86 Comp Rating but a weak D+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is a sign of more recent selling than buying by mutual funds over the past 13 weeks. Starbucks was down about 9% for the year. It has a so-so 70 Comp Rating and worst-possible E Accumulation/Distribution Rating.Oracle (ORCL) and PepsiCo (PEP) were two names in Wellington's sleeve only.Oracle was up 8%, but has a weak 55 Composite Rating and a D Accumulation/Distribution Rating. EPS fell the past four quarters and were flat in the two frames before that.Pepsi was up less than 1%, with a 59 Composite Rating and E Accumulation/Distribution Rating.""When we have a high-growth, bullish market, Winslow does better,"" Latif said. ""The opposite happens when the market is not led by growth and is challenged."" Wellington's sleeve has outperformed Winslow's so far this year, Latif says.

436,UNH,"Stocks fell hard in the early going amid a near-4% jump in crude oil futures and lingering uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates.Last week, amid dissension, the U.S. central bank decided it would not raise the cost of money but hinted at the possibility during its last meeting of the year in December, a month after the U.S. presidential election.The Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones industrial average both fell nearly 0.8%. The Nasdaq gained more than 1% last week. Top decliners in the Dow 30 included Goldman Sachs (GS) and managed care giant UnitedHealth Group (UNH). The latter slipped nearly 1% and undercut its 50-day moving average.But fellow Dow component Apple (AAPL) sneaked in a small gain, up 0.2% to 112.98 and up nearly 3% from a recent breakout past a 110.33 cup-with-handle buy point.The S&P 500 slipped nearly 0.7% as fiber optic telecom, foreign bank, regional bank, hospital and apparel makers paced the downside. Automaker, cement and gold mining shares, however, bucked the decline with stout gains. Tesla Motors (TSLA) advanced 0.4%, still shy of both its 50- and 200-day moving averages.Small caps moved largely in step with their large-cap peers. The S&P SmallCap 600 fell 0.5%. The index is up 12% since Jan. 1. In the stock market today, Nike (NKE) got shaken up with a 1.8% loss to 54.17, reaching a nearly two-month low. Volume was already running more than triple its usual level.The athletic shoe and apparel giant is slated to report August-ended fiscal first-quarter results Tuesday. Wall Street expects profit of 56 cents, down 16%, which would be the first year-over-year decline since 2012. Sales are seen rising 5.5% amid a strong U.S. dollar, which tends to make its products more expensive in overseas markets.Nike shares have been struggling ever since it dived hard in the week ended Nov. 13, then ran up fast to new highs two weeks later. This ""one week down, two weeks up"" action can serve as a sell signal since it's way too narrow to qualify as a proper base. A successful cup pattern is at least six weeks long while a solid flat base forms over a minimum five weeks.Nike shares then tried to form a new base in the first three months of the year. It met the time requirements for the cup, flat base and double bottom base, but action was sloppy and Nike failed to sprint to new highs as the market wavered in a mostly pressured uptrend mode.Other consumer-oriented names sank. Smith & Wesson (SWHC) gapped down more than 7% to 25.54, diving further into the belly of a four-month cup with handle that began forming in March. Watch to see if the gunmaker's stock can stay above or test buying support at the 200-day moving average. Late Friday, Smith & Wesson said it lost in a bid to replace the Beretta M9 as the U.S. Army's standard sidearm.RELATED:Stock Action Plan For This WeekWhen Did Apple Break Out?3 Critical Moves By Tesla Motors

Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart is scheduled to speak at 8 a.m. ET, and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Fed Governor Lael Brainard both are due to speak at 1 p.m. ET.Ripple effects from rate hike fears overseas and in commodities factored powerfully into premarket trade Monday.  Markets across Asia dropped hard, mirroring Friday's action in the U.S. and Europe. Hong Kong's Hang Seng outpaced other leading indexes with a 3.4% sell-off. Europe's markets were down hard, but had come partially off the lows in early afternoon trade, with London's FTSE 100 down 1.5%, the CAC 40 in Paris and Frankfurt's DAX off 1.7% apiece.Crude oil trimmed its early loss to less than 2%, with West Texas Intermediate hanging below $45 a barrel. Oil prices rose 3% last week, marking a first advance in three weeks. Gold shaved a fraction to trade below $1,328 an ounce early Monday.

"
438,UNH,"In a global market starved for growth, lead manager Justin Kelly thinks his $14.7 billion MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund (MLAAX) is about to feast like a shark amid a school of tasty fish.After losing more than twice as much ground in the first quarter than its average large-cap growth rival tracked by Morningstar Inc., the fund doubled its peer group's Q2 gain. And so far this quarter it is ahead 5.49% vs 5.21% for its peer mutual funds, going into Thursday.So what's behind the fund's sudden burst of speed? The market has tilted back toward the types of stocks favored by the fund. That includes stocks like UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which is up about 20% this year.And lead manager Justin Kelly thinks the party for growth stocks is still ramping up.""Growth stocks underperformed this year vs. what I call safety stocks,"" Kelly said. ""Safety stocks do best when the 10-year bond is declining in yield. Those are utilities, staples, telecom and REITs. They all did well in the first half of the year. But since June 30, this fund has been on a tear.""The fund focuses on stocks that grow faster than the broad market. And in the current global market, where growth overall is slow, stocks that can manage to generate above-average growth will be in greater demand, Kelly says. ""If that happens, growth stocks will do better than value, and this fund will rip!""One key to how the fund maneuvers through various markets phases: It adjusts its allocations among three types of growth stocks the managers seek.One bucket contains stocks that the fund sees as long-term sustainable earnings growers. The second bucket contains quality cyclical growers. And the third holds stocks in newer industries with rapid growth.Sustainable growers have some competitive advantage that lets them grow year after year. UnitedHealth Group is an example. Revenue for the provider of health care coverage and benefits services has grown at a double-digit pace for six quarters in a row.Broadcom (AVGO) is one of the fund's cyclicals.""They have radio frequency filters that are highly desirable and the best in the market to allow mobile phones to jump from one frequency to another,"" Kelly said. ""That gives them pricing power that few other vendors in their semiconductor industry have.""Broadcom's filters, Kelly adds, enable phones to work on networks in different countries and as a user moves from one cell tower to another.Facebook (FB) is in their bucket of stocks in newer industries with rapid growth. A top-10 holding as of June 30, its rapid growth comes from market-share gains in advertising. ""Its return on investment (for advertisers) is better than they get on other platforms like television and print,"" Kelly said. ""As more advertisers shift their dollars to the higher ROI on Facebook, we think growth will continue for years.""Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is also in the rapid-growth bucket.""Intuitive's robot (system) was starting to catch on in new surgical markets, especially for hernia cases,"" Kelly said. ""They had become widely used for prostatectomies and hysterectomies, but growth there has lagged since their heyday. Our estimate of earnings growth was above the Street's for 2016 and '17 and perhaps '18.""In the current slow-growth economic environment, the managers think their best prospects are companies with fast or steady earnings and sales growth.""We see the best opportunities in newer, faster-growing companies,"" Kelly said. ""We also like consistent growth. We are substantially overweight in newer, faster-growing companies and consistent growers, and we are underweight in cyclicals.""Still, the managers -- Clark Winslow and Patrick Burton also run the fund -- don't hibernate during markets that tilt away from their strategy. ""We took advantage of the broader pullback in the market in the spring,"" Kelly said. That's when the fund started its position in Intuitive Surgical.Also, the fund increased its stake in UnitedHealth, another top-10 holding. It was taking market share in the Medicare Advantage and Medicaid markets, said Steve Hamill, health care analyst for Winslow Capital, the fund's subadvisor. And Optum, its health services business, ""has been a tremendous growth business,"" Hamill said. It generates about 40% of UnitedHealth's earnings.Among other holdings, Activision Blizzard's (ATVI) earnings per share jumped 44% and 315% the past two quarters. The company is shifting to online gaming, away from reliance on console-based video games. That boosts margins, Kelly says.""Their next growth will come through e-sports, turning video gaming into a sport with spectators, such that people will go to Madison Square Garden to watch other gamers,"" he said.Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) is a newcomer to the portfolio. The fund began its current stake in the spring. ""Our thesis here is that this is a steady grower,"" Hamill said. ""They're the leading company in orthopedic implants and some related surgical categories.""Fundamentals slid after the merger of Zimmer and Biomet, which closed in June 2015, due to redundant sales forces and other inefficiencies, Hamill says. But now the company has cut costs. And surgeons like Zimmer Biomet's products, Hamill adds.Earlier this year, many Wall Street analysts expected the company to continue to lose share, especially in the hip and knee markets. ""We think they will grow at least as fast as the market,"" Hamill said. He thinks the company's growth will be even better in the spine and trauma markets. Revenue growth and margin expansion will be key drivers, he adds.The fund's institutional shares (MLAIX) carry no load and a 0.74% expense ratio. The $5 million minimum investment can be met at the plan or brokerage level. RELATED:Will Danoff Plus John Roth Equal Top-Performing Fidelity New Insights FundJanus Forty Managers Win With Bets On Proven Champs, Up-And-Comers And Calculated Risks Hot Hodges Mutual Fund Shines As Several Leading Stock Holdings ClimbWhy This Winning MFS Fund Prefers Stocks With Durable Growth Over Fastest Growth 
"
439,UNH,"The nation's progress in getting more people covered by health insurance slowed significantly this year, the government confirmed Wednesday in a report that tempers the Obama administration's signature achievement.About 1.3 million fewer people were uninsured the first three months of this year, driving the uninsured rate to a new record low of 8.6%, according to the National Health Interview Survey, an ongoing project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Still, that progress is a fraction of the earlier gains seen under President Barack Obama's health care law. When the law's big expansion got underway in 2014, the number of uninsured people went down by nearly 9 million.The uninsured rate has been cut by nearly half under Obama's law, but that hasn't been enough to overcome political divisions. The survey estimated that 27.3 million people remained uninsured in the first three months of this year, about 21 million fewer than in 2010, when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act.The law offers subsidized private insurance for people everywhere who don't have access to job-based coverage, along with a Medicaid expansion geared to low-income adults in states that opt for it. Although a growing economy should also be contributing to coverage gains, experts say the law deserves most of the credit.The uninsured estimates are based on a first-quarter survey and may not fully reflect the extent to which the ObamaCare exchanges have seen a steep drop off in enrollment as the year progresses. As of early February, 12.7 million people signed up for the exchanges, but there were only 11.1 million paying customers. By the end of June, reports from major public insurers including Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM), UnitedHealth (UNH), Centene (CNC), Cigna (CI), Humana (HUM) and Molina (MOH) suggest enrollment fell to about 10.5 million.Premiums are expected to surge in 2017 as UnitedHealth, Aetna and Humana all dramatically scale back their exchange presence. That could keep a lid on enrollment going forward, especially for those who don't qualify for subsidies.In another notable finding, the report said the share of working age people and dependents with high-deductible health insurance has increased and now stands at 4 out of 10. Such plans require patients to pay a sizable share of their medical bills before insurance kicks in. The survey defined that as at least $1,300 annually for self-only coverage, and $2,600 for a family.The trend toward high-deductible plans started before Obama took office but advanced during his tenure as employers sought to limit their costs. In 2010, only about 25% of people under age 65 were in such plans. Policy experts credit rising deductibles for helping to restrain overall health care spending, but employees generally see that as a cost shift to them. Polls suggest the trend has undercut support for Obama's health care overhaul.The administration accentuated the survey's positive finding that the uninsured rate hit a new low.""Our country's march toward improving access, quality and affordability in health care goes on, and today's numbers show that the Affordable Care Act is continuing to drive historic progress,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement.The slower progress registered in the CDC report echoed recent findings from a major private survey, the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index.The government survey found 8.8 million fewer uninsured people in 2014. The following year, 2015, there was a reduction of 7.4 million. That compares with 1.3 million fewer uninsured people in the first three months of this year.The numbers for 2014 and 2015 are for full calendar years. But the new figures for the first three months of 2016 are considered a reliable indicator for the rest of the year. That's because the health care law's open enrollment deadlines drive sign-ups early in the year.The upcoming 2017 sign-up season looks tough, with sharp premium increases in many communities and a dwindling choice of insurers. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has promised to help the health care law regain its momentum, while Republican Donald Trump would make good on the GOP's vow to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with a new program yet to be defined.Some independent experts said the survey suggests that the health care law is approaching its limits, absent a change.""The share of the population without health insurance is lower than it's ever been ... but further gains are getting harder and harder to achieve,"" said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""The pace at which people are getting newly insured has noticeably slowed.""""Low-income adults have come the farthest, but still have the farthest to go — nearly 25% of this population is uninsured,"" said Katherine Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Covering more low-income adults is hindered because 19 states are still refusing the law's Medicaid expansion.""Multiple initiatives are needed to have a major impact on further reducing the uninsured population,"" said Paul Hughes-Cromwick of the Altarum Center for Sustainable Health Spending, a research and consulting group.
"
440,UNH,"Spending on health care services surged a greater-than-expected 6.9%, or $37.1 billion, from a year ago in the second quarter, according to Census Bureau data released Thursday. The acceleration in spending growth is a worrying sign after a period of moderating growth that followed an ObamaCare-fueled rise amid Medicaid and individual-market coverage expansions.The obvious concern is that the latest surge isn't tied to more people getting coverage, but to faster per-person cost growth.The Altarum Institute, which tracks health spending, had expected a 5.3% year-over-year rise in spending on health services, equal to the year-over-year growth in the first quarter and consistent with a gradually moderating trend.The surprising re-acceleration in spending, if sustained, could create more headaches for the health care sector, which has already felt rising political heat due to drug pricing and spiraling premiums for ObamaCare exchange coverage.Democrats are pushing a government insurance option competing alongside private insurers as UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have pulled back from the non-group insurance market. Higher spending growth also could step up the pace at which the ObamaCare-created Independent Payment Advisory Board will have to propose cost cuts to restrain Medicare's growth. Meanwhile, both presidential candidates have talked about letting Medicare negotiate drug prices, and Hillary Clinton has been quick to capitalize on the drug-pricing controversy, leading criticism of Mylan (MYL) for its EpiPen price hike.Political risk in a hard-to-predict election year has helped make health care the worst-performing of the eleven major S&P 500 sectors this year, with just a 1% gain, investment strategist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research noted earlier this week. ""The sector has been haunted by controversy over egregious drug pricing, insurers pulling out of ObamaCare, and some disappointing news on the new drug front,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Overall, health care has lagged other stock sectors this year, but there have been plenty of health-related winners, including Intuitive Surgical, Veeva Systems and Healthequity. IBD helps investors identify the best stocks — before they stage a breakout. IBD writes about the best investment candidates in features such as The New America  and includes them in lists such as the IBD 50 and Sector Leaders. IBD also will even help you find the best buy point and teach you rules for selling.The 6.9% in spending on health care services reported in the Census' Quarterly Service Survey easily eclipsed the year-over-year growth reported since the recession — with one exception. The first quarter of 2015 saw 7.7% growth in health services spending, but that reflected the ObamaCare enrollment gains that, partly due to the HealthCare.gov technology glitch, didn't noticeably begin to push up health expenses until the second half of 2014. The services report doesn't detail prescription drug spending or health insurance spending.Hospital revenue jumped 6.6% from a year ago to $272 billion, even as the number of inpatient days dipped 0.1%. Meanwhile, hospital expenses on labor, supplies and overhead rose a more moderate 5.4%, signaling increased profitability. In this case, though, improvement is due to the tax-exempt sector. For-profit hospitals, such as those run by Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holdings (HCA), actually saw expense growth (10.3%) outpace revenue growth (8.3%). Yet for-profit hospitals still have higher profit margins than the tax-exempt sector.Spending on ambulatory care services jumped 7.3% from a year ago to $244.3 billion. Within that category, outpatient care center spending rose 9.2% and home health care services 6.8%. Medical and diagnostic labs showed relatively slow 2.7% growth. Spending at nursing and residential care facilities rose 6.3%.Overall, spending on health care services accounted for about 26% of total growth in services spending. That makes six straight quarters in which health care has accounted for at least one-fourth of the total growth in year-over-year services spending — twice as big of a share of growth as that seen as recently as the second quarter of 2014.

441,UNH,"Molina Healthcare (MOH) said its ObamaCare exchange membership more than doubled to 630,000 in the first quarter from 266,000 a year ago, but its earnings dived and shares tumbled 18% early Friday.Management said the customer growth was far more than it expected and acknowledged being overwhelmed by customer gains from Medicaid, exchanges and acquisitions.In an earnings call, management pointed to those stresses as part of the reason for its setback in controlling customer medical care costs, which rose to 89.8% of premium revenue from 88.7% a year ago. Earnings fell to 43 cents per share from 56 cents a year ago.But CEO Joseph Molina said the primary reasons for its big earnings miss were ""the general failure of Medicaid rates to keep pace with the growing medical care costs,"" higher utilization by customers in Texas and Ohio, and higher-than-expected pharmacy costs -- especially for high-cost specialty drugs.Molina's news appeared to weigh on the entire sector -- even among competitors that have reported their own earnings in recent days. Shares of Centene (CNC), another Medicaid managed care company seeing big exchange membership gains, slipped 4%. UnitedHealth (UNH) eased 1.5%; Aetna (AET) 2.3%; and Anthem (ANTM) 2.6%.The company, whose 4.2 million plan members include 339,000 in Puerto Rico, also highlighted the uncertain risks it faces from the Zika virus.""While very few of the expectant mothers among our membership have contracted the virus, the full financial effects of Zika will not likely be known for several months,"" Molina said.Molina's exchange customer base has tended to be relatively low cost, requiring the company to transfer funds to insurers with higher-cost members via ObamaCare's risk-adjustment program. Updated risk-adjustment estimates were one reason for Molina's lower premium revenue per member in the first quarter, the company said. Though it's too early to know much about the new customers, Molina expects that they will tend toward the healthy side based on demographics that are similar to 2015 customers.Molina didn't say where its exchange membership surge came, but Texas looks to be one market where it gained market share. Molina now offers the two lowest-cost silver plans in Houston, having displaced Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas and another carrier.
"
442,UNH,"Centene (CNC) looks like the mirror image of UnitedHealth (UNH) when it comes to the ObamaCare exchange business, but the truth is more complicated.A week ago, UnitedHealth said it was bowing out of most of the 34 state exchanges where it competes, as financial losses pile up.On Tuesday, Centene said its exchange profit margins are coming in ""at the higher end of our targeted range.""Centene's low-premium, narrow-network, low-deductible plans are on the opposite end of the spectrum for UnitedHealth's generally broader-network, lower-deductible coverage.One might say that Centene, with roots as a Medicaid managed care provider, is winning because it has brought Medicaid-type networks to the individual exchange market. Unfortunately for UnitedHealth, there aren't as many ObamaCare customers who are willing to pay up for broad provider networks, and those who are tend to be high-cost patients.Investors greeted Centene's earnings news by bidding up shares 6.1% to 66.71, the highest since Jan. 5. Likewise, shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH), another low-cost insurer with Medicaid roots, got a 3.4% lift to a six-month high ahead of its earnings report on Thursday.While UnitedHealth had amassed 795,000 exchange customers in its 34 states at the end of the first quarter, Centene said it had 683,000 customers in 15 states where it participates, up roughly 55% from a year earlier, according to ACASignups.net. The total includes exchange customers of Health Net, which Centene snapped up in a $6 billion merger that recently landed the company on the S&P 500.The generally accepted view is that Centene has simply outsmarted UnitedHealth, but there's more to the story than that. There's growing recognition among industry experts and even the Obama administration that the deck has been stacked against insurers like UnitedHealth and nonprofit Blue Cross Blue Shield, with plans which have attracted sicker customers.Customer risk was supposed to be balanced among all insurers through ObamaCare's permanent risk-adjustment program that transfers funds from carriers which attract low-cost customers to those that are a magnet for the sick. But risk-adjustment isn't working as intended for a variety of reasons, including the failure to consider customer use of prescription drugs in weighing an insurer's risk.To the extent the rules shift, the changes may take some of the wind out of the sails of Centene.One potential red flag comes from New Hampshire, where Minuteman Health said it plans to hike 2017 ObamaCare premiums by 45% -- if it faces a $3,000-per-customer risk-adjustment charge, as it expects. HHS will report risk-adjustment results for 2015 on June 30. That may also be a big day for Centene.Another part of the Centene story is more complicated than it appears. The company, through its Ambetter plans, is the lowest-cost insurer in places like Seattle, Miami, Atlanta and Jackson, Miss. But its pricing decisions don't always seem to be in the best interest of customers.While the cheapest annual bronze-plan premium (before subsidies) rose about $250 in Mississippi for a $25,000-earner this year, the subsidy fell $300, yielding a $550 increase. That came about because the subsidies are tied to the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan, and Centene cornered the market on low-cost plans in a number of states this year by attaching bronze-like deductibles ($5,500 and $6,500) to silver plans.

444,UNH,"Stocks wobbled in and out of mixed territory Wednesday morning, as earnings news, a rising dollar and a pullback in oil prices combined to pressure equities.The Nasdaq managed a 0.1% gain and the Dow held just below the 0.1% mark. The S&P 500 struggled against narrow losses.The stock market today moved in quiet volume. Trade slowed 4% on the NYSE and was down 8% on the Nasdaq, vs. action at the same time Tuesday.Homebuilder stocks traded lower, despite a better-than-expected reading on existing-home sales for March. The National Association of Realtors reported sales rose to an annualized rate of 5.33 million, up from 5.07 million in February and above projections for a sales pace of 5.268 million.The Dow felt the pull of undertow from Boeing (BA) and Coca-Cola (KO). Boeing thumped out a 3% loss after Bank of America downgraded the stock to neutral from underperform. Coke shed nearly 4% after its Q1 earnings, and revenue fell slightly less than consensus forecasts, but weakness in international markets left volume flat.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and American Express (AXP) led the index, up a bit more than 1% each.Check Point Software (CHKP) dropped 4% in heavy trade after earnings sneaked past consensus expectations, revenue just met views and management gave Q2 earnings guidance near the low end of the consensus range. The stock pared losses after finding support at its 50-day moving average. The dive cut 6% below an 88.08 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Discover Financial (DFS) and St. Jude Medical (STJ) led the S&P 500, surging 7% and 4%, respectively, after healthy Q1 reports. Discover's powerful volume gain lifted it well up the right side of a five-month cup base, easily clearing its 200-day moving average and putting shares within 3% of a 58.18 buy point.St. Jude is up 25% from a mid-February low, but still below its 200-day line and deep in a nine-month consolidation.MaxLinear (MXL) topped the IBD 50 list by a wide margin, surging 7% after revising its Q1 revenue and gross profit outlook. The stock tripped a sell rule Tuesday, dropping more than 8% below a 17.85 buy point and cutting its 50-day moving average in heavy trade.

445,UNH,"Stocks turned mixed early Tuesday, as oil halted an early advance, earnings news tripped some key sell-offs and March housing data were mixed.The Dow and S&P 500 held on to 0.4% gains. The Nasdaq reversed to a 0.2% decline.Volume rose in the stock market today, up 11% on the NYSE and 13% higher on the Nasdaq, compared with the same time Monday.Dow stocks moved almost unanimously higher at the open. Earnings reports drove the extremes:  UnitedHealth Group (UNH) led with a 2.3% gain, IBM (IBM) staked out the low end, down more than 4%.Among other Dow issues reporting, Goldman Sachs (GS) slipped 1% after a revenue miss. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) added 0.9% on a narrow earnings beat and higher guidance.Oil and energy crowded the upside of the S&P 500. Chicago-based Northern Trust (NTRS) jumped more than 5% after a solid first-quarter revenue and earnings beat.

"
446,UNH,"Yahoo (YHOO), Intel (INTC) and UnitedHealth (UNH) headline another busy day for earnings, though investors may look past headline EPS for all three industry giants.Yahoo is expected to report a 53% year-over-year decline in EPS to 7 cents after the market close Tuesday. Revenue likely fell 12% to $1.08 billion, with revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs seen declining even faster. CEO Marissa Mayer has been unable to fuel significant growth since taking the helm in 2012.What investors will want to know is any information on the Yahoo bidding process, with offers due on Monday. Yahoo is entertaining offers for all or part of the Web portal, including its core U.S. operations and its Alibaba (BABA) stake. It's unclear if Yahoo will say anything at all. Various reports said Verizon Communications (VZ) and YP Holdings, owned by Cerberus Capital and AT&T (T), are among the purported bidders.Yahoo stock rose 1 cent to 36.52 on the stock market today. Shares hit an 8-month high of 37.50 last week.Intel also reports after Tuesday's closing bell. Analysts expect EPS to rise 15% to 47 cents, with revenue up 8% to $13.83 billion. The key is to what extent data center chips offset weakness for PC chips. Investors will want to know if weak PC sales are continuing in Q2, and whether Intel will cut full-year guidance.Looking ahead, Apple may source 30 million to 40 million iPhone 7 modem chips from Intel, taking share from Qualcomm (QCOM), according to Canaccord analyst T. Michael Walkley. Qualcomm, which reports earnings Wednesday evening, will still get most of that business. Apple will release its iPhone 7 later this year.Intel rose 0.6% on Monday, find support just over its  200-day moving average. Qualcomm rose 1%, but remains in a downtrend going back to mid-2014. Apple fell 2.2%, continuing to fall after undercutting its 200-day line.The No. 1 U.S. health insurer, and the first to report Q1 results, is due out Tuesday morning. Analysts expect an 18% EPS rise to $1.72, with revenue up 23% to $43.96 billion. Investors will looking for industry clues about membership, medical costs.  They'll also want to know more about UnitedHealth's plans for the ObamaCare exchange. UnitedHealth, which was cautious about entering these marketplaces, has been the most vocal about getting out, perhaps  entirely in 2017, due to ongoing losses. UnitedHealth last week announced it was exiting the Arkansas, Georgia and Michigan exchanges.If UnitedHealth drastically scales back its participation, it could reduce competition and boost premiums for enrollees. But if UnitedHealth spurs a stampede of insurers getting out, the impact could be huge.UnitedHealth stock rose to a new high a month ago, moving sideways since then. Shares rose 0.4% to 127.81 on Monday.  
"
447,UNH,"Now that Aetna (AET) has joined UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana (HUM) in pulling back from the ObamaCare exchanges, the field is wide open for Centene (CNC) to make big enrollment gains. But that's not necessarily going to make Centene shareholders happy, Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte suggests in a new report.Gupte downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform on Monday but maintained an 80 price target. Shares dived 4.8% to 65.3 on big volume, though the stock found support at its 200-day moving average.Centene stock fell below its 50-day line in late August, along with Aetna, UnitedHealth and several other health insurers. Humana also is trending lower, but is still just above its 50-day and 200-day lines.Centene is turning a profit on its ObamaCare exchange business, which is an offshoot of its Medicaid managed care business. So why wouldn't even less competition on the exchanges yield even bigger profits?The potential risk for Centene and other insurers left standing is that they might inherit a lot of high-cost patients from the insurers who are pulling back from the exchanges amid financial losses. That risk could be exacerbated by the end of ObamaCare's reinsurance program, which is in its final year of covering a portion of the medical bills incurred by the highest-cost patients.Among a number of reasons for the downgrade, Gupte cited ""potential for downside risk from the HIX (health insurance exchange) exits by multiple plans and phaseout (of reinsurance in) 2017.""Gupte also said that ""margins in the core Medicaid business look to have peaked"" for Centene.That view seems consistent with the recent news that the government's cost for the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion exceeded per-person estimates by 49% in 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Learning when to sell a stock is as important as knowing when to buy. When Centene shares staged a breakout then fell below the buy point on July 26 after its earnings report, that triggered a key IBD sell signal. For a primer on protecting your profits and limiting your downside, visit IBD University.Gupte also noted some issues particular to Centene, involving a Pennsylvania Medicaid managed care contract that's now expected to produce losses in the near term and breakeven-at-best results from its Medicare Advantage expansion in four states next year.Bottom line: Gupte sees increased top-line growth, but with margin compression and earnings growth of 12% a year through 2019, down from prior expectations of 14%.Gupte lowered projected earnings for 2017 by 9 cents to $4.56 a share, well below the $4.87 average estimate of analysts.Shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH), another Medicaid managed care player that's fared better than most on the ObamaCare exchanges, gave up early gains as Centene plunged, but ended with modest losses.   
"
448,UNH,"Two heads can be better than one. Or, if not better, at least less volatile. For proof, look no further than $25.6 billion Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX).The $25.6 billion portfolio, which is sold through financial advisors, is up 4.75% this year going into Monday. Its stablemate is $108.5 billion Contrafund (FCNTX). Both funds have marquee manager Will Danoff at the helm. New Insights — once a clone of Contrafund — has behaved differently since John Roth became co-manager three years ago.Contrafund's 9.27% average annual gain ranks in the top 1% of large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past 15 years. New Insight's 7.95% ranks in the top 38% over the past 10 years. But so far this year New Insights 4.75% gain is in the top 14% of the same peer group vs. top 38% for Contrafund's 2.62% gain.Roth's portfolio picks go a long way to explaining why two top-notch funds, sharing a lead manager, have performed differently in the short term. Roth and Danoff talk together a lot and powwow formally once a week. But they run separate sleeves of Insights' securities.Differences in their picks add diversification. ""That gives us more ability to weather volatility,"" Roth said.On Friday, New Insights had a trio of 2%-plus gainers, as Netflix (NFLX), Tesla Motors (TSLA) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) each tacked on more than two percentage points.Netflix announced a deal last week with Liberty Global (LBTYA) to expand its global footprint. That's a key goal as the company nears saturation in the U.S. Customers of the jumbo global cable operator will be able to access Netflix content via Liberty set top boxes, but Netflix will retain a billing relationship with viewers. Netflix has recently announced other deals with other cable operators, including Comcast (CMCSA). And this month it is slated to become the exclusive viewing platform for certain films made by Walt Disney (DIS).Tesla rose amid an intensifying friction with former BFF (best friends forever, as the kids say) Mobileye (MBLY). Tesla accused Mobileye of trying to throw a monkey wrench into its efforts to develop vision chips on its own. Mobileye said it ended its relationship with Tesla in July because the electric car maker was ""pushing the envelope in terms of safety.""Tesla said Mobileye bailed because Tesla was planning to rely more on radar systems and less on camera-based driver-assistance systems such as those developed by Mobileye.IBD'S TAKE: Our Ed Carson digs into details of the spiraling cat fight between Tesla and Mobileye in this report.Tesla's 6% share price surge Friday -- lifting it 6% for the entire week -- and Mobileye's pullback show which side investors favor in this feud.New Insights owns both stocks.As for UnitedHealth, its Friday rise was on good volume. The stock is shaping a flat base with a 144.58 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: To learn more about UnitedHealth's prognosis, see how it stacks up against other stocks in its industry at IBD's Stock Checkup.Roth says some stocks he likes today reflect his past experiences at the helms of Fidelity's sector funds focused on multimedia, chemicals and utilities. ""I'm opportunistic, with a growth bias and a valuation sensibility,"" he said.Roth, who also runs $3 billion New Millennium (FMILX), says he prefers fewer stocks in his sleeve of New Insights than Danoff. He also tilts more to midcaps. His eye on valuation recently has led Roth to beaten-down names in energy and financials.Among the names in New Insights that are not in Contrafund, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence: American International Group (AIG), Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Antero Resources (AR), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), Chevron (CVX), Energy Transfer Equity (ETE), Exelon (EXC) and Morgan Stanley (MS).""I'm more of the energy guy,"" Roth said. ""I do think there are points in time when you want different cyclical groups.""Share prices of most of the energy names, for example, have yet to perk up a lot. But Roth says the conditions for a rebound are falling into place. U.S. production is sliding, he says, adding, ""Share prices are down, demand (for energy) is relatively good and we've seen a massive amount of capital come out of the space over the past 12 to 18 months. Rig count is down 40% to 60%. Hundreds of billions of dollars in exploration-and-production cap ex has come out.""Roth describes his thesis as of his latest disclosure for Diamondback Energy (FANG): ""We have bigger diversified companies, some service companies and smaller U.S.-focused E&Ps,"" he said. ""Diamondback is a classic one of those. It is an independent E&P with a good spot in the Permian Basin. It has great acreage that it will exploit at attractive costs.""Energy accounted for about 8% of New Insights' assets, its fifth-largest sector by weight, as of July 31. Contra has about 2% in the sector and New Millennium 16%.Technology, with a 26% weighting, is tops. The fund's top-three holdings are Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN).The fund has been trimming Facebook, but only to take profits and prevent the stake from getting too big. It was about 5% as of July 31. ""It's still our largest relative bet. It is our most important stock,"" said Roth.One leg of Facebook's appeal has been its success in shifting from a web focus to a mobile one. Another has been its success at remaining relevant to users through platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram. A third has been its ability to show advertisers the link between an ad and a sale. ""That's the ability to optimize ad campaigns and (let advertisers) see the return on investment,"" he said.Google is a similar story, Roth adds.Amazon's retail and music businesses do well, Roth says. But Amazon's key improvement is its AWS web services business. It wasn't until mid-2015 that Amazon broke out AWS' financial results. ""Investors were surprised by how profitable the business is,"" Roth said. ""It is a complete game-changer.""AWS has proved more attractive than rival services from Google, IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT), he adds.The cloud-services platform lets customers rent all the capacity they need at peak times, even if most of the time they need far less. Thus they avoid hefty capital expenditures.In summarizing their teamwork, Roth says that Danoff uses more small starting positions in individual stocks. Roth makes bigger initial buys. ""Our process keeps evolving,"" Roth said. ""I'm excited about it.""RELATED:Diamondback Dominates Shale-Rich Permian Basin With Conservative DealsHow Fidelity Contrafund Manager Will Danoff Played The DownturnP-s-s-st!

449,UNH,"Stocks pared losses by Friday's close with the key market indexes closing with weekly gains. Intel (INTC) and UnitedHealth (UNH) led the Dow.The S&P 500 fell 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.5%;  The Nasdaq fell 0.1%, with biotechs showing some strength. Volume was higher across the board vs. the same time Thursday, due to quadruple witching, or the quarterly expiration of futures and options contracts.Intel led the upside on the Dow with a 3% jump in heavy trade. Shares gapped up to a multiyear high after the chip giant raised its Q3 revenue guidance.

450,UNH,"Health Reform: This is rich. Aetna was once a big supporter of ObamaCare, but discovered to its surprise that it was costing the company a fortune. So now Democrats who created this problem are bashing Aetna for being ""irresponsible.""In a letter to Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Ed Markey, Bill Nelson, Bernie Sanders and Sherrod Brown — some of the most liberal lawmakers in the Senate — demanded that he explain his company's decision not only to abandon its expansion plans, but to pull out of all but four ObamaCare markets.""We are particularly troubled,"" the senators wrote, ""that Aetna's decision to leave the ACA exchanges appears to have been motivated by the Justice Department's decision to challenge Aetna's proposed $37 billion merger with Humana.""This is politics at its absolute worst.It was ObamaCare that pushed Aetna (AET) to seek out this merger in the first place — just as it pushed Anthem (ANTM) to seek a deal with Cigna (CI). The costs involved in complying with ObamaCare's rules and regulations, as well as the ObamaCare-induced merger frenzy among hospitals, pretty much required it.But while ObamaCare was pushing the industry to consolidate, Justice decided to push back, leaving Aetna no choice but to pack up and leave.As an Aetna spokesman explained to Business Insider, ""we are one of many insurers, large and small, that has been forced to reduce its public exchange participation due to an increasingly unstable marketplace.""He's right about that. For-profit and nonprofit insurers alike are reeling from massive ObamaCare losses, which could reach almost $2 billion this year. Humana (HUM), UnitedHealth (UNH), and Blue Cross have pulled out of several markets, and more than half the nonprofit co-ops that ObamaCare itself created have since failed.The law is failing with the public as well. As more people find their insurance canceled, their premiums spike, their provider networks shrink, ObamaCare's popularity continues to suffer. The latest Gallup poll finds that 51% disapprove of the law, and far more say ObamaCare has directly hurt them as say it's helped (29% vs 18%).Attacking Aetna shows just how desperate Democrats are to pretend that ObamaCare isn't failing.But it also shows the perils of ""partnering"" with the federal government. As soon as things turn bad, politicians will blame the private companies involved, not the flawed law. In fact, Aetna's past supportive comments about ObamaCare are now being used against it by these senators, as if this somehow provides evidence of the company's bad faith.The answer isn't to look for scapegoats in the private sector for the ObamaCare train wreck, it's to repeal the law and start over with free market reforms that will actually work.RELATED:ObamaCare Conspiracy Theories Are Looking More Plausible By The DayObamaCare Is Destroying The Co-Ops It Spent Billions CreatingObamaCare Is Failing Exactly The Way Critics Said It Would

452,UNH,"""I will predict that within that year — now I may be wrong on this — but within the immediate future the Democrats are going to throw their hands in the air and say, 'It's not working. It's unaffordable. And we have to go to a single-payer system.' ""That was Sen. Orrin Hatch in 2013, arguing that ObamaCare was designed to fail so that Democrats could use it as an excuse for the government to take over the entire insurance industry.At the time, no respectable health care expert took Hatch — or any other conservative making such conspiratorial claims — seriously.But today, Hatch is starting to look absolutely prescient, even if his timing was off.Consider what is happening right now with ObamaCare. Enrollment is way below expectations. Insurers are putting in for double-digit rate hikes across the country, with some as high as 60%. UnitedHealth (UNH), Humana (HUM), and Blue Cross Blue Shield are pulling out of several ObamaCare markets, and most of the nonprofit co-ops created by ObamaCare have gone bust. As a result, the competition that was supposed to make ObamaCare exchanges the health care equivalent of Travelocity is evaporating.And Democrats? They are using these problems to push for a still bigger role for government in providing health insurance.The latest blow to ObamaCare came from Aetna (AET), which had been promising to expand its reach to 20 states, but instead is staying in just four. As a result, at least one county, this one in Arizona, faces the possibility that no insurer will be offering a health plan in the ObamaCare exchange.Even before Aetna's decision, 664 counties — more than a quarter of all counties in the country — had just one insurer in their ObamaCare exchange, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report. Given that Aetna is exiting more than 500 counties, that number will only increase.Meanwhile, three entire states — Alaska, Alabama, and Wyoming — are down to one insurer, and there's no contingency if one of those insurers were to pack up and leave.That's not to say all of ObamaCare is falling apart — only the heavily-regulated private sector piece is.The law's Medicaid expansion, in contrast, is doing fabulously well, with enrollment climbing by nearly 15.5 million between the summer of 2013 and January 2016. That's a 27% increase. And that's despite the fact that more than a dozen states refused to expand Medicaid eligibility.So what's Hillary Clinton's answer to the failing private exchanges? Get more people on government insurance through what she calls the ""public option."" This would be a government-run health care plan offered in ObamaCare exchanges across the country.""The public option, Clinton says, ""will strengthen competition and reduce costs.""But wait a minute. The ""public option"" was pushed by liberal Democrats in 2009 when ObamaCare was being built, and it was rejected by centrists in the party because it looked too much like a steppingstone to single payer.As a matter of fact, that was the idea behind the ""public option"" in the first place.As Mark Schmitt explained in the liberal American Prospect, ""The public option was part of a carefully thought out and deliberately funded effort (to convince the single-payer crowd) they could live with the public option as a kind of stealth single-payer."" The idea was that the public option would be able to undercut private plans, driving them all out of the exchanges.But all those centrists Democrats who opposed the public option are gone from the Senate, and if Hillary Clinton gets elected with a more liberal Senate majority, the public option will likely be top of her agenda.With the vast Medicaid expansion, and the public option (as well as Clinton's proposal to expand Medicare), it's not far-fetched to say that soon the only people covered by private insurance will be the diminishing number who get it through work. (ObamaCare was also designed to shrink employer-based health.)So was this all in the grand plan when Democrats passed ObamaCare in 2010?Sen. Harry Reid, all but admitted as much in late 2013, when in an appearance on PBS' ""Nevada Week in Review,"" he said that ""what we've done with ObamaCare is have a step in the right direction, but we're far from having something that's going to work forever."" When asked if that meant a single-payer system, Reid said, ""Yes, yes. Absolutely, yes.""Ezra Klein, who at the time was a health care reporter with the Washington Post, explained that the left was pursuing a ""sneaky strategy"" to ""put in place something that over time the natural incentives ... move it to single payer.""Could it be that Hatch, Reid and Klein were all right? It sure seems like it these days.If so, the only way to stop the onward march to single payer would be to repeal ObamaCare and start over with free-market based reforms.Good luck with that if Hillary Clinton wins the election in November.

453,UNH,"The first ObamaCare requests for 2017 premium hikes are now being filed and the initial news looks bad — at least in Virginia.Anthem (ANTM) HealthKeepers, one of the biggest players in the state's individual market, is seeking an average 15.8% rate hike for a projected 190,000 members, both on and off the exchange.Anthem cited medical inflation, increased utilization, new specialty drugs for Hepatitis C; and the expiration of ObamaCare's reinsurance program that covers a portion of claims for the costliest patients.Innovation Health, a partnership in Virginia 50% owned by Aetna (AET), is seeking a 16.6% rate increase for 61,000 members.UnitedHealth (UNH), which has dropped out of Arkansas and Georgia, is at least keeping its options open in Virginia. It submitted a filing requesting a 9.4% rate increase for its 6,900 members, according to ObamaCare enrollment tracker ACASignups.net.Overall, the average weighted premium-hike request appears to be 17.9%, says Charles Gaba of ACASignups.The rate increases may turn out to be quite small for those who qualify for subsidies. The average premium hike for the subsidized population was just 4% in 2016, the Obama administration said on Tuesday.Consumers may be able to switch to cheaper plans, which might also hold down their premium increases. But all of the carriers except for UnitedHealth appear to be seeking double-digit increases in Virginia. A couple of carriers with a combined 40,000 customers, CareFirst BlueChoice and Optima Health, are seeking rate increases in excess of 30%.      
"
454,UNH,"New data out from the Obama administration on Tuesday seemed to suggest that all the hand-wringing over double-digit ObamaCare rate hikes in 2016 was much ado about not that much: The average exchange premium on plans selected via HealthCare.gov rose a less-jarring 8.4% from 2015.Yet a close look at the data shows that HealthCare.gov rates actually did rise at least 10% after all, with the average premium rising less, in part, because people were buying less coverage for their money.The average premium on plans selected (but not necessarily paid for) via HealthCare.gov as of Feb. 1 was $386 a month, $30 per month more than the average policy selected during the 2015 open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services said.There are three main ways that the reported 8.4% increase understates reality. First, new enrollees were somewhat more likely to opt for catastrophic and bronze coverage, while most people with platinum coverage dropped it. The effect of people choosing, on average, a slightly lower-level plan was to reduce premiums by nearly three-fourths of a percent, an IBD analysis finds.The second way that premiums understate the apples-to-apples increase in rates is harder to detect but may be significant. Consider that Florida, ObamaCare's largest exchange with 1.75 million members, saw just a 2.7% hike in premiums, meaning the rest of the HealthCare.gov states saw an average 9.7% hike.Now take a look at Miami-Dade County, Florida's largest market and the largest in the county. Centene's (CNC) Ambetter unit has the two lowest-priced silver plans, including one with an eye-popping $6,500 deductible that is 6.2% cheaper than the cheapest rival plan from Molina Healthcare (MOH).As explained at HealthCare.gov, a silver plan is designed to pay 70% of the total cost of covered expenses by all members. Yet that's not quite true -- especially in markets like Miami, Atlanta, Seattle and Jackson, Miss., where Centene's Ambetter is the low-cost provider and covers as little as 68% of total member costs.A primary reason that premiums didn't rise as much as feared, HHS says, is that consumers were active shoppers and swapped out of plans with big premium hikes. Yet many of these plan changers may have been swapping into plans with higher deductibles, lower cost-sharing and less coverage -- even if they didn't shift from, say, silver to bronze.Among silver plans in the biggest HealthCare.gov markets of each state, the average deductible of the second-lowest-cost silver plan rose 11% from 2015, IBD found.The third reason that the HHS spin doesn't quite add up is that sign-ups among children under age 18 jumped by more than 21% vs. the overall gain of just under 9%. While it's good that more children have insurance, they cost a whole lot less to insure. Including children in the mix has the effect of lowering the 2016 premium increase by about two-thirds of a percent.There's a good reason that signups in 2016 grew so little -- despite the ramping up of the penalty for going uninsured. Millions and millions of people are finding that the plans provide too little and are too costly -- even with subsidies that held down the effective premium hike to just 4% for the vast majority of exchange shoppers who qualify. While the new HHS data on premiums is misleading in a number of ways, the real problem is that the Obama administration is missing the forest for the trees.In coming weeks, insurers will begin to provide an early look at 2017 premiums, and the picture could get worse. One of ObamaCare's fiercest defenders, Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee, has predicted big premium increases across the country. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth (UNH) has already told Arkansas and Georgia that it's bailing on their exchanges.
"
455,UNH,"Next year, the combination of a sicker-than-expected insured group and the end of a temporary ObamaCare program to offset the cost of the sickest patients will send premiums soaring in Virginia, the first state where 2017 rate filings have been made public.Anthem (ANTM) has requested a 15.8% rate hike in Virginia for ObamaCare plans that cover about 180,000 members on and off the exchange. But that's actually a bit below the average rate hike that state insurers requested: 17.8%, as calculated by ACASignups.net, which tracks ObamaCare enrollment.The details behind Anthem's requested price hike highlight one reason why ObamaCare exchange premiums throughout the U.S. may be in for a big hike in 2017: the end of the three-year reinsurance program.In 2016, the program covered 50% of bills between $90,000 and $250,000 that an insurer incurred for patients. For the Anthem HealthKeepers plans in Virginia, it translated to about $65 million in payments from the government, helping cut outlays on benefits by about 10%, filings show.On the other hand, Anthem had to transfer about $20 million to other insurers under ObamaCare's ongoing risk-adjustment program, which provides for transfers to insurers that wind up with a sicker overall population.Excluding such transfers, Anthem's incurred costs equaled 90.5% of premiums collected, leaving a narrow margin to cover administrative costs, much less profit.Doubts about whether ObamaCare's risk-adjustment program is accurately compensating insurers has led to complaints from UnitedHealth (UNH) and generated strong criticism from independent policy experts.The biggest apparent beneficiary of the risk-adjustment program was Optima Health, which received nearly $36 million in transfers from other insurers on top of nearly $21 million in reinsurance for its 34,000 members.Without such help, Optima would have been sunk. It reported that incurred claims totaled 105% of premiums. As it is, the insurer is requesting a 37% rate hike and said that it will exit a number of Virginia's regions.Humana (HUM), a small player in Virginia, submitted notice on Friday that it's quitting the state's individual market. Aetna (AET) unit Coventry has yet to submit a rate request, so it's not yet clear if it will remain in the market. Aetna does have a 50% stake in Innovation Health, which is seeking a 16% increase for 61,000 members.On the other hand, both UnitedHealth and Cigna (CI), which would be a new entrant, submitted rate requests, with UnitedHealth seeking a 9.4% rate hike for some 11,000 members, according to ACASignups.Kaiser Foundation Health Plan reported that its incurred costs totaled 94% of premiums in the state, but its request for a 10% rate hike could put it in position to gain market share. One reason why Kaiser could request a below-average rate hike may be that it depended less on the reinsurance program, getting back just $4.4 million.Some insurers also noted other factors contributing to higher rates, including market churn, with customers running up bills and then bolting, and the grace period that puts insurers on the hook for bills incurred in the first month after customers fail to submit their premium payment.UnitedHealth will kick off earnings for health insurers on Tuesday, with Wall Street investors and health care policy analysts paying attention to any ObamaCare-related comments. UnitedHealth last week said that it would exit the Arkansas and Georgia exchanges. Late Friday, Michigan officials said UnitedHealth would exit that state's exchange. The insurer has warned that it might exit the exchanges entirely.

457,UNH,"Aetna (AET) announced late Monday that next year it will exit 11 of the 15 ObamaCare exchanges it currently operates in, citing heavy losses that have driven UnitedHealth (UNH), Humana (HUM) and others out of most markets, posing a major challenge for the Affordable Care Act.Aetna said in a statement:""Following a thorough business review and in light of a second-quarter pretax loss of $200 million and total pretax losses of more than $430 million since January 2014 in our individual products, we have decided to reduce our individual public exchange presence in 2017, which will limit our financial exposure moving forward.""When UnitedHealth announced early this year that it would exit all but a handful of exchanges, many dismissed the move. UnitedHealth, though the largest insurer, had been a late entrant into the individual marketplaces and was quick to complain about unexpectedly high costs.But Humana recently followed suit, planning to leave several states and the vast majority of counties that it had covered. As Aetna noted in Monday's statement, most co-ops have folded due to unexpected costs.Aetna's move means that many more counties will have only one exchange provider, with some having none.Aetna to drop Affordable Care Act plans in Arizona next year. @Aetna's exit means Pinal County, as of now, has no #ACA insurers for 2017.— Ken Alltucker (@kalltucker) August 16, 2016That Aetna, UnitedHealth, Humana and many others have decided they can't make money, even with premiums set to rise by double-digits in many parts of the country, suggests that the law still faces serious challenges.It appears that many patients -- perhaps with the connivance of some providers -- are gaming the system, overloading many insurers with unexpected costs.Medicaid managed care specialists Centene (CNC) and Molina Health (MOH) have expanded rapidly in recent years, offering ultra-high deductibles to limit premiums. But even Centene recently reported unexpected exchange losses from its recently acquired Health Net unit.Aetna and Humana may be less willing to stay in the exchanges, now that the Justice Department is trying to block the Aetna-Humana deal, as well as an Anthem (ANTM) deal for Cigna (CI).Related:ObamaCare Is Failing Exactly The Way Critics Said It Would

458,UNH,"Do you invest as successfully as Fidelity Investments does? Would it help your game to know in which large-cap stocks Fidelity's approximately 200 stock and stock-plus-bond mutual funds made some of their biggest second-quarter adds to and sells from?Todd Rosenbluth, S&P Global Market Intelligence director of mutual fund research, pored through the newly released SEC holdings disclosure of the second-largest mutual fund manager and compared it with past filings by the Boston-based behemoth, which had $1.4 trillion in long-term assets as of June 30.The snapshot of Q2 trades gives insight into what stocks Fidelity managers thought were worth getting into and what they were willing to trim.Information technology remained the fund giant's largest sector, with 23% of its collective assets as of June 30. That was the case even though many Fidelity managers sold shares in two tech titans, Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), in the second quarter. Fidelity trimmed its Microsoft share count by 20% compared with its Q1 stake. It peeled Apple back by 6.9%.Microsoft's stock fell 7% in Q2, but has rallied 13% since June 30. No word yet on whether Fidelity resumed buying.Apple's shares sank 12% in Q2, but have rallied 14% since then.In contrast, Fidelity beefed up its shares in home entertainment software stock Activision Blizzard (ATVI) by 92%. ""In Feburary 2016, ATVI completed its purchase of King Digital and reported first and second quarter results ahead of the Capital IQ consensus,"" Rosenbluth reported to clients. On Thursday afternoon shares were about where they closed at the end of Q2.The stock ended June 17% higher than where it began the quarter. It's been about flat since then.In the health care sector, Fidelity was both a net buyer and seller.Fidelity liked the prognosis for biotech firm Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) enough to graft an additional 48% onto its existing share count. That turned out to be a good call. In July, Vertex got FDA approval for a new cystic fibrosis drug, Rosenbluth notes. Now shares are up 15% since the end of Q2.Going in the other director, Fidelity sliced 18% from its Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stake and 3.8% from its UnitedHealth Group (UNH) holding. Both are about where they ended Q2.In other sectors, Fidelity added to its stakes in cell-tower owner American Tower (AMT), cable provider Charter Communications (CHTR) and carmaker Tesla Motors (TSLA). Fidelity added 20% to its positions in each.American Tower is about where it was on June 30. Charter is up 11%. The stock is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity from analysts, says Zacks Equity Research. Still, Charter's telecom services-integrated industry group is ranked 66, down from 43 four weeks ago.Tesla is up fractionally from where it closed Q2.Among stocks that Fidelity trimmed in Q2 were Amazon (AMZN), cut by 1.3%, and Visa (V), shaved by 1.9%.Fidelity's largest stock mutual funds continue to hold many of the largest megacap stocks, even those that the fund family as a group trimmed in Q2, Rosenbluth said. The $19.4 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX) has top-10 holdings in Apple and Visa. Other top 10 stocks included Tesla, which the complex added to.Blue Chip Growth is up 1.96% this year going into Thursday, vs. 3.42% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 8.29% for the S&P 500.The $7.5 billion Dividend Growth (FDGFX) held trim targets Apple, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft. Dividend Growth is up 5.02% this year.In separate data, Morningstar Inc. highlights stocks that funds have added to recently. The $109 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), managed by Will Danoff since 1990, has interesting adds.Contrafund, which is among the largest stock mutual funds available, has added to B2Gold. The Canadian-based gold producer runs mines globally. As of midday Friday, shares were up 209% so far this year.Earnings per share grew 95%, 69%, 46% and 52% the past four quarters. But note that the shares are trading just above 4 and have never reached 5.Contrafund holds about a dozen mining stocks and has boosted its stakes recently in half of them.Itau Unibanco (ITUB) is another name in which Contrafund has raised its stake. The Brazilian bank holding company's ADRs are up 73% so far this year.EPS has declined for six quarters in a row, but analysts see expect a 4% gain in the current quarter and a 5% increase in 2017.The company has a so-so Composite Rating from IBD of 78. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating. You should look for stocks whose rating is 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating.IBD'S TAKE: Alan Elliot explains why a high Comp Rating is not always a buy signal.Itau also has IBD's SMR Rating of B. SMR Ratings of A and B are the best.And Contrafund opened a stake in Applied Materials (AMAT) as of its latest disclosure.EPS went from a 4% decline three quarters ago to 17% and 52% growth in the two most recent frames.That 52% EPS gain was reported for Q3 on Thursday and it topped Wall Street expectations.But Applied's Q3 revenue, up 13%, were slightly below analysts' consensus. The maker of chipmaking equipment posted revenue of $2.82 billion in the period, falling short of Street forecasts. Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $2.84 billion.For the current quarter ending in October, Applied Materials expects its per-share earnings to range from 61 cents to 69 cents.The stock gapped up 7% on huge volume Friday. The semiconductor equipment maker's shares are up 58% so far this year.

459,UNH,"Aetna (AET) on Tuesday said it intended to abandon its 2017 expansion plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges and was reviewing future participation in the marketplaces, even as the health insurance giant reported second-quarter results that beat estimates.Just three months ago, Aetna said it planned to continue its ObamaCare business next year as it mulled an expansion to a few additional states.The company's shift makes it the latest health insurer to sour on the exchange marketplaces. Humana (HUM), which Aetna wants to buy, has said it planned to cut its exchange offerings next year. UnitedHealth (UNH) has also announced plans to leave most of its ObamaCare exchanges.Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI), which are also trying to merge, have also warned on higher costs from Affordable Care Act patients.""While we are pleased with our overall results, in light of updated 2016 projections for our individual products and the significant structural challenges facing the public exchanges, we intend to withdraw all of our 2017 public exchange expansion plans and are undertaking a complete evaluation of future participation in our current 15-state footprint,"" Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said in a statement.Aetna said it expected to lose more than $300 million on its Affordable Care Act plans offered this year.Aetna shares rose 1.1% in the stock market today, while Humana dropped 0.9%, and UnitedHealth dipped 0.2%. Anthem lost 1.6%, and Cigna eased 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Many health care stocks are struggling to find support at their 50-day lines. See IBD's Stock Checkup for more details. Health insurers' ObamaCare offerings have generally made up a small portion of enrollees. Still, Aetna has expressed concerns about the balance of healthy patients in the exchanges' risk pools. UnitedHealth has struggled with its higher-end exchange offerings, which patients are more likely to drop after a short period of time.Centene's (CNC) exchange offerings, targeted toward lower-income patients, had fared better, but its recent acquisition, Health Net, also reported losses on the exchanges.Meanwhile, Molina Healthcare (MOH) said it had agreed to buy some Medicare Advantage businesses from Aetna and Humana in a deal valued at roughly $117 million. Molina's purchase is contingent on the resolution of the Justice Department's lawsuit to block Aetna's combination with Humana.The Justice Department last month sued to stop that combination, as well as to halt the merger between Anthem and Cigna, arguing the new companies would be too big and limit competition.Aetna's second-quarter earnings per share rose 8% to $2.21, topping views for $2.12. Operating revenue rose 5% to $15.9 billion, surpassing estimates for $15.69 billion.The company's medical benefit ratio, or the percentage of premium revenue spent on health services, rose to 82.4%, as ObamaCare-related outlays increased.Aetna stuck to its full-year EPS guidance of $7.90-$8.10, vs. consensus for $8.05, but revised higher its expected medical benefit ratio, to 82%-82.5%, in part due to the exchanges.Health insurer WellCare (WCG), meanwhile, increased its full-year earnings per share guidance to $4.95-$5.05 from an earlier forecast of $4.55-$4.70, well above analyst estimates for $4.64. Second-quarter EPS and revenue also beat expectations, according to Thomson Reuters, and WellCare's medical benefits ratio fell during the quarter.Shares rallied jumped 4.7% to 111.91, moving above a 110.91 buy point.

Which are the blue chip index's blue chip performers in 2016?The top five Dow stock winners this year are a diverse group: UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Caterpillar (CAT), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and 3M (MMM).Health care products and services giant Johnson & Johnson continues to rise after reporting its third straight quarter of earnings growth on July 19. Consensus is for earnings per share to climb 11% for the current quarter to $1.66, which would be an acceleration from the mild 2% increase in Q2. The New Brunswick, N.J.-based company is growing organically and via acquisitions, and on July 18 concluded its $3.3 billion cash purchase of Vogue International, a privately-held salon-influenced maker of hair-care and other personal products. Johnson & Johnson stock was up 22.1% in 2016 as of Monday. J&J fell 0.4% in the stock market today.Shares of the nation's largest managed health-care provider rose 1.3% after it reported outstanding earnings and revenue growth. Over the past year UnitedHealth grew to serve more than 2.1 million people in domestic medical benefits markets, including 320,000 more people added in the second quarter.UnitedHealth was relatively conservative about entering the ObamaCare exchange markets, and has said it will exit most of those states in 2017. Some of its peers have announced similar withdrawals.UnitedHealth was up 22% year-to-date as of Monday, falling just 0.2% Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: J&J and UnitedHealth are the top performers on the Dow this year, bulling ahead to a 22% gain so far. To see what other medical stocks are top performers this year go to the IBD Stock Checkup.Sales for the largest maker of mining and construction equipment were weak last year and into early 2016 amid low prices for metals, while Caterpillar continues to sell construction equipment to the slowly recovering housing industry. RBC Capital Markets raised its price target on Caterpillar on July 26 based on the success of its restructuring so far.Although its position seems to be improving, it's not out of the deep mine shaft yet. On Tuesday, July 26, Caterpillar reported a drop in Q2 EPS and revenue, as EPS beat estimates while revenue missed. Caterpillar shares rose 20.6% as of Monday, dipping 0.9% Tuesday.The world's biggest retailer continues to hold its own against upstarts like Amazon.com (AMZN), which is growing fast but still just a fourth of Wal-Mart's size in revenue. Wal-Mart is scrambling to add features to entice shoppers and on July 6 announced that Walmart Pay, its card swipe technology, is now available at all 4,600-plus Walmart superstores nationwide. Walmart Pay works with Apple (AAPL) iPhone or any Alphabet-owned (GOOGL) Google Android device. Wal-Mart stock has climbed 20.4% this year through Monday, but fell 0.9% Tuesday.The nation's largest tapes and adhesives maker, and a purveyor of medical supplies, office equipment, surveillance and communications devices and other products, like Caterpillar entered a buy zone last week and continues to trade there after it reported health care sales rose nearly 5% last quarter, leading it to beat estimates and raise guidance on July 26.However, shares fell after it said that electronics and energy sector sales plunged 9.1% for the quarter. 3M rose 18.4% this year through Monday, and rose 7 cents to 178.36 on Tuesday.

461,UNH,"Stocks showed mild action Friday, but the Dow snapped a four-week winning run. In general, the market maintained a positive bent amid a week jam-packed with earnings reports and a data showing weaker-than-expected growth in the U.S. economy.But the Q2 advance GDP report didn't seem that horrible beyond the headline number. While the overall 1.2% gain far missed the Econoday consensus forecast for an increase of 2.6%, the government also revised the figure for Q1 of 2015 sharply higher from 0.6% growth to 2.0%.Plus, in the latest reading, consumer spending jumped 4.2%, strongly reflecting the positive impact of relatively high employment and lower gas prices in the world No. 1 economy.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped less than 0.1%, lagging gains of nearly 0.3% for both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500. The latter hit a new all-time high, rising as high as 2,177.09 during the stock market today.The Dow's 0.1% loss for the week pales in comparison with gains of 3.2%, 1.1%, 2% and 0.3% in the prior four weeks, respectively. The Nasdaq rallied 1.2% for the week -- a fifth straight weekly advance. The S&P 500 edged lower by fewer than 2 points, or less than 0.1%.Which stocks are performing best in the Dow?One way to view this is by comparing the Relative Strength Rating, which measures a stock's performance over the past 12 months vs. the rest of the stock market. Action over the past three months carries a higher weighting. On that score, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) lead the Dow's 30 components with RS ratings of 83 and 81, respectively.J&J rose 0.6% to 125.23, padding its impressive gains since clearing a long saucer with handle near 105. Even with that large advance, J&J's annualized dividend yield of 2.6% still exceeds the S&P 500's 2% payout.J&J continues to rise after recently posting a third quarter in a row of modest earnings growth. Q3 earnings are seen rising 11% to $1.66 a share, which would be an acceleration from the 2% increase which the medical and personal care products titan saw in the second quarter.For the year, J&J's earnings per share are seen rising 8% on a 3% pick-up in revenue to $72.07 billion.UnitedHealth has had a masterful performance since it broke out of a shallow double-bottom base at 121.19 in late February. The managed care behemoth rose 0.3% to 143.20, up 18% from that proper pivot point.Ranking third in RS Rating among the Dow components is DuPont (DD). The chemicals giant is cozying up to the 70 price level, where it's had trouble piercing higher. Earlier this week, DuPont marked a 14% jump in Q2 earnings, the best result in 10 quarters. Sales slid 8%, however.Investors who seek companies with faster growth need to look at IBD's various high-growth screens, including today's IPO Leaders column. This screen looks for outstanding performers in each aspect of IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm. The latest story highlights China's Yirendai (YRD) (EPS seen rising 65% in 2016), Veeva Systems (VEEV) (EPS seen up 12% in 2016 after a 38% gain in 2015) and IBD 50 stock LGI Homes (LGIH) (EPS seen rising 36% in 2016).IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50, Big Cap 20, Stock Spotlight and Sector Leaders columns, located inside IBD Stock Lists at Investors.com, all hunt for companies with above-average fundamentals. Keep an eye out for those companies that offer something new in the form of fantastic new products, a new industry, new market conditions, new management and a stock hitting new highs in price.

"
462,UNH,"Cigna (CI) tumbled in the stock market today after becoming the latest health insurer to cite high ObamaCare medical costs. Cigna also issued weak guidance as the company is in limbo with its  troubled merger agreement with Anthem (ANTM), an analyst suggests.Cigna's second-quarter earnings per share fell 22% to $1.98, badly missing views for $2.39. Revenue rose 4% to $9.893 billion, short of expectations for $9.974 billion. The company said its Group Disability and Life Insurance segments weighed on results.The company's medical care ratio, or its expenses as a percentage of money taken in from premiums, rose to 81.7% from 80.2% a year earlier. That reflected higher-than-expected costs from patients via the ObamaCare exchanges.Anthem itself cited high ObamaCare costs in its Q2 earnings report. Centene (CNC), which has been aggressively expanding in the exchanges, reported some hefty ObamaCare losses in its recently acquired Health Net. Humana (HUM) recently announced that it would exit most ObamaCare markets, following a similar decision by UnitedHealth (UNH), due to exchange losses.Insurers' loses and exits are likely to push premiums significantly higher in 2017.Cigna stock closed down 5.2% to 128.96, gapping down below its 200-day and 50-day lines. Shares of Anthem fell 1.2%, Humana rose 0.2%, and Aetna (AET) dipped 0.5%. Centene rallied 0.8% and UnitedHealth added 0.3%.""Cigna's quarter was disappointing, and with the ANTM combination threatened by the government's attempts to block it, we expect the shares to suffer,"" Wells Fargo analyst Peter Costa said in a report. ""We wonder how much of the pressure is a result of focus on the merger, since some of the pressure seems to be related to non-core items.""Cigna's results come after the Justice Department last week sued to block Anthem's takeover of Cigna, as well as the combination of Aetna and Humana.The mergers, the government argued in a statement, ""would increase concentration and harm competition across the country, reducing from five to three the number of large, national health insurers in the nation."" Health insurers have been looking to consolidate to shore up against regulations from the Affordable Care Act.IBD'S TAKE: Like Cigna, Medicaid-focused health insurer Centene also took a hit in the stock market this week. Share prices of industry players have had a wild month due to DOJ action on mergers and struggles in the Affordable Care Act. See how the industry is performing in IBD's Stock Checkup.Cigna also said continued higher costs in its Individual Health business  -- ObamaCare exchange-compliant plans -- would cut into its full-year EPS outlook. The company slashed its 2016 earnings per share guidance to $7.75-$8.10 from an earlier forecast of $8.95-$9.35, far below the $9.29 analysts had expected.Other insurers have also struggled with their individual businesses this quarter, Costa noted.Higher costs due to Cigna's response to a recent audit by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also weighed on the second quarter and the company's full-year outlook. CMS in January suspended Cigna from enrolling new customers to some Medicare plans due to what the agency called ""systemic failures"" in providing services to patients.
"
463,UNH,"A new government report shows that the average ObamaCare Medicaid expansion enrollee cost the federal government $6,366 in 2015, 49% above the per-person cost of $4,281 projected a year ago.The surprising cost overrun is likely to result in increased scrutiny of Medicaid program expenses by Congress and could pose a risk to insurer profits in the one area of ObamaCare that has provided a reliable boost for their bottom lines.UnitedHealth (UNH), which is pulling out of the individual health insurance exchange business in most states amid growing losses, is among companies profiting from the Medicaid expansion. Public companies vying for the Medicaid managed care business include Centene (CNC), Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH).Brian Blase, a researcher at George Mason University's Mercatus Center and Forbes columnist, was first to highlight the cost explosion, which he said likely stems from incentives built into the Medicaid expansion that, for now, is 100% paid for by the federal government.""The rates are much higher than the amounts for previously eligible Medicaid adult enrollees and suggest that states are inappropriately funneling federal taxpayer money to insurers, hospitals and other health care interests through the (Affordable Care Act) Medicaid expansion,"" Blase wrote.IBD'S TAKE: More bad news for insurers from the government today. The Justice Department has filed to block both the Anthem-Cigna merger and the Aetna-Humana deal.State Medicaid managed care contracts require insurers to pay back the government if their benefits per enrollee fall below a certain level, yielding profits that are deemed excessive. While those repayments aren't final, they could lower per-enrollee costs slightly, to $5,910, the annual report on Medicaid's outlook said.One surprise, Blase notes, is that Medicaid expansion enrollees now cost more per person than adults who are eligible for Medicaid under pre-expansion rules. Medicaid actuaries still anticipate that the new group will eventually cost less per person than the previously eligible group, which includes pregnant women, but only 7% less. That compares to a prior projection that Medicaid expansion enrollees would cost 30% less per person in 2023 than costs for those previously eligible.The upshot, Blase says, is that federal Medicaid spending and budget deficit projections are likely to be revised upwards when the Congressional Budget Offices takes into account the higher cost trajectory for Medicaid expansion enrollees.""Congress should closely scrutinize managed care contracts that states are making with insurers, as well as any actions that (the Department of Health and Human Services) is taking to guard against outrageously high federal payments for the expansion population,"" Blase advised.

464,UNH,"MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund (MLAAX) has built a solid 10-year performance record investing in a variety of growth stocks. The fund's sector weights show where the fund managers see the best opportunities for stock price appreciation.The $15.5 billion fund had 23% of its shareholders' money at work in consumer cyclical stocks as of Feb. 29, by Morningstar Inc.'s count. That was double the S&P 500's 11% weighting.Consumer cyclical sector funds rank eighth out of 14 sectors in performance over the past year.The fund was also overweight in health care, 23% vs. 15%. And it was overweight in technology, 24% vs. 19%.Health care funds rank 11th in one-year performance. Tech funds rank seventh.Some of the fund's consumer cyclical stocks could be poised to run higher. Amazon (AMZN) is down 13% from its 52-week high but up 25% from its February low. Trading around 601, it was working on a cup-with-handle base with a 603.34 buy point. The 600 level has been an area of resistance in recent days. Amazon is also shaping the right side of a lopsided double-bottom base. If the stock doesn't find strong volume in crossing the handle buy point, the next likely buy point would be the middle peak of the double-bottom, or 638.16. Aggressive traders might have bought when Amazon broke out of a downtrend on March 24. New buyers should wait for a breakout past the handle.Home Depot (HD), another consumer cyclical, is just above break-even so far this year. Trading around 134, it has rallied 22% off its Feb. 8 low. And it is within 2% of its 132.22 buy point.It has IBD's Composite Rating of 96. The Composite Rating combines IBD's five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings, with 99 being the highest.The home improvement retailer's sales have been lifted by the housing rebound. Also, its dividend yield is 2.1%.Among health care stocks, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is a bet that is already paying off. The provider of managed health care services is up 7% so far this year. And shares are up 18% from their Jan. 14 low.Earnings per share growth is slowing. In the past four quarters, respectively, EPS grew 30%, 15% and 3%, and then shrank 15%. Some of its slowdown is due to losses selling coverage on Affordable Care Act health exchanges.Analysts see earnings rising 11% in the current quarter and 20% for the full year.Tech giant Facebook (FB) is up 4% this year. Shares are forming a lopsided cup with handle. Trading around 111, its pivot point is 116.99.EPS grew 16%, 33% and 46% in the past three quarters, respectively. The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 99.Alphabet (GOOGL) is down about 3% this year. EPS grew 1%, 5%, 17%, 18% and 28% the past five stanzas. The stock has a 98 Comp Rating.Trading around 761, shares are in a cup-with-handle pattern, showing a 777.41 entry.The fund had big underweights in financial services, 7.5% vs. 14%. It is also underweight in energy, 0% vs. 6.8%, and in consumer defensive, 3.4% vs. 10.4%.The fund is subadvised by a team from Winslow Capital Management. Clark Winslow and Justin Kelly have been on the fund since late 2005. Patrick Burton joined in early 2013.The fund's 7.47% average annual gain over the 10 years going into Tuesday beat 71% of its peer group. Year to date, in a turbulent 2016, the fund has lost 6.30% vs. a 3.16% setback for its direct rivals and a 0.54% gain for the S&P 500.Image provided by Shutterstock.

465,UNH,"Health Reform: ObamaCare rates will skyrocket next year, according to its former chief. Enrollment is tumbling this year. And a big insurer is quitting most exchanges. That’s what we learned in just the past few days.Marilyn Tavenner, CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, revealed that she expects ObamaCare premium hikes ""to be higher than we saw previous years,"" including last year, which saw double-digit rate increases across the country.Tavenner, for those who don't know, was head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services until early 2015, which means she helped bring ObamaCare to life. In November 2014, she was boasting how “the Affordable Care Act is working to improve competition and choice among marketplace plans.""Now that she’s jumped to the other side of the fence, she’s discovered the dark side of the health reform monster she helped unleash.Why will 2017 rates spike even higher? In addition to the cost of complying with ObamaCare’s insurance regulations and mandates, there’s the fact that the ObamaCare exchanges have failed to attract enough young and healthy people needed to keep premiums down. Plus, two industry bailout programs expire this year, Tavenner notes.Oh, and she admits that people are gaming ObamaCare just like critics said they would: buying coverage after they get sick -- since insurance companies can no longer turn them down or charge them more -- then dropping it when they’re done with treatments. “That churn increases premiums. So you have to kind of price over that.”The timing of these coming rate shocks couldn’t be worse for ObamaCare supporters, since insurers will start announcing premium increases just as the presidential election heats up. Insurers have already requested 18% rate increases in Virginia.Meanwhile, IBD’s Jed Graham reported on Friday that ObamaCare enrollment has already dropped an average of more than 14% in five states since February -- a faster rate of decline than last year -- as people get kicked off for not paying premiums.Finally, we learned on Tuesday that UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is planning to drop out of almost every ObamaCare market it currently serves after losing $1 billion on those policies.The result will be less competition in those states. An analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that “more than one in four counties where UnitedHealth participates nationally would see a drop from two insurers to one if the company exits and isn’t replaced by a new entrant.”Skyrocketing premiums, fewer choices in the marketplace, and people fleeing ObamaCare in droves after signing up. This isn’t exactly what Obama promised when he signed ObamaCare into law.Democrats running for re-election this year might want to think twice about wrapping their arms around this terminally ill law. And Republicans should be busy crafting a replacement. Follow IBD Editorials on Twitter: @IBDeditorials.

466,UNH,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD), which are working toward becoming one, are both on tap to report earnings in the upcoming week.Walgreens has logged a string of double-digit earnings and revenue gains for the last four quarters, following the late-2014 completion of the merger of Walgreens and Alliance Boots. The drugstore giant then announced in October that it would acquire smaller rival Rite Aid at $9 per share in cash for a total valuation of $17.2 billion, including acquired net debt.The Walgreens-Rite Aid deal, which is still expected to close in the latter half of calendar 2016, was ""progressing as planned"" as of Walgreens' last quarterly report in January. Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mushkin, however, recently expressed doubt that the merger would get the regulatory OK.When Walgreens reports on Tuesday morning, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters anticipate an 8.5% profit rise to $1.28 per share. Revenue is seen growing over 15% to $30.66 billion.In mid-March, Walgreens and OptumRx, a unit of insurance giant UnitedHealth (UNH), announced a pharmacy benefit partnership, allowing the drugstore's pharmacies to better compete with CVS Health (CVS) on services and cost savings. CVS is a drugstore-pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) hybrid.Walgreens shares fell 0.45% in the stock market today. Shares have been in a broad period of consolidation, trading below their 200-day line since early November and finding support at their 50-day moving average in early March.Rite Aid, which has around 4,600 locations, reports early Thursday but will not be holding a conference call, due to the pending merger. Earnings are expected to tumble 50% to 6 cents a share on a nearly 23% sales climb to $8.4 billion.Shares dipped 0.1% on Monday.CVS shares retreated 0.3%. The stock recently found support at the key 200-day level in mid-March and set a 5-month high on Friday.RELATED:Walgreens-OptumRx Alliance Hits Express Scripts StockWalgreens-Rite Aid Deal: ‘Even More Doubt’ That Regulators Will OK.

Apple's stock price has closed down the last three sessions amid analyst concerns of lower iPhone demand and that it might miss estimates during the current quarter.Apple shares closed up 0.2% on the stock market today.Yahoo jumped 4.2% after several analysts raised their price targets on the stock. Late Tuesday, the company topped first-quarter earnings and revenue estimates but remained mum on its efforts to find a buyer for its core business and other businesses.RBC Capital Markets raised its price target on Yahoo to 38 from 33; Axiom Capital raised it to 37 from 36; and Goldman Sachs raised it to 38 from 37.Johnson & Johnson also got several price target hikes a day after the provider of health care products beat Q1 earnings views and raised its full-year EPS and sales guidance.

468,UNH,"The jobs report pushed stocks toward fresh all-time highs in a busy week. Tesla Motors (TSLA) announced a deal to buy SolarCity (SCTY) as tech M&A was strong. General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) fueled a sell-off in consumer-related stocks, while oil prices briefly undercut $40 a barrel. Also, the Bank of England cut rates and revived bond buying.The major averages were little changed through Thursday, but rallied Friday on the strong jobs report. The Nasdaq climbed 1.1% for the week for a record close Friday and just 10 points below its July 2015 intraday peak. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, hitting a fresh intraday best. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.6%. Energy stocks fell as oil undercut $40 early in the week, but rallied as crude recovered somewhat.The U.S. economy added 255,000 jobs in July, the second straight month of much-better-than-expected hiring, allaying fears about the economy. ISM's manufacturing index and nonmanufacturing index fell a little more than forecast, but still pointed to growth. Strong hiring and wage gains should support consumer spending and housing demand, despite many consumer-related firms reporting stalling demand.Tesla took a step closer toward acquiring SolarCity for $2.6 billion as a special committee of ""independent and disinterested"" SolarCity board members evaluated the proposal and alternatives, stating its approval of the merger. The deal still needs to be approved by shareholders and regulators.Tesla reported Q2 earnings that missed estimates but showed improvements in electric-car production. Its production is on track to support about 50,000 deliveries in the second half of 2016, which reaffirmed previous guidance.The electric-car company's losses ballooned to $1.06 a share from 48 cents in the year-earlier figure, much greater than the 52-cent loss estimate. Tesla reported non-GAAP revenue of $1.56 billion, up 33% but missing the consensus of $1.62 billion.Tesla fell 2% for the week, while SolarCity lost more than 7%.Ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies is selling its Chinese operations to Apple (AAPL)-backed rival Didi Chuxing Technologies, capitulating on an expensive battle for a foothold in China. The deal has Uber swapping its Chinese business for a 20% stake in Didi, making the former foe the largest stakeholder in Didi. In turn, Didi will become the de facto ride-hailing leader in China, valued at more than $35 billion. Uber's most recent valuations put it north of $68 billion.Verizon Communications (VZ) agreed to buy Fleetmatics (FLTX), a vehicle tracking system maker, for $2.4 billion, or $60 per share. The acquisition expands Verizon' push into web-connected vehicles, part of the Internet of Things. Ireland-based Fleetmatics' mobile-software platform lets businesses manage commercial fleets by providing data on vehicle location, fuel usage, speed and mileage.Verizon fell 3.2% for the week, dropping below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. Fleetmatics jumped 38.5% to 59.50.Time Warner (TWX) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) both turned in mixed results, but Time Warner's move to buy a 10% stake in Netflix (NFLX) rival Hulu – joining current co-owners Walt Disney (DIS), Fox and Comcast (CMCSA) -- stole headlines. Viacom (VIAB) reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, as did Lions Gate (LGF), which posted a surprise Q1 profit.U.S. oil prices fell below $40 per barrel early in the week, following July's 14% tumble, as OPEC production climbed on strong output from Nigeria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia continued to pump out oil near record highs. U.S. crude stockpiles rose in the latest week, according to the Energy Information Administration, but U.S. production dipped and gasoline supplies fell. Shale producers Continental Resources (CLR), Oasis Petroleum (OAS), and Laredo Petroleum (LPI) all lifted their output forecasts. Oil closed the week higher, at $41.80.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) plunged 16% Friday after its cancer drug Opdivo ended a string of clinical-trial successes with its failure in a trial as a single therapy of newly diagnosed lung-cancer patients. Merck (MRK) had succeeded with a similar patient group in a trial of its competing drug Keytruda, though it was aiming at a smaller potential market. Merck stock jumped 10.4%, hitting its highest level since June 2001.Earlier, Merck was reported to be talking with Biogen (BIIB) about a possible Biogen buyout, as was Allergan (AGN). This further boosted Biogen's stock a day after its partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) announced the unexpected success of a clinical trial of nusinersen, a treatment for a rare spinal disease with blockbuster potential. Biogen rose nearly 9% for the week.Meanwhile specialty drugmakers Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Shire (SHPG) rose 19% and 3.5%, respectively, after they beat estimates and raised guidance, while Pfizer (PFE), Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) slipped after they beat Q2 numbers but issued so-so guidance. Animal-health company Zoetis (ZTS) also rose after beating and raising.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) led auto stocks lower after reporting slower U.S. sales for the month of July, with Ford projecting U.S. industry sales to fall in 2016 and 2017 after years of big gains. Department stores, grocery stores, restaurants and airlines also declined, but recovered somewhat by week's end.The sell-off among consumer stocks triggers a warning for the broader U.S. economy amid falling business investment and homebuilder spending. Consumer spending rose at a strong 4.2% annual rate in Q2, but if that falters, the economy may not be able to match its anemic Q2 GDP growth of 1.2%.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) beat Q2 earnings estimates, with EPS up 57% to 47 cents, but revenue growth of 12% to $508.8 million missed views. The steakhouse chain also said early Q3 same-restaurant sales growth had slowed from Q2.The outlook comes amid growing worries about the restaurant sector overall. Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald's both recently reported weak U.S. comps amid warnings from analysts about the retail sector.But pizza delivery chains including Papa John's (PZZA) are bucking the trend. Papa John's said EPS jumped 30% to 61 cents to top views, and raised guidance for the rest of the year. Also, chicken-themed El Pollo Loco (LOCO) and Wingstop (WING) rallied on their results, while Jack In The Box (JACK) soared on its earnings.Separately, Monster Beverage (MNST) reported weaker-than-expected earnings growth, but topped on revenue forecasts. Monster Beverage, a Leaderboard stock, rallied Friday, hitting a new high.IBD'S TAKE: Investors should look for growth stocks clearing proper buy points. IBD Leaderboard is a premium service that provides detailed chart analysis of leading stocks. See what other top-rated growth names are at or near buy points.The Bank of England cut interest rates by a quarter-point to 0.25%, as expected, as the U.K. economy slows in reaction to the Brexit vote. But policymakers went further, reviving government bond purchases and announcing that the BOE would buy corporate debt. They also signaled that a rate cut to near-zero is likely by year-end, but BOE Gov. Mark Carney said he's opposed to negative rates and ""helicopter"" money.Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), which makes crushed stone, sand and other aggregates used in construction, fell short of second-quarter forecasts. Rival aggregates supplier Vulcan Materials (VMC) also badly missed. In the related ready-mix concrete market, U.S. Concrete (USCR) reported that Q2 EPS plunged 59% to 54 cents, missing by 41 cents. Revenue rose 12.7% but also missed. All three blamed bad weather and said they expect better results in the second half. Martin Marietta CEO Ward Nye cited ""record or near-record rainfall and its attendant effects in many of our key markets."" Shares of the trio fell hard on the earnings misses but recovered some lost ground by the end of the week.Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported a 7% decrease in passenger unit revenue for July, saying the drop was in line with its expectations. But investors appeared worried about the tone the results set for the third quarter, during which Delta said the key metric of operating efficiency would fall 4%-6%.

469,UNH,"Even California won't escape next year's ObamaCare premium shock. Customers will face an average 13.2% premium hike before subsidies, the state's Covered California exchange announced on Tuesday.The marketplace, which had just 1.4 million customers at the end of March, is likely to see big turnover, as shoppers aim to avoid a big spike in premiums. Exchange officials said that 80% of customers would see a rate bump of no more than 5% if they switch to lower-cost insurers, though that could mean having to switch doctors.The prospect of major turnover by customers hunting for bargains creates high stakes for Anthem (ANTM), which has about 360,000 Covered California customers, more than one-third of its total exchange customers.Meanwhile, Health Net, which was acquired by Centene (CNC) earlier this year, has about 180,000 exchange members, but it's likely to face a big challenge from Molina (MOH), another Medicaid managed care play focused on the lowest-income exchange enrollees. In Los Angeles and other key markets in Southern California, Molina will offer the lowest-cost plans, giving it a chance to significantly grow its 4% statewide market share.UnitedHealth (UNH) is dropping out of the California exchange business, along with most other state exchanges, which should give a nice lift to company profits in 2017.The big jump in average premiums comes after two years in which state officials drove a hard bargain and limited the rise to 4%. Covered California officials blamed the expiration of ObamaCare's temporary reinsurance program, which has helped to pay some of the bills of the most expensive patients.Officials also said that two unnamed insurers have been hit hard by people who enrolled after the end of the open-enrollment period ""who may be enrolling in health insurance only after they become sick or need care.""Unlike most states, California offers only standardized plans. Next year, the bronze plan will have a $6,800 deductible (including a $500 drug deductible), which is up from $6,500 this year and $5,000 the prior year. Meanwhile, the standard silver plan will cap out-of-pocket costs at $6,800, up from $6,250 this year.With California rates now in, it looks like average exchange premiums are set to jump about 20% nationwide next year.

470,UNH,"Aetna's decision to abandon its ObamaCare expansion plans and rethink its participation altogether came as a surprise to many. It shouldn't have. Everything that's happened now was predicted by the law's critics years ago.Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said that this was supposed to be a break-even year for its ObamaCare business. Instead, the company has already lost $200 million, which it expect that to hit $320 million before the year it out. He said the company was abandoning plans to expand into five other states and is reviewing whether to stay in the 15 states where Aetna (AET) current sells ObamaCare plans.Aetna's announcement follows UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) decision to leave most ObamaCare markets, Humana's (HUM) decision to drop out of some, Blue Cross Blue Shield's announcement that it was quitting the individual market in Minnesota, and the failure of most of the 23 government-created insurance co-ops. And it follows news that insurance companies are putting in for double-digit rate hikes that in some cases top 60%, and news that the Congressional Budget Office has sharply downgraded its long-term enrollment forecast for the exchanges.Who could have envisioned such problems? Not ObamaCare backers. They were endlessly promising that the law would create vibrant, highly competitive markets that would lower the cost of insurance.Critics, however, were spot on. They said that, despite the individual mandate, ObamaCare wouldn't attract enough young and healthy people to keep premiums down.The Heritage Foundation, for example, said that under ObamaCare, ""many under age 35 will opt out of buying insurance altogether, choosing to pay the penalty instead."" That's just what has happened.Critics predicted sharp hikes in premiums and big increases in medical claims. That's what's happened.Critics said people would game the system, waiting until they got sick to buy insurance, then canceling it once the bills were paid, because of the law's ""guaranteed issue"" mandate. That's happening, too. In fact, administration officials are trying to tighten the rules to mitigate this problem.Critics said insurers would abandon ObamaCare amid substantial losses. Anyone want to dispute that this is happening?These dire predictions weren't pulled out of thin air. Several states had already tried ObamaCare-style market reforms in the 1990s, only to see their individual insurance markets collapse. A 2007 report by Milliman Inc. looked at eight states that had adopted the ""guaranteed issue"" and ""community rating"" reforms at the heart of ObamaCare.Like Obama, these states wanted to create insurance markets where no one could be denied coverage, or charged more, just because they were sick. But Milliman found that these regulations resulted in fast-rising premiums, a drop in enrollment in the individual market, and an exodus of health insurers.Sound familiar?By the time ObamaCare came around, most of those states either abandoned or overhauled this regulatory scheme, only to have it reimposed on them.ObamaCare architects figured they could avoid the fate of those state experiments by including the individual mandate and subsidies for lower income families.However, consulting firm Oliver Wyman correctly predicted in 2009 that these wouldn't work, either. ""The subsidies and mandates,"" it concluded, ""are not sufficient to drive high participation of younger, healthier members.""Aetna's Bertolini says that what's needed now to keep ObamaCare functioning are bigger and more generous taxpayer financed insurance subsidies — i.e., bailouts. Democrats say what's needed is a ""public option"" so that consumers in states abandoned by private insurers will be able to get coverage.How about instead policymakers listen to the original ObamaCare critics? For decades, they've been calling for reforms that lift myriad anti-competitive government regulations, as well as fixes to the tax code so that it no longer massively distorts the insurance market.The resulting free market competition in health care would do what it does everywhere it's allowed to function — improve quality while improving affordability. In other words, it would achieve the things ObamaCare promised but miserably failed to deliver.

471,UNH,"The Justice Department filed lawsuits Thursday to block the Anthem merger with Cigna (CI), and the Aetna (AET) buy of Humana (HUM), arguing that they would reduce competition.Attorney General Loretta Lynch, in a morning press event, said the health insurance mega-mergers would have hurt consumers.Aetna, Anthem, Cigna and Humana, after modest initial selling, are up on the stock market today. Aetna rose 1.55%, Cigna 5.4% and Anthem 2.6%. Humana jumped 8.3%, though it found resistance at its converging 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Investors had largely priced in the risk of regulators blocking the deals after months of signals and reports that the DOJ was skeptical.All four insurers responded that they would fight the lawsuits in court. That would put the deals, announced in 2015, in limbo for several months.Aetna said Thursday that the DOJ move was a ""misguided step backwards."" Aetna had been in talks with other insurers, reportedly WellCare Health (WCG) and Centene (CNC), about selling assets to try to win DOJ approval. Aetna has said it would fight in court to keep the deal.Cigna, meanwhile, said it is ""currently evaluating its options"" given that the deal likely would not be approved, if at all, until 2017 at the very earliest.Humana shares rallied so much in part because it raised earnings guidance and said it would exit most of its ObamaCare markets. Humana now expects to earn at least $9.25 a share excluding various items, up from its prior target for at least $8.85  and analyst consensus for $8.87. Humana expects to lose $1.33 a share from individual markets, as it loses money on the ObamaCare exchanges.Humana is slashing its ObamaCare exchange exposure, exiting at least 88% of the counties it currently serves.""The company's 2017 geographic presence for its Individual offerings is expected to cover no more than 156 counties across 11 states, down from 1,351 counties across 19 states in 2016. Humana expects 2017 premiums associated with ACA-compliant offerings in the range of $750 million to $1 billion versus approximately $3.4 billion projected for FY16. The rate review and approval processes with the related states are ongoing.""UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest U.S. insurer, has already announced it will exit all but a handful of states for 2017.

472,UNH,"Top insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH) said Tuesday its 2017 earnings will benefit as it mostly exits the ObamaCare exchanges, its worst-performing business line.UnitedHealth reported second-quarter earnings of $1.96 per share, up 13% from a year earlier, handily beating analysts' estimates of $1.89. Still, the company just slightly raised its full-year earnings outlook to $7.80-$7.95 a share from $7.75-$7.95, roughly in line with consensus estimates for $7.89.The high end of its full-year 2016 earnings guidance held steady because worse-than-expected results in its ObamaCare individual market business called for a conservative outlook, management said in an earnings call.Shares closed up 1.3% to 142.59 on the stock market today. The stock has been trading near an all-time high and finished above buy range.The good news is that as UnitedHealth shrinks its presence in state exchanges, most of its projected $605 million in ObamaCare exchange losses in 2016 will evaporate. That equates to about 35 cents a share, one analyst offered on the earnings call. UnitedHealth plans to have no more than three state exchanges in 2017, down from 34 this year,UnitedHealth upped its exchange-related loss estimate for the year by $200 million, citing higher-than-expected enrollment and the increased prevalence of customers with chronic conditions such as HIV, diabetes and hepatitis C.UnitedHealth had 820,000 exchange customers at the end of June, up about 25,000 from the end of March. The higher total was a surprise, given that national enrollment has typically declined as the year progresses. Last year, UnitedHealth said the additional customers who signed up mid-year, after open enrollment had closed, tended to be sicker.Management said on the call that the company does not ""expect any meaningful financial exposure"" from the limited exchange presence next year, though it noted that some fixed costs of participating in the exchanges will remain.IBD's TAKE: With an 88 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99, UnitedHealth ranks second among health insurers, behind only Centene Corp. (CNC). Check out IBD's Stock Checkup on UnitedHealth here.UnitedHealth kept its cards close to its vest when asked about potential acquisitions, as Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM) mull selling off pieces to attain approval for their respective acquisitions of Humana (HUM) and Cigna (CI). But those deals may be in peril, as Bloomberg reported that U.S. government officials are poised to file lawsuits to block both acquisitions.Humana took the worst of it in Tuesday trades, dropping 3.9%. Aetna fell 2.7%, while Cigna lost 2.1%, and Anthem dipped 2.2%.UnitedHealth's revenue surged 28% to $46.5 billion in the quarter, trouncing the $45 billion consensus estimate, according to Thomson Reuters.""Overall, medical cost trends remain well-controlled and consistent with expectations,"" the company said, noting that the only unfavorable development came in its individual ObamaCare-compliant business. The results seem to validate UnitedHealth's decision to pull back from the exchanges.The company's medical-cost ratio, the share of premium revenue paid out for claims, rose 30 basis points to 82%.UnitedHealthcare, the insurance unit, saw revenue grow 14% and served 2.1 million more members than in the year-earlier quarter. On a sequential basis, membership grew 320,000.The real growth driver has been the company's Optum division, which saw revenues surge 52%. Within that group, the OptumRx pharmacy services unit boosted revenue to $15.1 billion, up 69%.Management said that they executed about $1 billion in stock buybacks in the first half, but they will slow the pace of such purchases in the second half.

473,UNH,"U.S. antitrust officials are poised to file lawsuits to block Anthem's (ANTM) takeover of rival health-insurer Cigna (CI) and Aetna's (AET) deal to buy Humana (HUM), according to a person familiar with the matter.Tasked with protecting competition, Justice Department officials are concerned the deals would harm customers by turning the health-insurance industry's five biggest companies into three, according to several people familiar with the situation. The fifth major health insurer is UnitedHealth (UNH), the biggest of the quintet.The final decision could come this week and will be made by the end of the month, one of the people said.Shares of the four insurers were all lower in morning trades. Humana was hit hardest, down 5.5%. Aetna dropped 4.1%, Anthem lost 3.2%, and Cigna gave up 2.4%. UnitedHealth, which is sitting on the sidelines at present and reported earnings Tuesday, sidestepped most of the damage but still was off 0.3%.News of the government's possible thwarting of the deals came a few days after Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell highlighted the importance of competition to insurance markets.Last week, Burwell said competition among insurers can reduce costs that consumers face and improve the quality of their health coverage. Burwell declined to comment on the proposed mergers, but said: ""When there is competition, that creates downward price pressure, and it also creates upward quality pressure.""Burwell went on to say: ""We've always thought and talked about why competition is an important part of the overall picture, and that's not just in the marketplace but overall for the nation in terms of our health care.""

476,UNH,"Stocks came under selling pressure early yesterday morning as expected, but then did a complete 180 degree turn around closing mostly higher with the Dow up triple digits, piercing the psychologically important 18k level while the S&P surged 13 pts ending the day right on the highs as the rally that people love to hate moves on. Pressure on oil prices worked against stocks in the first moments of trading but investors/traders and the big banks ended up ignoring the news out of Doha in a move that surprised many.Mkts around the world are all celebrating today...taking their cue from the turnaround in US equities....US futures are rocketing higher - currently up 11 pts as we kiss the psychological 2100 level.....but as my friend Scott Redler (@RedDogT3) tells me on twitter this morning""The first kiss us usually meets some opposition, then the romance gets you around the bases"" - to which I say - Yes, but it is the first kiss that is the sweetest which makes you want to go back for more.....and more is what it looks like we are gonna get today.....Remember - the mkt is a discounting mechanism....it is looking 4 - 6 months out....the trading today is not about today.....(Just sayin.....) - it is really about what the mkts expect in the fall......and by the looks of it - the mkt is expecting great things...Asian mkts were all higher overnight - Japan which got clobbered on Monday - snapped back and regained 100% of Monday's losses.....as we saw the Yen weaken a bit....a stabilizing oil mkt is also helping to support mkts today....After yesterday's mkt action - it appears that investors are disconnecting from the whims of the oil mkt....at least for now and concentrating on earnings.....European mkts are also enjoying an explosive rally....because why? Earnings and oil......and the sense is that maybe - the whole Mid-East OPEC summit was all hype.....to confuse the conversation.....interesting that the possibility of increased production has caused oil to stabilize and rally a bit from the Monday lows.....Does it feel like something else is going on? FTSE +0.56%, CAC 40 + 1.21%, DAX + 2.22%, EUROSTOXX +1.58%, SPAIN +0.88% and ITALY + 0.57%.Now just a thought or two about yesterday.....and the role that the Deputy Crown Prince is now playing......Look the big story was OIL and POLITICS – Mid East politics – and after two months of all the hype about this pending agreement in a production freeze – traders and the mkts had to deal with the fact that there was no deal – which now sets up the oil mkt for a possible 'free for all'….Keep your eyes on Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – for he is now the name to know – for it was this 30 yr old son of King Salman who has now turned over the apple cart and merged the commercial considerations of the kingdom with his political stance – a move that is in complete contrast to what was existing policy.......You see for the past 20 yrs – Ali Al-Naimi – the current Saudi oil minister has kept those two issues on separate pages – keeping supply and pricing as the main drivers of any production decisions, always cooperating with the other members – including Iran – no matter what their politics were – in the past to cut production to boost oil prices. The Deputy Crown Prince is not sure he agrees with this policy and so while all the talk has been about how the Saudi's were cooperating with Russia, Venezuela and Qatar – Iran was still the thorn in Prince Mohammed's side….so in a bid to establish himself as an emerging 'force' - as the potential heir to the throne - he nixed the oil deal sending oil mkts into a tailspin on Sunday night/Monday.What is important to understand is that the deputy Crown Prince has now burst onto the global stage since his father became King last year and appears to have every intention of letting the world know. He was appointed the Defense Minister – and is the one responsible for launching the latest military campaign in Yemen while also chairing the country's 'economic planning body' and the council that controls the massive 'state owned' oil company. In a telling interview last week with Bloomberg – the Prince was very clear –""We don't care about oil prices, $30 or $70, they are the same to us. We have our own programs that don't need high oil prices.""This is not how the rest of the OPEC and non OPEC members feel at all – so by nixing any deal he has protected the Saudi's mkt share, and has secured their role as a 'leader' while at the same time laying the groundwork for continued political instability in the region.OK - back to the mkts.....After the initial concerns over these recent developments – the focus returned to US earnings…the day started off with better numbers from Pepsico (PEP), Hasbro (HAS), JB Hunt (JBHT) and in a another surprise move – we learned that Morgan Stanley (MS) – while reporting horrible numbers did in fact ""beat all the estimates."" Net Income FELL 54%, Equity trading revenues FELL 34%, Fixed Income trading revenues FELL 52% and Investment Banking Revenues FELL 15% - but yet they somehow managed to beat the 'much lower' EPS expectation….so all this means is that we must watch out for Goldman Sachs (GS) report this morning.....Analysts expect EPS of $2.48......Now remember – Uncle Lloyd pre-announced this 're-structuring' plan late on Friday – so investors/traders have been prepped about all the bad news and how he has dealt with it head on…. – and like Cousin Jamie (Dimon) of JP Morgan (JPM)– Uncle Lloyd knows how to 'massage' the street analysts – so what I expect to hear this morning is a 'BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF EPS' beat to rival even the most generous estimate….and the clock ticks towards 7:30 am......In other news - United Health (UNH) just reported a better number - $1.81 vs. exp of $1.72, Philip Morris (PM) on the other hand missed - $0.98 vs. exp of $1.10..... Watch for Brinker (EAT), Comerica (CMA), Genuine Parts (GPC), Harley Davidson (HDI), Kansas City Southern (KSU),Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Take Good Care

478,UNH,"UnitedHealth (UNH) is right: ObamaCare's insurance markets aren't working.That's not just the view of the nation's biggest insurer and other carriers losing money in the individual market. A new analysis from the Avalere Health consultancy confirms that ObamaCare is unintentionally punishing insurers that offer policies with lower deductibles and broader networks.Even the Obama administration understands that there are problems with a key feature of the law's individual market reforms -- the risk-adjustment program that's meant to neutralize the risk that some insurers will rack up losses because they attract higher-cost members, even as others with low-cost members reap profits.On Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services is convening a full-day meeting of stakeholders to begin hashing out a plan to better level ObamaCare's playing field.That won't solve all of ObamaCare's problems. If the relatively young and healthy don't think ObamaCare plans are worth the price — even if they have to pay a penalty — then there may not be enough low-cost members to balance out those with higher costs.Yet the importance of effective risk adjustment shouldn't be underestimated. If risk adjustment can't be made to work, insurers will have no choice but to do everything they can to make their plans look as unappealing as possible to consumers facing high medical costs. Deductibles will rise as high as possible and networks will become as narrow as possible.In fact, there are signs that's already happening. For example, Centene's (CNC) Ambetter plans in a number of states are offering low-priced silver coverage with bronze-type deductibles -- as high as $6,500. Such policies cover some basic costs before the deductible. Primary care visits cost $30, specialist visits $60 and generic drugs $15. But big-ticket items like specialty drugs, emergency-room visits and surgical procedures aren’t covered until after a patient racks up $6,500 in in-network bills.(High-deductible, low premium silver plans also reduce subsidies available on other plans, because subsidies are based on the second-cheapest silver plan in any given market.)UnitedHealth and Humana (HUM), which have both racked up losses and said they may abandon the exchange business, will likely base their decisions at least in part on an assessment of whether risk-adjustment will work effectively.“If the risk-adjustment model is inaccurate, then plans that enroll a disproportionate share of sicker enrollees may experience financial losses and exit the market, even if they have priced premiums accurately,” Avalere's Tom Kornfield said in discussing the group's new critique of the program.Yet good news for UnitedHealth regarding risk adjustment may not be as positive for the earnings outlook for Centene, Molina Healthcare (MOH), and other companies profiting from the ObamaCare exchange status quo.The way that risk-adjustment is supposed to work is that insurers set their rates based on the overall health of the risk pool, which includes insurers operating on and off the exchange. Then, plans which enroll lower-cost enrollees subsidize plans with higher-cost enrollees through transfer payments, the size of which are determined by a complex set of criteria and calculations.In its analysis, Avalere highlighted three main problems with ObamaCare's risk-adjustment model.First, the model was constructed based on the health experience of the large-group employer market. Yet ""actual individual market enrollees tend to be older, lower-income, and have higher health needs,"" Avalere said. ""These enrollees also tend to move in and out of coverage throughout the year.""Second, the diagnosed diseases used to identify plans with a disproportionate share of high-costs patients ""are not reflective of the health needs of the population"" in the individual market, Avalere said.Lastly, ObamaCare's risk-adjustment model excludes information about prescription drugs an enrollee receives. As a result, ""plans may be systematically undercompensated for enrollees who use high-cost medications, because they are not used to inform disease identification and severity.""Avalere noted a perceived risk that the inclusion of prescription information in risk-adjustment calculations could encourage increased use of high-cost drugs ""in order to achieve higher risk scores and, thus, receive higher payments.""In other words, getting this right is not going to be easy.

The Dow Jones utility average outperformed, rising 0.2%. Volume was running lower vs. the previous session on both major exchanges, which is common in the run-up to the Good Friday holiday.The stock market will be closed Friday.Apart from the holiday, institutional investors had another reason to step back and wait. On Friday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its final figure on fourth quarter GDP. The first reading was 0.7% but it was revised to 1% on the second take. The Street's consensus estimate is for the 1% percentage to remain unchanged.

482,UNH,"Here's how big of a mess the ObamaCare exchanges are: The insurer lauded as a model of success for turning a profit in its exchange business is actually increasing the ranks of the uninsured.Centene (CNC) ObamaCare exchange profits have been cited again and again, often by analysts on the left, as proof that UnitedHealth (UNH), Humana (HUM) and other companies losing their shirts are doing it all wrong.Yet, while Centene merits credit for being an efficient, low-cost provider in states where it has contracts to manage the care of the Medicaid population, there's another side to the story. A closer look at Centene's much-heralded success reveals that competition between insurers on the ObamaCare exchanges has become toxic. Rather than being a boon to consumers looking for a good deal, competition is hurting the very people it is supposed to help.Even as it distances itself from rival insurers in offering the cheapest plans available, Centene is turning Mississippi into ground zero for the ObamaCare individual mandate penalty, sinking subsidized enrollment both there and in Washington state.If Centene is a model of ObamaCare success, the logical takeaway is that there is little prospect of healthy competition in the exchanges as long as the customer base remains so narrow, so old and in such poor health. Not even the so-called public option — letting government compete against private insurers, as President Obama and Hillary Clinton are calling for — would be likely to help, if a level playing field were even possible. Rather, a fundamental rethinking of the marketplace is likely needed to broaden participation and create incentives that attract rather than punish the relatively young and healthy.Take a look at what's happening in Mississippi. Recall that in this, ObamaCare's third year, enrollment was expected to be on the upswing as the ramping up of the individual mandate compelled more people to get coverage after weak take-up in 2015. That happened to a very modest degree in many states, but not Mississippi, where the number of people getting subsidized coverage fell by 2,367, or 3.1%.To get a sense of just how lousy that is, consider that only 40% of the subsidy-eligible exchange population is enrolled in Mississippi, putting it dead last among states which didn't expand Medicaid and, therefore, cater to a more heavily subsidized group.Yet the fallout was entirely predictable. Although subsidies are pegged to the premium of the second-lowest-cost silver plan in each market, Centene has been scrunching down its silver premiums by making the plans more bronzelike — with deductibles as high as $6,500 this year and a $7,050 silver-plan deductible coming in 2017. That in turns shrinks the government subsidies that are supposed to help make coverage affordable. If customers can't afford, or don't like, the cheap Centene silver plans on offer, they'll have less of a subsidy to buy a bronze plan or a silver plan from a competitor.In the largest HealthCare.gov market in 37 states, the second cheapest silver plan costs, on average, 27% more than the cheapest bronze plan this year. But in Mississippi, where Centene's Ambetter brand is the low-cost provider, the gap between bronze and silver is only 12.6% in 2016, down from 34.8% in 2015.Just look at what happened to the cost of coverage as a result: A 30-year-old in Yazoo City earning about $25,000 (214% of the poverty level) has to pay $554 more for the cheapest bronze plan, $1,478 vs. $924 in 2015. While the cheapest bronze plan from Ambetter saw before-subsidy premiums rise 12%, the cost of its second cheapest silver plan fell 7.5%, shrinking the annual subsidy by nearly $300, or 25%.Try to put yourself in those modest-income shoes. If you're in good health and making $25,000 a year, here are your three unaffordable options: Buy the cheapest silver plan from Ambetter for $1,750, with a $4,500 deductible even after extra cost-sharing subsidies; buy a $6,800-deductible bronze plan for $1,450; or pay a $695 penalty, equal to 2.8% of your income.Next look at Washington state, another place where Centene's success has led to a decrease in subsidized enrollment. According to data from the Department of Health and Human Services, the number of paying ObamaCare customers receiving subsidies at the end of March was down over 14,000, or 11.3%, from a year earlier, 110,476 vs. 124,505.What might have precipitated the drop? A 30-year-old in Seattle earning 250% of the poverty level got a $319 subsidy in 2015 but no subsidy at all this year, boosting the after-subsidy cost of the cheapest bronze plan by 20%.Now Washington's enrollment of just 36% of subsidy-eligible customers is the worst of any state, except two with unusual circumstances. New York just shifted nearly half of the state's exchange members to a public plan, while the collapse of Colorado HealthOP at the end of 2015 left 69,000 exchange customers in the lurch.Meanwhile, in Indiana, subsidies for buying coverage are set to fall in 2017 for a second straight year, largely due to Centene's aggressive silver-plan pricing strategy. Next year's subsidy for a 30-year-old in Indianapolis earning about 250% of the poverty level will fall to $571, down from $627 this year and $1,012 in 2015. Hoosier State enrollment has been falling dramatically, though the state's Medicaid expansion in February 2015 partly explains the drop.The untenable nature of the competition within the exchanges has been underscored in recent weeks by the impending collapse of more nonprofit ObamaCare co-ops after they were hit with big risk-adjustment bills. That ObamaCare program is meant to compensate insurers which attract a relatively high-cost customer base by awarding them a portion of the premiums — sometimes 25% or more — collected by insurers with relatively healthy customers.Molina Healthcare (MOH) has sometimes been cited, along with Centene, as evidence that it's possible for insurers to make money in the exchange business. Yet that status is in doubt after Molina got hit with a $254 million risk-adjustment bill, $40 million more than it allowed for when it reported year-end 2015 earnings. Molina, in a quiet period before earnings, hasn't commented on the charge.
"
483,UNH,"Believe it or not, the text of the law known as ObamaCare demands that companies provide — not just offer — the same health coverage to most rank-and-file, full-time workers as they do to the CEO.So why did Starbucks (SBUX) just announce -- along with wage increases -- that it's going to let its store employees opt for a lower level of insurance and more take-home pay?""The new health care options allow partners to only pay for the coverage they want and will actually use,"" Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz wrote in a letter to employees.One reason Starbucks is making the move is likely because a lot of workers want that option, which might save them $800 a year. Another reason is that, six years after its passage, the IRS has never been able to translate ObamaCare's pie-in-the-sky dictate into a workable regulation and probably never will.No big deal, you might think, if it's truly pie in the sky. Yet beyond the happy talk of everyone getting the same excellent employer health coverage, the reality of ObamaCare's employer rules has been a disaster for modest-wage, full-time workers and their families.According to Kaiser Family Foundation estimates, there were as many as 4.9 million Americans who were uninsured last year but ineligible for subsidies to buy coverage via the ObamaCare exchanges because they — or a spouse — were offered coverage by an employer.This is the predictable result of employer mandate rules that shield companies from potential fines as long as they offer workers ""affordable"" coverage that costs much more than their modest-wage workers are likely to pay: as much as 9.66% of their gross income for a high-deductible bronze-type plan in 2016.Even low-wage employers offering a somewhat better deal haven't found many takers. Insurance take-up by fewer than 10% of low-wage workers at a company is commonplace, the New York Times has reported. Wendy's (WEN) initially expected its health insurance tab to jump by $25,000 per restaurant. But the burger chain cut that to $5,000 before the law got off the ground in 2013 because Wendy's found few interested employees.This year, for a 30-year-old full-time worker earning $10 an hour ($20,800 a year), ObamaCare deems a $2,000 annual premium for a $6,000-deductible employer plan to be affordable. Yet individuals at the same income level who have no offer of employer insurance can get a subsidized bronze exchange plan for $437 per year, according to Kaiser's health subsidy calculator.The rules don't just hurt workers; they also narrow the potential pool of exchange members, leaving a sicker group of customers that has swamped the likes of UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana (HUM) with losses and forced them to the exits in a number of states.Amid an absence of more sensible rules, ObamaCare has encouraged employers to offer a type of coverage that the law's crafters thought was history: so-called ""skinny"" plans that don't cover hospitalization or surgery but cost little and will allow workers to avoid an individual mandate tax penalty. The plans are reportedly popular in the staffing and accommodation industry and among other low-wage employers. Another new twist to hold down employer costs is health insurance that doesn't cover outpatient surgery.A survey from the National Business Group on Health found that 16% of large employers in 2015 planned to offer workers the choice of skinny coverage or a more comprehensive but much less affordable plan that would keep the companies from having to pay a mandate penalty.The real fear about the ObamaCare employer mandate was that employers would cut workers' hours below 30 per week to dodge the fines for failing to offer suitable coverage. As Goldman Sachs pointed out recently, that's happened to at least a modest extent and partly explains why nearly 2 million more people are stuck working part-time than a decade ago. Yet companies haven't had to resort to cutting workers to part-time status in a major way because they have figured out how to minimize their liability under the law.Labor Department data confirm that ObamaCare's employer mandate has largely struck out when it comes to getting employers in low-wage industries to provide health coverage to their workers.Private service-occupation employers paid even less for employee health benefits in the first quarter of 2016 — just 89 cents per hour of work — than they paid before ObamaCare became law in 2010. That compares with health benefits of $2.71 per hour for workers in production occupations and $3.81 per hour of work for managers and professionals.The accommodation and food service industries still pay just 65 cents per work hour in insurance benefits, up a mere six cents in the past six years. Retailers now pay $1.25 per hour of work on employee insurance benefits, virtually unchanged from $1.24 per hour in early 2010. While Wal-Mart (WMT) said it faced $500 million in extra health benefit costs in 2014 (and responded by eliminating coverage for some part-time workers), other companies whose employment policies don't face such intense scrutiny have had a relatively easy time escaping the law's costs.The reality couldn't be much further from the idealized vision of low-wage workers getting the same coverage as their bosses.A small section of ObamaCare entitled ""Prohibition on Discrimination in Favor of Highly Compensated Individuals"" was supposed to extend rules governing self-funded plans to all employer-sponsored group plans. But benefits experts suggest the self-funded plan rules were fuzzy and often ignored in the past, and the IRS said it would review those rules even as it drew up regulations for fully insured plans.The self-funded plan rules essentially require that health benefit plans offered to top executives be offered on similar terms to 80% of full-time workers over the age of 25. Yet offering isn't enough: At least 70% of eligible workers must take the offer to prove nondiscrimination.

484,UNH,"Stocks gave up some gains in early afternoon trading Thursday. Hunger for blue chips seemed to increase as the Dow Jones industrial average paced the gains among the popular indexes.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.6%, adding to its 2.7% advance claimed over the prior four sessions. The 30-component blue chip index is now up 6% year to date. The Nasdaq composite, up 0.4% Thursday afternoon, has climbed 3.5%.Oil, steel, banking, fertilizer, railroad and semiconductor stocks helped hoist the S&P 500 0.3% higher. Volume is running higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.The Dow Jones industrial average seemed to relish its role as a perennial laggard since the market's bottom in October of 2011. While the index posted an impressive gain of 76% to a peak of 18,288 in March 2015, it paled vs. the Nasdaq composite's 128% run over roughly the same period of time.However, the individual action among stocks in the Dow continues to get better. Take the health care sector. Pfizer (PFE) is acting like a big-cap leader lately. The Big Pharma play rose 1% to 36.67, up 3% from a 10-month saucer with handle.Notice how in the three-week-long handle, which began on June 10, the stock pulls back lightly and volume dries up in most of the sessions. That's ideal action as a stock sets up a potential breakout, which in Pfizer's case took place on July 1. While volume was quiet on the breakout, IBD research has found that in some cases, volume may come in strong a few weeks into the move toward new highs.Wall Street seems convinced that Pfizer has returned to a growth track, as Q2 profit is seeing rising nearly 11% to 62 cents a share on a 9% pickup in sales to $12.94 billion. This week, the ethical drug giant reportedly closed a deal to sell medicines in the Russian market and also got a label extension for its Prevnar vaccine for pneumonia. Doctors may now prescribe the vaccine to adults under 50 years old.Also in the Dow, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH) are acting well after recent breakouts. The former is flat at 123, extended from a recent breakout past a 115.10 buy point. Its Relative Price Strength line has been rising since June, indicating that J&J has been outperforming the S&P 500.UnitedHealth is down 0.6% intraday, but at 140.60 the stock remains above a 135.21 flat-base entry. In a flat base, the decline from head to toe must not exceed 15%. UnitedHealth's five-week flat base features a very mild 5% drop, indicating a reluctance among institutional investors to sell shares.The 5% buy zone extends up to 141.97 for UnitedHealth. The company earns a respectable 89 Composite Rating out of a maximum 99 on IBD Stock Checkup, second only to managed care industry peer Centene (CNC).Johnson & Johnson and United Health report earnings next week.Fellow Dow stock JPMorgan Chase (JPM) gapped up, leading the money center banks with a 1.7% gain to 64.21. Volume is running more than double normal levels. The Wall Street bank posted a 1% rise in Q2 profit, beating analysts' consensus view, as revenue lifted 5% to $26.8 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon earlier this week announced plans to raise minimum pay for a large number of the bank's employees.The stock still needs work on building the right side of a potential new base. JPMorgan's 44 RS Rating lags those of Pfizer (73), UnitedHealth (81) and J&J (86).Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, data center operator CoreSite Realty (COR) cooled off for a third day in a row, down 1.5% to 84.55, as investors appeared to cash in more gains in dividend-paying REITs. Nursing and physician staff outsourcer AMN Healthcare (AHS), the highest ranking medical name on the IBD 50, jumped nearly 2% to 43.59 in dull turnover. The stock has risen more than 30% past a 33.40 handle entry on a long double-bottom base. In general, at least some profits should be taken when a stock rises 20% to 25% past a proper pivot point.As seen in Wednesday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend. This means an investor has a higher probability of making money when buying breakouts of high-quality growth stocks at proper buy points.

485,UNH,"Stocks finished narrowly mixed Wednesday as the market paused from its recent rally. But the Dow Jones industrial average eked out another new high, thanks to gains from UnitedHealth Group and Microsoft.The Dow closed up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 was fractionally higher. The Nasdaq composite eased 0.3%, though it held above the 5000 level. Volume was lighter across the board vs. Tuesday, according to preliminary data.Oil stocks led the downside in the stock market today, as West Texas Intermediate crude slid nearly 4% to about $45 a barrel. The Energy Information Administration's weekly industry report showed a surprise rise in U.S. oil stockpiles. Biotechs and retailers also lagged.Gold miners were the biggest gainers, with gold futures climbing nearly 1% to $1,344 an ounce. Managed care providers and media stocks advanced too. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) led the Dow with a 1.2% gain. Shares are nearly extended from a 135.21 flat-base buy point cleared June 2.Microsoft (MSFT), up nearly 1% to stretch its winning streak to a seventh straight session, also boosted the blue chip index. Shares are working on the right side of a shallow consolidation. RBC Capital Markets reiterated an outperform rating and 61 price target on the Surface and Xbox maker, citing confidence in Microsoft's ability to maintain EPS growth.CSX (CSX) surged 4% in heavy volume to a seven-month high after the railroad operator reported Q2 earnings and revenue that topped views.On the IBD 50, Masco (MAS) followed through on a Tuesday breakout past a 33.02 flat-base buy point, adding 1% in heavy volume to a new high. The cabinet and plumbing products maker is still in buy range from the entry. But Five Below (FIVE), GrubHub (GRUB) and Blue Buffalo Pet Products (BUFF) shed more than 2% each.On the economic front, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book cited modest growth in the U.S. economy from the Fed's 12 districts and some softness in consumer spending.Weekly jobless claims and the Producer Price Index for June are on tap for Thursday, while James Bullard and Dennis Lockhart are among Fed chiefs scheduled to speak.

486,UNH,"Centene (CNC) reported blowout second-quarter earnings, but the stock fell sharply after reporting big ObamaCare-related losses for Health Net.The Medicaid-focused health care provider also poured cold water on speculation that it would bid on assets put up for sale to clear the way for mergers, such as those being attempted by Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) or by Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI).Second-quarter earnings per share surged 70% to $1.29, well above views for $1.09, and the company's full-year EPS guidance of $4.20-$4.55 was above forecasts for $4.10. The company's health benefits ratio -- the amount of income paid out for insurance claims -- was 86.6%, better than 89.1% a year earlier.Revenue nearly doubled to $10.987 billion, above estimates for $10.785 billion, largely due to Centene's acquisition of Health Net in March.But Centene had to set a $300 million premium deficiency reserve, mostly due to Health Net's losses in the California and Arizona exchanges. Many other insurers, including UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana, have also set some reserves.Centene says its overall performance in Affordable Care Act exchanges is strong.Centene shares fell 8.5% to 68.87 in the stock market today, plunging below a 71.63 entry point in a cup-with-handle base. But the stock closed above its 50-day line after tumbling as low as 63.44 intraday.IBD'S TAKE: Centene has been the leader in the Medical-Managed Care group, but other health insurer stocks are performing well. To compare Centene's vitals vs. objective criteria and its peers, go to IBD Stock Checkup.UnitedHealth and Humana have announced plans to exit most ObamaCare exchange markets, but Centene has been expanding its reach, pushing up deductibles to woo customers with lower premiums. The insurer has benefited strongly from the law's Medicaid expansion.Meanwhile, the Justice Department last week sued to halt the Aetna-Humana and Anthem-Cigna combinations. Centene and others were reportedly attempting to buy some of the Medicare Advantage plans Aetna might have to sell to help green-light its purchase of Humana.But Centene CEO Michael Neidorff on Tuesday said that the insurer ""has not participated and will not participate in bidding and auctions. So anything that indicates that would have to be considered a rumor.""Aetna fell 0.5% and Anthem 1.7%. Cigna lost 0.1% while Humana rose 0.55%. UnitedHealth edged down 3 cents at 141.70.
"
487,UNH,"Some of the ObamaCare exchanges' lowest-cost insurers got really bad news from the Obama administration that may push 2017 premiums -- already expected to soar -- even higher.June 30 may be the most-dreaded day of the year for lower-cost and profitable plans because they find out how much of their premium revenue they have to turn over to insurers with higher-cost members under ObamaCare's risk-adjustment program.At the end of last year, Molina Healthcare (MOH) -- which has the lowest-cost exchange plans in places like Albuquerque, N.Mex.; Houston and Milwaukee -- had expected to owe $214 million under risk-adjustment for the 2015 plan year. With its first-quarter report, Molina revised up its payable amount by $20 million based on more complete information. Yet the actual risk-adjustment payments owed by the company in its nine markets sum to $254 million, as detailed in Thursday's once-a-year report from the Department of Health and Human Services.For Molina, which had a monthly average of about 240,000 exchange members last year, the payout to rival insurers amounts to more than $1,000 per customer. Nationally, an amount equal to 10% of individual market premiums is slated to be transferred from insurers with lower-risk members to those who attract a higher-risk population, HHS said. (Assuming half of all insurers have payables, that means they'll pay out, on average, about 20% of premiums, or $870 per full-year customer.)For Centene (CNC) -- with Ambetter plans that are the cheapest available in places like Seattle, Miami and Atlanta -- the risk-adjustment news was slightly worse than expected. It faces an assessment of just under $115 million for its 2015 plans vs. the $108 million the company had anticipated.Molina couldn't be reached for comment, and it's not clear whether the insurer's apparent underestimation of its risk-adjustment payable will lead it to seek even bigger premium increases for 2017 than so far requested. But in other cases, low-cost insurers have signaled that bad news on risk-adjustment from the Obama administration would have to be priced into next year's plans.Minuteman Health, which offers by far the cheapest plans in New Hampshire, said in April that it would request a 45% premium hike for 2017 if its risk-adjustment payment was as high as it feared.""As it is written now, risk adjustment punishes high-growth plans with efficient provider networks by forcing them to pay onerous sums to insurers that are slower-growth and have wide-open networks with more expensive providers,"" Minuteman's New Hampshire executive director Scott Colby said at the time.The news on Thursday was about as bad as anticipated: Minuteman owes $10.5 million for its roughly 7,250 monthly average customers for 2015, or close to $1,500 per person. Minuteman, which also does business in Massachusetts, said in March that it had set aside 41% of 2015 premium revenue collected in both states to cover its expected combined payout of $17.6 million. The total was only slightly less at $16.6 million, including a reported $6.1 million payable in Massachusetts, the only state to run its own risk-adjustment program.Maryland's lowest-cost insurer is also in a fix after Thursday's risk-adjustment report confirmed its worst fears. Evergreen Health Cooperative initially requested an 8.1% premium hike for 2017, which would have left it with by far the lowest rates in Baltimore, with the next-cheapest plan costing over 14% more. But that was before the small insurer, which launched in 2012, found out it might face a risk-adjustment liability of $22 million, or 26% of 2015 premium revenue.Evergreen sued the Obama administration earlier this month to try to block it from collecting the risk-adjustment assessment. At the time, Evergreen CEO Peter Beilenson told Bloomberg BNA that, if it had to make such an ""insane"" payment, ""We're dead.""In fact, it's on the hook for even more than it feared: $24.2 million. The bulk of that is related to the ObamaCare-compliant small group market, which accounts for a majority of Evergreen's customers.There's a strong rationale behind the risk-adjustment program. It's meant to take away the financial reward of cherry-picking low-cost customers, so insurers focus instead on delivering the best, most efficient care. Yet other insurers, including UnitedHealth (UNH), industry analysts and even the Obama administration say that the approach has been flawed.Some fixes are in the works, but those could take another year or two, and they won't solve the biggest underlying problem, which is that the entire group getting coverage via the exchanges is relatively high-cost.
"
488,UNH,"No industry faces more upheaval from the changing of the guard in the White House than the health sector, with Donald Trump pledging to sweep away ObamaCare, the defining policy effort of outgoing President Barack Obama.Yet, despite the uncertainty over whether up to 22 million people might lose coverage, health insurance stocks — with a few exceptions — have been among the big winners of the stock market's postelection rally.A few drivers of the rally are pretty obvious. Repeal of ObamaCare is expected to kill an insurance industry tax that cut the profit of industry leader UnitedHealth Group (UNH) by $1.85 billion in 2016. President Obama and Congress already passed a one-year moratorium of the tax for 2017.A Trump administration that may be less hostile to big business combinations could let Aetna (AET) complete its acquisition of Humana (HUM) and Anthem (ANTM) close its deal to buy Cigna (CI). That latter deal could create the nation's largest health insurer, displacing UnitedHealth for the top spot in the number of insured.Still, UnitedHealth, though it's not the best sector performer since the election, is alone among major insurers in reaching an all-time high.""We see the next 10 years as holding even greater opportunity and growth than the last 10 years for this company,"" Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley said at the company's recent Investor Day conference.UnitedHealth, which is No. 6 on the Fortune 500 list and still would tower over Anthem-Cigna based on revenue — an estimated $184 billion vs. $123 billion combined in 2016 — doesn't have to have the most clients to be the Amazon.com (AMZN) of health care, as it appears well on its way to becoming.No company is better situated to capitalize on the irrepressible growth in health care spending, aging demographics and the inevitable need to control costs, and those trends are far too powerful to be derailed by a change at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.""What has UnitedHealth standing apart from other insurers is Optum,"" its fast-growing, higher-margin, health-services division that will contribute more than 40% of company operating profit this year, CFRA Research analyst Jeffrey Loo told Investor's Business Daily.Optum, which is on pace to grow revenue by 22.8% to $83 billion for 2016, has three main parts: OptumInsight, a data-analytics division; OptumRx, its prescription benefit management business; and OptumHealth, which provides medical care via 20,000 physicians and more than 500 primary and urgent care centers.Like Amazon, UnitedHealth has become the leader in customer data analytics and personalization — though instead of suggesting other books you might like, Optum can provide proactive help filling gaps in care. That might include scheduling an overdue mammogram or signing up someone ordering a prescription for a long-term diabetes-management program.Also like Amazon, UnitedHealth has expanded horizontally, carving out new ground to better fulfill its customers' needs, such as through its fast-growing network of urgent care centers. Similarly, UnitedHealth's OptumInsight unit has opened up fast-growing markets selling its expertise, just like Amazon Web Services.""Optum, while participating in a contested market, has created a demand for its technologies and services,"" noted research and consulting firm Frost & Sullivan in naming Optum its 2016 company of the year in population health management. ""The company is equally versed to draw evidence from payers, providers, employers and consumers,"" informing its ""holistic health care approach.""IBD'S TAKE: Shares of UnitedHealth are extended after breaking above a buy point at 144.58 on Nov. 10. Visit IBD University for a primer on timing stock purchases and be sure to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's underlying trend and what it means for investment decisions.All these elements, along with its mining of data derived from the 50 million people it covers and the 1 billion prescriptions it processes in a year, come together to let UnitedHealth deliver what executives like to say is ""the right care at the right place at the right time"" to achieve the best outcome while holding down costs.Despite political uncertainty over ObamaCare, Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick upgraded UnitedHealth to a buy rating this week following the company's Tuesday investor conference.""UnitedHealth made a compelling argument at its Investors Day that its balanced portfolio and growth, its innovative approaches and its commitment to fixing a broken health care system likely insulate it from downside due to political change,"" she wrote, seeing sustainable double-digit growth in earnings per share.OptumInsight CEO Bill Miller told investors that nearly 700 hospitals are using Optum analytics to predict outcomes and guide treatment for their patient populations, including more than 100 additional hospitals over the past year. Further, he said, 20 of the 25 top health plans have tapped Optum to improve their claims processing.UnitedHealth stubbed its toe with ObamaCare, piling up losses and beating a nearly full retreat from individual exchange business, but Loo sees that as being due to problems with the exchanges, rather than exposing a weakness of the company.While big coverage losses with the unwinding of ObamaCare could hurt UnitedHealth, which has benefited from the expansion of Medicaid coverage, Loo also sees potential upside from the GOP's election sweep. On one hand, efforts to rein in Medicaid could be a negative, but fiscal curbs also could lead more states to shift to Medicaid managed care. UnitedHealth told investors that it is starting five new Medicaid managed care contracts in 2017.Likewise, the GOP has always preferred Medicare Advantage to traditional fee-for-service Medicare, so there's a possibility of faster growth there. Hemsley preached his vision to investors — as the company does to policymakers in Washington — of fully shifting both Medicaid and Medicare to managed care.Such a strategy could reap savings for the government while giving UnitedHealth and other insurers a bigger cut of the government health-care pie. Currently, less than two-thirds of 72 million Medicaid beneficiaries are enrolled in managed care programs, while about 30% of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.UnitedHealth signaled to analysts that its insured base could drop by 1 million in the individual market — both on and off the exchanges — amid its pullback from ObamaCare, but that will be a tailwind for earnings in 2017 because the company has lost about $850 million on the exchanges this year.UnitedHealth shares started to break out in late October, retreated, and then surged in mid-November. Shares had been on a four-day rally but slowed to a crawl, and fell by 1.9% to close at 157.63 on Monday.

489,UNH,"The major averages ended on the positive side Monday, with the Nasdaq taking the lead as several chip stocks rallied.The Nasdaq closed up 1% to regain its 50-day moving average, the S&P 500 advanced 0.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.2%, setting another record high.

""Their flat-out fear penalized stocks inordinately,"" Valeri said.In the second half, investors' fears eased. ""By mid-February, a lot of bad news was priced into stocks, and data started to get better,"" Valeri said. ""In mid-March the market got a tailwind from the Federal Reserve, which suggested it was likely to raise rates twice this year, not four times.""Click Here To View A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersWeekly jobless rolls fell. Retail sales for January were stronger than expected, with an upward revision for December. Even manufacturing data, a sore spot previously, improved in March. Housing data showed resilience.

Tax-exempt bond funds gained 1.43%.""In the near term, there's good reason to think oil has stopped going down and the dollar has stopped going up,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. ""If that's the case, the market could get better in the second half of the year.""But, Doll cautions, oil has never staged a sharp rally. ""Commodities in general and oil in particular have never made a V bottom,"" he said. ""After declines, they've often had multiyear periods before going up the other side (of a price formation).""And since late March, the per-barrel price of benchmark light sweet crude oil has pulled back slightly.Also, China's economic growth is still not expanding. ""China is consciously reorienting its economy away from huge dependence on exports and capital investments and toward a longer-term, sustainable economy based on consumption,"" Doll said.Amid global economic uncertainty, U.S. stocks appear likely to remain a safe-haven attraction for investors.The technology and financial sectors appeal the most to Doll. ""Financials are the cheapest cyclicals in the market,"" Doll said. ""They had a big bear market in the first six weeks of the year. Now they're back up.""SPDR Financial ETF (XLF) fell 17% through Feb. 11.

""When things improve and other investors get complacent, let some go (to take profits).""Doll said he will keep some telecommunications stock in his portfolio. ""I want some defense in there,"" he said. Instead, why not utilities, which are also defensive and pay dividends? ""They're expensive now, and telecom is a better value.""Doll said he also has more appetite for consumer discretionary than staples. ""Discretionary has better valuations,"" he said. ""And staples tend to be more global, and therefore face more risk of currency headwinds.""Valeri has a similar view on some sectors. ""We're still focused on areas that benefit from further expansion,"" he said. ""That means more cyclical sectors like consumer discretionary and tech. We also have a more modest overweight to industrials.""The $1.2 billion Fidelity Select Consumer Discretionary Portfolio’s (FSCPX) recent top holdings were Amazon (AMZN), followed by Home Depot (HD), Walt Disney (DIS) and Nike (NKE).He added, ""Health care is the one defensive sector that is a focus because earnings clarity is fairly good.""Allergan (AGN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and United Healthcare (UNH) were recent top holdings of Vanguard Health Care Fund (VGHCX), which wields $46.9 billion in assets.Like Doll, Valeri is leaning away from utilities and consumer staples. Unlike Doll, he's also leaning away from telecom. ""Our expectation is for improving economic growth,"" he said. ""So those sectors won't necessarily benefit as much. Utilities and telecom are rate-sensitive, and we think rates will move gradually higher this year. So that's a headwind for those sectors. And their valuations are generally expensive.""Image by Shutterstock.

494,UNH,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) will use UnitedHealth (UNH) OptumRx for its pharmacy benefit needs, which could save companies and consumers billions.The pact likely negates the need for Walgreens making an expensive purchase of a large pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) like Express Scripts (ESRX), as some on Wall Street had speculated. Express Scripts shares fell 3.5% to 67.61 after falling as low as 65.97, near a 52-week low.Walgreens' agreement with UnitedHealth OptumRx will give it the ability to provide similar services and cost savings as arch-rival CVS Health (CVS), a combined drugstore and PBM.The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association separately launched an ad campaign Thursday touting savings from PBMs. The trade group said in a statement that PBMs, which negotiate prices and other terms between pharmacies and drugmakers/distributors, are projected to save employers, unions, government programs and consumers a combined $654 billion on drug benefit costs over the next decade.Currently the No. 2 drugstore chain by revenue, Walgreens is buying No. 3 Rite Aid (RAD), which has its own PBM, for an estimated $17.2 billion. If that deal goes through, Walgreens could choose to expand use of that PBM for the combined company.Walgreens said in a statement that the UnitedHealth OptumRx agreement includes a 90-day prescription option at Walgreens' nearly 8,200 pharmacies in the U.S., OptumRx home delivery, and 24/7 access to pharmacists.The drugstore company plans to integrate OptumRx's pharmacy care services with Walgreens' current drugstore services. The agreement will go into effect starting on Jan. 1, 2017.Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance, which operates nearly 13,000 locations in 11 countries, rose 1.5% to 83.30 in the stock market today.

"
496,UNH,"New exchange enrollment data released by the Obama administration on Friday reveal in multiple ways that ObamaCare is failing to live up to its goal of providing affordable care.That's no small problem when the law mandates that people buy coverage or face a fine. The fact that enrollment grew only modestly in the law's third year despite the ramping up of the mandate penalty underscores the reality that ObamaCare only offers poor options to far too many millions of people.No one is getting a worse deal than the people of Mississippi. Despite the fact that the state ranked near the bottom last year with enrollment of just 38% of those eligible for subsidies, the number of people signing up for subsidized exchange plans in 2016 was virtually flat from a year ago (97,943 vs 97,606 in 2015).IBD predicted last fall that Mississippi would be ""ground zero for ObamaCare's individual mandate"" because stagnant state sign-ups looked like a sure bet with after-subsidy premiums set to jump on the order of 60%, far more than in any of the 36 other states using HealthCare.gov last year.For 30-year-olds in Yazoo City earning about $25,000 (214% of the poverty level), the after-subsidy cost of the cheapest bronze plan spiked by about $550 to just under $1,500, or 6% of pay. Because this plan from Ambetter, a unit of Centene (CNC), covers little before the $6,800 deductible is met, it may make the $695 mandate tax look like the best among bad options for someone who isn't expecting big medical bills.It's becoming clear that millions of working-class Americans face a choice between paying a penalty they surely can’t afford and buying a policy — if they can foot the bill — that may still wreck their finances if they land in the hospital.While this reality is pretty pervasive, it's especially harsh in some areas, Mississippi and Washington state among them, partly due to competitive pricing decisions made by Centene. While the cheapest bronze-plan premium (before subsidies) rose about $250 in Mississippi for a $25,000-earner, the subsidy fell $300, yielding the $550 increase. That came about because the subsidies are tied to the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan, and Centene cornered the market on low-cost plans in a number of states this year by attaching bronze-like deductibles ($5,500 and $6,500) to silver plans.Centene took the same tack in Washington state, with a similar result. This year, Washington's exchange signed up 140,000 people for subsidized plans. At first blush, the 10.5% growth over last year's 126,650 total looks good, but it's deceptive because last year, unlike this year, the state only counted paid enrollment. Once nonpayers are scrubbed from the total, the number of subsidized customers in 2016 may end up being equal to, perhaps even lower than, last year's.Centene, along with other Medicaid managed care players like Molina Health (MOH), moved into the individual market with the launch of ObamaCare and has been credited with navigating the market more adeptly than bigger players such as UnitedHealth (UNH).Still, Centene's subsidy-squeezing shift isn't widespread yet. Overall, the average HealthCare.gov subsidy rose 10.3% to $290 per month from $263 a year ago, as the average share of premiums paid by those eligible for subsidies rose just under 5%, to $106 a month from $101.The Department of Health and Human Services also revealed that the exchanges ended 2015 with just under 8.8 million paid enrollees nationwide, down 25% from the 11.7 million sign-ups to start the year. As of last March, once the unpaid total was culled, there were 10.2 million members.The data also indicate that the paid ObamaCare insurance pool gets older as the year progresses. Among the 5.6 million people who renewed their HealthCare.gov coverage this year (out of 6.3 million who held policies at year-end), just 1.35 million, or 24%, were in age 18 to 34. That's down from a 28% young-adult share of sign-ups in the 2015 enrollment period.It's worth recalling that the Obama administration and Kaiser Family Foundation both set a target of about 2.8 million young-adult enrollees in ObamaCare's first year, or roughly 40% of the total, in keeping with the young-adult share of the eligible population. It's clear that the exchanges ended the second year far below that initial target, with as few as 2.1 million 18- to 34-year-olds.  This year, 3.5 million of the 12.7 million sign-ups are age 18 to 34, though it remains to be seen how many fail to pay or later exit the exchanges if they get workplace insurance.A higher share of young adults could help keep down premiums because, under ObamaCare's age-rating limit, younger people are charged more than their expected cost to restrain premiums for older adults. This helps turn ObamaCare's market upside-down relative to pre-2014 markets, with a bronze plan now costing $1,000 more for a 30-year-old than for a 60-year-old if both earn $25,000.Still, there is some evidence in the new data that the higher individual mandate penalty may be convincing people to enroll. About 38% of the additional sign-ups compared to a year ago chose bronze or catastrophic plans. Generally, people who are signing up to avoid a penalty can be expected to lean toward the cheapest plan available.The number of people with subsidized coverage via HealthCare.gov rose just 6.1% from a year ago. While a clear assessment won't be possible until we know how many people actually pay for their coverage, the weak sign-up total has left ObamaCare in much the same place that it was a year ago.Millions of people are benefiting from the exchanges, especially near-poor households that qualify for the most generous subsidies and people with pre-existing conditions that no longer have to pay an arm and a leg. But likely fewer than 1 in 3 people with income from 150% to 250% of the poverty level are now getting silver coverage that will protect their finances if they land in the hospital. The vast majority even in this modest-income group either have high-deductible bronze coverage, remain uninsured or are ineligible because they, or a spouse, work full-time for an employer who offers insurance — even if that insurance is far from affordable.

497,UNH,"U.S. companies are still desirable, but less popular targets for those in an acquisitive mood as the first quarter comes to a close.Mergers in the U.S. are down 40% year-over-year, marking the nation's lowest total global share for the January-March time frame since 2012, despite the competing bids to buy Starwood Hotels (HOT), according to Dealogic.U.S. target mergers and acquisitions volume totaled $248.2 billion, a 40% reduction from the $415.4 billion last year. U.S. target M&A comprised 36% of total volume during the quarter.Overall, global M&A volume fell 25% compared with a year ago, slipping to $701.5 billion. The number of deals has fallen 19% to 8,347. It's a year of tough comparisons, as 2015's first quarter at $934.5 billion was the biggest for deal making since 2007's record high of $1.1 trillion.Mergers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) fell 19% to $217.9 billion, the least of the three major global regions that Dealogic tracks. EMEA-targeted M&A comprises 31% of the global total, its highest quarterly share since the second quarter of 2013. Asia-Pacific targeted mergers comprises 28% with $195.9 billion of the global total, on par with 2015's first quarter.Chinese companies are among those with the biggest appetites for deal making, with ChemChina's $48 billion bid to buy Syngenta (SYT) being the largest on record for the quarter. The Johnson Controls (JCI) bid to buy Tyco International (TYC) for $16.6 billion is the quarter's largest U.S. telecom deal. Overall, telecom deals fell 50% to $39.7 billion via 151 deals, its lowest first-quarter volume since 2012.Starwood Hotels (HOT) finds itself in the middle of a merger love triangle, of sorts, with China's Anbang Insurance's $14.7 billion bid competing with Marriott International's (MAR) $13.6 billion bid for its rival hotel chain. The dining and lodging sector had its biggest first quarter for mergers since 2006, with $25.6 billion via 198 announced deals, much of the total dollar amount boosted by the Starwood bid.Technology was the quarter's top sector with $100.3 billion spent on 2,115 deals, up 10% year over year -- and containing its highest first quarter since 2000's $190.8 billion. Real estate was the second-largest sector, with $69.5 billion on 440 deals, though that was down 22% compared with 2015.Health care mergers plunged 56% to $58.7 billion, its lowest volume in four years, though it's the victim of tough comparisons as the sector had back-to-back record-breaking years in 2014 and 2015.Oil and gas volume was $24.9 billion via 208 deals, down 41% year-over-year and its lowest volume since 2005 and its lowest first-quarter activity since 2003. TransCanada's (TRP) $13.2 billion purchase of Columbia Pipeline (CPGX) is the biggest Canadian outbound deal in the energy sector on record.Finance M&A total $58.4 billion via 470 deals, making up 8% of the global total, its highest Q1 share since 2012. In that sector, Deutsche Boerse's $14.3 billion deal to acquire London Stock Exchange Group is the largest securities and commodity exchange targeted M&A on record.Goldman Sachs (GS) led global M&A among banks who advised on deals with $214.2 billion, followed by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) with $153.1 billion and UBS (UBS) with $98.7 billion.In comparison, some of the megadeals during the first quarter of 2015 were the $46 billion merger of Kraft Heinz (KHC), AbbVie's (ABBV) $21 billion bid for Pharmacyclics, and UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) $12.8 billion deal to buy pharmacy benefits manager Catamaran.

498,UNH,"Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, the biggest player in the state with 103,000 individual market customers, is the latest insurer to pull back from the state's ObamaCare exchange after piling up $500 million in losses.The hit to Minnesotans buying coverage on and off the exchange is just the latest in a series problems for what ranks as among the least-stable markets in the nation. In 2014, the dominant insurer in the marketplace, PreferredOne, dropped out of the exchange. For 2016, Blue Cross and Blue Shield hiked premiums by 49%.To top it off, marketplace demographics went from bad to nearly the worst in the nation as the relatively young and healthy shunned exchange coverage. As of April, just 20% of 2016 enrollees were in the 18-to-34 age group, down from 25% in 2015. Meanwhile, those 55 and over made up more than 38% of enrollees, up from 31% a year ago. Only West Virginia has an older tilt.Minnesota is far from the only state to see insurers leave or premiums spike. UnitedHealth (UNH)has said it will exit almost all of the 34 state exchanges where it is doing business this year. Humana (HUM) also has dropped out of multiple exchanges. Yet a close look at the Gopher State's plight provides an especially useful window on the failings at the heart of ObamaCare because the state recognized many of those problems at the outset.Starting with its launch in 2014, Minnesota's exchange was one of a kind: The state was alone in embracing ObamaCare's pseudo-public option, the Basic Health Plan. The BHP allows states to create a separate government managed care program for subsidy-eligible households earning up to 200% of the poverty level ($23,340 for a single this year).Why adopt such a program instead of just letting those low-income individuals and families buy an exchange plan? Minnesota recognized what some have labeled ObamaCare's ""bronze plan trap.""Silver-level coverage is really quite good for low-income purchasers, because it comes not only with generous premium subsidies, but also with cost-sharing subsidies that dramatically shrink deductibles and lower the ceiling on out-of-pocket costs. The problem is that many financially strapped households earning up to 200% of poverty are hard-pressed to pitch in up to 6.4% of their income on silver premiums. That leaves two lousy options: either buy a less-expensive bronze plan with a $6,000-plus per-person deductible — more than one-fourth of earned income — or go uninsured and face a fine.The harsh reality of the ObamaCare exchanges recognized by Minnesota — as well as New York, which launched its Basic Health Plan this year — is that they fail a high percentage of low-income individuals who could sorely use some help. That group includes low-income full-time workers who, along with their spouses, are ineligible for exchange subsidies if their employer offers coverage that qualifies as ""affordable"" under ObamaCare even if it is nothing of the kind.The Basic Health Plan fixes ObamaCare for some low-income households, those up to 200% of the poverty level who are eligible for subsidies. But it throws modest-income households under the bus and making things even worse for the middle class.Minnesota and New York are giving a great deal to the lowest-income group. Those up to 200% of the poverty level in New York get zero-deductible plans for up to $20 per month. Coverage via MinnesotaCare, carries a $3 monthly deductible. But that creates a bigger subsidy cliff to fall off for those who earn just above 200% of the poverty level. As one ObamaCare navigator helping Minnesotans to select the most appropriate plan wrote in an op-ed, ""a pay raise costs too much"" under the law. ObamaCare ""forces some people to make hard choices about how much more money they can really afford to earn,"" she wrote.For relatively young households with income modestly above 200% of the poverty level, MNsure really doesn't have any affordable options. The cheapest bronze plan in Minneapolis costs about $950 for 30-year-olds earning $24,000 and carries a $6,450 deductible. The cheapest silver plan for these modest earners costs almost $1,500, likely far more than most healthy individuals at this income level can rationalize spending for a plan with a $1,700 deductible and maximum of $5,000 in out-of-pocket costs for accessing medical services.Minnesota's effort to save low-income households from the bronze-plan trap is a big negative for middle-class households who qualify for little or no subsidy to buy coverage. The problem is that MinnesotaCare covers a lot of relatively young and healthy individuals, limiting the exchanges to a narrow, relatively high-cost slice of the population. While all states are facing this problem to some extent because of ObamaCare's affordability issues and the exclusion of low-wage full-time workers, it's even worse in Minnesota because it separates out another potential group of low-income enrollees.To its credit, Minnesota realizes the bad deal that modest-income households are getting, so it wants to expand its managed-care plan up to 275% of the poverty level via a waiver. Doing so will further narrow the exchange pool and likely send rates still higher. Further, improving coverage for this next income tier will, of course, cost the state more, so it's much more of a wealthy blue-state strategy than something that can be replicated around the country.One more problem with Minnesota's — and New York's — Basic Health Program: A federal judge recently ruled that the cost-sharing subsidies which help finance the program were illegally appropriated by the Obama administration, siding with House Republicans. Thus, this very flawed strategy for overcoming some of ObamaCare's serious failings remains in legal limbo.

499,UNH,"Strong sales and profit growth are important characteristics of the best stocks. But it's also important for those stocks to form sound chart patterns. Charts help investors identify the proper buy point for stocks that meet CAN SLIM criteria. Studying the chart closely can help investors determine whether a stock has set up in a proper base.""You want a stock to prove its strength to you before you invest in it,"" IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""IBD research on market winners going back to 1880 shows stocks that form correctly shaped bases have the best chance of success. Cups should show smooth action on the left and right sides of the pattern. There shouldn't be jagged edges or many wild weekly swings of 10% to 15% or more.The base should be symmetrical in shape; the number of down weeks on the left side should roughly match the number of up weeks on the right side of the pattern. Few of the big market winners broke out of a lopsided base.The same principles of symmetry and smooth, tight action generally apply to double-bottom bases. Flat bases should show tight trading.Studying examples of breakouts from sound bases will help you distinguish good from bad.IBD weekly charts and MarketSmith charts make for easy visual inspection of a stock's true price action and the quality of base patterns it creates. That's because they're on a logarithmic scale, in which a move from 10 to 20 looks the same as a move from 20 to 40. In other words, moves of equal percentages look the same.On an arithmetic scale, a move from 20 to 40 would look bigger than a move from 10 to 20. That's not right, since it's the percentage change that matters, not the absolute change.FHP International, a provider of managed health care services and insurance, formed a solid base in late 1988 with a 13.23 buy point. The base was 13 weeks long. It showed institutional support at 10.88 (1).The pattern was 17% deep, nicely shallow, and there were no wild swings. The stock also closed at weekly highs several times as it climbed the right side of the base, another bullish sign.FHP broke out Jan. 24, 1989, in more than double its average daily volume. It nearly quadrupled over the next 10 months, hitting a high of 51.13 on Oct. 3. FHP was acquired in 1997 by PacifiCare Health Systems, which itself was bought by UnitedHealth Group (UNH) in 2005.A note of caution before buying any stock: Make sure the market is in a confirmed uptrend. Prefer stocks that are at a first- or second-stage base, because later bases tend to be risky. Also, check for recent excessive stock splits or share offerings that might dilute the stock's value.(Editor's Note: This story was originally published in the Feb. 5, 2013, edition of IBD.)

500,UNH,"Federal regulators have expressed concerns about the Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) merger and could scuttle the $48 billion deal, according to reports. But so far, investors, while taking notice, aren't panicking.The merger would bring the number of health insurance giants in the U.S. down to three -- UnitedHealth (UNH), Anthem and Aetna (AET) -- including Aetna's pending acquisition of Humana (HUM).Anthem and Cigna management met with Justice Department officials and representatives of more than a dozen state attorneys general earlier this month, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited sources close to the situation.The government regulators expressed concern that the companies wouldn't be able to provide enough concessions to preserve competition in the health insurance sector. The companies outlined plans to make changes they hoped would be sufficient to ease those concerns, the report said.In addition, California's insurance commissioner last week in a letter to the Justice Department expressed doubts about the merger, Bloomberg reported, saying it would seriously hurt competition in the nation's most populous state.If the deal goes through, the merged company would have 40% to 50%-plus market share in California for a multitude of services in many counties. Anthem on May 26 announced that it had received approval from Indiana for the planned purchase, the 10th state to OK the deal.Combining the two insurers would create a company with annual sales of more than $118 billion a year. UnitedHealth has annual sales of about $132 billion.Anthem shares were up 0.3% to 132.72 on the stock market today. It has consolidating for more than eight months with a buy point of 173.69 and was trading below both its 10-week average and its 200-day line Monday. Cigna was down 1.3% to 127.94.Anthem, which operates Blue Shield Blue Shield plans and has annual sales of about $61 billion, proposed the deal nearly 11 months ago, on July 23, 2015.That same month, Aetna agreed to buy Humana for $35 billion. Aetna management said earlier this year that it expects that merger to close by end of 2016.Aetna shares climbed 1% to 122.34. Humana was up 1.5% to 189.90. UnitedHealth shares were up 0.6% to 138.55.

501,UNH,"Health Care: A new study shows that the average increase for low-cost ObamaCare plans in 2017 will be 11% — which is twice the rate from last year. Will the “rate shocks are a myth” crowd finally admit it's wrong?The latest annual report on ObamaCare rates from the Kaiser Family Foundation looks at premium increases for the lowest-cost Silver plan in 14 cities. What it found is that the weighted average premium increase will be 11% for these plans.Premiums for these plans will go down in just two markets -- Providence and Indianapolis -- but up as much as 26% in Portland.  Kaiser also found that premiums for the second-cheapest Silver plan in these markets will climb an average 10%.These rate spikes are especially important because Silver plans are the ones most people enroll in.Kaiser also found that the average number of insurers in these markets will have dropped from 6.4 in 2015 to 5.5 next year.Less competition and higher premiums are the exact opposite of what ObamaCare backers promised.The Kaiser report is just a sampling, but there is plenty of other evidence that the pain of higher premiums and fewer choices will be felt across the country when people go to sign up for insurance this fall.IBD’s Jed Graham found that major insurers offering ObamaCare plans in 30 states have put in for average rate hikes of 25%. Humana (HUM), for example, is seeking premium hikes of more than 38%, with UnitedHealth  (UNH) at 25% and Anthem (ANTM) 21%.The average weighted rate hike tops 56% in Tennessee. In Oklahoma it's 53%, and Iowa 32%.These are increases that, before ObamaCare, were cited as a reason for ObamaCare. Now, Obama and company dismiss these magnificent hikes as no big deal.First, backers say, people can choose a different insurer and possibly keep rates down. Except that doing so can be highly disruptive, since plan switchers will often end up facing a much higher deductible, and might have to switch doctors as well. In other words, they will not only have to drop a plan they like, but doctors they like, too.Plus, competition in the exchanges is dwindling. People living in three states -- Alaska, Alabama and Wyoming -- as well as those in hundreds of counties across the U.S. will have only one insurance company from which to ""choose."" More than half the counties will have two at most.Next, ObamaCare backers say, higher rates don’t matter because most people buying in the ObamaCare exchange are getting generous subsidies so they won’t feel much of the sting of these rate hikes.Except, as industry analyst Robert Laszewski points out, “half of the individual market does not get a subsidy,” which means half the market will face the full brunt of these rate hikes. And, since the subsidies phase out as income goes up, there will be plenty of middle income families stuck with huge premium increases they can't afford.Finally, ObamaCare supporters say that big rate hikes are to be expected in the short term, as insurers figure the market out. But fear not, sometime down the road premiums will stabilize and all will be well.That’s a bit like reassuring passengers on the Titanic that the sinking will stabilize once the ship takes on enough water.ObamaCare's government-created insurance markets aren't stabilizing. They are getting worse. No matter who the next president is, he or she is going to have to deal with this mess. Follow IBD Editorials on Twitter: @IBDeditorials.

508,UNH,"Six years after the passage of ObamaCare, Republicans are no closer to settling on an alternative way of providing affordable private coverage to people in the individual market.The reason is clear. For all of ObamaCare's serious problems and unpopular mandates, and despite the bad deal it gives to far too many millions of working-class households and young adults, the reality is that it is helping millions of people. Low-income households and people with pre-existing conditions who couldn't afford decent insurance now can get the care they need.The problem with the GOP plans proposed by members of Congress and presidential candidates is that in crafting a deal that works better for people who aren't served well by ObamaCare, they overlook the consequences for those who would be lost without it.Donald Trump's plan would replace ObamaCare's premium and cost-sharing subsidies by letting people deduct individual market premiums from taxes. That would provide help to people in high tax brackets who earn too much for ObamaCare subsidies.But consider what it would mean for 64-year-old couples at 150% of the poverty level. Under ObamaCare, they can buy a plan with a $1,000 cap on out-of-pocket costs for about $1,000. Under TrumpCare, the same level of coverage would cost them just as much as an elite mentorship at Trump University: $20,000, or about 80% of their total income. (The higher cost factors in the reduction in subsidies as well as the repeal of ObamaCare's age-rating limit that lowers premiums for older adults.)While Trump's plan is worse than other GOP proposals on this score, they all make it impossible for low earners to afford an appropriate level of insurance. For example, under the Empowering Patients First plan authored by Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., the same plan that costs that 64-year-old couples $1,000 now might cost $18,000.GOP policymakers seem to understand that they'll have a big problem selling such a change to the public, so a who's who of conservative health experts recently unveiled a plan to kill ObamaCare softly. The trick is that the plan would let people choose between ObamaCare and the GOP vision of reform, the idea being that people will embrace the free-market Republican version of their own volition.""Some individuals would find themselves better off remaining in their ACA-purchased coverage for a time and could do so,"" wrote health policy wonks assembled by the American Enterprise Institute.They add that a GOP version of health reform is ""more likely to be reached if an ACA (Affordable Care Act) replacement plan wisely includes short-term transition provisions to defuse opposition.""Here’s the catch: The people who will have a reason to embrace the GOP plan will tend to be relatively young, healthy, moderate-income individuals who get little or no subsidies from ObamaCare and have to pay a penalty if they don’t buy coverage. Compared with their current treatment, getting even a modest subsidy to buy lower-cost coverage will be a fantastic deal.Draining younger, healthier people from the ACA individual market risk pool would undoubtedly trigger the kind of death spiral that conservatives have warned about, and facing this prospect, many insurers would simply refuse to participate. Already, UnitedHealth (UNH) has said it’s fed up with losing money and will exit the ObamaCare exchange business after 2016 if things don’t turn around. Aetna (AET), Humana (HUM) and many other insurers around the country also are losing money as they cover an insured group that’s less healthy and higher-cost than expected.If any insurers didn’t exit the exchanges at the outset of this transition plan, they would have no choice but to send premiums soaring, which could easily make after-subsidy premiums triple overnight.While Ohio Gov. John Kasich hasn't laid out how he would replace ObamaCare in detail, he seems to be starting with the right idea and likely the only idea that can lead to a workable plan — giving a better deal to the millions who get a bad deal under ObamaCare without taking away the good deal on which millions of vulnerable people depend.Among the few specifics he's offered, Kasich has said he would keep ObamaCare's guarantee that individuals can purchase insurance without being penalized if they are sick. (Trump initially said the same, then put out a plan that said the opposite.) That's a huge red flag for GOP policy wonks — and Democratic ones as well — because they see the individual mandate and coverage guarantee as a package deal: You can’t have the latter without the former, or else people will wait until they are sick to get covered. That would leave the insurance market prone to adverse selection, yielding excessive premiums and the risk of a death spiral.Yet those concerns are relatively simple to address. There is a logical path that starts by offering people a good deal and the flexibility to choose a plan that fits their budget, including no-cost plans that come with a Health Savings Account deposit for modest earners.Other key steps include easing age-rating for high-deductible and catastrophic coverage; broadening eligibility to include millions of low-wage, full-time workers that ObamaCare threw under the bus; and creating a level playing field between the middle class who get no help to buy individual market coverage and their peers who get government tax subsidies to buy employer coverage.Lastly, instead of imposing fines for not buying coverage, the government could gradually reduce the level of future health insurance tax subsidies for those who go uninsured, making it a no-win proposition for young invincibles to gamble that they won’t get sick.

509,UNH,"A couple of weeks after the new year began, shares of the otherwise staid WebMD Health (WBMD) suddenly shot up 6% on Jan. 13, hitting a new 52-week high.WebMD shares were starting to make an upward push, but this jump was out of character for the health information website. The reason for the jump: Reports circulated that Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group (UNH) were bidding to buy the company.It was a rumor that would be short-lived. The next day WedMD's stock fell 8% after the company squelched the merger talk, saying in a written statement that it is ""not currently in any negotiations to be acquired.""""We've been around a long time,"" WebMD Chief Executive David Schlanger told analysts recently on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""Our content is highly valued by consumers, by physicians, and also highly ranked by the search engines, and we don't believe that situation is going to change.""Although it may eventually choose to merge with a deep-pocketed company such as longtime marketing partner Walgreens, the fact that WebMD isn't seeking a merger should come as no surprise. The company's finances seem fit as a fiddle without the aid of a larger partner.When the New York-based entity reported a 67% jump in fourth-quarter earnings per share to 60 cents on Feb. 23, it kept alive a string of strong reports in which WebMD posted quarterly profit growth of at least 39% for the last three years. At times that growth has gone as high as 600%.Also in the quarter, sales grew 18% to $192.13 million from advertisements on 3.97 billion page views, up 7% year over year. Both earnings and sales topped analyst projections.WebMD's 2015 revenue of $636 million was nearly three times that of the next-largest publicly traded health site operator, Everyday Health (EVDY), which operates its namesake site and several others. Another rival is Time's (TIME) Health.com. WebMD also competes with nonprofits like the Mayo Clinic, which takes paid ads, and the American Heart Association, which doesn't.The health advertising market in general is large and growing, and there are glimmers of optimism, even in negative news. Schonfeld & Associates last year forecast that the global pharmaceutical industry will cut advertising spending by 1.7% in 2016 amid consolidation and growing emphasis on affordable health care. Still, spending will top $21 billion, the market research firm said.WebMD is taking advantage of that, as well as an uptick in new drug approvals. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration approved 45 new drugs in the U.S., significantly more than the 28 the agency averaged in 9 of the last 10 years, officials say.""There is a historically strong pipeline of new drugs coming to market, a 40-year high,"" Keybanc Capital Markets analyst Donald Hooker told IBD. ""The Food and Drug Administration has been accelerating drug approvals, establishing the fast-track program and speeding the process for breakthrough therapies. And all of those new drugs need ads.""Perhaps best known for its flagship consumer-oriented WebMD site, the company operates a variety of other health-related sites that have enriched its coffers. In fact, one contributes more to the top line than even WebMD, and that is Medscape.A resource for physicians and other health professionals, Medscape has accounted for 60% of the company's total ad revenue each of the last three years. It's a free one-time registration site that provides personalized medical information and education tools to doctors and other health professionals. WebMD says its Medscape Journal of Medicine is the Internet’s first primary-source medical journal.""Drugmakers want to reach both physicians and consumers. But they want to reach physicians more, and they will pay more to do so,"" said Leerink Partners analyst Steven Wardell.Wardell expects Medscape will continue to contribute more to total revenue than WebMD. In the fourth quarter, Medscape averaged 7.3 million physician sessions a month, a 9% increase over the same quarter a year earlier. Other WebMD sites include MedicineNet, eMedicine, drug info site RxList and theheart.org.Figures indicate there's room for growth as drug ad spending is skewed toward old school media such as print magazines and newspapers.Leerink's research shows that just 4% of consumers reach for print media for health news, but the print industry gets 18% of health ad revenue. Meanwhile, 48% of consumers get health info from digital media, but just 31% of ad revenue goes there.""I would call this one of the best macro trends available to investors because pharmaceutical companies will re-index spending to where the audience is -- to digital spending,"" Wardell said.WebMD also is pushing deeper into video health presentations, which could further boost ad sales. Currently, WebMD is launching more than a dozen new video series that range from short, social-friendly episodes like ""how to's"" to in-depth features hosted by well-known TV journalists.Schlanger admits there are hurdles.""Starting in the third quarter of 2015, we began to experience a decline in the rate of growth of our overall traffic, which has continued into the current quarter,"" he said on the conference call. ""We are working to understand the reasons for this change.""Leerink's Wardell said he's not concerned about the slowdown in growth of overall page views because the highly-focused Medscape site for physicians generates the bulk of the company's revenue, and it's growing at a rapid clip.Keybanc Capital's Hooker agrees.""I think the decline in page views (growth) is misleading,"" he said. ""WebMD Health is ultimately a platform for drug ads. And there is a massive flow of new products coming into the market.""

510,UNH,"The stock market saw red in afternoon trading Wednesday, still shaken a bit by Tuesday's terror attacks in Belgium.After two days of gains, biotechs weighed on the Nasdaq, which fell 0.7%. Selling was less intense in the NYSE indexes as the S&P 500 dropped 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking higher than Tuesday's levels.In the stock market today, UnitedHealth (UNH), Visa (V) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) outperformed in the Dow. Nike (NKE) lagged, falling 3% after the company reported earnings late Tuesday.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) slumped 3%.  The ETF was weak, as gold prices fell due to strength in the U.S. dollar. A breakout over a handle buy point of 120.94 was short-lived.Elsewhere, Virgin America (VA) soared 13% after Bloomberg reported the company is attracting takeover interest.In the technology space, small-cap chip designer Inphi (IPHI) gapped up and rose 7% after Deutsche bank lifted its price target to 40 from 30. Inphi is extended after a breakout over a 28.54 double-bottom buy point, but for those who missed the initial breakout, 32.42 is also a legitimate entry.Inside the IBD 50, Five Below (FIVE) was a big winner, rising 7%. It reversed higher after falling nearly 4% early. Late Tuesday, the retailer reported its second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Five Below is a heavily shorted stock, so part of today's move could be short covering.Meanwhile, IBD 50 name O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is close to breaking out of a 21-week consolidation. Shares rose 1%.After the close, watch for earnings from two apparel makers: Oxford Industries (OXM) and PVH Corp. (PVH).Image provided by Shutterstock.

511,UNH,"McKessson (MCK) announced up to $330 million in costs for restructuring, including layoffs, amid a consolidation wave led by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS).McKesson said in a regulatory filing Friday that its restructuring will result in a $300 million to $330 million charge this year, mostly for severance and employee-related costs. The company expects the cost alignment to save about $170 million-$190 million in the coming fiscal year starting April 1, and about $70 million-$80 million the following year.The Dallas Morning News said Wednesday that McKesson will lay off approximately 1,600 people, or 4% of its workforce, as it consolidates offices in Irving, Texas. Earlier this month, McKesson also agreed to buy Canadian drug store operator Rexall for $1.9 billion.In January, McKesson cut its fiscal 2016 earnings outlook and sees next year’s EPS getting hit by 85 cents, citing weak generic drug prices and ""recent customer consolidation.""Last year, Rite Aid (RAD), with which McKesson has a distribution deal, agreed to be acquired by Walgreens Boots Alliance.Other upcoming headwinds include the end of a contract with UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx health-services unit and the transitions of contracts with Ommicare and Target's (TGT) pharmacy business, which were bought by CVS.McKesson stock had been a steady performer for years, reaching an intraday high of 243.61 on May 19, 2015, before faltering. It's lost 35% of its value since then but rose 4.4% on the stock market today.Walgreens Boots Alliance closed up 0.8% on Friday. Rite Aid edged down 0.25%, and CVS Health climbed 0.5%.Meanwhile, Walgreens, which has a distribution partnership with AmerisourceBergen (ABC), exercised warrants to buy 22.7 million shares of the drug distributor for about $1.17 billion.Walgreens has the right to buy another 22.7 million shares beginning in March 2017.Amerisource shares rose 1.9%.

"
513,UNH,"In what appeared to be another of his jaw-droppers, Donald Trump, who has vowed to kill ObamaCare and replace it with ""something terrific,"" seemingly embraced the law's most-detested part: the individual mandate to get coverage or pay a fine.""Well I like the mandate. OK. So here's where I'm a little bit different: I don't want people dying on the streets,"" he told a CNN town hall on Feb. 18.As outraged conservative editorials flooded the Internet the following day, Trump clarified in a tweet that he was referring to the law's requirement that insurers offer people with pre-existing conditions coverage on the same terms offered to people in robust health.Yet, even though his clarification was logical enough based on the wording of the question he was asked, it's safe to say that most of the Republican Party's influential policymakers were hardly assuaged. In their view -- much like the view of the Obama administration -- the individual mandate and coverage guarantee are a package deal: You can't have the latter without the former, or else people will wait until they are sick to get covered. That would leave the insurance market prone to adverse selection, yielding excessive premiums and the risk of a death spiral.Trump has eschewed wonkery and position papers, making a pitch that aims for the gut, backed by the candidate's bravado and little depth of thought. Yet in this case, there's little doubt that Trump is right, that you can have the coverage guarantee without the mandate, and that the solution could be pretty terrific relative to the ObamaCare status quo.It's clear that the individual insurance market is not functioning well even with an individual mandate. UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), facing financial losses, have both questioned whether the exchanges are sustainable under current rules.The problem with ObamaCare isn’t that insurers participating on the exchanges are making money hand over fist: many are losing large sums. While more competition is a good thing, Trump’s idea of selling insurance across state lines has little or no potential to change ObamaCare’s dynamics because doing so won’t have a major effect on provider costs or on the population that signs up.The problem is simple: ObamaCare offers such an unattractive deal to so many millions of people that the exchanges are attracting a pool of customers which is too small, too old and too costly. The logical way to fix the individual insurance market is to start by offering people a deal that makes a lot more sense for their finances.To understand how this could work, first consider the example of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis, Mo., with pre-tax income of $40,000 (200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare from Cigna (CI) this year costs about $2,200, which may not be financially feasible, even before their $1,000 deductible and maximum cost-sharing of $4,500.The couple could instead buy the cheapest bronze plan for $1,260, but it carries a $13,700 deductible, which means that a trip to the hospital could be financially devastating. Since that's just the situation that ObamaCare was supposed to fix, it seems beyond the pale to force a couple in this situation to buy coverage or pay a fine of $1,390 -- 3.5% of their income. In other words, it's likely that all the options for this couple are bad, unless they happen to be desperate for health coverage, perhaps because they're trying to have a second child.Once you factor in the threat of a tax penalty for those who go uncovered, the reality is that ObamaCare, which was supposed to be an antidote for inequality, turns out in far too many cases to make inequality worse.The chasm between silver and bronze deductibles — $1,000 vs. $13,700 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. The architects of ObamaCare decided to attach extra cost-sharing support to silver plans, effectively turning the plans to platinum for low-income beneficiaries. The cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers on a monthly basis, whether or not the policy holder gets medical care.Simply getting rid of the individual mandate could lead millions of people to drop coverage, sending rates through the roof. But what if, for starters, the government offered that cost-sharing support directly to individuals, instead of paying it out to insurers? If this were done while easing ObamaCare's age-rating restriction (for bronze plans only) that artificially inflates the cost of coverage for young adults — a bronze plan costs $1,000 more for a 30-year-old than for a 60-year-old if each earn $25,000 — the deal offered to this 30-year-old couple would be transformed. They could still get the same level of coverage offered by silver, but if they opted for bronze-level coverage, their policy would cost nothing (vs. $1,260 under ObamaCare today), and they'd have $800 in a Health Savings Account to put toward medical bills (assuming a 4:1 age-rating for bronze). Clearly, no mandate would be needed to get modest-income households to sign up for this kind of coverage.This approach resembles the Republican idea of giving people a subsidy and, if they choose catastrophic coverage that costs less, letting them keep what is left over. The problem with GOP plans offered to date is that they make comprehensive coverage a whole lot less affordable for people who really need it — dramatically so for older people with modest incomes.The potential fallout from taking away coverage that millions are depending on explains why a who's who of GOP policy wonks has come up with the idea of killing ObamaCare softly -- letting people opt into a Republican vision of health reform and leaving the exchanges to gradually fade away. The only problem is that their idea of a gradual phase-out has zero chance of working.What's needed is an approach that offers a good deal to the millions who don't get one under ObamaCare, while continuing to meet the needs of the millions who are happy with their deal. There's no reason it can't work and there's no reason it can't be done without a heavy-handed mandate.The keys are giving people much more flexibility over how they use their subsidies; easing age-rating for high-deductible and catastrophic coverage; broadening eligibility to include millions of low-wage, full-time  workers that ObamaCare threw under the bus; and creating a level playing field between the middle class who get no help to buy individual market coverage and their peers who get government tax subsidies to buy employer coverage. Lastly, instead of penalizing for not buying coverage, the government could very gradually reduce the level of future health insurance tax subsidies for those who go uninsured, making it a no-win proposition for young invincibles to gamble that they won't get sick.

514,UNH,"Stock opened to modest losses Tuesday, as global markets took a breather after a strong start to the week.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each started down 0.3%. The Dow opened to a 0.2% slip.Global markets sagged Tuesday as commodities prices backed way from gains and Britain's pound rebounded from a seven-year low -- both of which helped trip rallies from Shanghai to New York on Monday.BHP Billiton (BHP), one of the leaders of the FTSE 100's rally in London Monday, reported heavier-than-expected Q4 losses and slashed its dividend.  Regulators in China also added pressure, lowering the yuan's peg vs. the dollar.Leading benchmarks in China and Japan closed lower, but held to losses of less than 1%.

533,UNH,"The Obama administration has shifted expectations about ObamaCare to such an extent that the latest enrollment data were, quite remarkably, reported as good news.Yet the best measure of how well ObamaCare is providing affordable care to the broad group that the exchanges were meant to help should ring alarm bells.Many journalists and policy analysts seem to be grading on a curve, perhaps thinking that ObamaCare has earned goodwill by making insurance affordable for the very-near-poor and many with pre-existing conditions who previously had to pay an arm and a leg for coverage.That attitude would be reasonable if ObamaCare was a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. But ObamaCare is a mandate for millions of modest-income people to buy unaffordable coverage or pay a penalty. There's a reason why the uninsured disapprove of the law by an overwhelming 2-to-1 margin: To paraphrase Jimmy Stewart, they know the difference between a blessing and a punch in the nose.Enrollment Dived In Late 2015One metric that's yet to be reported is what happened to enrollment in the final quarter of 2015, but the indications are that it continued to sink by 5% or more.Consider that HealthCare.gov ended 2014 with 4.3 million customers and re-enrolled 4.2 million of them. If customers don't actively renew their insurance or select another option, they get renewed automatically, unless they actively opt out, which almost no one did a year ago. Yet this year, of 9.3 million customers nationwide who were enrolled at the end of the third quarter, only 8.2 million re-enrolled.Now that doesn't mean that close to 1 million ObamaCare customers bolted in the fourth quarter. New York moved customers from 139% to 200% of the poverty level to a new public plan, and a handful of other states are still moving people into other coverage whose nonprofit co-op plans were shut down. Still, it seems clear that the number of people with exchange coverage shrank by at least 500,000 in Q4 to 8.8 million or fewer.Big insurers like Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM) and Molina Health (MOH) reported an average 8% drop in exchange customers in the third quarter. Then, in November, UnitedHealth (UNH) warned that it might get out of the exchange business in 2017, in part because it has seen people rack up big health bills and then stop paying their premiums.'New Enrollees' = 'The Usual Suspects'One amusing spin from the Obama administration is that the new group of enrollees — those who didn't re-enroll — is younger than the new group who signed up last year at the same point. But ""new enrollees"" includes anyone who previously dropped coverage before November. Enrollment sank by nearly 3 million from the 11.7 million total that signed up for 2015, so there is a big pool of young, uninsured former customers that ObamaCare is trying to woo back with the threat of an individual mandate penalty of $695-plus.A case in point comes from Abby Goodnough of the New York Times, who reported on a California couple who dropped coverage. The man, age 37, plans to stay uninsured and pay the fine, but his 26-year-old wife will sign up because she's now thinking about having a baby.Total signups through the first week in January are still about 300,000 below last year's 11.7 million final total, says Charles Gaba of ACASignups.net. If, say, one-third of the ""new"" signups are past dropouts, then the actual pace of new enrollment is running way behind last year's pace. The upshot is that demand appears tepid and the final signup total may not even break 13.5 million, a far cry from the 20 million annual average projected by the Congressional Budget Office.Of course, paying customers mean a lot more than signups. If past is prologue, a couple of million people will never pay or drop coverage for a variety of reasons as the year progresses, and many more people will be left with policies that do little to make care affordable.A Bigger Bronze TrapOne thing that's clear from the latest enrollment period is that those who sign up close to the wire are much more likely to choose bronze plans — 29% of HealthCare.gov signups did in last year's final month vs. 19% in the first two months. That makes sense, because people who drag their feet but sign up to avoid paying a fine are more likely to opt for the cheapest plan available.Thus, the bronze share of plan selections is sure to rise over the next month, yet bronze is already more popular among HealthCare.gov signups this year than it was in the first two months of enrollment a year ago: 21% have opted for bronze vs. 19% at the same point.This is a concern because even among those earning above 300% of the poverty level (just over $35,000 for a single), relatively few are in a position to handle bronze-plan deductibles of up to $6,850 this year. But it's a huge concern when a sizable share of lower earners opts for bronze, and it looks like more will do so this year.ObamaCare made a priority of limiting out-of-pocket medical spending for those with incomes of up to 250% of the poverty level, so that they wouldn't face a pileup of medical debt or avoid getting necessary care at the risk of worse health outcomes. That's why the law provides both premium subsidies and an extra slice of cost-sharing subsidies for households in this income range.But because Democrats were so focused on limiting unmanageable out-of-pocket costs, the law's crafters linked the extra cost-sharing subsidies exclusively to silver plans as an extra incentive for modest-income individuals to buy comprehensive coverage. Those who buy cheaper bronze plans lose out on the extra subsidies.In this signup period, like last year's, 20% to 25% of those who would be eligible for cost-sharing subsidies — based on their low income if they bought silver — have instead selected bronze. (Both years' data are missing some income information, so exact numbers aren't available.)The bigger problem is this: Not only are many low-income enrollees choosing bronze coverage that may not help them much in a pinch, but millions of low-income households are steering clear of the exchanges because all of their options are bad. On top of that, due to ObamaCare employer rules, a few million modest-wage, full-time workers are ineligible for the subsidies — even if their employer offers coverage that costs them close to 10% of income.The bottom line is that even in the modest-income group from 150% to 250% of the poverty level, ObamaCare isn't helping a wide majority of people who surely could use help, but it may cost them $695 if they don't sign up.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.

534,UNH,"Insurers covering more than half the U.S. are seeking average premium hikes of 25% for 2017 for ObamaCare policies sold on and off the public exchanges.Although the requests are preliminary and filings for 20 more states are still due, there's now little doubt that individual market premiums are set for a shockingly large jump next year.An IBD analysis of rate hikes proposed by individual insurers finds a wide divergence, from an average 10.0% hike per customer requested by Centene (CNC) on the low end to the 38.1% increase sought by Humana (HUM). Among other participants, Molina Healthcare (MOH) is seeking an average 10.4% hike, Cigna (CI) 16.5%, Aetna (AET) 19.6%, Anthem (ANTM) 21.3% and UnitedHealth (UNH) 24.9% in the few markets it's not planning to exit.The data, though incomplete, suggest potential for big increases in market share by Centene and Molina, two Medicaid managed care companies that have quickly grown an individual market presence in the ObamaCare era, even as heavyweights like UnitedHealth and Blue Cross Blue Shield plans have been swamped ObamaCare exchange losses.Among states, Tennessee tops the list with a weighted average 56.4% premium hike requested by insurers. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee is asking for a 62% hike after requesting -- and receiving approval for -- a 36% rate hike in 2016.So far, insurers in 9 additional states are seeking average hikes of at least 25%, including Arizona (53.1%), Oklahoma (51.0%), Kansas (35.3%), Texas (35.1%), Nebraska (35.0%), Iowa (32.0%), Delaware (30.5%), Oregon (27.5%) and Louisiana (26.8%), according to ObamaCare enrollment tracker ACASignups.net.Big premium hikes threaten to stall growth of the ObamaCare exchanges by driving away healthy members, particularly those who don't get subsidies, making the relatively costly customer base even more so. Indeed, some insurers are pricing such adverse selection into their 2017 rates.Providence Health of Oregon, which saw a threefold jump in customers in 2016, said 5 percentage points of its proposed 29.6% hike reflects its expectation that 2017 customers will be in poorer average health. That’s in part because Providence said it mistakenly expected the risk pool would be healthier in 2016 than in 2015 with the ramping up of the individual mandate penalty. On top of that, Providence says, back-to-back years of big premium hikes will likely drive a portion of unsubsidized customers out of the market -- especially relatively healthy customers.The proposed increases also reflect the trend growth rate of medical costs as well as the end of ObamaCare's temporary reinsurance program that has helped offset the cost of insurers' most expensive customers. Yet 2017 premium hikes might be a couple of percentage points higher if not for a deal in Congress that shelved ObamaCare's health insurance tax for 2017, saving about $12 billion for the insurance industry, which passes such costs directly to customers.Last year, insurers requested premium hikes averaging about 14% for 2016. The Obama administration subsequently said that the actual rate hike experienced by customers, including millions of people who shopped for a cheaper plan, was only about 8%. IBD explained why that analysis from the Department of Health and Human Services understated actual rate hikes, primarily because people were buying less coverage for their money.The costlier reality experienced by ObamaCare customers is underscored by a new Kaiser Family Foundation survey. As Brian Blase, senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center noted, ""Individuals who switched plans are twice as likely to feel less financially protected with their new plan than more financially protected.""By Monday's close in the stock market today, Centene ended trading off 0.9% to 67.30. Humana fell 1.1% to 184.69, Molina dropped 0.5% to 50.49 and Cigna skidded by 1.2% to 126.50. Among the larger players, Aetna lost 1.1% to 119.18, Anthem gave back 0.6% to 130.68 and UnitedHealth was down 0.8% to 138.09.

"
536,UNH,"Back when ObamaCare launched in 2014, exchange shoppers were shocked by the exchanges' lower-cost bronze-plan deductibles that typically ranged from $5,000 to a maximum of $6,350.That shock hasn't really worn off, as the maximum bronze deductible has climbed to $6,850 this year, on the way to $7,150 in 2017. But what's even more shocking is how high supposedly mid-level silver-plan deductibles have gotten.This year, Ambetter plans from Centene (CNC) broke new ground with a $6,500 silver-plan deductible as it sought to underprice the competition. The strategy seems to be paying off for the company, which is among the relatively few insurers making solid profits on the exchanges. Not only has Centene's exchange enrollment surged, but it has manged to attract a relatively healthy group of customers. That's not entirely surprising, since people expecting to have surgery, for example, would tend to choose a lower-deductible plan.Now, a regulatory filing for 2017 plans shows that Blue Cross of Idaho is set to push the envelope even further with a $6,850 silver-plan deductible and a maximum of $7,150 on out-of-pocket spending on medical services, excluding premiums.The filing includes an example of what a plan member can expect in benefits if they have a baby with a regular delivery and no complications. The good news is that the plan will cover nearly 80% of qualifying expenses. The bad news is that the help won't kick in until after the $6,850 deductible is exhausted. The bottom line: The new mother pays $7,010 out of the $7,540 in costs.That doesn't exactly scream ""affordable care"" -- especially after a couple earning $40,000 forks over about 8% of their income, or $3,200, for a silver plan. Still, the $6,850 deductible isn't as bad as it sounds because some benefits are provided before the deductible is met, including certain prescription drugs.In another example, Blue Cross of Idaho details a case showing that routine maintenance of type 2 diabetes would result in $5,400 in medical expenses, with the policy holder on the hook for just $2,000.By comparison, someone with the $6,500-deductible Centene silver plan this year would pay $3,080 for the same diabetes treatments. In other words, the fine print matters a lot.Centene's high deductibles may be one reason that the company, unlike UnitedHealth (UNH), has said it didn't experience any problems with people signing up for coverage mid-year and running up big bills.ObamaCare was supposed to balance risk among all insurers by transferring funds from carriers which attract low-cost customers to those that are a magnet for the sick, but risk-adjustment hasn’t worked as intended for a variety of reasons, including the failure to consider customer use of prescription drugs in weighing an insurer’s risk. Now the Obama administration is focused on making risk-adjustment work better, with uncertain implications for insurers' profitability.Blue Cross of Idaho's highest silver-plan deductible this year is $4,000. But after hiking premiums about 22% last year and being underpriced by competitors, the company may be turning to a much higher deductible as a way to hold down premium price hikes for 2017.Yet holding down premiums, while it may sound consumer friendly, can actually turn out to be the opposite when it comes to ObamaCare's subsidized customers. That's been evident in Centene markets like Miami, Atlanta and Jackson, Miss., where the after-subsidy cost of a bronze plan is more than 20% more expensive than in the average HealthCare.gov market.That's because offering silver plans with bronze-like deductibles, and scrunching down the cost of silver plans closer to those of bronze, shrinks the size of the available subsidies for all plans. Subsidies are based on the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan in each market.This seems to be an issue particularly in Centene markets, because the company offers not just one, but two low-priced silver plans with bronze-like deductibles of $5,500 and $6,500. Early filings for 2017 suggest that Centene plans to stick with that strategy next year.
"
537,UNH,"Reports continue to flow in of big ObamaCare premium spikes that will hit exchanges around the country in 2017.Insurers are seeking an average 27% rate hike in Oregon; 21% in Maine; 18% in Virginia; and 18% in Florida.But if the premiums don't shock you, the deductibles very well might. Not only are bronze deductibles rising as high as $7,150 in 2017, from a maximum of $6,850 this year, but silver deductibles of $6,000 or more are becoming commonplace. In fact, Centene (CNC), one of the most aggressive exchange competitors when it comes to pricing, is planning to roll out a new silver plan with a $7,050 deductible next year under the Ambetter name — to go along with the $6,500-deductible silver plan it's already offering. Amazingly, Ambetter had just a $1,750 silver-plan deductible in 2014.The problem for exchange shoppers is that ObamaCare premium subsidies are set based on the cost of the second cheapest silver plan in each market. The effect of Centene's sky-high-deductible strategy is to scrunch down silver-plan premiums closer to the cost of a bronze plan and shrink the government subsidies that are supposed to help make coverage affordable. If customers don't like the cheap Ambetter silver plans on offer, they'll have less of a subsidy to buy a bronze plan or a silver plan from a competitor.Thanks to Centene, the subsidy available to 30-year-olds earning $30,500, just over 250% of the poverty level, will shrink from about $627 this year to $571 next year in Indianapolis, an IBD analysis finds.Centene pursued the same hard-nosed strategy this year, selling silver plans with bronze-like deductibles of $5,500 and $6,500 in Miami, Atlanta and Jackson, Miss. While its cheap silver plans have helped the company boost enrollment, it's no coincidence that those three markets are the most expensive major markets on HealthCare.gov for buying subsidized bronze plans.While Centene filings have only been made public for Indiana, Ambetter plan designs in the Hoosier State mirror those in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state this year, so those states and others also may see $7,050 silver deductibles in 2017.As IBD noted recently, Blue Cross of Idaho plans to offer a $6,850-deductible silver plan in 2017, which would make a pregnant woman pay $7,010 for delivery of her baby. Blue Cross of Idaho’s highest silver-plan deductible this year is $4,000. But after hiking premiums about 22% last year and being underpriced by competitors, the company may be turning to a much higher deductible as a way to hold down premium price hikes for 2017.The story for Centene is much different. The company, which expanded from Medicaid managed care into the individual commercial insurance market with the launch of ObamaCare, is one of the few insurers making solid profits on the exchange. Although other insurers in Indiana are seeking double-digit price hikes, and Anthem (ANTM) has requested a 30% increase, Centene has proposed a 5.3% rate cut.Aetna (AET), which saw its ObamaCare enrollment shrink from a year ago in the first quarter, filed to begin offering exchange coverage in parts of Indiana and will apparently start with the lowest-cost bronze plan on the market, just 3.6% higher than this year's cheapest bronze plan. Yet because of the smaller subsidy, the after-subsidy cost of the cheapest bronze plan will rise 7.6%.Aetna's lowest-cost silver plan, by the way, will carry a $6,075 deductible, though the maximum out-of-pocket spending on medical services also will be capped at $6,075, below ObamaCare's $7,150 maximum for 2017.While the high silver-plan deductibles can leave people on the hook for huge expenses before insurers pay much in the way of benefits, they're not as bad as they sound, because some benefits are provided before the deductible is met. Aetna's plan charges $10 per primary care visit (excluding x-rays), $10 for laboratory tests and $5 for generics, but plan members are on their own for most big-ticket items.Before Ambetter's $7,050 deductible is met, members can pay $30 for a primary-care visit and $60 for a specialist; $15 for generics; $50 for preferred brand drugs; $100 for urgent care; $30 for prenatal and postnatal care; and $60 for diabetes management. But that still leaves huge holes for surgery, MRIs, specialty drugs; hospitalization and more.Another important consideration is that the full deductibles only apply to individuals and families earning more than 250% of the poverty level. Those with lower incomes get extra cost-sharing subsidies -- the subsidies that a federal judge just ruled have been funded without authorization and in violation of the Constitution.But those subsidies are pretty meager for people earning between 200% and 250% of the poverty level. For this modest-income group, Aetna's $6,075 deductible is only reduced to $4,875, while Centene's $7,050 deductible is reduced to $5,250.Centene’s high deductibles may be one reason that the company, unlike UnitedHealth (UNH), has said it didn’t experience any problems with people signing up for coverage midyear and running up big bills. People with urgent health needs are more likely to pay up for plan that limits out-of-pocket costs and provides a broad network of hospitals.ObamaCare was supposed to balance risk among all insurers by transferring funds from carriers which attract low-cost customers to those that are a magnet for the sick, but risk-adjustment hasn’t worked as intended for a variety of reasons, including the failure to consider customer use of prescription drugs in weighing an insurer’s risk. Now the Obama administration is focused on making risk-adjustment work better, with uncertain implications for insurers’ profitability.

"
559,UNH,"On Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell may announce that more than 9 million people signed up in time for Jan. 1 coverage via HealthCare.gov. The national sign-up total could exceed 12 million.
"
560,UNH,"In medical terms, the HealthCare.gov enrollment surge being celebrated by the Obama administration means that the patient didn't suffer a massive heart attack but still needs a quadruple bypass.
"
561,UNH,"The news is decent enough that sighs of relief can be expected from ObamaCare supporters, including hospital operators like HCA (HCA) and Tenet Healthcare (THC) that benefit from its generous subsidies to low-income households. Insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) that have been losing money on their ObamaCare exchange businesses may be feeling a bit more encouraged, with another full month of open enrollment still to come.
"
562,UNH,"Yet the real measure of ObamaCare is whether it makes health care broadly affordable, especially for those who lacked affordable options before its launch. On that score, ObamaCare is failing, and compelling a few million more people to sign up for coverage that may be of little use to them but won't cost any more than paying a mandate fine hardly counts as a success.
"
563,UNH,"Will ObamaCare Sign-Ups Pay?
"
564,UNH,"Current enrollment in the exchanges has dwindled to about 9 million nationally, perhaps less, down by roughly one-fourth from the 11.7 million who enrolled for 2015 coverage. So the total of 2016 sign-ups isn't much more than the number who originally signed up last year. One obvious question is how many of this year's enrollees will follow up with payments. The number touted by HHS will include a few million people who were automatically renewed, and ""new"" enrollees include people who had coverage previously but dropped it.
"
565,UNH,"There's another datapoint that may be just as important as the overall gain in enrollment: How much of the enrollment surge is really a surge of people selecting bronze plans. That's especially important when it comes to modest-income households earning up to 250% of the poverty level, since this group qualifies for extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. The catch is that those extra subsidies are only available to those who buy silver plans.
"
566,UNH,"For a 30-year-old couple in Richmond, Va., earning 200% of the poverty level ($40,000 for a family of three), buying a silver plan cuts their family deductible to $1,500, while the cheapest bronze plan comes with a $12,900 deductible. Yet, at $2,500, the silver plan may be too much of a stretch, leaving bronze the only realistic option for a family that doesn't expect massive medical bills. If a trip to the hospital could still torpedo their finances, does it really count a success if the couple pays $1,000 for a bronze plan so that they don't have to pay a combined $1,390 fine?
"
567,UNH,"The Kaiser Family Foundation says that 3.5 million uninsured will be able to buy bronze coverage in 2016 for less than the cost of the individual mandate penalty.
"
568,UNH,"ObamaCare Often Increases Inequality
"
569,UNH,"The reality is that the program, which was supposed to be an antidote for inequality, turns out in far too many cases to make inequality worse. Take single 27-year-olds in St. Louis earning $24,000, whose cheapest option is a $1,000 bronze plan with a $6,850 deductible. In other words, they can pay a fine equal to 3% of their income or spend 4% of income on a plan that will be of little use.
"
570,UNH,"ObamaCare has succeeded in making health care much more accessible to people whose health conditions make them desperate for comprehensive policies to limit high out-of-pocket costs and for people with income below 150% of the poverty level for whom subsidies are especially generous. But most people with income above that level aren't being served well by the exchanges.
"
571,UNH,"An Urban Institute analysis estimated that just 35% of people eligible for exchange subsidies had purchased plans. Yet the reality may be even worse for two reasons: The figure includes low-income people who settled for bronze plans and it excludes some 3 million uninsured who would be eligible for subsidies based on income but work full-time for companies that offer ""affordable"" coverage.
"
572,UNH,"Those low-wage, full-time workers get the worst deal from ObamaCare. For example, in 2015, workers earning $17,500 a year — and their spouses — were ineligible for subsidies if their employer offered them bronze-type coverage for no more than $1,670. That's 15 times the $9 per month a bronze plan would cost via the subsidized exchanges.
"
573,UNH,"When you include low-income uninsured workers with an offer of employer care, only about 1 in 4 with income from 150% to 250% of the poverty level got silver coverage in 2015 that would protect their finances if they landed in the hospital. Even if enrollment jumps in 2016, it's not clear how much the 75% with no coverage or bronze plans will decrease.

The data showed a loss of momentum after an encouraging start to 2016, the report said, with manufacturers citing ""softer underlying demand patterns.""Europe's markets added to their early gains, boosted by energy and mining stocks, and overcoming a number of negatives: Britain's pound dove to a seven-year low after London's mayor backed the idea of a U.K. exit from the European Union, preliminary data showing euro zone growth slowed in January to its weakest level in a year  and wobbles in the banking sector following a surprise loss reported by HSBC Holding (HSBC).

576,UNH,"Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.3% in January and 2.2% from a year ago, the fastest annual rise since June 2012, the Labor Department said.Overall prices were unchanged for the month and up 1.4% from a year ago. Energy costs slid 2.8% for a second straight month, but the yearly decline slowed to 6.5% vs. 12.6% in December and 18.4% in September, as comparisons get tougher.Core prices were driven by gains in the cost of medical care, health insurance and housing, including lodging away from home.Health insurance costs rose 1.1% for the month and 4.8% from a year ago — the biggest increase since April 2013, before the ObamaCare exchanges were launched. Although subsidies help reduce the prices, inflation measures take into account the added government costs as well. Despite rising premiums, UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have warned of losses in the exchanges, with UnitedHealth the most explicit about possibly exiting the market if conditions don't improve.The cost of medical care rose 0.5% in January, bringing the yearly increase to 3%, tied for the highest since early 2013. Prescription drug companies such as Gilead Sciences (GILD)and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX)  have been under fire for high costs, but the annual rise in prescription costs has decelerated to 3% from 6.4% at the end of 2014.The cost of medical service rose 0.5% for the month and 3.3% from a year ago, the biggest annual rise since April 2013.Rent of primary residence rose 0.3% in January and 3.7% from a year ago, matching December's annual gain for the biggest since June 2008.Lodging away from home, which sees volatile swings from month to month, rose 2% in January and 3.1% for the year.All items excluding food, shelter and energy still were up a more moderate 1.5% from a year ago.The core inflation rate has risen above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. But the Fed pays more attention to another price gauge, the core PCE deflator, which has shown little pickup in recent months.UnitedHealth shares fell fractionally on the stock market today in morning trade.

Rowe Price Growth Stock (PRGFX) is still way off its late-2015 high (it's down 10.36% this year going into Tuesday), like a lot of growth-oriented mutual funds. So what's the fund doing to position itself for the future and to resume the outperformance charted by helmsman Joe Fath since he took the tiller a little more than two years ago?After becoming manager in early 2014 and then reshaping the portfolio to reflect his strategy, Fath guided the fund to a 10.85% gain in 2015. That topped 96% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its peer group averaged a 3.60% gain. The S&P 500 edged up 1.38%.It will be increasingly hard to find growth in 2016, Fath said in his year-end commentary. Durable growers will be crucial to good performance. And he wants to use market volatility to find good growers whose price gets knocked too low -- relative to their long-term prospects.Eight of his top-10 holdings as of Dec. 31 have strong Composite Ratings from IBD of 80 or higher.He's already seeing gains out of names like Ross Stores (ROST).

580,UNH,"Health Reform: It wasn’t that long ago when ObamaCare fans were wagging their fingers at critics, saying industry profits proved that the law was working. They’ve been noticeably silent as insurers report huge losses.“It turns out that the law that the insurance industry's shills demonized has been awfully good to insurance-company investors.” That was from a piece in the Huffington Post almost exactly a year ago, after UnitedHealth Group released its Q1 earnings.The writer went on to point out that the good news was reported in the pages of IBD, while our editorial page has long been critical of the law. “I can't wait,” Wendell Potter concluded, “to see how IBD's editorial writers spin UnitedHealth's ObamaCare success.”We can’t wait to see how Potter and other ObamaCare fans are spinning the law’s “success,” now that insurance companies are showing big, sustained losses and threatening to pull out of the program next year.The latest to join the list is Humana, which just reported that profits fell 30% in the last quarter of 2015 and has set aside a reserve for expected losses this year. It’s now saying it “continues to evaluate its participation” in the individual insurance market.A few days earlier, Aetna said it lost up to 4% on its ObamaCare policies in 2015 and said it had “serious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges.”And UnitedHealth Group said it expects losses from its ObamaCare enrollees to top $650 million this year and next. “We cannot sustain these losses,” is how CEO Stephen Hemsley put it.Humana, as with other insurers, discovered that ObamaCare enrollees were sicker and more expensive to cover than they anticipated. And worse, they're finding that ObamaCare officials are letting too many people game the system by waiting until after they are sick to enroll for coverage, knowing they can get it guaranteed.Spiraling premiums, an unstable insurance market, people gaming the system. These were predictions made by ObamaCare’s free market critics, including IBD, who said this is where the law's mountain of regulations would inevitably lead.So, what say you now, ObamaCare fans?
"
581,UNH,"The Obama administration violated the constitution by funding ObamaCare subsidies without an appropriation, a federal judge ruled on Thursday.The subsidies at issue provide cost-sharing support that cut ObamaCare's high deductibles for households earning up to 250% of the poverty level. While the 2010 health law clearly makes an appropriation for premium subsidies, there's no such appropriation for cost-sharing subsidies.The White House initially requested an appropriation from Congress for the cost-sharing subsidies, which are expected to cost $130 billion over the coming decade. But when the House showed no sign of complying, Obama administration officials asserted the authority to pay out the subsidies anyway, saying the two sets of subsidies were inextricably linked.""The question is whether (the cost-sharing subsidies) can nonetheless be funded through the same, permanent appropriation (as the premium subsidies). It cannot,"" U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer wrote.Her ruling orders an immediate end to the subsidies, which are critical to making ObamaCare exchange coverage viable for low-income individuals and families. Yet Collyer stayed her order pending a certain appeal.With insurers in the process of setting premium rates for 2017, the ruling will create uncertainty about how the exchanges will operate next year.Already UnitedHealth (UNH) has said it will exit most exchanges, while Humana (HUM) is leaving some and planning big premium hikes in others. UnitedHealth fell 0.7% to 129.74 while Humana dropped 2.5% to 165.81 in the stock market today.  Among other major insurers, Anthem (ANTM) lost 2.5% to 136.08, Aetna (AET) fell 3.3% to 108.60 and Cigna (CI) dropped 1.9%.The effect of ending the subsidies is complicated by the fact that the law requires insurers to provide the cost-sharing support. Really the only way they'll be able to do so without losing money is to raise premiums to offset their extra costs, but that would only exacerbate ObamaCare's current difficulties by driving relatively healthy customers away.Even legal experts sympathetic to ObamaCare had said that appropriations law is straightforward and that President Obama broke the law. The only hope for the White House was that the judge would rule that the House lacked standing to sue. That was a real question because such a grant of standing was unprecedented. While the Obama administration argued that the House couldn't sue over questions of how a law is interpreted, Judge Collyer saw the question as a constitutional issue, not a statutory dispute.Uncertainty over the lawsuit's eventual outcome is heightened by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and his eventual replacement, which could tilt the court in either direction. It's probably unsafe to assume that a more liberal court will side with the Obama administration. If there was ever a case in which the power of the purse was jeopardized, this was it. Not only did the White House assert the authority to spend money without an appropriation of Congress, but it determined to do so on a permanent basis.
"
582,UNH,"As it reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings Tuesday, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) said it would remain in only a ""handful"" of ObamaCare public exchanges next year, down from 34 state exchanges currently. Shares gapped up 2% near the close.UnitedHealth Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley said in a post-earnings conference call that the exchange business's smaller market size and ""shorter-term high risk"" suggested that the company could not broadly serve more than a handful of states as part of the Affordable Care Act, and added that UnitedHealth will advocate for ""more sustainable"" strategies.Hemsley offered no specifics as to the states where the company would continue to offer ObamaCare coverage. The insurer is already known to be exiting Arkansas, Georgia and Michigan.""They're experiencing more losses than they anticipated,"" analyst Ana Gupte of Leerink told Investor's Business Daily. ""Very few players are making a positive profit margin.""Georgia is likely UnitedHealth's most unprofitable state, Gupte noted, though she adds analysis of data in filings alone cannot definitively determine profitability of state exchanges. Other likely high-loss states ripe for exit include Florida, North Carolina, New York, Alabama and Louisiana, according to Leerink's analysis.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, said it recognized $125 million in reserves in the first quarter to cover additional exchange-related losses. It had earlier expected $525 million in losses in 2016. But with its whittled-down profile in the exchanges, it doesn't expect negative financial exposure next year.Early indications show that the health status of exchange members got ""a little worse,"" one UnitedHealth executive said in the conference call.The insurer has long been a tentative participant in ObamaCare , shying away from offering coverage under the massive health care plan at first and then working its way in gradually during its first couple of years. The extent of its participation in various state exchanges was limited and far less than other carriers relative to their size such as Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM).""Aetna and Anthem are more exposed to the individual markets than United so they have less flexibility to leave,"" Gupte said, adding that less than 2% of UnitedHealth's revenue comes from the exchanges.UnitedHealth had around 795,000 exchange-compliant individual enrollees as of the end of the first quarter. Analyst Peter Costa of Wells Fargo pointed out in a note Tuesday that about half of the company's enrollment was new this year, and that these new members ""appeared to have a higher-risk health profile.""UnitedHealth's planned exits means it'll be more likely that the pending megamergers between Anthem and Cigna (CI) and Aetna and Humana (HUM) will be approved by regulators, partly because the consolidations will help to preserve access to exchange marketplaces, Gupte noted.UnitedHealth's overall first-quarter results were relatively strong, driven in part by strength in its Optum health services business, which uses advanced data analytics and technology. Total revenue rose 25% over last year to $44.53 billion, above the $43.96 billion expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. On an adjusted basis, it earned $1.81 a share, compared with expectations of $1.72.Net margin in the quarter declined to 3.6% from 4% a year earlier. UnitedHealth's medical care cost ratio -- the proportion of revenue spent on providing health services -- in the quarter increased 30 basis points over last year to 81.7%, reflecting an extra calendar day of service in the quarter, the company said. Medical cost trends in the quarter ""were well-controlled and consistent with management expectations,"" the company stated in the release.The company said it expects adjusted earnings for 2016 of $7.75 to $7.95 vs. prior guidance of $7.60 to $7.80, above analysts' views of $7.73, on revenue of $182 billion, up from $157.1 billion in 2015 and also above views.""As individual exchange losses are eliminated in 2017, bottom-line growth is likely to accelerate,"" wrote analyst Steven Halper of FBR & Co., who raised his 2017 EPS estimate by 10 cents to $8.90.Image provided by Shutterstock.

583,UNH,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the biggest U.S. health insurer, said it will drop out of all but a “handful” of state exchanges where it sells individual Obamacare plans, acting on concerns it raised last year that the government program that has brought coverage to millions isn’t profitable enough.Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hemsley said Tuesday that the company next year “will remain in only a handful of states.” The exchange market is proving to be smaller and riskier than UnitedHealth had expected, meaning “we cannot broadly serve it on an effective and sustained basis.” The company expects to lose about $650 million on the plans this year.Hemsley spoke on a conference call as part of the company’s release of first-quarter results, which topped analysts’ profit estimates in part thanks to UnitedHealth’s consulting, technology and services unit, Optum.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement, is projected to cover about 12 million people this year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, helping many afford private insurance using tax subsidies. It has proven volatile for health insurers selling coverage in the new markets, known as exchanges, with some reporting losses.UnitedHealth already plans to withdraw from at least five states for 2017 after selling coverage in 34 states for 2016. The company said in December that it should have stayed out of the individual exchange market longer.UnitedHealth had about 795,000 customers of Obamacare’s exchanges as of March 31, and expects that number to fall to about 650,000 by December.Earlier Tuesday, UnitedHealth posted first-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates as results from its Optum business helped overcome losses on its Affordable Care Act plans.Earnings were $1.81 a share, excluding some items, UnitedHealth said in a statement, exceeding the $1.72 average of 24 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Changes to how the company accounts for taxes on stock-based compensation boosted adjusted earnings by 6 cents a share, UnitedHealth said.“Consistent organic growth, strong operating discipline and solid execution generated a strong quarter with a little upside,” Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA, said in a research note. “This is a really strong, solid way to start the year.”The shares gained 1.6 percent to 129.83 in morning trading.Net income rose 14 percent to $1.61 billion, or $1.67 a share, on revenue of $44.5 billion. Optum posted operating profit of $1.1 billion, up from $742 million a year earlier. fueled by the expansion of the pharmacy-benefits business with the acquisition of Catamaran Corp. in July. The company raised its 2016 adjusted earnings forecast to a range of $7.75 to $7.95 a share on annual revenue of $182 billion. Analysts had estimated adjusted earnings of $7.73 on average. The change was driven by taxes and accounting items.UnitedHealth is the first health insurer to report results for the first three months of 2016. Analysts and investors will scrutinize the report for signs of how the entire health-care industry is faring. UnitedHealth, based in Minnetonka, Minnesota, said it spent about 82 cents on medical costs for every premium dollar it took in during the first quarter. The company’s medical membership climbed to 47.7 million people on March 31 from 46.4 million in the last quarter on 2015.Optum includes units that help doctors and hospitals analyze data and treat and bill patients. It also aids employers with health benefits, runs clinics and has a pharmacy-benefits business.

584,UNH,"Oregon's largest individual market insurer has filed for an average 29.6% rate hike for 2017 policies sold on and off the ObamaCare exchange.Providence Health, which saw enrollment nearly quadruple in 2016 to 100,900, grabbing 40% of the market, blamed the increase partly on next year's phase-out of ObamaCare's temporary reinsurance program, which covers some of the bills of the costliest patients.But Providence also is pricing in a 5-percentage-point hike because it expects 2017 customers to be in poorer average health. That's in part because Providence said it mistakenly expected the risk pool would be healthier in 2016 than in 2015 with the ramping up of the individual mandate penalty. On top of that, Providence says, back-to-back years of big premium hikes will likely drive a portion of unsubsidized customers out of the market — especially relatively healthy customers.Moda Health, Oregon's second-biggest individual market carrier even after losing one-third of its customers following a big premium hike this year, has proposed a 32.3% premium hike for its 62,600 customers.Premera Blue Cross, the fourth-place insurer through its LifeWise Health Plan, has said it's bailing out of Oregon amid financial losses.Overall, Oregon insurers are seeking an average 27% premium hike, as calculated by ObamaCare enrollment tracker ACASignups.net, weighted based on 2016 enrollment.Oregon is just the second state to make public initial rate requests filed by all insurers for 2017. Participants in Virginia's market are seeking an average 17.9% hike, including a 15.8% increase requested by Anthem (ANTM) for its 180,000 members in ObamaCare-compliant plans.In New Hampshire, Minuteman Health, the lowest-cost and second-largest exchange participant, has requested a 45.2% premium hike.Meanwhile, Humana (HUM) offered a somewhat bleak take on its ObamaCare experience in 2016 in its first-quarter earnings report, saying it may exit a number of states. UnitedHealth (UNH) recently said it would exit all but a ""handful"" of ObamaCare exchanges.Humana, which is aiming to finalize its merger with Aetna (AET) in the second half of the year, said its renewing customers ""were higher utilizers (of medical services and prescriptions) than those terminating coverage.""In addition, new customers signing up for Humana's off-exchange plans had higher hospital admission rates than renewing customers. Off-exchange plans are the same as those sold on the exchanges, but enrollees can't qualify for the exchange subsidies available to those with income up to 400% of the poverty level.Humana said it will try to make changes to retain a viable product, where feasible, but that's likely to mean ""certain statewide market and product exits both on and off exchange, service area reductions and pricing commensurate with anticipated levels of risk by state.""The company has 554,300 ObamaCare exchange customers and an additional 208,700 in the same plans bought off the exchanges. The total is down by about 180,000 from a year ago, in part because Humana discontinued plans serving 100,000 people due to unexpectedly high costs.Humana, Aetna and UnitedHealth shares fell less than 1% in afternoon trade on the stock market today. Anthem lost 2.3%. 
"
585,UNH,"Aetna (AET) reported 911,000 ObamaCare exchange members as of March 31, down more than 4% from over 950,000 at the same time a year ago.The news is somewhat of a surprise after Anthem (ANTM) said it saw a modest increase in customers largely thanks to nonprofit co-ops going out of business in some of its 14 markets like New York and Colorado.Anthem ObamaCare enrollment rose 8.6% to 975,000, from 898,000 a year ago.Centene (CNC), a Medicaid insurer specialist that's rapidly expanding its ObamaCare exchange reach with low-premium, high-deductible plans, recently reported a 55% enrollment spike to 683,000. UnitedHealth (UNH) had 795,000 exchange customers at the end of Q1, but has said it will exit all but a ""handful"" of states in 2017.Total exchange sign-ups rose 8.5% to 12.7 million, from 11.7 million a year ago, but it's not yet clear how many people actually paid. Last year, 1.5 million had dropped out by the end of March.Reports from six states show that ObamaCare enrollment has shrunk about 14% from the number reported in February, but it’s unclear if that trend will hold.Aetna management expressed optimism that its exchange business will break even in 2016, though it's still getting a feel for the medical costs of this year's members, given the relatively large amount of customer churn from year to year.Overall, Aetna's ObamaCare-compliant enrollment, including off-exchange customers, fell to 1.2 million from 1.275 million a year ago.Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said he sees the exchange business as a good investment for the company, despite modest losses so far, provided that Congress and the next president are able to set politics aside and modify the program, as they do for Medicare and Medicaid on a pretty regular basis.Aetna shares rose modestly on the stock market today on stronger-than-expected Q1 results.

"
587,UNH,"The root of ObamaCare's mounting problems is that far too many people — even those eligible for big subsidies — see the plans as either unaffordable or such a bad deal that they're willing to risk paying a fine.That goes a long way to explaining why the exchanges are attracting a small group of customers who are disproportionately old and in relatively poor health, why the cheapest bronze-plan premiums are set to spike 28%, and why UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) are bolting most of the markets where they're doing business.In replacing ObamaCare with ""something terrific,"" as Donald Trump has pledged to do, he may not find it especially hard to give a better deal to those millions of middle-class and working-class households that get a bad deal from the exchanges. Yet Trump also will have to find a way to meet the needs of millions of low-income families and older adults, many with costly chronic conditions, for whom the law has been a godsend.The reality check for Trump is that there is a vast gap between the financial support that a modest-income older adult with a chronic condition will need to make health care affordable and what the GOP is on record as supporting.This look at just how the Empowering Patients First Act, a GOP blueprint for replacing ObamaCare, would serve the needs of modest-income, older adults relative to the ObamaCare exchanges should be eye-opening — to say the least.Consider that for a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level ($23,895), an ObamaCare silver plan in 2017 will cost a bit less than $1,000, after subsidies, and cap out-of-pocket spending at $1,000 to $2,000. That means, in a really bad scenario, the couple might end up spending from 8% to 12% of annual income on insurance and medical bills.A key question is how much low-income adults can reasonably afford to pay in premiums and additional medical expenses before the cost of health care overwhelms their finances. Those on the right worried about the size of government might argue that the couple could reasonably afford to pay a somewhat bigger share of income, but how much more? Would it be reasonable to put this couple on the hook for up to 15% of income? Would 25% of income make the couple shoulder too much financial risk?Now consider how the couple would fare under the Empowering Patients First Act, legislation put forward by House and Senate Republicans that has been at least loosely endorsed by every GOP health policy wonk. The same low-deductible coverage that costs less than $1,000 in after-subsidy premiums under ObamaCare could cost the couple about $18,000 under this leading Republican plan, putting them on the hook for up to 80% of their annual income, including out-of-pocket costs.How does a sub-$1,000 plan under ObamaCare turn into an $18,000 plan under the GOP? First, the GOP believes it's a bad idea to provide subsidies that rise with income, because that can be an incentive for people to earn less, but there are other ways to mitigate this concern than slashing subsidies to lower earners. The GOP plan gives $6,000 to couples at least 50 years old to help with premiums. Back in 2015, before exchange premiums began to spike due to the exchanges' stunted growth and unhealthy risk pool, ObamaCare gave the same couple a premium subsidy of $14,846, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation health subsidy calculator.(For 2017, ObamaCare's subsidy will rise to $19,592 to offset the surge in premiums. The comparison here uses ObamaCare's 2015 premiums and subsidies to provide a fair comparison, or else the GOP subsidies would look stingier.)Second, even a comparison of premium subsidies understates the cost difference between ObamaCare and GOP alternatives, because ObamaCare provides another layer of subsidies to low-income enrollees to offset out-of-pocket costs. Those extra cost-sharing subsidies, which are paid directly to insurers, effectively turn a silver plan to platinum, lowering the cap on out-of-pocket medical bills from about $13,000 to $2,000 or less. For the older 64-year-old couple, those extra cost-sharing subsidies effectively add just over $5,000 to ObamaCare's premium subsidy.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of some health insurers have been flying since Donald Trump's surprise victory, now that big mergers might get a friendlier hearing than they did from the Obama administration. Although UnitedHealth is staying solo, for now, its stock surged above a buy point and hit a record high. Meanwhile, Centene and Molina, the fastest growing insurers in the ObamaCare era, are tanking amid uncertainty about the Medicaid expansion on top of sagging hopes for the exchanges. Check out the group at IBD Stock Checkup. So, as far as subsidies go, ObamaCare is giving the 64-year-old couple just under $20,000 to the $6,000 provided by the leading GOP plan. Yet, even that understates the cost gap for low-income older adults, because GOP plans would eliminate the ObamaCare regulation that limits how much insurers can charge older adults to three times the premium charged to 24-year-olds. Removing that age-rating restriction and returning insurance markets to the common 5-to-1 gap between premiums charged to old and young before ObamaCare would raise the cost of premiums (before subsidies) by about 16.5%. So the older couple would have a much smaller subsidy to buy a more expensive plan.The comparison is a rough one, because ObamaCare's list of essential benefits might raise the cost of exchange plans by 3% to 9%, various analyses have shown. Yet that doesn't change the math very much.The challenge of taking care of the needs of low-income ObamaCare enrollees with chronic health problems helps explain why, before the election, a murderer's row of health policy wonks offered a GOP plan to kill ObamaCare softly. The plan from the American Enterprise Institute effectively promised that people who liked their ObamaCare plan could keep it, while everyone who got a bad deal under the law could opt for the new GOP deal. Their goal was to make the idea of replacing ObamaCare less scary for the public and to avoid the backlash seen in 2013 with the cancellations of millions of plans. Yet the promise people can keep their ObamaCare plan is an empty one because the approach would drain younger, healthier people from the risk pool and would undoubtedly trigger the kind of death spiral that conservatives have warned about. Insurers would simply refuse to participate.RELATED:Why Obama Is Wrong About ObamaCare, In One ChartObamaCare Subsidies To Explode As Cheapest Bronze-Plan Costs Surge 28%

589,UNH,"Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Tuesday that 8.25 million people signed up in time for Jan. 1 coverage via HealthCare.gov.Despite the upbeat tone after a last-minute rush led officials to push back the Dec. 15 deadline by a few days, the total so far trails the 8.8 million who signed up during open enrollment for 2015 coverage.At this point a year ago, HealthCare.gov sign-ups already had eclipsed its first-year total, so the news may be a sign that there's no great untapped ObamaCare demand. HHS touted 2.4 million ""new"" enrollees, but that includes people who previously signed up and dropped their plans.When the Obama administration projected that national enrollment would end 2016 at 11.4 million — at best — most analysts figured the estimate was intentionally way too low. Yet that's beginning to look plausible. Certainly, the Congressional Budget Office estimate of 21 million exchange enrollees in 2016 looks divorced from reality.Only 5.8 million people of the 7.2 million who held policies in June renewed coverage via HealthCare.gov, which operates exchanges for 37 states. An apparent auto-renewal snag means that this figure will rise slightly.Bad News For Insurers?People are automatically renewed if they don't visit the exchanges to select a plan. Though data from the other 13 states and D.C. haven't yet been compiled, the implication is that national enrollment in 2015 plans dived between June and December to roughly 9 million, down nearly one-fourth from the 11.7 million initial sign-ups. Big insurers, including Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH), reported losing an average 8% of exchange members in Q3.Tuesday's news may not be a great sign for insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) that have been losing money in their ObamaCare exchange business. While the jump in 2016 premiums and deductibles will make a difference in insurer bottom lines, making plans less affordable may be taking a toll on consumer demand.UnitedHealth warned that it would exit the exchanges after 2016 unless things turned around. So far, at least, there's no clear evidence of a turnaround.Even the same kind of surge in January and February as last year would only put sign-ups roughly in line with HHS' modest target.Bronze Age, ContinuedHHS predicted that national sign-ups could rise as high as 14.1 million but end the year nearly 20% lower as people drop out, either because they get coverage from another source (employer, Medicaid or Medicare) or go uninsured.Another datapoint may be just as important as the overall gain in enrollment: How much of the sign-up rush is really a surge of people selecting bronze plans. That's key when it comes to modest-income households earning up to 250% of the poverty level, since they qualify for extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. The catch is that the extra subsidies are only available to those who buy silver plans.For a 30-year-old couple in Richmond, Va., earning 200% of the poverty level ($40,000 for a family of three), buying a silver plan cuts their family deductible to $1,500, while the cheapest bronze plan has a $12,900 deductible. Yet, at $2,500, the silver plan may be too much of a stretch, leaving bronze as the only realistic option for a family that doesn't expect massive medical bills. If a hospital trip could still torpedo their finances, does it really count as a success if the couple pays $1,000 for a bronze plan so that they don't have to pay a combined $1,390 fine?The Kaiser Family Foundation says 3.5 million uninsured could buy 2016 bronze coverage for less than the mandate penalty.

617,UNH,"More than 1 million ObamaCare exchange customers have likely dropped out since open enrollment ended on Feb. 1, updated state reports suggest.The ramping up of the individual mandate penalty, to a minimum of $695 per adult, raised a possibility that few people selecting exchange plans would fail to follow through and pay, as was fairly common in the exchanges' first two years.But reports from five states — Colorado, Connecticut, Minnesota,Oklahoma and Washington — show that their enrollment has dropped more than 14%, from a combined 698,200 to about 598,000, since early February.The 14.3% loss in those five states is even worse than the 13% drop in national enrollment between the end of the 2015 enrollment period and March 31 of last year, when 1.5 million customers among the 11.7 million signups had their policies canceled.If enrollment in the rest of the country is down even 7.5%, just over half as much on a percentage basis as it is in those five states, that would mean a drop of one million customers from the 12.7 million who had selected plans or been automatically re-enrolled as of Feb. 1.The exodus of customers looks especially severe in Colorado, where the number of paying individuals had plunged 23% at the end of March from the sign-up total through Feb. 1. The drop to 115,890 from 150,769 has left paid enrollment below where it was a year ago.Colorado's problems were surely exacerbated by its low-priced, non-profit CO-OP, Colorado HealthOP, going out of business. Customers who don't qualify for subsidies are paying 34% more catastrophic plans and 21% more for bronze than they did in 2015. The COOP covered 69,000 exchange members last year, but only 25,000 of its former customers had signed up by Jan. 1, the Denver Post reported. People who lost their plans were given until the end of February to enroll.Colorado may be an outlier with its high percentage of unsubsidized customers, but combined enrollment is down 12% even in the other four states, not much better than last year's rate of attrition — and that was just the first quarter.In the final three quarters of 2015, national enrollment sank by nearly 14%, or 1.4 million, to 8.8 million, despite lax policies that allowed people to sign up midyear without documenting that they qualified for an exception, due to the loss of employer insurance, for example.A similar decline in the remainder of 2016 would bring national enrollment down to around 10 million at year's end.The news reinforces concerns that the pool of paying ObamaCare customers remains too small to balance out the older, higher-cost group that has flocked to the exchanges. Such concerns will prompt UnitedHealth (UNH) to exit exchanges in all but a handful of the 34 states where they are now doing business, the company said this week.Meanwhile, Marilyn Tavenner, CEO of the America's Health Insurance Plans trade association, told Morning Consult that she expects premiums to jump even more this year than last year. While the Obama administration said the actual premium increase only amounted to 8% this year because people shopped for bargains, an IBD analysis revealed that the ObamaCare premium increase was 10% once one accounts for the influx of kids and the level of coverage selected.In Virginia, the first state where insurers have filed their rate-hike plans for 2017, ObamaCare participants are asking for a nearly 18% premium hike, on average, an analysis by ACASignups.net finds.Anthem (ANTM), which had about 180,000 ObamaCare customers in the state in 2015, is seeking a 15.6% premium hike. One big reason for the increase is the phase-out of ObamaCare's temporary reinsurance program, which offsets part of the cost of the sickest patients. In 2015, Anthem's bottom line got a $65 million boost from the program, but that will go to zero in 2017.Connecticut's exchange enrollment fell from about 116,000 to 105,000, a drop of 9.2%, Arielle Levin Becker of the Connecticut Mirror reported.Becker, citing information released at a board meeting of the Connecticut exchange, reported that of the 18,800 customers who dropped out, 20% failed to provide required information; 53% didn't pay; 10% asked to have their plans canceled; and 12% shifted to Medicaid. Those exiting customers were partly offset by nearly 8,000 latecomers, more than one-third of whom lost Medicaid.Minnesota's MnSure exchange reported that paid enrollment (including small-business enrollment) stood at 76,505 in March, down 10.4% from 85,390 from early February.Also of note in Minnesota is the lopsided demographics of the exchange: Just 20% of members are age 18 to 34, and 38% are age 55 to 64.Adam Cancryn of SNL Financial reported that Oklahoma enrollment stood at 123,371 at the end of February, which is down 15.1% from the 145,329 total reported by the Department of Health and Human Services as of Feb. 1.As of the end of February, Washington state had lost 12% of the 200,691 customers who signed up, with 176,914 still active. Yet state data show that only 156,493 customers had submitted payment by the end of February, with other last-minute or post-open-enrollment shoppers facing their first due date in March, so it's likely that there will be more dropouts.

618,UNH,"For clues about ways to fight the current up-and-down market, take a look at the investment strategy of mutual funds that have outperformed over the long haul.The $8 billion American Century Ultra Fund (TWCUX) beat 66% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past 52 weeks going into Friday. Over the past three years, the fund's 11.38% average annual gain topped 80% of its peers, which averaged 9.48%, while the S&P 500 averaged 10.41%.The fund seeks highly profitable companies that look poised to keep growing. It aims for large, industry-leading companies that have sustainable accelerating earnings growth and positive price momentum.Where does the fund expect the best odds of finding such companies? A look at the fund's portfolio weightings offers a clue: As of March 31, managers Keith Lee, Michael Li and Jeff Bourke had their key overweights in the information technology and health care sectors. In tech, the fund was finding opportunities in Internet software and services, IT services and communications equipment.The fund's top 10 holdings reflect that tilt toward tech and health care. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) were the top four as of Feb. 29. The top 10 also included health care names UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG).Social networking giant Facebook is still in a buy range from a 117.09 buy point after gapping up April 28 on strong earnings.Its recent action in the stock market is not perfect. Its IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a C- from a worst-possible E, but the weak rating is still a sign of more recent selling than buying by mutual funds over the past 13 weeks.But earnings-per-share growth has sped up, going from 16% four quarters ago to 33%, 46% and 83% in the past three frames, respectively.And the stock's IBD Composite Rating is a solid 99. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings, with 99 being the highest.Managed health-care services provider UnitedHealth's EPS rebounded to 17% growth in the most recent stanza after falling 15% in the previous quarter.Shares are up 13% over the past 52 weeks, even after falling nearly 1% on Thursday as a federal judge ruled that the Obama administration is unconstitutionally spending federal money to fund ObamaCare.Shares of many key health care stocks went down after the decision. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer's ruling was a win for House Republicans who brought the legal challenge. The government was slated to pay $175 billion over 10 years to health insurers, lowering copayments for lower-income people.Robotic surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is a health care name that was unharmed by the ObamaCare ruling. Shares rose nearly 1% on Thursday. They're up more than 28% over the past 52 weeks.The stock's EPS grew a respective 34%, 20% and 24% over the past three quarters.Bank of America/Merrill Lynch recently said Intuitive was one of 16 S&P 500 stocks that could soon start paying a dividend. It cited the company's low debt compared with its industry, at least 2% of its market cap coming from cash, a stable earnings trend and EPS growth the prior fiscal year, as well as growth expected in the current year.

"
620,UNH,"Minuteman Health, the lowest-cost and second-biggest participant on New Hampshire's ObamaCare exchange, warned last week that it's requesting a 45.2% premium hike for 2017.The news comes as New Hampshire insurers reported an 11.7% decline in membership, down from the 55,183 signups reported by the Obama administration as of early February to 48,704 members with up-to-date payments at the start of April.Including ObamaCare customer exits in five other states -- Connecticut, Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Washington -- previously reported by IBD and other news outlets, that averages out to a 14.2% decline. The six states combined had nearly 647,000 customers at latest word, down from more than 753,000.That's an early sign ObamaCare's individual mandate isn't working as well as its supporters hoped. With the mandate tax penalty jumping to a minimum of $695 per adult for going without coverage this year, the fact that people are opting not to pay suggests that many would prefer to gamble on going uninsured and pay a fine rather than buy a bronze plan with a deductible of $6,000-plus.If the same rate of attrition occurred in the rest of the country, which is by no means clear from the small sample, that would cut enrollment to just under 11 million from the 12.7 million who signed up.Minuteman, with nearly 13,500 customers and nearly 40% of bronze-plan members, trails Anthem (ANTM) as the biggest player on the exchange, excluding Medicaid customers up to 138% of the poverty level. Near-poor customers became eligible this year for marketplace plans through a state waiver granted by the Department of Health and Human Services.Centene (CNC) unit Ambetter from N.H. Healthy Families plan has 20,800 Medicaid waiver customers, nearly half the 41,800 total.Minuteman officials said they were being financially conservative in requesting the high rate increase and could substantially lower the request, but there's good reason for their caution.The company, which also competes in Mass., had to pay out $2,150 per plan member last year into ObamaCare's risk-adjustment program, based on 2014 results. The program shifts funds from insurers who get a relatively healthy group of enrollees to those who attract sicker customers. Yet insurers and experts alike have said it does a poor job of accurately balancing the risk taken on by insurers.Now Minuteman, expecting even worse, has set aside $3,000 per 2015 customer. HHS will report risk-adjustment results for 2015 on June 30, and Minuteman will update its rate request in July.Small carriers like Minuteman would like to see risk-adjustment pay-outs capped at a fixed percentage of premiums. But others, like UnitedHealth (UNH), have suggested they're already being short-changed. (UnitedHealth this month said it would pull out of all but a ""handful"" of exchanges in 2017.)The Obama administration brought stakeholders together for a big risk-adjustment meeting last month to hash out the future of the program.Minuteman this year is offering the cheapest bronze plan and the two cheapest silver plans in New Hampshire. Its lowest-cost bronze offering is 11% cheaper than its nearest rival, Harvard Pilgrim Health.

621,UNH,"Stocks tumbled in and out of mixed trade Thursday morning as earning reports, economic news and overseas factors all had a say in early action.The Nasdaq held up a 0.2% gain, buoyed primarily by Facebook (FB). The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.4% and the S&P 500 dipped 0.2%.Volume rose mildly, up 1% on the NYSE and 8% higher on the Nasdaq, vs. action at the same time Wednesday.The stock market today felt early pressure from overseas markets, which traded generally lower after the Bank of Japan held its monetary policy unchanged and sent the yen soaring and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 to a 3.6% loss Thursday. Economic news increased that weight, after the Labor Department estimated Q1 GDP growth at 0.5%, sharply below Q4 growth and below the consensus view for 0.7%.Nearly all Dow stocks declined at the open. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) led the few advancing issues, up 0.9%. DuPont (DD) shouldered the heaviest loss, down more than 2%, possibly affected by investor response to Q1 results from its pending merger mate Dow Chemical (DOW). Dow's results topped expectations, but the economic outlook appeared wobbly. Dow shares slipped 2%.Facebook easily led the Nasdaq 100 with a 10% advance. Facebook's Q1 earnings report late Wednesday triggered a handful of analyst price target increases Thursday morning. The gain sent shares 2% past a 117.09 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.At the weak end of the Nasdaq 100, chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX) tanked 10%. The company reported late Wednesday its Q1 earnings and revenue narrowly topped consensus views. Management guided Q2 EPS in line with views, but guidance for flat revenue disappointed expectations.Acquisitions news powered a healthy piece of early trade. St. Jude Medical (STJ) opened 24% higher after fellow heart-device maker Abbot Labs (ABT) agreed to buy the company in a $25 billion deal. Abbott's shares fell more than 8%.Facebook's technical and fundamental vital signs are avaible using IBD's Stock Checkup featureBiomed Medivation (MDVN) scribed an early 9% advance, ignited by a $9.3 takeover proposal from France's Sanofi (SNY). Sanofi shares shed 2%.Chicago-based drugmaker Abbvie (ABBV) slumped almost 5% after announcing plans to acquire privately held cancer treatment biomed Stemcentrix in a deal valued at $5.8 billion.Outside of the medical territories, Comcast (CMCSA) sealed its deal to ingest Dreamworks Animations (DWA) for around $3.8 billion. Dreamworks traded flat on Thursday, after spiking 19% on the news in Wednesday's session. Comcast traded a fraction lower Thursday, and was down 0.3% on the week.Haynesbrands (HBI) jockeyed 9% higher after announcing it would pay $835 million to acquire leading Australian undergarment maker Pacific Brands.Companies scheduled to report after today's close include Amazon.com (AMZN), Baidu (BIDU), Netsuite (N), LinkedIn (LKND) and Western Digital (WDC), among many others.

622,UNH,"At the close of the third sign-up season for ObamaCare, 12.7 million people had selected plans, the Obama administration reported on Thursday. It's not yet clear how many of those are paying customers, though well more than 1 million will likely never submit a payment, based on last year's experience.While the Obama administration, as always, hailed the results as evidence the public insurance exchanges are working, it is clearly bad news. Even with an individual mandate penalty for going without coverage -- a minimum of $695 per uninsured adult in 2016 -- half or more of those eligible for subsidies still haven't enrolled.The news is bad for insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), who had hoped to see a broader, healthier risk pool and are now questioning the sustainability of the exchanges. Above all, it's bad for millions and millions with modest or moderate incomes, who faced an unhappy choice between paying for a plan they couldn't afford or paying a fine and praying that they'd stay healthy.Supporters argue that the reason so few people are signing up is that they don't know enough about ObamaCare. Yet there's a much simpler explanation as to why people would spurn ObamaCare coverage as such a bad deal that they'd rather risk paying a penalty: Either the silver-plan premiums are too high for them to afford -- even with subsidies -- or the common $6,000-plus deductibles make bronze plans of marginal usefulness.While the Obama administration thinks it's a success when anyone signs up for a plan, it's hard to see why. Preliminary data suggest that many of the new enrollees may have opted for a low-cost bronze plan to avoid a fine -- even if the unrealistic deductible would torpedo their finances if they actually have a health emergency.The Urban Institute estimated that 24 million people would be eligible for exchange subsidies this year. The Congressional Budget Office had projected that an annual average of 15 million people would receive subsidies this year, but last month it cut that estimate to 11 million. The data released by HHS on Thursday suggest that 10 million or fewer subsidized customers will hold policies once payments are submitted, and that number is likely to dwindle as the year progresses.After three years of enrollment, it's now fair to say that the reality of the individual mandate penalty is much harsher than the way that the Obama administration advertised it. Back then, the White House described it as ""a penalty for the few people who will refuse to buy health insurance -- even though they can afford it.""The lack of any sizable jump in enrollment from last year's 11.7 million signup total is sending a jarring message. Consider that HHS pushed enrollment this year by saying most people qualifying for subsidies could get a plan for $900 or less this year. So why would people risk throwing out a nearly equal sum of cash on a penalty? The message is that people are simply too stretched to pay that much for a very-high-deductible plan. If the government is going to collect from them at tax time in 2017, they'll worry about it then.As insurers continue to have their earnings pressured by the individual exchange business, and as the backlash over the individual mandate builds, it will increasingly become evident that the individual exchanges can't be made to work well unless Congress rolls up its sleeves and fixes them. That would surely require a major rethinking of the law.Department of Health and Human Services officials explained that the 12.7 million sign-up figure understated the gains from last year's 11.7 million figure. That's true to an extent, because perhaps 300,000 people who haven't paid already have had their applications discounted. New York also steered about 200,000 people with income up to 200% of the poverty level from private plans into a government-run version of ObamaCare. That, in itself, was an admission of ObamaCare's affordability shortcomings.Officials continue to celebrate one enrollment data point: Four million ""new"" enrollees signed up for coverage in the 38 states using HealthCare.gov. If that were the case, why did total HealthCare.gov sign-ups rise by less than 1 million? There's a simple reason: ""New"" is defined to include anyone who had previously signed up but never paid, or stopped paying their premium by the fall of 2015. In other words, new enrollees include the usual suspects.

623,UNH,"Strength in overseas stock markets overnight and a jump in oil prices helped U.S. stocks score big gains near midday Monday.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq each rose 1.3%. About two hours into the session, volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking well below Friday's levels.UnitedHealth (UNH) and Caterpillar (CAT) were early leaders in the Dow.Copper and other industrial metals also rose. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) and Alcoa (AA) led in the S&P 500, rising 13% and 10%, respectively.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, benchmark WTI crude oil rose 6% to $31.50 after the International Energy Agency forecast lower U.S. shale production this year and next.In the stock market today, market leader Dean Foods (DF) reversed hard after an early 2% pop.  Before the open, the company reported adjusted profit of 36 cents a share, up 350% from the year ago-quarter and above the consensus estimate for 34 cents. Sales fell 16% to $2.02 billion, below the consensus for $2.07 billion. After a bullish breakout over a 19.51 buy point, Dean Foods fell below the buy point Monday.On the downside, Lumber Liquidators (LL) tanked 14% after the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said cancer risk associated with the company's flooring is much higher than other products.IBD Sector Leader Nautilus (NLS) edged lower ahead of its earnings report after the close. Quarterly profit is seen rising 15% to 38 cents a share. It's trying for a breakout over a 21.06 buy point.Key economic news releases this week include January existing-home sales numbers on Tuesday, new-home sales data Wednesday, January’s durable goods report Thursday and revisions to the Commerce Department’s Q4 GDP on Friday.

625,UNH,"If the House wins its ObamaCare lawsuit, the ruling would be an unprecedented rebuke of a president for brazenly usurping the power of the purse that the Constitution entrusts to Congress.But the celebration may not last long, because the GOP may be in for a shocker: Eliminating $130 billion or so in unappropriated funds that the Obama administration has carved out for ObamaCare may significantly increase the cost of the law.That's the surprising conclusion of a new Urban Institute study which finds that total ObamaCare costs will rise by $47 billion over 10 years if a court ruling nixes the spending program which compensates insurers for reducing deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs charged to low-income policy holders.Yet the study's authors ignore the political ramifications of such an increase in costs, which would come about only if the Obama administration (or the Clinton administration, perhaps following a 2017 Supreme Court ruling) rewrites regulations to permit a dramatic change in the way premiums are priced.It strains belief to imagine that Republicans would sit idly by as a Democratic administration effectively boosts spending by about $175 billion by executive fiat. Such a move would seem almost guaranteed to set off a heated budget showdown, with the GOP threatening to withhold funds from other programs near and dear to Democrats.Gaming out the chain of events that would follow a ruling in favor of the House is much more than idle speculation. As University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley, a reliable ObamaCare supporter, writes in a new paper, ""the president appears to have broken the law.""The legal question over funding of ObamaCare's cost-sharing subsidies is straightforward, so the only real question in the case is whether the House has standing to sue. That would be a first, but the case itself is unprecedented: The Obama administration unilaterally decided to appropriate $10 billion-plus a year — not as a one-time thing, but on a permanent basis.U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer already decided that the House has standing, so it is virtually certain that she will rule against the Obama administration, likely in the first half of 2016. The White House will surely appeal and seek a stay of her ruling, which could push the endgame into 2017.  But the verdict will pose a serious threat to the health of the ObamaCare exchanges — and to insurer profits — at a time that UnitedHealth (UNH) is thinking about exiting the business and Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM) have been struggling to earn a profit.To understand why the future of ObamaCare's exchanges could be seriously hurt by the outcome of the House lawsuit, consider what these cost-sharing subsidies mean to an individual earning 200% of the poverty level, about $23,500 a year. The cheapest silver plan in Houston comes with a $2,000 deductible and caps a plan member's cost for medical expenses at $6,850, after which the insurer pays all bills. But for lower earners, the insurer reduces the deductible to $450 and puts a $2,250 limit on out-of-pocket costs.You might say that the cost-sharing subsidies put the ""affordable"" in Affordable Care Act. But even if government funding of these subsidies is eliminated, insurers must still provide the same cost-sharing breaks to lower earners under the 2010 law.The logical way for insurers to make up for the loss of government funding for the cost-sharing subsidies is to charge higher premiums. But if insurers spread this expense across all plan levels, people who don't qualify for the subsidies would, in effect, have to pay a surtax for the cost-sharing benefits that go to someone else.""This would be a strong disincentive for individuals to enroll"" in exchange plans, write the Urban Institute's Linda Blumberg and Matthew Buettgens.Not only would the higher premiums dissuade people who don't get subsidies from signing up, but insurers who only offer individual-market policies off the subsidized ObamaCare exchanges wouldn't have to charge a surtax, giving them a competitive edge. Under that scenario, ObamaCare's problems with a narrow, high-cost insured pool will only get worse.The best solution for insurers and customers alike, the authors reasonably conclude, would be to charge a surtax only on silver plans. Since the cost-sharing subsidies only come with silver plans, people who don't qualify could still buy bronze or gold without paying extra. Further, because the size of premium subsidies is based on the cost of silver plans, and silver-plan premiums would jump by about 29%, the value of premium subsidies also would soar.This approach would produce some odd consequences, to say the least. Silver plans would become more expensive than gold plans, even though gold plans provide a much higher level of benefits. Because subsidies would be much bigger, many more people could get bronze plans for free, so more people would buy coverage and fewer would pay the mandate fine.Meanwhile, many people who now take advantage of the cost-sharing subsidies, which are paid directly to insurance companies, could instead opt for bronze coverage and reap a windfall in refundable premium tax credits. A 64-year-old couple earning just under $24,000 could get bronze coverage for free and an extra $8,000 tax credit to do with as they please.If the GOP wins their suit, as seems likely, the strategy mapped out by the Urban Institute could, in theory, be a boon to ObamaCare. But there's no chance that a Republican president would consider it, and it's likely to escalate the partisan war over ObamaCare.

639,UNH,"Anthem (ANTM) said its ObamaCare exchange business gained market share in states like New York and Colorado, where nonprofit, government-funded co-ops went bust.The removal of low-priced competitors helped Anthem grow its exchange customer base to 975,000 at the end of the first quarter, up from 898,000 a year earlier. However, it's too early to tell whether its customers will be more or less costly than expected.Unlike UnitedHealth (UNH), which is pulling out of most of its exchange markets, Anthem has committed to the exchange business for the long haul. That's both because of long-term potential and short-term political necessity, as it seeks regulatory approval for its merger with Cigna (CI).Likewise, Aetna (AET) must maintain and grow its exchange presence -- at least in Florida -- to close its merger with Humana (HUM). State regulators said the combined Aetna-Humana must expand to five additional counties by 2018 and statewide by 2020.While Anthem officials said the company's exchange business is trending in the right direction, they still see a cloudy future.In an earnings call, Anthem CEO Joe Swedish described the company as well positioned ""if the market stabilizes to a more sustainable level,"" alluding to appropriate risk-based pricing of premiums.Later, he said, ""maybe a sustainable model can be built.""Swedish noted that Anthem is pressing the Obama administration to fix the risk-adjustment program that shifts funds from plans that attract healthier customers to those that attract sicker ones. He's also looking for a narrowing of the exceptions that allow people to enroll outside the open-enrollment period to start the year. Another stated problem is the grace period that puts insurers on the hook for bills run up by customers for a month after they've stopped paying premiums.Lastly, Anthem is looking for the flexibility to offer different types of coverage than currently allowed.The end of ObamaCare's temporary reinsurance program, which reimburses insurers for some of the claims of its costliest members, will alone boost premiums by 5% to 6% in 2017, Anthem said.The company has filed for a 15.8% premium hike in Virginia, where it had about 180,000 individual market customers, both on and off the exchange, in 2015. A filing by Anthem said its HealthKeepers plan got back $65 million in reinsurance payments from the government last year.

"
648,UNH,"The ObamaCare exchanges have added so few customers in the past three weeks that it almost seems like there must be some kind of glitch. With less than three weeks left to enroll, the exchanges still have fewer customers than signed up in 2015, yet the rate of new sign-ups now appears to be slower than it has been since the glitch-filled launch in the fourth quarter of 2013.That's worrying news for insurers like UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM). Without an infusion of fresh blood during this final sprint, the exchanges will tilt a bit older and not much bigger than 2015's make-up that prompted double-digit premium hikes and UnitedHealth's threat to exit the exchanges if losses don't end.It's also troubling for ObamaCare's supporters who have hoped that a jump in the individual mandate penalty to a minimum of $695 for going without coverage in 2016, more than double 2015's minimum hit, would result in a big increase in enrollment rather than a big jump in the tax penalty millions of people will have to pay. Since there's no glitch holding down enrollment as the individual mandate penalty spikes, the problem must be in the marketability of the plans.Just 74,000 Sign-Ups Last WeekIn the past week, HealthCare.gov, which handles operations for 38 states, added just 74,000 customers, or less than half the 163,000 customers added in the same week a year ago.In fact the totals in each of the past three weeks are the three slowest weeks since the Obama administration began breaking out weekly HealthCare.gov totals at the start of 2015 enrollment. The three-week total of 231,800 new sign-ups is likely the worst stretch since late 2013 because the weakest month since then (February 2014) still saw close to 700,000 sign-ups.So far there's no hint that activity is accelerating as the clock winds down on 2016 open enrollment. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell made no mention of a pick-up in her statement announcing the latest figures, referring only to a burst of activity in mid-December. One leading indicator of sign-up activity also has lagged. Over the past two weeks, 451,000 customers submitted applications, a necessary precursor to selecting an exchange plan. That's down by nearly one-fourth from the 579,000 application filers in the same period a year earlier.The drop in applications provides confirmation that sign-up activity is genuinely slow, rather than just an illusory effect of a shift in accounting for plan cancellations. Like last year, the HealthCare.gov states are subtracting customers when people cancel their plans, and each week's total represents the net addition of customers.In addition, insurers in HealthCare.gov states will strip out customers who never pay as their deadlines for monthly payments pass, rather than waiting until the end of open enrollment to do so.An example of what that culling of nonpaying customers looks like comes from Rhode Island, which operates its own exchange. This week, the state reported 30,015 paying and nonpaying customers, down 15.3% from the prior week's 34,627.There's no indication of any similar purging of nonpayers in the HealthCare.gov states. Two states did report that their sign-up totals edged lower last week. Montana sign-ups fell by 78, or 0.1%, from 55,555, and Pennsylvania's slipped by 1,239, or 0.3%, from 412,914. It's not clear whether those mild declines are just related to stripping out plans actively cancelled by consumers or whether an insurer here or there has started to winnow nonpayers.Aetna, Humana Signal Enrollment WeakFurther suggestions ObamaCare enrollment is weak have come from Aetna and Humana (HUM) recently. This week, Aetna told investors that its first-quarter individual market enrollment will be at least as high as at the end of 2015. That's a pretty low bar considering that Aetna's exchange enrollment shrank by more than 100,000, or 11%, in the third quarter as customers dropped coverage and likely continued to fall in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, Humana reported that its individual enrollment will shrink by 200,000 to 300,000 by the end of 2016. (Aetna has agreed to buy Humana, but regulators have yet to approve it.)While Medicaid insurers such as Centene (CNC) that have been more aggressive in pricing premiums lower may be stealing customers from the competition — often with high deductibles — the size of the pie is likely to be smaller than companies were expecting.In 2015, 11.7 million sign-ups dwindled to 10.2 million paying customers by March and likely fewer than 9 million by year-end. The Obama administration's estimate of 11.4 million enrollees at the end of 2016, which had seemed shockingly low compared to the Congressional Budget Office's projected annual average of 20 million paid enrollees, now looks on the money and possibly optimistic.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.Related:ObamaCare Employer Mandate Is Worse Than Feared.

655,UNH,"New ObamaCare exchange enrollment via HealthCare.gov continued to lag behind last year's pace during Thanksgiving week. That's an unwelcome sign for the insurance industry and the Obama administration, which has been expecting the ramping up of the individual mandate to boost new sign-ups by as much as 30% this enrollment period.Comparing new enrollment with last year's sign-up period is tricky, because this period runs from Nov. 1 to Feb. 1, while last enrollment season went from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15. As the mid-December enrollment deadline for being covered on New Year's Day approaches, activity will pick up.So ObamaCare supporters needn't panic yet that HealthCare.gov has signed up only 714,000 new customers through the first four weeks of open enrollment, nearly 40% below the 1,176,000 through four weeks of enrollment last year.Still, even comparing the last two full weeks of November with the same period a year ago, new enrollment ran 6% below last year's pace.ObamaCare Stakes High In 2016The stakes are high for ObamaCare in 2016: UnitedHealth (UNH), the nation's largest insurer, says that it may bow out of the individual exchange business if it can't turn a profit this year. Other insurers, including Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM) and Humana (HUM), marked down their expectations after seeing a big outflow of customers in the third quarter. While they're expressing patience, a weak enrollment year could lead to another big round of premium hikes for 2017.A ruling on the House lawsuit against the Obama administration for spending never-appropriated billions on cost-sharing subsidies will come during the spring, and a victory for Republicans would cast further doubt on ObamaCare's future.So far, the Obama administration is releasing data for only the 37 states whose exchanges are operated by HealthCare.gov. New enrollees include anyone who didn't hold an exchange policy when they signed up in the current enrollment period — even if they had signed up previously and dropped their coverage for whatever reason.New enrollment is only part of the equation. Getting current members to re-up also matters. So does getting people who sign up to pay for coverage. The Department of Health and Human Services expects up to 14.1 million people to sign up, including as many as 5.4 million new members, but it sees paid enrollment falling to a maximum of 11.4 million at year-end 2016.Some analysts see 11.4 million as a low-ball estimate. In any case, a total of 5.4 million new sign-ups doesn't look likely, since the pace of sign-ups is running behind last year's total, which ended below 4.2 million.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.

671,UNH,"Biotech pioneer Amgen has long depended on its flagship drugs for its revenue stream, but the next few years could see a changing of the guard as new medications overshadow the old.
"
672,UNH,"Currently, more than half of Amgen's (AMGN) sales come from drugs that debuted in the 1990s: the sister drugs Neulasta and Neupogen, both of which stimulate production of white blood cells, and Enbrel, which treats immunology conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Amgen's legacy anemia treatment, Epogen, still provides 9% of sales after being approved way back in 1989.
"
673,UNH,"However, as some of the earliest and therefore simplest biologic drugs, they've also been the first targets for rivals waiting to sell what are known as biosimilars once patents lapse on Amgen's products. Biosimilars aren't quite like generic drugs, which are identical copies of the originals, but they are similar enough to be used interchangeably by at least some physicians.
"
674,UNH,"Biosimilars of Neupogen have been sold for a few years in Europe, and this year Novartis' (NVS) version, Zarxio, entered the American market. It has put more weight on the growth of Amgen's launches.
"
675,UNH,"Repatha's Launch
"
676,UNH,"Probably the most anticipated Amgen launch this year was for Repatha, a treatment for high cholesterol approved in Europe in July and in the U.S. in August.
"
677,UNH,"Repatha is one of a new class of cholesterol medications called PCSK9 inhibitors, also being developed by several other drugmakers. In fact, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and its partner Sanofi (SNY) launched their own PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, just a month earlier than Repatha in the U.S.
"
678,UNH,"Since the clinical trials indicate similar effectiveness for both drugs, the two have been duking it out for payer deals. Last month Amgen was put on the preferred formulary of CVS Health (CVS), while Regeneron and Sanofi did the same with UnitedHealth (UNH).
"
679,UNH,"Analysts agree, however, that the crucial test for Repatha will come next year. That's when Amgen reports on the first results from its trial measuring Repatha's effects on cardiovascular outcomes — that is, whether it actually reduces cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke. Praluent's corresponding tests come shortly after.
"
680,UNH,"Though the FDA approved both Repatha and Praluent based on their ability to lower LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol, that ability doesn't mean that they automatically improve heart health.
"
681,UNH,"Better Than Expected?
"
682,UNH,"In a Dec. 14 note upgrading Amgen to overweight, Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison estimated that outcomes data could add 20% in annual sales of Repatha, even if Praluent (as is likely) gets the same result. But his upgrade was driven by a survey of cardiologists that found it could do better than expected even before that.
"
683,UNH,"""While we will be the first to acknowledge that survey data tends to skew toward high uptake, the cardiologists and PCPs (primary care physicians) we surveyed believe PCSK9 inhibitors can obtain 30% to 40% share of patients ... prior to outcomes data,"" Harrison wrote. ""This is well above what both we and the consensus model (see), and even if the penetration was cut in half, it would still be above consensus.""
"
684,UNH,"Seeing The Upside
"
685,UNH,"Analysts call for peak annual Repatha sales of $4 billion to $5 billion, but Harrison isn't the only analyst who sees upside to that number. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee recently wrote he thinks sales could be twice that.
"
686,UNH,"However, the peak isn't expected until 2020, and the need to negotiate with payers is keeping the launch fairly slow in the near term.
"
687,UNH,"Amgen has a few other cards to play, though, starting with blood-cancer drug Kyprolis.
"
688,UNH,"Amgen came by Kyprolis when it acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals in 2013 for $10.4 billion. Many investors at the time balked at the price tag, but Amgen has been working to justify it by doing more research to expand the drug's label.
"
689,UNH,"When the FDA first approved Kyprolis for multiple myeloma in 2012, it cleared the drug only for advanced cases — those who'd had at least two prior treatments — and only in combination with another drug called Velcade. Also, Amgen couldn't put any survival benefit on Kyprolis' label, as the clinical trials hadn't proven the benefit.
"
690,UNH,"Amgen won approval for somewhat less advanced multiple myeloma this summer, and it produced studies demonstrating a survival benefit, as well as Kyprolis' effectiveness without Velcade. In the most recently reported third quarter, Kyprolis sales jumped 46% from a year ago to $137 million.
"
691,UNH,"Overall, Amgen's earnings rose 18% to $2.72 a share for the quarter, beating analyst estimates by 34 cents. Sales increased 14% to $5.72 billion, also ahead of Street views.
"
692,UNH,"Unusual Events
"
693,UNH,"It was the best sales growth in some years, but Amgen acknowledged that some of it was due to one-time events, such as one customer's abnormally large purchase of Enbrel. Amgen's guidance was more modest; analysts overall are expecting a slowdown, with earnings up 5% in the current quarter and up 6% next year.
"
694,UNH,"The Street expects earnings growth to jump to 16% the year after that, but the longer-term outlook depends on the success of drugs currently in the pipeline.
"
695,UNH,"Analyst Harrison pegs June 2016 as the likely report date for the results of a late-stage study of romosozumab, a medicine Amgen is developing for osteoporosis. If it succeeds, the drug could eventually reach blockbuster status, with more than $1 billion a year in sales.
"
696,UNH,"But in the nearer term, Amgen doesn't have many levers left to keep growth pumping, says Wells Fargo analyst Jim Birchenough.
"
697,UNH,"""With a highly leveraged balance sheet and commitment to its dividend policy, we view Amgen's business development opportunities as much more limited than peers',"" Birchenough wrote in a Dec. 3 report, initiating coverage at neutral.
"
698,UNH,"""While Amgen has been able to beat consensus estimates for the past five years, with share repurchases and aggressive cost cutting, we believe that further cost cuts would be difficult to achieve and that focus will increasingly be on top-line performance,"" Birchenough said.Biotech pioneer Amgen has long depended on its flagship drugs for its revenue stream, but the next few years could see a changing of the guard as new medications overshadow the old.Currently, more than half of Amgen's (AMGN) sales come from drugs that debuted in the 1990s: the sister drugs Neulasta and Neupogen, both of which stimulate production of white blood cells, and Enbrel, which treats immunology conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.

"
704,UNH,"The backlash over ObamaCare deductibles will only intensify as customers shopping for 2017 plans a year from now face bronze-plan deductibles as high as $7,150.The Department of Health and Human Services on Friday detailed many key ObamaCare parameters for 2017, including a $300, or 4.4%, rise in the maximum out-of-pocket expense for covered medical bills — not including premium payments — from $6,850 in 2016.Some of the lowest-cost bronze plans for 2016 are setting deductibles and out-of-pocket limits at the $6,850 ceiling to hold down premiums, which still rose by about 12% over 2015, on average.That means that landing in the hospital could wreck the finances of many modest-income bronze plan enrollees.Aetna (AET) offers the cheapest bronze plan in St. Louis with a $6,850 deductible via its Coventry unit. Ambetter, affiliated with Centene (CNC), has the lowest-priced bronze in numerous markets such as Miami and Atlanta with a $6,800 deductible.UnitedHealth (UNH) roiled Aetna, Centene as well as other medical services stocks Thursday by warning it may exit the ObamaCare exchanges after 2016. UnitedHealth expects to continue losing money on such plans, even with deductibles rising and, in many markets, significant increases in premiums.The 2010 health reform law specifies that the maximum out-of-pocket cost will rise each year in tandem with the national average growth in premiums. The Obama administration only factors in the change in employer premiums.Employer penalties are indexed according to the same procedure, which means that companies will face a penalty of $2,260 per full-time worker in 2017 (with an exemption for 30 workers), up from $2,160 in 2016, if they fail to offer health coverage that meets ObamaCare standards.Unlike wages, employer fines are paid out of after-tax profits, so the $2,260 fine really equates to $3,711 in taxable wages, or $1.78 an hour for a full-time, year-round worker.In 2017, these key parameters will both be about 13% higher than their 2014 levels, with the maximum deductible rising to $7,150 from $6,350. The employer fine is up to $2,260 from $2,000, though the penalty was delayed until 2015.A long list of employers has limited work hours to dodge the fine while avoiding the cost of providing health benefits for some modest-wage workers.Still, the impact of the employer mandate has been more muted than the law's critics expected, but that's largely because low-wage, full-time workers are turning down employer coverage they find unaffordable.In 2017, as long as employers offer workers coverage that doesn't exceed 9.69% of pay — $1,938 for a $20,000-earner — they face no penalty under ObamaCare and the worker is ineligible for exchange subsidies. As a result, millions of low-wage workers remain uninsured because they can't access ObamaCare subsidies.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.
"
705,UNH,"UnitedHealth (UNH) is nearly out of patience with ObamaCare's individual market exchanges, warning Thursday that it may get soaked again in 2016. The outlook for other big insurers like Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM) has gotten increasingly cloudy, with the forecast not clearing until 2017 or perhaps 2018.
"
706,UNH,"But that may be optimistic because another huge, red-ink-imperiling curveball could come this spring with a ruling in House v. Burwell. Nearly 20% of total exchange subsidies paid out to insurers — or $136 billion over the next decade, by Congressional Budget Office estimates — is at stake.The House GOP's lawsuit against the Obama administration threatens the cost-sharing subsidies that turn silver plans to platinum for low-income exchange customers, dramatically shrinking their deductibles and out-of-pocket payments.The Affordable Care Act clearly requires insurers to provide these enhanced benefits to those who qualify based on income, and it directs the government to compensate insurers for those benefits. The problem is that, as the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has said, ""unlike the refundable (premium) tax credits, these payments to health plans do not appear to be funded through a permanent appropriation.""Initially, the Obama administration agreed, as evidenced by its $4 billion appropriation request for 2014 to pay out these cost-sharing subsidies. Yet, doubting that the House would go along, the Department of Health and Human Services reversed course and insisted that no annual appropriation was needed.The House voted to sue the Obama administration to protect its power of the purse and its lawsuit already cleared one huge hurdle. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer ruled in September that the House has standing to sue in an opinion that strongly suggested she's likely to rule for the House on the merits.A decision is likely in the spring — around the time that insurers are figuring out where to set premiums in 2017.""If Judge Collyer rules that insurers cannot be reimbursed for the cost-sharing reductions they are required to provide . . . insurers would face substantial costs which are not covered by premiums,"" Washington and Lee University law professor Timothy Jost wrote for Health Affairs. ""This could introduce serious instability into insurance markets.""Insurers would have to raise premiums to cover the cost-sharing reductions, perhaps by double-digits in many markets. That, in turn, could drive more relatively young and healthy customers out of markets in which the average customer is already ringing up higher costs than expected.There's also another potential problem. Insurers who sell ObamaCare-compliant policies both on and off the exchange have to offer the same price for the same coverage. But if the cost of exchange coverage spikes to make up for the loss of cost-sharing subsidies, insurers who exit the exchange may find a significant pricing advantage in selling off the exchange to higher-income customers who don't qualify for subsidies.In short, it may be clear by spring that the individual insurance exchanges, which are already failing to deliver for insurers and — more importantly — for a large majority of the modest-income uninsured population, won't have much of a future unless Congress and the next president can agree on a new path forward.While Judge Collyer won't have the final say — the case is likely to get to the Supreme Court — the merits of the case are far stronger than those of the recent King v. Burwell case in which conservatives argued that Congress intended to deny subsidies to states that didn't set up their own exchanges.The Government Accountability Office notes in its ""Principles of Federal Appropriations Law"" reference book that ""a direction to pay without a designation of the source of funds is not an appropriation.""Interestingly, the GAO included a new example to demonstrate the point: ObamaCare's risk-corridors program, which left insurers on the hook for some $2.5 billion in 2014 losses that the government was supposed to recoup.The statute ""directing HHS to make payments to qualified health plans did not, by its terms, enact an appropriation to make those payments.""

"
708,UNH,"The Department of Health and Human Services on Friday gave a green light to an aggressive new ObamaCare exchange pricing strategy that relies on huge silver-plan deductibles and results in smaller government subsidies.
"
709,UNH,"This is likely good news for Centene (CNC), which could see big enrollment gains in 2016 because its Ambetter affiliate managed to significantly underprice competitors in a number of major markets by attaching deductibles as high as $6,500 to silver plans. But it's bad news for modest- to moderate-income customers buying coverage in some Ambetter markets like Miami, Atlanta and Jackson, Miss., which will face the highest after-subsidy premiums in the country in 2016.
"
710,UNH,"Many Bronze Premiums Spike
"
711,UNH,"The cheapest bronze plan available in 2016 in those three cities will cost about $2,220, or $185 a month, for 27-year-olds earning about $30,000, just over 250% of the poverty level. That's 21% more than the average $152-per-month cost of the cheapest bronze plan found by IBD in a review of the largest market in each of the 37 states using HealthCare.gov.
"
712,UNH,"Paying the individual mandate penalty of $695 — less than one-third of the cost of the cheapest, $6,800-deductible bronze plan in those Centene-Ambetter markets — may look like the best option.
"
713,UNH,"Although ObamaCare is already struggling to attract relatively young and healthy customers, and Centene's pricing strategy will make it even harder to do so, HHS said it has no plans to add new restrictions to the type of policies an insurer can offer.
"
714,UNH,"While the Obama administration plans to create a standard silver plan that will have a $3,500 deductible, and it will aim to highlight that option for customers, that won't do anything to address the real threat: smaller subsidies.
"
715,UNH,"Silver Deductibles Deduct From Subsidies
"
716,UNH,"That's because the size of exchange subsidies depends on the price of the second-cheapest silver plan in each market. Largely because two Ambetter plans are priced so low in its markets — with a $6,500 deductible for the cheapest silver plan and a $5,500 deductible for the second-lowest-cost plan — the subsidy available to 27-year-olds earning about $30,000 in Jackson will fall from $757 in 2015 to $439 in 2016.
"
717,UNH,"The pricing shift in Jackson has been especially dramatic. In 2015, the second-lowest-cost silver plan cost 35% more than the cheapest bronze, but the gap has narrowed to just 13% in 2016.
"
718,UNH,"One key reason is that Ambetter's cheapest silver plans cover only about 68% of eligible expenses of the insured group, not too far above the typical 60% covered by bronze plans. The standardized silver-plan option HHS envisions would cover 71% of group costs.
"
719,UNH,"Centene also may be pricing in somewhat smaller bills among customers attracted by its lower-premium, high-deductible plans. Customers who choose Ambetter's $6,500 deductible plan in Indianapolis will get limited benefits before the deductible is met, such as primary-care visits at a cost of $30, specialist visits for $60 and generic drugs for $15, along with free preventative care such as vaccines. But big-ticket items like diagnostic testing, MRIs, specialty drugs, emergency-room visits and surgical procedures aren't covered until after a patient racks up $6,500 in in-network bills.
"
720,UNH,"Silver plans are the most common exchange selection because customers with incomes up to 250% of the poverty level are eligible for extra subsidies that lower out-of-pocket costs.
"
721,UNH,"Even with these extra cost-sharing subsidies, people earning from 201% to 250% of the poverty level would face a $4,500 deductible under the cheapest Ambetter silver plan.
"
722,UNH,"After its $6.8 billion merger with HealthNet (HNT), Centene will have about 500,000 individual market customers in 14 markets.
"
723,UNH,"Medicaid Insurers Expand In Exchanges
"
724,UNH,"Along with Centene, Molina HealthCare (MOH), CareSource and other Medicaid managed care specialists have been among the most aggressive exchange competitors in terms of pricing. This group — not the start-up ObamaCare co-ops that are dropping like flies — looks likes the real threat to a profitable ObamaCare exchange presence for the biggest insurers, including UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM).
"
725,UNH,"Last week, UnitedHealth shook up the entire sector with its warning that it may abandon the exchanges in 2017 if it keeps bleeding red ink in the coming year.
"
726,UNH,"If it wanted to, the Obama administration could modify regulations to require silver plans to cover at least 70% of group costs, though it may be leery of taking steps that will lead to bigger premium hikes (before subsidies) in 2017, particularly since those will become evident by the time voters go to the polls in 2016.
"

"
728,UNH,"Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.The Department of Health and Human Services on Friday gave a green light to an aggressive new ObamaCare exchange pricing strategy that relies on huge silver-plan deductibles and results in smaller government subsidies.This is likely good news for Centene (CNC), which could see big enrollment gains in 2016 because its Ambetter affiliate managed to significantly underprice competitors in a number of major markets by attaching deductibles as high as $6,500 to silver plans. But it's bad news for modest- to moderate-income customers buying coverage in some Ambetter markets like Miami, Atlanta and Jackson, Miss., which will face the highest after-subsidy premiums in the country in 2016.Many Bronze Premiums SpikeThe cheapest bronze plan available in 2016 in those three cities will cost about $2,220, or $185 a month, for 27-year-olds earning about $30,000, just over 250% of the poverty level. That's 21% more than the average $152-per-month cost of the cheapest bronze plan found by IBD in a review of the largest market in each of the 37 states using HealthCare.gov.Paying the individual mandate penalty of $695 — less than one-third of the cost of the cheapest, $6,800-deductible bronze plan in those Centene-Ambetter markets — may look like the best option.Although ObamaCare is already struggling to attract relatively young and healthy customers, and Centene's pricing strategy will make it even harder to do so, HHS said it has no plans to add new restrictions to the type of policies an insurer can offer.While the Obama administration plans to create a standard silver plan that will have a $3,500 deductible, and it will aim to highlight that option for customers, that won't do anything to address the real threat: smaller subsidies.Silver Deductibles Deduct From SubsidiesThat's because the size of exchange subsidies depends on the price of the second-cheapest silver plan in each market. Largely because two Ambetter plans are priced so low in its markets — with a $6,500 deductible for the cheapest silver plan and a $5,500 deductible for the second-lowest-cost plan — the subsidy available to 27-year-olds earning about $30,000 in Jackson will fall from $757 in 2015 to $439 in 2016.The pricing shift in Jackson has been especially dramatic. In 2015, the second-lowest-cost silver plan cost 35% more than the cheapest bronze, but the gap has narrowed to just 13% in 2016.One key reason is that Ambetter's cheapest silver plans cover only about 68% of eligible expenses of the insured group, not too far above the typical 60% covered by bronze plans. The standardized silver-plan option HHS envisions would cover 71% of group costs.Centene also may be pricing in somewhat smaller bills among customers attracted by its lower-premium, high-deductible plans. Customers who choose Ambetter's $6,500 deductible plan in Indianapolis will get limited benefits before the deductible is met, such as primary-care visits at a cost of $30, specialist visits for $60 and generic drugs for $15, along with free preventative care such as vaccines. But big-ticket items like diagnostic testing, MRIs, specialty drugs, emergency-room visits and surgical procedures aren't covered until after a patient racks up $6,500 in in-network bills.Silver plans are the most common exchange selection because customers with incomes up to 250% of the poverty level are eligible for extra subsidies that lower out-of-pocket costs.Even with these extra cost-sharing subsidies, people earning from 201% to 250% of the poverty level would face a $4,500 deductible under the cheapest Ambetter silver plan.After its $6.8 billion merger with HealthNet (HNT), Centene will have about 500,000 individual market customers in 14 markets.Medicaid Insurers Expand In ExchangesAlong with Centene, Molina HealthCare (MOH), CareSource and other Medicaid managed care specialists have been among the most aggressive exchange competitors in terms of pricing. This group — not the start-up ObamaCare co-ops that are dropping like flies — looks likes the real threat to a profitable ObamaCare exchange presence for the biggest insurers, including UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM).Last week, UnitedHealth shook up the entire sector with its warning that it may abandon the exchanges in 2017 if it keeps bleeding red ink in the coming year.If it wanted to, the Obama administration could modify regulations to require silver plans to cover at least 70% of group costs, though it may be leery of taking steps that will lead to bigger premium hikes (before subsidies) in 2017, particularly since those will become evident by the time voters go to the polls in 2016.HHS also detailed key ObamaCare parameters for 2017 on Friday, including a maximum $7,150 bronze-plan deductible.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.

729,UNH,"The Doctor is 'NOT' in....  Just ask United Health Care's  (UNH) CEO - Stephen Helmsley........Obama care has made THEM sick and they are not willing to continue to suffer losses going into 2017........That's right 2017 - because yesterday the company announced a $700 mil loss in the exchange business for 2015 - which included an 'advance recognition of losses for 2016'.....this announcement caused them to cut 2015 earnings projections to $6/sh...down from $6.35/share.
"
730,UNH,"This announcement does NOT include an expected additional $225 mil in 2016 losses.......as a result - investors took 8% out of the stock at one point yesterday after they heard the news that ""the biggest US health insurer has suffered major losses on policies sold under the affordable care act's (ACA) exchanges and will consider withdrawing from them.....""
"
731,UNH,"Hark - hear the hear the other herald angels sing....AETNA (AET) , Humana (HUM), CIGNA  (CI), Anthem (ANTM) all chiming in singing the same tune.....But insurers that focus on the Medicaid population Molina (MOH)  don't seem to be having that same problem because their low income consumers  are subsidized by the gov't.  As a result - we are now seeing the effects of this poorly designed piece of signature legislation - Anyone seen Nancy Pelosi recently?  Did she ever read the legislation?  Insurers are raising premiums, cutting product offerings and choices of health care providers.... We as consumers are seeing the least desirable 'silver' plans increase rates by 7.5% on avg while the better plans are seeing increases of more than 10%, with higher deductibles and higher co-pays.........and just like ECON 101 taught you.....higher costs discourage buyers (in this case HEALTHY buyers) , which then only drives the costs even higher because the remaining consumers are sicker and need more healthcare....it's a vicious circle.....known as the 'death spiral'.....
"
732,UNH,"Now Republicans were quick  to jump on the bandwagon saying that ""Premiums are up and healthcare is more expensive...the consequences we see from this hastily and conceived legislation were entirely foreseeable and not at all surprising"" .....and as you expected the Democrats - led by Obama were quick to point out that the 'law is working well'.......Hmmm.....Well boys....you can't have it both ways - so which is it....is the ACA  working or not?  By the sounds of it.....CEO Helmsley clearly has a view......maybe the Democrats  need to talk to the insurers and see why the Doctor is NOT in......
"
733,UNH,"And in another move by the healthcare industry.....yesterday brought us news that Pfizer (PFE) is pressing ahead in its fight to save on corporate taxes by getting in bed with Ireland based Allergan (AGN)......putting the gov't and the company on a 'collision course' in what is known as the 'inversion trade'.......and here the Democrats want to prevent a company from 'strategically relocating' to take advantage of a broken US corp tax structure by piling on more regulations and red tape  while the Republicans say that the real problem here is the ""Broken US Corp Tax Structure"" as they call for a complete overhaul of the tax code - thereby eliminating the need or incentive to invert....
"
734,UNH,"Now back to the mkts......the broader mkt showed a lack of direction yesterday after Wednesday's surge......causing the S&P to tease both sides of the unchanged at least 25 times....the lack of any real significant change came as traders/investor took a breath.  The technical underpinnings of the mkt continue to argue that only a few companies continue to dominate the major indexes, while so many continue to drag....While the biggest companies with the largest capitalizations have pushed the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq closer to their annual highs.....the broader indexes like the Wilshire 5000 and the Russell 2000 are still struggling.
"
735,UNH,"(The Wilshire 5000 - a total mkt index that measure the performance of all US stocks with 'readily available price data'.  But most people do not follow or even know what the Wilshire 5000 is.....because the media only talks about the Dow, the S&P and the Nasdaq, which are heavily weighted with large cap companies....that the average investors knows....  In fact the Wilshire 5000 is a much truer measure of the real health of the US economy as a whole.... I'm just sayin....) From a short term basis, the market is trying to work off last week’s sharp selloff and so far it appears to be doing just that......We need to continue to watch what crude oil prices do....Crude is now trading at $41/barrel....it needs to hold here.... A rally in oil will certainly help support the mkt but that is still a difficult call given the fundamentals and the strengthening dollar.....but it IS in a short-term oversold condition - so a bounce would not be out of the question......causing bargain hunters to go on a shopping spree.
"
736,UNH,"Overnight - the Asian mkts finished the week strong... Japan +0.1%, Hong Kong + 1.13%, China + 0.37% and ASX +0.26%. In Europe - mkts are churning.....even as Draghi hints at more stimulus......The Mali hostage crisis this morning is raising concerns over global security..... causing the focus to once again turn to ISIS and the recent events in France.  In the end - the mkts need to digest the action of late as we move into the weekend.  FTSE +0.12%, CAC 40 -0.13%, DAX +0.3%, EUROSTOXX -0.01%, SPAIN -0.5% AND ITALY -0.6%.  US Futures are pointing higher.....currently +5 pts.....but keeping us still within the 2065/2100 trading range.  We will get another load of FED speakers today.....St Louis FED Pres Bullard and NY's Dudley - both speaking on the economy......and you can believe that they will hammer home the message of 'normalization' coming to a theater near you in December.  On the eco front - look for reports form the Kansas City FED......survey says 0.  Take good care    Kp

784,UNH,"ObamaCare exchange enrollment sank by more than 300,000, or about 8%, from the end of June through September, eight big insurers disclosed in third-quarter earnings reports.
"
785,UNH,"On Friday, Humana (HUM) helped fill out the picture, reporting that it lost 61,800 exchange customers, or 9.2% out of the 671,400 total at the end of Q2.
"
786,UNH,"These eight big insurers, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Aetna (AET), accounted for just under 40% of national exchange enrollment in June. Their results suggest that national enrollment has continued to sink from 9.9 million at the end of June to perhaps 9.5 million or lower at present. A drop below 9 million by year-end looks like a good bet based on the decline during last year's fourth quarter.
"
787,UNH,"ACASignups.net, which compiled the data, noted that if national enrollment fell in Q3 at the same rate as it did for this group of insurers, it would have dropped to about 9.2 million at the end of September, but the actual decline was probably more modest. Charles Gaba, who runs the enrollment-tracking site, also posted data from a small sample of states that saw roughly flat enrollment in Q3, while exchange membership jumped in Massachusetts, which has no cut-off date for signing up.
"
788,UNH,"Molina Healthcare (MOH) saw ObamaCare marketplace membership sink from 261,000 to 226,000 during the quarter. The 13.4% drop was the biggest on a percentage basis among the eight publicly traded insurers. Still, Molina is feeling pretty positive after having just 15,000 members at the end of 2014.
"
789,UNH,"Aetna saw enrollment slide just over 11%, from about 920,000 to 815,000. Anthem (ANTM) saw enrollment fall by 69,000, or 7.7%, to 824,000. Exchange customers at Centene (CNC) fell 7%, from 167,400 to 155,600. UnitedHealth Group saw a relatively tame decline of less than 2%, from about 550,000 to 540,000.
"
790,UNH,"HealthNet (HNT) said its ObamaCare-plan customers fell from 350,000 to 334,000 in the quarter, a 4.6% decline, but that includes off-exchange customers, which make up about one-fourth of the total. Cigna (CI) saw individual market enrollment slip 3.6%, from 223,000 to 215,000, but it didn't disclose how many of those are in exchange, off-exchange or grandfathered plans.
"
791,UNH,"Low enrollment is a concern for ObamaCare because the exchanges are having trouble getting enough young adults to balance out the risk of a customer base that has higher medical costs than expected. Humana noted a ""deterioration in claims experience"" in the past quarter. UnitedHealth also noted higher medical use in the quarter, but said that ""strong price increases"" should lead to better performance in 2016.
"
792,UNH,"The big drop from 11.7 million signups to 10.2 million paying customers at the end of March highlighted concerns about the affordability of the subsidized plans, particularly high-deductible bronze. Enrollment declines in the third quarter may not be as worrisome because they may result from people getting employer coverage or turning 65, for example.
"

"
796,UNH,"ObamaCare's rules let many people skip their final payment of the year without consequence. Under ObamaCare's 90-day grace period, insurers must pay all claims for an enrollee for the first month after a payment due date is missed. For policyholders who aren't close to meeting their deductible, there isn't any risk in waiting to pay their December bill and doing so only if they have a costly medical emergency during the month.
"
797,UNH,"The other factor that could lead people to take a free ride in December is that many of the low-cost policies on various state exchanges have seen significant price hikes, while other competitors have taken over as the lowest-cost provider. As a result, people shopping for bargains may consider switching plans and leaving their old provider in the lurch for December.
"
798,UNH,"Enrollment in 2016 is likely to be a different story. Many modest income households may find that paying the minimum $695 per-adult penalty for going uncovered will be nearly as expensive as the cheapest bronze plan — if not more so.

946,UNH,"Anthem (ANTM) will announce a deal to buy Cigna (CI) for about $48 billion, or $187 a share as soon as Thursday, according to a variety of reports. Along with other mergers, the managed care industry on the road to shrinking to three giants from five today — if they pass antitrust musterCigna, which fell a fraction to 151.07 on Wednesday, rose to about 162 in after-hours trading as reports of an imminent deal came out. Cigna hit a record 170.68 on June 26.Anthem, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in many states, has been trying to buy Cigna for weeks. On June 20, it made a hostile bid of about $184. Apparently key questions over who would run the combined entity have been resolved.Anthem-Cigna would be larger than current No. 1, UnitedHealth Group (UNH).Meanwhile, Aetna (AET) reached a deal to buy Humana (HUM) for $35 billion earlier this month.There are other notable managed care firms. A day before the Aetna-Humana announcement, mid-sized insurers Centene (CNC) said it would acquire Health Net (HNT) for $6.3 billion.Still, the number of health insurance giants could fall to three — UnitedHealth, Anthem and Aetna — in the near future.That is, if antitrust regulators allow the takeovers to go forward. Investors aren't so sure. Humana is trading at a significant discount to Aetna's offer, while the spread has widened on the Centene-Health Net deal. Cigna's relatively modest rise late Wednesday also may indicate market doubt that the deals will get down.On the one hand, a handful of big insurers may have more market power to raise premiums or limit benefits. But they also could drive harder bargains with hospitals and drugmakers, helping consumers.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

948,UNH,"As consolidation fever grips the managed care industry, Molina Healthcare (MOH) prefers to ""stick to our knitting,"" as chief financial officer John Molina likes to say.Its knitting since its founding in 1980 by Molina's father, David Molina, has revolved around the health care needs of low-income people who face barriers to care.Based in Long Beach, Calif., not far from where it was founded, Molina operates health plans in 11 states and Puerto Rico, most of them managed-care Medicaid programs for low-income and needy populations.If the pending merger of Centene (CNC) and Health Net (HNT) goes through, Molina would be ""the purest of the pure plays"" in Medicaid managed care and, more broadly, government-aided programs for low-income populations, Molina said in an interview with IBD.""We don't want to get into the broad commercial business. We don't want to take care of Medicare retirees who play golf three times a week,"" he said.Managed-Care MedicaidAs it happens, the managed-care Medicaid market is the fastest growing segment of the managed care industry, says Brian Wright, an analyst with Sterne Agee CRT.""About 28% of all Medicaid expenditures are in managed-care Medicaid,"" he said. ""Our view is that this is a market that can triple from where it is (today).""Molina is benefiting from that growth as states shift Medicaid patients to managed care programs. It also has gained business from state exchanges under ObamaCare, covering the ""lowest income levels,"" says Wright.Molina's largest number of members are in California, Washington, Florida, Ohio and Texas.In April, Molina added Puerto Rico to its roster, covering around 350,000 members for more than 3.3 million in total. It's currently bidding for new business in Iowa and Georgia. But the company is also looking to grow in existing markets such as Florida and Texas.""We're hiring folks. We're expanding. At the same time, we're sticking to the core business dad put us into 35 years ago,"" Molina said.The company is still a family business of sorts. Molina's older brother, Mario Molina, is the CEO; his sister, Martha Molina Bernadett, is an executive vice president. Both are physicians. ""I went to law school and became the numbers guy,"" Molina said.Through various trusts, the Molina family owns a 25%-30% stake in the company, Molina says. The company went public in 2003.New contract wins and privatization of Medicaid programs will continue to drive Molina's top-line growth, says Ana Gupte, an analyst with Leerink Partners.Revenue has grown around 26% on a compounded annual rate over the last two years. But growth has picked up sharply this year. In the first quarter, revenue jumped 53% over the earlier year to $3.2 billion. Enrollment grew 38% across all its health plans.Its Florida health plan alone added 185,000 federally subsidized exchange members in the quarter, resulting in a tripling of premium revenue over the prior year.Earnings per share in the quarter soared to 56 cents a share from 10 cents. Second-quarter results will be released on July 30.Economies Of ScaleAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that Molina's revenue for all of 2015 will jump 49% over last year to $14.4 billion, slightly above Molina's forecast for $14.3 billion. They see earnings rising 99% to $2.59 per share.""We have the lowest (general and) administrative costs in the managed care industry,"" said Molina, noting that it's around 8% of revenue compared to the average 12% to 15%. The company forecasts a 7.6% ratio for the full year.Even though it's a relatively small managed-care player compared with UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Anthem (ANTM) and Aetna (AET), which plans to acquire Humana (HUM), ""scale and critical mass give it leverage to improve fixed costs,"" Gupte said.Rather than drive costs down through a merger, Molina seems more intent on improving net profit margin to 2% from less than 1% by increasing revenue on its own. It raised around $400 million in a secondary equity offering in June and has since announced three small acquisitions for putting that capital to work.The three are in Florida, Michigan and Illinois, states where it already has business.Molina's scale in local markets is viewed as more crucial by some than scale across state borders. ""The benefits of scale (through mergers) have been greatly exaggerated in this industry,"" Wright said. ""You have to have local market share. There are plenty of quite successful (companies) of smaller scale such as Molina. It's growing nicely organically. I think it has enough scale in the Medicaid business in its major markets to compete quite effectively.""Analysts have speculated that Molina might indeed get swept up in merger mania, though. Much of the speculation has centered on a combination with WellCare Health Plans (WCG) . Molina wouldn't comment as a matter of policy.But Molina did offer an argument against a merger: ""There is a notion people have that being larger is beneficial. Medicaid is in some respects unique because it is one state at a time. You don't do Medicaid across three states at once, so economies of scale are a little different.""Wright doesn't rule out a potential merger. But he doesn't think Molina ""needs to be bought.""""I think there are plenty of people interested in buying it,"" he said. ""The question is, at what price? The issue with price is that people don't want to pay what its value will be three years down the line. Potential acquirers have vastly underappreciated the growth of the company and the Medicaid business in general.""

The Nasdaq jumped 1.4% while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 1.2% each. Lower volume on both exchanges somewhat dampened the bullish mood.The Nasdaq index is looking back up at 5000 in the stock market today. The price level has acted like a magnet since the Nasdaq made contact in March for the first time in 15 years. Since then, the composite index has stayed within 3.5% above or below 5000.The market showed little reaction to the latest comments from Yellen that largely reiterated her stance from the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the minutes from which were released Wednesday.Apple (AAPL) and UnitedHealth (UNH) were the top performers from the Dow, up more than 2% each. Apple stock is bouncing off support near its 200-day moving average. After a failed breakout attempt in April, Apple will need more time to carve out a new pattern. The stock has faced heavy selling in recent weeks amid headlines of poor Apple Watch sales. Shares have a worst possible Accumulation/Distribution Rating of E.UnitedHealth Group broke out past a 123.86 flat-base buy point on June 26. Shares quickly retreated, but have found support at the 50-day moving average. UnitedHealth is less than 2% off an all-time high.Leading chip stocks were trying to bounce back Friday after coming under fire in recent weeks. Avago Technologies (AVGO) added 3% while Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) jumped nearly 5%. Both stocks remain under their 50-day moving averages and recent buy points.

"
1001,UNH,"The stock market today carries a bit less weight on its shoulders after the S&P 500 decisively punched past its 50-day moving average and the Nasdaq gained more altitude above that important line of support on Wednesday.
"
1002,UNH,"Investors drew confidence after minutes from the Fed's Oct. 28 meeting showed a majority of the Federal Open Market Committee in favor of a rate hike in December. Apple (AAPL) also factored into the day's gains, gapping up to a better-than-3% gain after an upgrade from Goldman Sachs.

1003,UNH,"The current uptrend still bears a heavy load of distribution days: six on the Nasdaq, five on the S&P 500. That is good cause to keep a cautious stance toward new purchases or stocks flashing sell signals.

1020,UNH,"The current list of IBD Big Cap 20 features more stocks that are relatively old than relatively new. That's not a big surprise. After all, it takes years, if not decades, for even a fast-growing company to achieve the earnings, sales and size of a large cap within the U.S. equity market. IBD defines a large cap for this screen as $15 billion in market value or higher.
"
1021,UNH,"The surprise found within the Big Cap 20 lies in how numerous companies have come back from truly severe declines.

"
1030,UNH,"In July that year, the stock cleared a properly formed flat base near its 52-week high and eventually took out its 2007 peak. The stock corrected again from 2011 to the summer of 2013, then broke out again at 38.14 in the week ended Sept. 6, 2013. Another long digestion of gains led to a fresh breakout past a new 51.48 buy point last year.

1300,UNH,"Stocks lost their grip on most of the day's gains Thursday as the indexes headed into the final hour of trade. The Nasdaq was up 0.3%, after being up 1.5% at midday. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average held pops of 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Volume in the stock market today was running much slower than the previous session.Among widely held issues, AT&T (T) thrust about 2% higher in volume 55% above average. While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are down about 10% and 8% respectively so far this year, AT&T has held steady with a 1% gain.AT&T's dividend might be part of the reason. In an ugly market, dividend stocks start looking good to some investors. AT&T has increased its dividend for 32 consecutive years. The current annualized yield is 5.6%.The stock price, though, has been rangebound for more than two years. AT&T stock has found repeated resistance at the 36-37 area and support at the 31-32 level. The stock is trading just under 35.In the IBD 50, a list of stocks with the best ratings via fundamentals and technicals, Carter's (CRI) gained 1% in volume a third faster than normal. The marketer of clothes for babies and children is working on a stage-two base. However, the stock needs to do more work on the right side. Carter's is 17% off its high.A stage-two base means the stock is forming its second consolidation since starting an advance. Breakouts from the first two consolidations are more likely to work than those from a later stage.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, coal and oil stocks grabbed the biggest gains. Funeral Services and book stocks took the hardest hits.Follow Paul Whitfield on Twitter @IBD_PWhitfield.

1334,UNH,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is expected to produce its best performance in years when it reports first-quarter results Thursday, while its stock price continues to trade near record highs following a major acquisition at the end of March.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the nation's No. 1 health insurer to post Q1 earnings of $1.34 a share, up 22% from the prior year. If that holds up, it would be the biggest gain since the third quarter of 2012.Revenue is seen rising 9% to $34.6 billion, which would be the biggest top-line increase since the September 2013 quarter.In Q4 2014, UnitedHealth topped sales and earnings views, as its Optum Health Services platform delivered a 23% revenue gain. Optum includes a managed care business, a software and consulting unit, and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) provider.The PBM unit, OptumRx, will get a lot bigger when UnitedHealth closes its $12 billion acquisition of Catamaran (CTRX), which was announced on March 30. The deal is expected to close during the fourth quarter.The merged entity will serve 65 million customers — nearly twice the 35 million that Catamaran currently serves. That should give UnitedHealth's PBM business the kind of scale and bargaining power to land better deals on drugs, analysts say.""The combination of the two entities will take the total annual prescriptions filled to nearly 1 billion and make it the third largest player in the industry with a market share of around 20%,"" Trefis analysts noted in a recent report.In comparison, the report said, ""CVS Health (CVS) and Express Scripts (ESRX), which together control more than 50% of the PBM market, filled around 1 billion prescriptions each in 2014.""Trefis says OptumRx was the fastest-growing business in the entire Optum division in 2014: ""OptumRx revenues have almost doubled since 2010, and there was improvement in the bottom line as well. This is exhibited by the fact that EBITDA margins improved from under 3% in 2011 to 4.4% in 2014.""UnitedHealth has an IBD Composite Rating of 92.

1340,UNH,"The Big Cap 20 is showing itself to be a good representation of today's market leadership, as technology, health care and consumer stocks dominate the list.A glance of the IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables shows chips, medical, apparel, retail and other technology sectors make up most of the top 10 sectors. That's a fitting reflection of what you find in the Big Cap 20. Most of the 20 stocks can be categorized in one of those areas.In technology, a couple of chipmakers rank among the leading big caps, along with some business-service tech companies.Analog Devices (ADI) is one of the more interesting charts. The stock broke out of a cup-shaped base on Feb. 17 and has risen 3% from that entry.The chipmaker earned 63 cents a share excluding items for the January-ended quarter, beating expectations. Sales rose 23%, as the top line continued an accelerating trend of growth.Analysts noted strength in its industrial and automotive markets.Apple (AAPL), a tech leader that could be viewed as a consumer stock too, is another high-tech stock that's found a home in the Big Cap 20. The stock is near new highs, extended from its breakout past 119.85 last month.In the medical sector, drugmakers Biogen Idec (BIIB), Pharmacyclics (PCYC) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) have rallied in recent weeks and account for some of the best percentage gains in the Big Cap 20 over the past couple of weeks.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Cigna (CI) are part of a broad rally in HMO stocks.While those medical leaders are extended, Mylan (MYL) is setting up in a base with a 59.70 buy point.However, its shares fell moderately after the close Monday, when the company reported Q4 earnings of $1.05 a share, an increase of 35%. Sales rose 18% to $2.08 billion.Mylan forecast 2015 revenues of $9.6 billion to $10.1 billion.In consumer stocks, the big cap leaders run the gamut of auto-parts chain O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Starbucks (SBUX) and discount retailer Ross Stores (ROST).Ross Stores shined Friday as its earnings report sent shares gapping up to a 7% gain and a record high.For the first two months of 2015, the Big Cap 20 has acquitted itself quite satisfactorily. It rose 6.9%, far better than the 2.2% gain for the S&P 500, which is a broad gauge of big-capitalization stocks.Qorvo (QRVO) may be an unfamiliar name on a list filled with familiar brands.

1414,UNH,"With the market in a confirmed uptrend, most stocks should advance. But investors should look for the true market leaders, such as Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).IBD's Screen of the Day, Bolting RS Lines, separates the wheat from the chaff. It focuses on top-rated companies whose relative strength lines are rising to new highs. A rising RS line means the stock is outpacing the benchmark S&P; 500 index.Skyworks has advanced for the past six sessions, rising 2% Monday to a new closing high of 82.48 on the stock market today. Even more impressive, Skyworks has reported nine straight quarters of accelerating earnings per share growth, including last week's Q1 2015 gain of 88%. Sales growth has picked up for four straight quarters.Skyworks shares have been on a tear since finding support just above its 200-day moving average on Oct. 10. Its RS line has been hitting new highs since early November.Skyworks makes radio frequency chips used in the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy GS5 as well as many other wireless devices and in other industries. Apple reports earnings Tuesday night, with analysts raising iPhone 6 sales targets.Centene (CNC) is a leading health insurer, focusing on Medicaid programs. It's benefited from the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion as well as winning more state Medicaid contracts.Centene said Monday it will buy Oregon-based Agate Resources , which provides some Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and ObamaCare exchange coverage in the state.Q4 earnings likely doubled (101%) in Centene's next report due in early February, accelerating from the prior quarter's 37% advance. Centene shares cleared a short consolidation base last week, hitting a record intraday high on Friday. Its RS line hit a new high ahead of the stock, a bullish sign.Shares rose 1.2% to 111.80 on Monday, a new closing high.Several other health insurers are on the Bolting RS Lines screen — though not in the top 5 — including UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Cigna (CI). UnitedHealth earnings beat estimates last week as medical costs remained tame.Next on the Bolting RS Lines' top 5 is Qorvo (QRVO), another RF chipmaker. The name may not be familiar, but it's forged from the recent merger of RF Micro Devices and Triquint Semiconductor. The Apple iPhone 6 also boasts Qorvo chips. Qorvo rose to a new high Friday after clearing a 3-week consolidation following a rapid ascent. Qorvo stock fell a fraction Monday.Rounding out the top five are Electronic Arts (EA) and Alaska Air Group (ALK). Alaska is one of three airline stocks on the Bolting RS Lines screen, along with Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Delta Air Lines (DAL).Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

1439,UNH," Medicaid-focused managed-care firm Centene is having its moment as states turn over Medicaid patients to managed-care firms.St. Louis-based Centene (CNC) has been expanding in Florida and Mississippi, and may get a lot bigger in Illinois next year.It already gets a big slice of Medicaid business from Texas.And Texas will likely hand over more business to Centene next year for a new pilot program for low-income ""dual eligibles"" — those on Medicare and Medicaid.Besides Texas, it could get new business from Michigan and South Carolina as they phase in similar programs, analysts say.""There's never been a better time to be in the Medicaid business,"" said Brian Wright, an analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach. ""You have a broader backdrop of states transitioning their higher-cost Medicaid populations into managed care.""Health-care reform has also been a positive for Centene, Wright says. ""Even in non-expansion states, we have seen growth in the overall Medicaid population because of awareness of those benefits becoming available,"" he said.Year For New EnrollmentsIn January, Centene began serving enrollees in health-insurance marketplaces in nine states.Centene's Medicaid business at the end of June covered 3.16 million members in 20 states, 23% more members than a year earlier.Centene took in $3.7 billion in revenue in the second quarter, up 49% from the year-ago period. More than 75% of its membership during the quarter was Medicaid-related.Earnings rose 11% to 79 cents a share, despite higher costs associated with health reform and chronically ill cases.Revenue growth was due to a myriad of factors, the company said. It ticked off a list that included expansion in Florida, new business from a specialty pharma acquisition, a new contract in California, expansion in Ohio and health-insurance exchanges.As Centene has been on the move, so has its stock, which is up 40% this year.""The stock has gone up because they have executed well,"" said David Windley, an analyst with Jefferies. ""We have been cautious about the magnitude of the new business they've been adding in 2014. But so far, that caution has been unfounded.""Centene's strong second quarter was in stark contrast to WellCare Health Plans (WCG), which reported an unexpected seven-cent per-share loss and lowered its forecast for the year.Analysts blame WellCare's weak showing on company-specific issues such as recent management changes at the top.""Management changes can be very disruptive,"" said analyst Joseph France of Cantor Fitzgerald.Centene's management team is ""more experienced,"" he said. ""They have expanded rapidly into new markets without the disruptions we've seen at WellCare.""Centene was recently named Cantor Fitzgerald's ""top pick"" in managed care for 2014. Not only were Centene's Q2 results better than expected, ""we look for further upside as it rolls out in new markets over the next 12-18 months,"" France said in an August 25 note that singled out Centene.He says that Centene will likely become more involved in Illinois next year as the state expands its Medicaid population to put around half of total enrollees under managed care.Florida's Hot In Health CareFlorida's expanded Medicaid program will have an especially significant impact on Centene as it nearly doubles the number of Medicaid members in managed care this year, Wright says.That expansion about doubles Centene's revenue in Florida on an annual basis to over $1.5 billion, Wright says. ""It showed up a little in the second quarter, but you'll get more of an impact in the third quarter,"" he said.If Indiana further expands its Medicaid population into managed care, as it's considering, Centene could benefit there, too, Wright says. Centene already handles 200,500 members in Indiana.Texas is Centene's biggest state by far, accounting for 921,500 members as of June 30, or 29% of its total membership.Georgia was the next largest, with 373,000, followed by Florida, with 313,800. But unlike Georgia's modest growth, Florida's number was up 45% from a year earlier — and still growing over the summer.Texas has largely finished transitioning into managed care, Wright says. But next year's dual-eligible pilot will offer managed care firms new opportunities. Centene is a likely beneficiary since it has the largest share in managed care in Texas, Wright adds.Complex Conditions CoverageCentene has also been finding new revenue streams through acquisitions. Most notably was last year's buy of specialty pharma company AcariaHealth. AcariaHealth focuses on complex conditions and distributes high-cost medications such as hepatitis C drugs.AcariaHealth was largely why Centene's service revenue went from a little more than $100 million a quarter to more than $400 million a quarter, Wright says.Early this year, Centene bought a majority interest in U.S. Medical Management, an in-home health services firm focused on seriously ill patients. Centene said that the deal would add between $220 million and $240 million in annual revenue and two to five cents EPS in 2014, then 20-25 cents in 2015.A transaction in July with Community Health Solutions of America added around 200,000 Medicaid lives in Louisiana, noted France.For 2014, Centene expects revenue of $15 billion to $15.5 billion and per-share earnings of $3.70-$3.90. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast $16.2 billion in revenue, a 49% jump over 2013. They see earnings rising 33% to $3.83.Centene is the top-rated company in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, with the highest-possible Composite Rating of 99. Another big Medicaid player, Molina Healthcare (MOH), has a 73. Several highly rated managed-care names are more diversified. Aetna (AET) has a 94 rating, Cigna (CI) an 89 and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) an 86.

1464,UNH,"Monthly premiums for stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plans will likely fall next year as a number of sponsors consolidate offerings into lower-cost plans, according to a study released Monday by Avalere Health.After analyzing data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the health care advisory firm estimated that average premiums would fall by 2% to $38.95, from $39.88 in 2014.As premiums decline, Avalere warns, Medicare Part D sponsors ""may be shifting more cost-sharing responsibilities to beneficiaries."" For example, the proportion of prescription drug plans with zero deductibles in 2015 will drop to 42% from 47% in 2014.In addition, Part D sponsors ""continue to move away"" from offering coverage in the drug-coverage gap, or donut hole, as the Affordable Care Act gradually closes the gap. Some 74% of such plans will not offer coverage of drugs in the gap next year, Avalere said.""While beneficiaries will welcome lower premiums, they will need to look at other facets of benefit design, including how their medications are covered, cost-sharing responsibilities and total out-of-pocket spending,"" stated Christine Harhaj, senior manager at Avalere.Avalere noted a wide variance among the top plans. For example, a consolidated plan from Aetna (AET), called Aetna Medicare Rx Saver, will reduce premiums by 31% to $24.46, while WellCare Health's (WCG) Classic plan will go up by 52% to $31.46.The two most expensive plans are Humana (HUM) Enhanced at $52.81, up 11% from 2014, and the AARP MedicareRx Preferred from UnitedHealth (UNH) at $50.15, up 16% over 2014, Avalere said. The latter plan is also the largest by number of enrollments, at nearly 3.8 million.Humana also has among two of the lowest-priced 2015 plans: the Humana Preferred Rx Plan at $26.40 and Humana's Wal-Mart (WMT) Rx Plan at $15.67.The second largest plan by enrollment (at nearly 2.5 million), SilverScript Choice, will see average premiums fall by 21% in 2015 to $23.16, Avalere said. SilverScript Choice is offered by SilverScript Insurance, a CVS Caremark company, part of CVS Health (CVS).Another plan from UnitedHealth, the AARP MedicareRx Saver Plus, will have an average premium of $28, Avalere said.As for Medicare Advantage plans, Avalere found that the number of those plans will drop 3% amid continued government reimbursement cutbacks.

1473,UNH,"How do you follow a legend?
"
1474,UNH,"That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.
"
1475,UNH,"Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012. He famously beat the broad stock market as measured by the S&P 500 for 15 years in a row — from 1991 to 2005.
"
1476,UNH,"Miller's winning streak came to an end. Peters joined as co-manager in late 2010 and took the lead in April 2012.
"
1477,UNH,"Peters has made progress in returning Value to the apex among top mutual funds. The fund beat 24% of its large-cap blend peers in 2011, 46% in 2013 and is ahead of 83% this year through July 31, says Morningstar Inc.
"
1478,UNH,"The fund changed its brand name from Legg Mason on March 1.
"
1479,UNH,"Peters, 45, discussed his investment approach from his office overlooking Baltimore Inner Harbor.
"
1480,UNH,"IBD: Is the crux of your strategy the pursuit of mispriced stocks?
"
1481,UNH,"Peters: We look at traditional growth stocks and traditional value stocks. We go up and down the quality spectrum. We try to come up with a reasonable range of business values (for a stock) under future scenarios. I'm a valuation manager. But the real expertise is looking at stocks and free cash flow analysis, then over time figuring out what powers a stock's return and finding those with a price-to-value gap.
"
1482,UNH,"IBD: Many people say no one can do that consistently for long periods.
"
1483,UNH,"Peters: Any time you're an active manager, you have to take a humble approach. The market's tough to beat. Once an analyst comes to me with a stock whose valuation is 60 or 70 or 80 cents to the dollar, I ask what is the market getting wrong? I look for things that strengthen or weaken the investment case. I look for reasons why the market's expectations are wrong. Most of the time, it is not wrong. We look at hundreds of stocks to find a few where the market is wrong.
"
1484,UNH,"IBD: How come you don't end up with a lot of broken stocks?
"
1485,UNH,"Peters: I don't want Frankenstein. I want the most diversification I can get in a concentrated portfolio — I own only 40 to 50 names — but I don't want to pay for it. We've got to be disciplined. It takes time for (mispriced stocks') price and value to converge. That's why our average holding period is three-plus years.
"
1486,UNH,"IBD: How does your approach differ from Bill Miller's?
"
1487,UNH,"Peters: I became co-manager in November 2010. He was a good coach. I started changing some things. He encouraged me. I like to cast my net wider, for example. We were very underweight in health care when I came on board. And I have a health care stocks background. So we went from 4% underweight (vs. the S&P 500) to about 6% overweight. I cut some financials and housing stock to do that. I also sold some tech names.
"
1488,UNH,"We're overweight energy. We weren't when I came on board. We're very overweight financials now and we're overweight tech. Health care peaked at 6% overweight earlier this year.
"
1489,UNH,"IBD: For people who may not know, what is your health care background?
"
1490,UNH,"Peters: I managed the global health care team at Fidelity and managed Fidelity Select Health Care and Select Medical Equipment funds from January 2004 to April 2005.
"
1491,UNH,"IBD: How else does your approach differ from Miller's?
"
1492,UNH,"Peters: Take breadth. Let's say there are 10 great price gap stocks. If two are home runs you can hit out of the park, Bill will concentrate on those. I'll take more names, even if there's less upside. I'll add four or five nice valuation bets and diversify the fund more.
"
1493,UNH,"IBD: Is the purpose of added diversification to cut volatility?
"
1494,UNH,"Peters: It's not necessarily to make the fund less volatile. But the result is that it is less volatile over time.
"
1495,UNH,"IBD: What's your biggest bet?
"
1496,UNH,"Peters: I'll answer that this way. My biggest overweight is a bet on higher interest rates. That's moved against me year-to-date, but I'm still ahead of the market.
"
1497,UNH,"IBD: Do you still pick Miller's brain?
"
1498,UNH,"Peters: He's been my biggest mentor. Always will be. We are very close friends. I have the utmost respect for him.
"
1499,UNH,"He was relieved when I charted my own course. That contrarian streak in buying negative price momentum and being differentiated, that got reinforced by and I learned a lot from Bill. I learned about being intellectually diverse, reading widely, talking with people, not being dogmatic, all from Bill. Yet it allowed me to be different from Bill.
"
1500,UNH,"We talk investing, but we rarely talk individual names.
"
1501,UNH,"Bill is a huge contrarian (too). We share that common DNA, and he pushed me to really think for myself and look at the facts, which is essential if you are going to have a contrarian approach. Be contrary to opinions and not facts.
"
1502,UNH,"IBD: How much skin do you have in the game?
"
1503,UNH,"Peters: I'm one of the larger shareholders in the fund, which is how it should be. It's the largest chunk of my net worth. My SEC disclosure has me over the $1 million mark. When I get bonuses, I add to the fund. I am the largest individual shareholder in the fund, though some institutional shareholders have more.
"
1504,UNH,"IBD: Your June disclosure shows your stake in Apple (AAPL) jumped to 1.3 million shares from 205,000 as of April 30. Apple had a 7-for-1 split, so did you also trim?
"
1505,UNH,"Peters: Yes, Apple had a split, and I've actually been trimming.
"
1506,UNH,"I typically buy when a negative narrative goes too far. I get excited if the hurdle goes from 4 feet high to an inch high. That was the case with Apple at 400. At 650 it's a tougher case. (Post-split Apple is trading around 95.)
"
1507,UNH,"People are excited about a 6-inch screen (on the iPhone) and a watch that are supposedly coming.
"
1508,UNH,"But Apple is discounting flattish margins. It is discounting some growth. And it's a higher hurdle to jump over. It's not massively overvalued. But it's less interesting than it was.
"
1509,UNH,"IBD: Celgene (CELG) is another recent split, right?
"
1510,UNH,"Peters: It is. This is a classic for us. We got involved before the big biotech run, when it was a value stock. When I joined the fund, health care was in the dumps.
"
1511,UNH,"I love positive price momentum. I just don't want to pay for it. We trimmed before biotech got hit in March. Then when Celgene got sold (by the market) in Q2 we added back when expectations got reset. I think Celgene will be a long-term winner. And we think Celgene will prevail on its Revlimid patents (in its court fight against Natco, which is developing a generic rival for Revlimid).
"
1512,UNH,"IBD: Is fracking the bedrock of your Halliburton (HAL) play?
"
1513,UNH,"Peters: They put straws a mile down into the ground, go out 5,000 feet horizontally, then blow up rock underground to drive more oil up. The more complex those wells are, the better the economics for Halliburton.
"
1514,UNH,"What we noticed about the shale revolution is that rig productivity is doubling every three years, which is amazing. Halliburton is capturing a lot of those efficiencies.
"
1515,UNH,"IBD: Why did you trim Broadcom (BRCM) between April and June?
"
1516,UNH,"Peters: This was classic for us. Broadcom was doing some bad things, throwing huge amounts of money into chasing Qualcomm's (QCOM) monopoly in baseband chips. They made no headway. They diluted their own fundamentals on an uneconomical bet.
"
1517,UNH,"They ended up with the lowest valuation of all large-cap semiconductor stocks. We bought when everyone told us we shouldn't. It was in the high 20s. (Now it's trading in the high 30s.) It was so bad, it was good. We thought they would get pressure from employees, shareholders, their own board to fix things. We felt if they made changes for the better, the stock would go up a lot.
"
1518,UNH,"And last quarter, lo and behold they said 'Uncle.' They stopped chasing Qualcomm's monopoly in baseband. They said they'd give back more to shareholders. Profit margins would go up. So you'll see positive earnings revisions.
"
1519,UNH,"We still think the business value is higher, somewhere in the 40s. Now it has positive momentum. We have a big position. So you'll see us trim a little.
"
1520,UNH,"IBD: Calpine (CPN) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your thesis?
"
1521,UNH,"Peters: We began buying early this year around 19. Late first quarter, early second quarter. They're taking a 12% free cash flow yield, which is extremely high, and buying back a lot of stock. So we got in effect a high tax-efficient yield. In a 2.5% 10-year Treasury world, that's a good way to win.
"
1522,UNH,"We (the U.S.) reward underbuilding utility power supply in the U.S. Especially in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. We're having lots of coal utility retirements. We're not building new nukes (power plants). So power supply is getting tighter. We think this will set up a lot of power pricing volatility. Which is great for Calpine.
"
1523,UNH,"IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is uptrending despite modest EPS results. What's your view?
"
1524,UNH,"Peters: They got hit with negative earnings revisions due to ObamaCare. But the stock was cheap enough to withstand it. Now estimates have stabilized. They have growth in services, growth in their core managed care side. Mixed with low valuation and better earnings as we look into 2015, it will result in a nice stock. A low valuation lets you be timing agnostic.
"
1525,UNH,"IBD: When did Expedia (EXPE) look like a value play to you?
"
1526,UNH,"Peters: We bought it last fall when it stumbled on earnings last summer. It became very cheap.
"
1527,UNH,"I met management in the fall and became comfortable that they had gotten their technology platform in good enough shape to manage pressure from Priceline (PCLN). I felt we should see positive earnings surprises against a lower bar.
"
1528,UNH,"And we think the online travel space is a good cash generator.
"
1529,UNH,"IBD: What do you like about truck and parts maker Paccar (PCAR)?
"
1530,UNH,"Peters: Trucking capacity is getting tight. You can't get drivers. And the (national) fleet is getting old, so it's set for a replacement cycle in a big way. That's building a big fundamental tailwind for Paccar. And they're good about capital allocation.
"
1531,UNH,"IBD: Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) is uptrending, so why do you still like it?
"
1532,UNH,"Peters: They've done a good job turning no top-line growth into bottom-line growth by smart capital allocations. And they're buying back a lot of stock well below its business value.
"
1533,UNH,"They've driven profit margins higher and rationalized their business. Also — and this bothers me a little — people have been looking for domestic plays. Dr Pepper is a North American beverage play unlike Coke (KO) and Pepsi (PEP). Its valuation is getting less attractive. But we're still holding it.
"
1534,UNH,"IBD: What bothers you about investors liking U.S. stocks?
"
1535,UNH,"Peters: We try and find uncrowded games, and the U.S. is seen as the safe zone right now. That may be true, but high investor expectations and crowding make it a risk.
"
1536,UNH,"IBD: Wells Fargo (WFC) has met or topped consensus expectations in recent quarters. What else do you like?
"
1537,UNH,"Peters: They're incredibly well managed. After their last stress test regulators said basically that they can return about 100% of their earnings to shareholders if they want to, which is unprecedented, with Citigroup (C) hanging out at zero. And they're dominant in the mortgage market. Return on equity is well into the double digits. They're selling below business value. And if we get higher interest rates, that's going to be good for large banks and life insurers.How do you follow a legend?That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012.

1545,UNH,"UnitedHealth Group chief executive Stephen Hemsley said Thursday that the insurer would expand into as many as two dozen state health exchanges in 2015.
"

"
1548,UNH,"The nation's largest health insurer said that revenue in the quarter grew 7% over last year to $32.6 billion, driven by government-related gains, especially in Medicaid, and by UnitedHealth's tech-heavy Optum health services, where revenue grew 28% to $11.7 billion.

1573,UNH,"ObamaCare's long shadow is expected to fall on UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as the nation's largest health insurer is expected to see first-quarter earnings fall as the industry at large adjusts to a new regulatory environment.Wall Street analysts expect UnitedHealth, which reports on Thursday before the market opens, to report a 6% drop in earnings per share to $1.09, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. Revenue is forecast to grow 5.4% to almost $32 billion.Though ObamaCare's individual mandate has gone into effect, uncertainty remains about whether the influx of new enrollees under the health insurance overhaul will lead to earnings growth or losses in the long run.The cuts mandated by the Affordable Care Act plus the trimming of the federal budget and reductions to the Medicare Advantage health plan will serve as a drag on the company's earnings in Q1 and in the remaining quarters of 2014, according to Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst at CRT Capital Group.""Even if they beat (estimates) this quarter, I'm not expecting them to increase guidance for the year,"" she said. ""There are some very significant head winds for United this year.""In contrast to WellPoint (WLP), which has taken an aggressive posture in regard to ObamaCare's health exchanges and reports Q1 earnings on April 30, the Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealth has been more conservative in its approach.The unusually severe winter that affected much of the U.S. during Q1 likely led to a modest number of doctor visits for UnitedHealth-insured patients, analysts said.

Gilead was up 3% in morning trading Wednesday, near 75.
"
1590,UNH,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee lifted his 2014 sales estimate to $9.5 billion from his previous $7.4 billion, and added $1.05 to his full-year EPS estimate, now $6.15. He expects Sovaldi sales to hit $11.5 billion next year, with EPS reaching $7.
"
1591,UNH,"Nomura's Ian Somaiya lifted his price target to 130 from 121.

That means it's time to look for stocks breaking out of sound bases.But mutual funds have already been busy in recent months, their buying helping to form the right side of the stock basing patterns.The top-performing funds of the past three months have been big buyers in their latest reporting periods of chipmakers such as Avago Technologies (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Cavium (CAVM).Top-performing sectors recently have been defensive areas, including auto-related issues Lydall (LDL), Meritor (MTOR) and Goodyear Tire & Rubber (GT).Managers of leading funds have continued to add to their transportation holdings Southwest Airlines (LUV), Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE).In other industries, the ubiquitous K-cup coffee giant Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) has garnered big money from top funds.IBD found 59 top-notch funds loading up on Actavis (ACT), investing an estimated $145 million in their latest reporting periods.Two A+ rated funds, $36.3 billion Vanguard Health Care Fund and $5.9 billion Fidelity Select Health Care Portfolio Fund, owned big stakes in the firm.The Ireland-based company makes and distributes generic and branded drugs for hypertension, pain, sleep disorder and contraception. To boost its portfolio of products, especially in their branded-drug area, it made a big purchase earlier this year, buying rival Forest Laboratories in a deal valued at $25 billion.After reaching a 52-week high of 230.77 on Feb. 26, the stock has been etching the right side of a later-stage base. It's currently sitting just 6% off its high.Actavis has been growing earnings at a healthy double-digit pace in at least the past five quarters. Revenue growth has also been robust in the 20% range for the same period.The drug firm's first-quarter earnings shot up 75%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see a 44% rise in profits for the year.Sell SideThe nation's top funds have been unloading managed-care giants Aetna (AET), WellPoint (WLP) and United Healthcare (UNH) in their latest reporting periods.Earnings growth for each of these three firms has been slowing and inconsistent in the past four quarters.

1616,UNH,"Stocks put in a second straight gain Monday, extending a recovery effort from last week's losses. Helped by Apple (AAPL), which won an upgrade from Barclays and a price-target hike at Morgan Stanley, the Nasdaq climbed 0.6%.

1617,UNH,"Even the best companies in an industry have rough patches, and UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) ""recent rough spell"" will likely continue for the next 12 months. So said Sterne Agee analyst Brian Wright Friday in an initiation report on the nation's largest health insurer. He smacked the Minnetonka, Minn.-based company with an ""underperform"" rating. He said UnitedHealth is experiencing commercial pricing…
"
1618,UNH,"As managed-care organization Centene readied its first-quarter report in April, investors were getting very nervous.
"
1619,UNH,"This year brought the first quarter when the managed-care industry faced a new health-insurer fee imposed under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The fee will continue to rise through 2018.
"
1620,UNH,"It was also the first full quarter of sales for Gilead Sciences' (GILD) mega-blockbuster hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. While Sovaldi has far greater efficacy and lower toxicity than the traditional regimen of interferon, the $84,000 price tag for a full round of treatment — combined with the sheer volume of infected patients — led some insurers to grumble that it would break the bank.
"
1621,UNH,"Centene's (CNC) largest competitor, UnitedHealth (UNH), seemed to confirm some of those fears when it reported its Q1 a week before Centene. Its results missed estimates, and one reason it gave was the $100 million in hepatitis C payouts.
"
1622,UNH,"Centene seemed especially vulnerable to a similar impact, given the nature of its user base. Centene's specialty is the Medicaid managed-care business, which it conducts under state contracts. It also has a growing presence in ""correctional health care"" — that is, prisons. Thus its customers are largely poor and/or imprisoned,making them more likely to have hepatitis C.
"
1623,UNH,"Consensus Crushed
"
1624,UNH,"So it came as an enormous relief to Wall Street when Centene came out and crushed the consensus Q1 numbers and raised its full-year outlook. Profit jumped 36% over the year-earlier quarter to 57 cents a share, beating estimates by 14 cents, while revenue rose 37% to $3.46 billion, more than $200 million above the Street's consensus.
"
1625,UNH,"Centene's chief strategy was to be well prepared, especially on the Sovaldi front, says Leerink analyst Ana Gupte.
"
1626,UNH,"""They have been on watch far more than the commercial payers,"" Gupte told IBD. ""They've been trying to make sure they get some public-policy attention (so) they get some support from the broader health-care community with state Medicaid negotiation, so they get the reimbursement that they're seeking.""
"
1627,UNH,"If the state does not put Sovaldi on its preferred formulary — such as in Texas, where Centene does a large amount of business — then Centene just won't pay out. This result has made Sovaldi even more controversial, as some regard it as inhumane to deny people such a superior drug. Centene CEO Michael Neidorff said on the Q1 conference call that the company has to follow state policy, but remarked, ""It is important to note these new therapies are curative; thus it is possible that longer-term savings will be realized from reducing other medical costs associated with hepatitis C.""
"
1628,UNH,"At the same time, Centene has also been playing the other side of the market through the other segment of its business, specialty services. In April last year it acquired AcariaHealth, one of the largest independent specialty pharmacies in the U.S., which also happens to be one of the largest managers of hepatitis C care. That business actually makes more money from the purchase of expensive drugs.
"
1629,UNH,"In his April 16 initiation report on Centene, UBS analyst A.J. Rice cited the specialty business as a key differentiator from Centene's peers.
"
1630,UNH,"""The specialty services complement CNC's core Medicaid Managed Care business, diversify the company's revenue stream, provide higher-quality health outcomes to CNC's membership and others, and assist in controlling costs,"" Rice wrote. ""We believe the company's ability to cross-sell specialty products, including behavioral health, disease management, and pharmacy, has helped CNC to reprocure existing or win new business in the recent years.""
"
1631,UNH,"Centene's rate of new business wins — it has captured 89% of the contracts it has bid on — has especially caught Wall Street's attention and driven its growth. When the company went public in 2001, it was operating in just three states. Today, it is in 20, and is the largest pure-play Medicaid MCO in the country.
"
1632,UNH,"Analysts are expecting more growth as Medicaid coverage expands due to the ACA rollout. Rice said that new eligibility rules that went into effect at the start of this year could bring 80,000 new members to Centene, coming to about $240 million in revenue. The company is also expanding its membership rolls through buyouts, most recently when it acquired Community Health Solutions' contract with Louisiana, bringing 200,000 lives aboard.
"
1633,UNH,"ObamaCare Exchanges
"
1634,UNH,"Centene has also jumped into the ACA's new health insurance exchanges in nine states through its Ambetter brand. Neidorff said in April that its financial impact on 2014 would be minimal, but he said that by the end of the current quarter enrollment should reach about 70,000.
"
1635,UNH,"""In the long run, we view this initiative positively,"" FBR analyst Steven Halper wrote in a May 19 note, but he added, ""Initial enrollment figures have been lackluster, and the company has indicated that it will reach the low end of its previous membership expectations from this segment.""
"
1636,UNH,"Some analysts' investment theses on Centene include the possibility that it will be bought. In early June, in fact, there were rumors that non-profit hospital chain Ascension Health was looking to buy a health insurer active in 18 states, leading Gupte to speculate that Centene or WellCare Health Plans (WCG) was the target. That drove the stock to a new high until Citigroup debunked the rumor, but Centene may still be an attractive candidate in a consolidating industry.
"
1637,UNH,"""Ascension was a long shot, particularly with Centene,"" Gupte said. ""But it's hardly the only company that's interested.""
"
1638,UNH,"Analysts expect Centene's profit to grow 29% this year to $3.71 a share, then climb another 20% next year to $4.47.As managed-care organization Centene readied its first-quarter report in April, investors were getting very nervous.This year brought the first quarter when the managed-care industry faced a new health-insurer fee imposed under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

1661,UNH,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the country's largest health insurer, will be the first of the ""Big 5"" to report fourth-quarter results on Thursday. Analysts aren't expecting major surprises.They've already lowered their earnings estimate to $1.40 a share from $1.43, the consensus prior to the company's so-so Q3 results. But that would still be a gain of 17% over last year.In Q3, earnings just met views for $1.53 a share, up only 2% from the prior year. Revenue missed slightly, rising 12% to $30.6 billion. Revenue is seen climbing 8% in Q4, to nearly $31.1 billion.""The quarter is going to be pretty much in line, maybe a little higher than expected but not very much,"" said analyst David Windley of Jefferies & Co.Upside would likely come from stronger-than-expected results from UnitedHealth's OptumHealth, he says. In an investor day in early December, UnitedHealth said it expects ""exceptional"" growth from the health services business in 2014.Analysts will also be watching for commentary on the company's substantial Medicare Advantage business, the privately run version of the government's Medicare program, which has been impacted by reimbursement cuts.In a filing last week, Humana (HUM) said it expects gross sales and terminations for individual Medicare Advantage plans for 2014 to be ""meaningfully better"" than previously projected, resulting in Advantage membership gains in 2014.""UnitedHealth had taken the position that membership was more likely to be flattish and margin would be down some beginning in 2014,"" Windley said. ""So it will be interesting to watch if UnitedHealth's (Medicare Advantage) will also be better than expected.""He thinks the open enrollment period for this year will show higher numbers than expected.But Humana, in the same filing, increased its prior estimate regarding 2015 Medicare Advantage funding pressures from 4% to 5% to 6% to 7%, based on an update of medical cost trends from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Deutsche Bank analyst Scott Fidel upgraded UnitedHealth's stock last week to buy from hold, based on expectations for 2014, namely higher price increases than its peers and a more conservative approach to the public exchanges than its peers.UnitedHealth may be considered a bellwether in the health-insurance industry, but it's been a contrarian on ObamaCare. Unlike its peers, UnitedHealth is largely sitting out the public exchanges this year, participating in only a handful of state exchanges.That may turn out to be a wise move. In the same filing last week, Humana said it now expects the ""risk mix"" of members enrolling in the exchanges to be ""more adverse than previously expected,"" presumably meaning more older, sicker enrollees than ""young invincibles.""Deutsche Bank downgraded Humana to ""sell,"" noting it has the softest premium increases of its peer group. Humana will report Q4 results on Feb. 5, with Aetna (AET) and Cigna (CI) following over the next two days.On Thursday, Credit Suisse upgraded Aetna to ""outperform"" on ""muted cost trends"" and synergies from its acquisition of Coventry Health Care last year.The other ""Big 5"" insurer, WellPoint (WLP), will report on Jan. 29.

In a recent report, JPMorgan analyst Justin Lake noted that at the end of the first quarter, Aetna had 230,000 paid public exchange members, ""with expectations it will nearly double in size to 450,000"" by the end of the year.A few months ago — when managed-care companies were fretting over the risks and costs associated with ACA exchanges — having a large exposure to ObamaCare was considered a vulnerability.Those fears have eased in recent weeks, even if they haven't gone away altogether.""Early indicators on the risk profile look manageable relative to their pricing assumptions, though Aetna notes it is still early days and they lack enough experience to draw meaningful conclusions,"" Lake said.Coping With ObamaCareThe managed care industry has had few good things to say about ObamaCare, blaming it for everything from higher costs and tighter margins to more competition. Still, there's little question that recent news surrounding the program has calmed investor nerves.Aetna shares are up about 13% since an April 17 dip and currently trade near 76. Aetna and IBD's Medical-Managed Care group have both risen 10% for the year to date, while the S&P 500 index has lifted just 2%.""Almost everything moving these stocks has been Affordable Care related,"" said Vishnu Lekraj, analyst at Morningstar. ""A lot of the movement depends on how the major managed care firms have navigated the new landscape, and that's been largely positive.""These firms have been able to price their affordable care products better than investors initially expected, Lekraj says, and they have ""definitely"" been able to execute better than investors expected.""It's not that Affordable Care is great for the industry. There's still margin compression, more competition and a lot of headwinds,"" he said. ""But it's not as bad as everyone thought it would be, which has helped share prices.""Among the recent positive developments is a surge in younger members signing up for coverage under the ACA. Early ACA enrollees tended to be older than the managed care industry originally anticipated and had a higher-than-expected use of medical services.The increase in younger, healthier members helps lower the risk profile for exchanges.""The estimate is that you need about 30% to 40% of younger, healthier members to offset members who are older or may have health problems, and we have definitely seen more younger people signing up,"" Lekraj said. ""We should continue to see that happen.""While UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the largest managed care company, recently said ObamaCare costs and high drug prices have hurt its earnings, other firms have offered a more positive take.Earlier this month Cigna (CI) raised its full-year earnings guidance and sounded upbeat about the fact that more younger people began to sign up for ObamaCare during the last weeks of open enrollment.Meanwhile, WellPoint (WLP) said it would simply raise prices to offset costs tied to ObamaCare.Aetna officials were not available for comment. A spokeswoman with the company referred IBD to a webcast of Aetna investor presentations during the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Health Care Conference, held May 14, and the UBS Global Healthcare Conference, held May 20.During those presentations, Aetna said that one of its main focuses this year will be ""collecting or solving"" ACA-mandated fees and taxes.The company said that it accrued about $240 million of ACA mandated fees during the first quarter. It looks to offset some of those costs this year through a combination of price, premium and cost adjustments.'Manageable' ExposureAccording to a report that accompanied the investor presentation, Aetna said its public exchange membership ""still represents a manageable financial exposure.""While ObamaCare has garnered most of the recent attention surrounding Aetna and other managed care firms, it's not the only trend that has been changing the industry. Consolidation has been a major story as well.Aetna itself has seen a big spike in revenue in recent quarters, thanks to its $5.7 billion buyout of Coventry Health Care last year.When that deal closed, Aetna estimated that its synergies from the buyout would total about $50 million in 2013. The company later said it ""achieved the high end of its target,"" Citigroup analyst Carl McDonald noted in a report.""Aetna is projecting synergies of $150 million in 2014 and $200 million in 2015, driven by medical cost and network synergies, operational streamlining, vendor re-contracting and specialty pharmacy migration,"" McDonald added.More recently, Aetna in April completed its acquisition of UK-based InterGlobal from a group led by its majority shareholder, Alchemy Partners. InterGlobal specializes in international private medical insurance for groups and individuals in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Europe. Terms were not disclosed.Financially, Aetna has grown revenue at least 31% each of the last four quarters. During the previous six quarters, it logged only one quarter of double-digit growth.The company's first-quarter revenue gained 47% from the prior year to $14 billion — the biggest increase in years. Operating earnings climbed 27% to $1.98 a share, topping consensus estimates for $1.55.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 11% this year and 10% in 2015.

That ended a four-quarter string of double-digit gains.UnitedHealth touted strong growth from its Optum health-services technology and analytics division, where revenue grew 35% to $10.2 billion.Operating margins for 2013 fell 120 basis points to 6.4%.Medicare Dis-AdvantageUnitedHealth blamed government funding cuts to Medicare Advantage, the privately run version of the government's health care program for seniors. The insurer estimated that the government underfunded the program by 6.7% last year.CEO Stephen Hemsley also pointed out in a morning conference call that the 2014 Advantage program was ""underfunded,"" adding, ""we continue to be watchful of funding pressure"" and will advocate for ""strong and reasonable funding.""Those comments exacerbated fears that Medicare Advantage will face further payment cuts in 2015 and beyond, as part of ObamaCare savings.UnitedHealth shares fell 3%.Despite government cuts to Medicare Advantage and pressures from ObamaCare, UnitedHealth said it would stick to its prior outlook for 2014, revenue of $128 billion to $129 billion and earnings of $5.40 to $5.60 a share.UnitedHealth and other insurers are responding by trimming Medicare Advantage benefits and provider networks.Revenue in 2013 grew 11% to $122.5 billion as the No. 1 U.S. health insurer added more than 4.5 million members, including 170,000 in Q4.UnitedHealth added 425,000 Medicare Advantage members in 2013, a 17% gain, including 20,000 in Q4. Medicare and retirement revenue rose 11% in Q4 to $11 billion.Meanwhile, as Hemsley noted, Optum advised federal and state exchanges and will play a ""senior advisory"" role to the government in its continued implementation of the Affordable Care Act.But UnitedHealth itself will remain ""selective"" as it evaluates whether to participate in the public exchanges this year, Hemsley told analysts in the call. The firm expects to see growth from ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion, however.Medical and drug costs trends remained relatively restrained, management said, noting that inpatient hospital use fell for the fifth straight year.Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch called Q4 results ""solid,"" though operating metrics were weaker than expected.Humana, Others FollowOther major health insurers start reporting Q4 results later this month, starting with WellPoint (WLP) on Jan. 29.

1790,UNH,"Strong sales and profit growth are important characteristics of the best stocks. But it's also important for those stocks to form sound chart patterns.Charts help investors identify the proper buy point for stocks that meet CAN SLIM criteria. Studying the chart can help investors determine whether a stock has set up in a proper base.""You want a stock to prove its strength to you before you invest in it,"" IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""IBD research on market winners going back to 1880 shows stocks that form correctly shaped bases have the best chance of success. Cups should show smooth action on the left and right sides of the pattern. There shouldn't be jagged edges or many wild weekly swings of 10% to 15% or more.The base should be symmetrical in shape; the number of down weeks on the left side should roughly match the number of up weeks on the right side of the pattern. Few of the big market winners broke out of a lopsided base.The same principles of symmetry and smooth, tight action generally apply to double-bottom bases. Flat bases should show tight trading.Studying examples of breakouts from sound bases will help you distinguish good from bad.IBD weekly charts and MarketSmith charts make for easy visual inspection of a stock's price pattern. That's because they're on a logarithmic scale, in which a move from 10 to 20 looks the same as a move from 20 to 40. In other words, moves of equal percentages look the same.On an arithmetic scale, a move from 20 to 40 would look bigger than a move from 10 to 20. That's not right, since it's the percentage change that matters, not the absolute change.FHP International, a provider of managed health care services and insurance, formed a solid base in late 1988 with a 13.23 buy point. The base was 13 weeks long. It showed institutional support at 10.88. (1)The pattern was 17% deep, nicely shallow, and there were no wild swings. The stock also closed at weekly highs several times as it climbed the right side of the base, another bullish sign.FHP broke out Jan. 24, 1989, in more than double its average daily volume. It nearly quadrupled over the next 10 months, hitting a high of 51.13 on Oct. 3. FHP was acquired in 1997 by PacifiCare Health Systems, which itself was bought by UnitedHealth Group (UNH) in 2005.A note of caution before buying any stock: Make sure the market is in a confirmed uptrend. Prefer stocks that are a first- or second-stage base, because later bases tend to be risky. Also, check for recent excessive stock splits or share offerings that might dilute the stock's value.

Among these, eight transactions comprised hospitals with $1 billion or more in revenues, double the big-ticket mergers in 2016.Hospitals and health systems announced 561 transactions consisting about 1,260 hospitals from 2010 to 2015, according to the American Hospital Association. Health insurers are also striving to cut deals in this field.Some noted deals planned in the recent past include UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) (the biggest U.S. health insurer) $4.9 billion deal to acquire DaVita Medical Group and CVS Health Corp.’s (CVS  -  Free Report) acquisition plans for Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) (one of the top U.S. health insurers), for about $67.5 billion in cash and stock. CVS’s acquisition of Aetna is expected to close in 2H 2018. Cigna also proposed a $67 billion acquisition of Express-Scripts.What Promotes HealthCare Industry Merger? A surge in interest has been noticed for vertical mergers. This would help companies to generate more efficiencies by consolidating supply chains and enjoy scale advantage, per State Street (read: Play the Best Sector of Summer With These ETFs & Stocks).Investors should note that the healthcare sector’s debt-to-equity levels are 30% lower than the broader S&P 500. The sector is estimated to see return-on-equity more than double to 27.2% by the end of 2019 against the 19.72% expected growth in the broad market. The factors made the sector more attractive to companies that are eyeing inorganic expansion.Other Tailwinds So, investors can definitely play the merger mania in this field. Apart from this, there are some specific factors that can favor the sector in the near term.President Trump’s announcement of the drug plans in May, which were in the best interest of pharma companies, may benefit the space. The drug plans will likely put pressure on U.S. trading partners, forcing them to pay more for medicines.Also, on May 30, the President signed the 'Right To Try' bill into law. This law will help patients suffering from terminal diseases to undergo experimental treatments and use drugs that are not yet approved by the FDA.

The company shows confidence in providing improved health status and better access to coordinated care and prevention with this active partnership. It also previously forged alliances with healthcare providers and community leaders in order to serve members with better health care experience.This contract will increase the company’s Medicaid membership, which was 1.8 million as of Mar 31, 2018, down 23% year over year due to certain Medicaid contract terminations.Given its more than 30 years’ experience in providing the most vulnerable markets with unique approaches and local presence in the market, Aetna Medicaid Administrators LLC excels in catering to high-need Medicaid members.The State of Kansas recently awarded Medicaid contracts to United HealthCare (UNH  -  Free Report) as well.Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report) also announced that its wholly owned unit, Molina Healthcare of Florida, Inc., has been approved Medicaid Managed Care contracts by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration in Regions 8 and 11 of the Florida Statewide Medicaid Managed Care Invitation to Negotiate.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 26.27%, underperforming its industry’s surge of 33.29% in the past year.A Stock to ConsiderA better-ranked company in the Medical-HMO industry is WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

1819,UNH,"With a market capitalization of approximately $20.26 billion, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (DGX  -  Free Report) has been benefiting from consistent strategic buyouts, a solid balance sheet and positive demographic trends. However, with the recently implemented PAMA (Protecting Access to Medicare Act) rule, a persistent decline in healthcare utilization rate, softer volume, commercial pricing pressure and cutthroat competition in the niche space are denting the stock’s growth.Pressure on volume due to a difficult macro-economic situation and pricing, constitutes the primary risk for Quest Diagnostics. Nevertheless, we have observed some changes in the volume trend over the past couple of quarters. In the last reported quarter, volume measured by a number of requisitions increased 2.2% year over year, driven by acquisitions while organic growth remained essentially flat.Per the company, the impact of weather presented a headwind of approximately 60 basis points to volume in first-quarter 2018.We also expect a low level of employment and slow growth of commercially-insured lives to continuously affect the company’s overall improvement until the economy rebounds.Buoyed by the above mixed trends, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here we take a quick look at the major factors responsible for continuously ailing Quest Diagnostics and also the brighter prospects indicating a near-term recovery.Factors Plaguing Quest DiagnosticsComing back to PAMA, the year opened with the first quarter operating under the clinical IP schedule, accounting for approximately 12% of the company’s revenues last year. The company still expected the impact of the final rates under PAMA to cause an approximate 4% revenue reduction in 2018 while nearly 10% in both 2019 and 2020 as well.Quest Diagnostics faces intense competition, primarily from Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), other commercial laboratories and hospitals. Hospitals control an estimated 60% of the diagnostic test market compared with Quest Diagnostic’s 15% share.While pricing is an important factor in choosing a testing lab, hospital-affiliated physicians expect a high level of service including accurate and rapid turnaround of testing results. As a result, Quest Diagnostics and other commercial labs compete with hospital-affiliated labs, primarily on the basis of service quality.Why Should You Hold?We are optimistic about Quest Diagnostics’ consistent efforts to refocus on core diagnostic information services business and a disciplined capital deployment. The company’s latest acquisitions and collaborations with hospitals and integrated delivery networks continue to act as major growth drivers.We are also upbeat about the company entering into an expanded long-term strategic partnership agreement with UnitedHealthcare, a business of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to operate as a preferred national laboratory for all the company’s members starting Jan 1, 2019. This extended pact will provide in-network access to Quest Diagnostics’ complete portfolio of laboratory services to more than 48 million eligible members.Under the widened tie-up, the companies are going to join forces on a variety of value-based programs. Further, Quest Diagnostics’ merger and acquisition activity is being executed successfully. Recently, the company completed the acquisition of MedXM, a leading national provider of home-based health risk assessments related services.In 2017, the company announced seven acquisition activities, which should help exceed Quest Diagnostics’ long-term M&A objective of 1-2% top-line growth for 2018. Among these buyouts, worth noting is the company’s recently-closed buyout of the Cleveland HeartLab from Cleveland Clinic.Price PerformanceQuest Diagnostics has outperformed its industry in a month's time. The stock has gained 9% compared with the industry's rise of 7.3%. Key PickA better-ranked stock in the broader medical space is Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report).Genomic Health has a long-term earnings growth rate of 19.3%.

The credit rating agency expects the company’s operating margins to stay stable with the bottom line boosted by increased premium revenues.A.M. Best also expects the company’s membership o continue growing but at a moderate pace, driven mostly by Medicare and Medicaid. UnitedHealth’s long-term partnership with AARP is the main driver of its strong growth in the senior market.Business diversification that the company derives from its service segment named Optum is positively seen by the rating agencies.

1821,UNH,"UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) the health insurer major has carved a niche for itself in the health care industry by building up pieces of businesses that has given it enormous diversification benefits, both across product and geography.UnitedHealth’s business diversification has been achieved by fortifying its health service business, Optum, which over the years has grown to claim a greater share of the company’s total revenues. One of the main reasons for the company to nurture this business was that it remained largely insulated from the regulation which is applicable to another segment UnitedHealthcare, still the major contributor to total revenues.UnitedHealth has complemented its organic growth with targeted acquisitions that have helped it to achieve more in much lesser time. Its Optum business which provides services via three business segments — OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx — provide service capabilities in data and analytics, pharmacy care services, population health management, health care delivery and health care operations. Together, these capabilities represent a $1.4 trillion market opportunity, which implies huge growth for years to come.Coming to the other segment, UnitedHealthcare, has grown organically by more than 12 million people domestically since 2010, achieved via balanced, vibrant growth, serving increasingly diverse markets. The growth profile should continue given the company’s strong standing in the government business, which presents immense potential.  UnitedHealth is also one such company that has been able to lower medical cost for its customers via Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). These ACOs are groups of providers that are paid on the quality of service provided and not on the quantity of service provided as prevailed earlier.The company currently delivers more than $60 billion in care annually through contracts, with value-based features and is on course to raise that number to $75 billion by 2020.We expect the company’s impressive growth to continue as it remains an active acquirer of other businesses to strengthen an existing business or platform or provide a new platform for future growth or avail tools, technologies or skills that cannot be otherwise obtained or developed more efficiently.Moreover, in 2018 and beyond, we see the potential for sustained growth across markets served by the company, particularly in expanding government programs.Also, UnitedHealth remains the frontrunner in applying digital tools and data for health decision-making for its consumers. It is also using blockchain technology in its operations, which should enhance its overall business efficiency.Year to date, the stock has gained 14% compared with the industry’s growth of 12%. Its performance looks better than the growth of 4% and 5% for Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), respectively, over the same time frame.UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another stock worth considering in the same space is Humana Inc.

1822,UNH,"The Dow endured a turbulent week, marked by lingering trade tensions. The blue-chip index also closed below its 200-day moving average for four consecutive sessions. Conflicting signals emerged from the Trump administration on trade issues. These mixed signals led to a significant spike in volatility, with the index whipsawing during several trading sessions.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow gained 0.5% last Friday, reversing an eight-session long losing streak. This was the blue-chip index’s longest stretch of losses since March 2017 and was just one day short of its all-time longest losing streak since 1978.Gains were primarily attributable to an energy sector rally following the meeting between OPEC and Russia led consortium that took place in Vienna on Jun 22. Finally, OPEC decided to raise production quota by 624,000 barrels a day, much lower than 1.5 million barrels a day demanded by Saudi Arabia and Russia.The index declined 2% over last week, its largest weekly decline since Mar 23 as well as its second straight weekly fall. The Dow declined modestly on last Monday, as trade war fears once again escalated making investors jittery. However, markets ended sharply lower on last Tuesday, as trade war fears escalated once again.Growing fears of a U.S.-China trade war continued to take its toll on the Dow on last Wednesday and Thursday. Markets were further rattled after a Supreme Court ruling on sales tax saw shares of online retailers tumbling.The Dow This WeekThe index shed 1.3% on Monday, its biggest one-day drop since May 29, closing at its lowest level since May 4. Moreover, the Dow ended below its 200-day moving average, a psychological barrier to gauge its long-term momentum trends. Investors’ apprehensions about a trade war between the United States and China as well as with European Union continued to weigh on investor sentiment.The index gained 0.1% on Tuesday but still ended below its 200-day moving average for the second straight session.  Investors reacted cautiously as the U.S. government continues to provide mixed signals on the ongoing trade conflicts.On Jun 24, The Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump is considering restricting Chinese investment in high-tech U.S. companies. On Jun 25, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin first tweeted that the WSJ published “fake news”. However, he later clarified that restrictions will apply to all countries including China if they try to steal proprietary tech assets of U.S. companies.The Dow lost 0.7% on Wednesday, closing at its lowest level since May 3. The blue-chip index ended 165.52 points lower after touching an intraday high of 285.91 points. This reflects the index’s largest intraday downslide since Feb 21. Moreover, the Dow ended below its 200-day moving average for the third straight session.Markets opened on a positive note as President Trump stated that he has decided to strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), who will assess potential threat from Chinses investment in U.S. companies. This was a softer stand compared with Trump’s earlier decision to impose China specific investment restrictions.Later in the day, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated the government can block any American joint venture in China if the firm transfers critical technologies to China.Moreover, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration’s revised approach related to Chinese investment in the United States should not be considered as a soft stand on China. Following these two developments, stock markets took sharp downturn.The index gained 0.4% on Thursday, ending 98.46 points higher are dropping 100 points earlier in the day. Gains were largely broad-based with banks and tech stocks rallying strongly.

1823,UNH,"UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter earnings results on Jul 17, 2018, before the opening bell. The company is anticipated to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Revenue growth at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum segments is expected to aid the company’s second-quarter earnings results, offset by increased expenses due to additional investments and operating costs.Factors to Affect Q2 ResultsFor the company’s UnitedHealthcare segment, we expect revenue growth from its Medicare and Retirement sub-segments from higher individual product sales and employer-sponsored group retiree plans. Its international business is expected to gain from an increased number of people serving in Chile, Colombia and Peru.We expect Optum, the company’s health service business, to be a significant contributor to its earnings. Optum’s sub-segment Optum Health’s earnings are anticipated to be driven by growth in care delivery, and behavioral, digital consumer engagement and health financial services; while its sub-segment OptumInsight’s revenues are expected to be driven by an expansion in payer technology and services, and care provider advisory services. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue from this segment is $24.9 billion up 9.7% year over year.The company’s membership growth is anticipated to be driven by higher Medicaid and Medicare Advantage enrollments. In the commercial group market we expect membership gains in services to small groups, which should drive membership in risk-based benefit plans.However, UnitedHealth is expected to incur additional investment and operating costs in order to accelerate existing initiatives along with artificial intelligence, data analytics, individual health record custodianship, digital health, net promoter score improvements and health-related initiatives in local communities. These accelerated investments will lead to incremental operating expenses of $200-$300 million for 2018. Part of these spending was borne by the company in the second quarter, which might increase operating expenses.The bottom line is expected to be cushioned by the shares bought back in the second quarter.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company has an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.64%. This is depicted in the chart below:UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteWhy a Positive Surprise Likely?Our proven model indicates that chances of UnitedHealth beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.

1824,UNH,"Credit rating giant Moody’s Investor Service recently assigned an A3 senior unsecured debt rating to the planned issuance of around $4 billion senior unsecured debt of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report). The total amount is due in June 2021, 2023, 2028 and 2048. The rating outlook stays stable.Net proceeds from the same would be used for repaying commercial paper borrowings as well as general corporate expenditure of the company (that might consist of redeeming or repurchasing outstanding securities or refinancing debt).Ratings RepresentationThe credit rating agency expects the proceeds to be primarily used for paying back $4.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of Mar 31, 2018. As such there should not be any considerable change in the company’s indebtedness.Moody’s debt-to-capital was 42.5% as of Mar 31, 2018, above the high end of its rating expectation. Moreover, the agency notes that the $4.9 billion worth acquisition of DaVita Medical Group, which is expected to be closed in 2018, would be paid through a combination of commercial paper, cash and debt. This acquisition will effectively increase the leverage ratio of the company to more than 44%, lying above the rating agency’s benchmark.As on Mar 31, the parent company had $587 million in cash and cash equivalents.The A3 senior unsecured debt rating and A1 insurance financial strength rating of UnitedHealthare based on its  strong business profile, primarily driven by its national presence, brand value, membership base, diverse benefits and services product offerings as well as an impressive level of unregulated revenues.The ratings also find support in a solid financial profile characterized by a steady, consistent earnings performance, a conservative and well-diversified investment portfolio plus a strong interest coverage from both regulated and unregulated operations.

1827,UNH,"Envision Healthcare Corporation (EVHC  -  Free Report), a physician staffing company, has entered into an agreement to be acquired by the global investment firm KKR.   Financial Terms of the Deal Envision Healthcare will be acquired in an all-cash transaction worth nearly $9.9 billion, including the assumption or repayment of debt. Each share of Envision Healthcare will fetch $46.00 per share in cash, which reflects nearly 32% premium to Envision Healthcare’s volume-weighted average share price from Nov 1, 2017, when the company disclosed that it was reviewing strategic alternatives to enhance shareholders’ value.  Earlier in the year, Envision Healthcare sold its American Medical Response, the provider of ambulance services in the United States to KKR for net proceeds of $2.1 billion. The deal, subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions, should see light by the fourth quarter of 2018.  Strategic Alternatives  The deal does not come to us as a surprise since the company had already hinted at this direction when last year it disclosed that it has reviewed all the strategic alternatives. The different options included – capital structure alternatives, potential acquisitions, portfolio optimization, a potential sale of the whole company and continued operation as a standalone business. The sale to KKR is expected to generate utmost shareholder’s gain according to the company’s management, which after thorough scanning of a number of potential buyers found KKR the best fit. Moreover, the sale of the entire company was the best option among others, considering business and competitive landscape, the company’s opportunities and challenges and strategic and financial alternatives available. Envision Healthcare Corp. was formed in December 2016 as a result of a merger of Envision Healthcare Holdings Inc. with AmSurg Corp. With its sale to KKR, the company will go private.Recent Troubles In recent times, Envision Healthcare was mired in lawsuits over allegations over “balance-billing” and outrageous billing practices which increased costs for hospitals and consumers.  The company also lost its contract with UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), due to the egregious billing practices of the former to UnitedHealth’s customers.  Envision Healthcare was already struggling with weak patient volumes and given its tarnished image for overbilling, it was not easy to expand its in-network relationships with private insurance carriers. Moreover, the sale of its ambulatory services business caused a loss of business diversity and decline in business scale, which would limit its top-line growth. Given these headwinds, the company going into the hands of a private player is probably the best that Envision shareholders could wish for.  In year's time the stock has lost 23% compared with the industry's growth of 4.3%.  Envision Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks worth considering in the healthcare space are INC Research Holdings, Inc. (SYNH  -  Free Report) and  OncoCyte Corporation (OCX  -  Free Report). Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2.

The news of dividend hike, a new share buyback plan, and tie-ups with a laboratory and a diagnostic company must have led to the surge in the share price.Catalysts in DetailInvestors viewed favorably UnitedHealth Group’s recent announcement to increase its quarterly dividend by 20% to 75 cents per share. The company’s current dividend yield of 1.24% is higher than 1.06% for the industry.  UnitedHealth is all the more attractive given lower dividend yields for the companies in the same space. For instance, Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corp.

Via these agreements the insurer intends to control  soaring medical costs, since the payment for services to these labs will be made on the quality of the service provided compared with earlier mode of payment on the basis of quantity of service.These agreements will also enable UnitedHealth to utilize patient’s data available at these labs to provide more specific services to its customers.  Other factors that have led to a consistent rise in the company’s share price are its strong first-quarter earnings and 2018 earnings guidance increase, as well as the acquisition of Empresas Banmédica, a Chilean company, early during the year.In a year’s time, the stock has gained 40% compared with the industry’s growth of 33%.Further Upside Left?The company strong fundamentals featured by its vastly diversified operations, a strong balance sheet and growing membership should drive revenues and earnings going forward.

1831,UNH,"Injecting a fresh dose of uncertainty for health insurers, the Trump administration has said that it would halt payments under risk adjustment. This will put the money of many insurers with sicker customers at stake.The risk-adjustment program was formed under Obamacare. It is a mechanism under which insurers with a healthier customer profile received from Obamacare health exchanges compensate those with a sicker patient population.This risk-adjustment arrangement was put in place to make the functioning of the insurance market places smoother and prevent any of the insurance companies from “cherry-picking” customers.On Saturday, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said that it will be compelled to suspend $10.7 billion in risk-adjustment payments which were due for 2017, following a month’s old federal ruling.Effect of SuspensionThe effect of this halt will be varied, with insurers as well as customers facing the consequences. In the short term, however, insurance companies with a healthier patient population will be better off as they would stand to gain on savings on the risk-adjustment payment, which otherwise would have to be made by them to their less-advantageous counterparts. The loser would obviously be the insurer group that was the recipient of funds under the risk-adjustment program.Over the long term, the fear is that the end of the risk-adjustment program will disrupt the health insurance market place. Since those who lose from costly customers and do not get compensation from the risk-adjustment program would raise the premium, making health insurance more expensive. This might eventually lead to an increase in the uninsured rate, which means a lesser number of Americans buying policies and a decline in the top line of players.The risk-adjustment program along with two other programs, namely risk corridors and reinsurance, were put in place to stabilize premiums and lessen the risk of operating in the law’s fledgling individual marketplaces.According to FierceHealthcare, Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) paid the maximum in the risk-adjustment program from 2014-2016 of nearly $1 billion. Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report), Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report), Kaiser Permanente and Fidelis Care rounded out the top five payers.The action has caused industry-wide chaos among health insurers and supporters. Blue Cross Blue Shield Association’s Chief Executive Officer Scott Serota said in a statement that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “should take immediate action to reinstate these payment transfers to ensure the market works as intended.”One of the biggest health insurance companies, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), has already left the insurance marketplace due to losses incurred from it.  Given the uncertainty over risk-adjustment payments, other insurers still present on the exchanges are struggling to price their policies and decide marketplaces on which to offer their plans. If regulatory uncertainty persists, other companies also may call it quits from the marketplace business.  Friction in Sight?This action along with other regulatory moves would make the functioning of the Affordable Care Act all the more difficult. The most pertinent of the recent regulations is  the repeal of the individual mandate provision, which required individuals to carry a health insurance or to pay a fine in case of failure to do so. This regulatory action is believed to give healthy young individuals the choice to remain uninsured. The CBO estimates that this rule will cause premiums to go up by nearly 10%. Other changes such as reducing the advertising budget for Obamacare exchanges and narrowing the open enrollment period work against the ACA.All these factors combined will lead to an increase in the uninsured rate, which has already been showing an uptick. The nonprofit Commonwealth Fund data showed that the uninsured rate rose in the first few months of this year, from 12.7% at the end of 2016 to 15.5% in the first three months of 2018.Health insurers have showed resilience by putting up a superior performance for the past several years since the Affordable Care Act was enacted andwe  believe  that the players will emerge as winners over the long term. Nonetheless, short-term jerks will prevail until the regulatory dust settles.In a year’s time, the industry has grown 30%, which is more than double the gain of 14% clocked by the S&P 500 index and 1.7% by the Medical sector.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

Shares of Goldman Sachs took a beating, as bond yields took a toll on banks and other financial companies that gain from rising interest ratesThe index gained 1.4% on Wednesday. The rally was led by financial stocks, boosted by the rise in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield and partly supported by robust economic data and easing of trade war fears.On Wednesday, ECB’s chief economist Peter Praet signaled the end of the bond-buying program. As a result of this, bond prices fell, pushing yields higher. The 10-year Treasury note rose 5.9 basis points to 2.975%, its highest since May 24.

1835,UNH,"On Jul 5, Centene Corp.’s (CNC  -  Free Report) shares hit a 52 week high of $128.02, ending the day a tad lower at $128.00.Recent positive developments, which includes the completion of Fidelis Care acquisition, securing New Hampshire Department of Corrections contract and other buyouts, seems to have spurred the stock.In a year’s time, the stock has gained a significant 57.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 28.5%. In fact, its performance looks more illustrious when compared with others in the space such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), which have registered gains of 33.3%, 28.5% and 25.3%, respectively.What’s Behind the Rally?The Fidelis Care buyout is a catalyst for Centene as the acquisition would poise the company well in the country’s four largest states. It will also aid expansion in Medicare Advantage and Exchanges.Recent Medicaid contracts in five states of Arizona, New Mexico, Iowa, Florida and Washington will bolster the company’s revenues.The recent acquisition of MHM Services positions the company well in the rapidly growing business managing benefits for correctional facilities. The company’s correctional health plans business has grown over the past year and the deal will expand its correctional presence to six states.Also last month the company’s subsidiary Centurion of New Hampshire was re-approved a contract for continuing the provision of medical and dental professionals to the New Hampshire Department of Corrections.In March, Centene completed the acquisition of Community Medical Group (CMG), which highlights its targeted approach toward vertical integration in healthcare. In addition to CMG’s primary care services, its specialty care, transportation and a suite of social and other support services is likely to enhance Centene’s service portfolio.In the same month, Centene made an equity investment in RX Advance, a full-service pharmacy benefits manager. The company expects to utilize RX Advance’s cloud-based technology platform to significantly reduce administrative cost and affordable drug-impacted medical cost.The company also acquired an additional 61% investment in Interpreta in March. It is an innovative health IT company focused on clinical and genomic data, as well as real-time analytics. These deals will help the company in developing its PB business, consequently aiding in savings by significantly reducing both administrative and drug impacted medical costs.Will the Momentum Stay?The company’s re-procurement wins, expansion into new markets, and future growth pipeline will drive its long-term growth. Moreover, the diversification into other businesses such as advisory services, data analytics, forging government partnerships in new markets   positions the company  for strong growth ahead.There seems to be no hindrance in the stock’s growth trajectory at the moment. Moreover, the stock looks attractively valued with a PEG ratio of 1.1 comparing favorably with the industry’s PEG ratio of 1.4.Centene carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1838,UNH,"Big banks are starting the second-quarter earnings season this week, and results from pharma giants are due over the next few weeks, making this a good time to shift attention to the reporting cycle from tariff concerns. Although trade woes are a concern for pharma companies as around 55% of their revenues are generated from foreign markets, the overall earnings number is expected to be upbeat.The healthcare sector has jumped 6.5% in the last three months, better than the S&P 500’s 5% rally. Signs of the sector’s success became more evident in the last three months, when the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index gained 3.1% and 11.7%, respectively.With Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) scheduled to report on Jul 17 and Jul 18, respectively, this may be a good time to figure out which of these is a better stock. Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings scheduled next week include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceJohnson & Johnson has seen a gain of 4.18% over the last one month, while Novartis has advanced 4.16%. So Johnson & Johnson is a winner in this respect with better returns than both rival Novartis and the broader industry, which rose 3.70% during the same period.ValuationThe most-appropriate ratio to evaluate these two drug makers is perhaps EV/EBITDA. This metric is usually used to compare two stocks in the same industry. It is superior to other metrics such as P/E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies.Coming to the two pharma majors, Novartis with an EV/EBITDA value of 12.10 is overvalued compared to the broader industry, which has a valuation of 11.98. However, Johnson & Johnson holds an edge over both Novartis and industry here with a lower EV/EBITDA value of 7.92.Dividend YieldOver a year, Johnson & Johnson and Novartis have offered dividend yields of 2.82% and 2.42%, respectively, while the industry’s dividend yield was 3.11%. Although the industry’s dividend yield is slightly higher than both the pharma giants, between the individual stocks, Johnson & Johnson has taken the lead here too.Net MarginThe pharmaceutical industry enjoys higher profit margins than several other sectors. This is possibly one of the reasons why critics of the sector continually draw attention to allegedly exorbitant drug pricing, which helps the sector maintain its steep margins.With a net margin value of 22.77%, Novartis underperforms its bigger rival Johnson & Johnson, which has a net margin value of 26.23%. The broader industry’s net margin value is equal to that of Johnson & Johnson.Return on EquityReturn on equity (ROE) is one of the key financial ratios for pharma companies as these entities employ huge amounts of capital to bring their products to the market. In this respect, using ROE will help in evaluating the company’s ability to generate ample profits from its equity capital.The broader industry has ROE of 29.71%. Coming to the two stocks, Johnson & Johnson with an ROE of 30.65% is clearly at an advantage over both the industry and Novartis, which has ROE of 16.23%.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Johnson & Johnson has delivered positive surprises in each of the four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 2.86%. On the other hand, Novartis has delivered positive surprises in the prior four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 3.34%.When considering Earnings ESP, Johnson & Johnson has an ESP of +0.37%, while Novartis has an ESP of -2.68%. Johnson & Johnson’s earnings estimates for the current year have increased by 0.3% over the last 90 days, while the same metric for Novartis has declined by 1.3%. ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Novartis holds an edge over Johnson & Johnson when considering only earnings history. However, when considering price performance, valuation, ROE, and net margins Johnson & Johnson is at an advantage over Novartis. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson also has a better dividend yield than Novartis and with a more comprehensive look at its estimate revisions, Johnson & Johnson is clearly the better stock.What clinches the case in favor of Johnson & Johnson at this point in time is that it has a better ESP, which is a leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. This is why it might be wise to bet on Johnson & Johnson over Novartis as both prepare to report earnings next week.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more, wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1841,UNH,"After the worst first half performance since 2010, the Dow Jones has shown some strength at the start of the second half. This is especially true as the blue-chip index had its best day in a month on Jul 9, which pushed back the index to a positive territory for the year. The gains came on the back of a strong jobs report and Q2 earnings optimism amid trade tensions (read: Winning & Losing Sector ETFs From June Jobs Data).  Further, the index closed above its 50-day moving average for the first time in nearly three weeks, a positive sign for its short-term momentum trend.

1842,UNH,"Have you been paying attention to shares of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7.3% over the past month. UNH hit a new 52-week high of $251.50 in the previous session. UnitedHealth Group has gained 13.7% since the start of the year compared to the 1.4% move for the Medical sector and the 10.6% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 17, 2018, UnitedHealth Group reported EPS of $3.04 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.6%.For the current fiscal year, UnitedHealth Group is expected to post earnings of $12.61 per share on $225.14 billion in revenues. This represents a 25.22% change in EPS on a 11.92% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $14.26 per share on $243.93 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 13.05% and 8.35%, respectively.Valuation MetricsUnitedHealth Group may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for UNH? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.UnitedHealth Group has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 19.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 20X versus its peer group's average of 14.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.45. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and Consensus  UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and Consensus | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, UnitedHealth Group currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if UnitedHealth Group passes the test. Thus, it seems as though UNH shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.

1846,UNH,"We believe UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) health services business Optum will be an important ingredient of its first-quarter earnings growth.

Its revenue CAGR of 24% from 2014 to 2017 is highly impressive. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the segment is $23.6 billion, up 11.3% year over year.Revenue growth from this segment should be driven by increased contribution from each of its sub-segments, OptumHealth, OptumInsight, Optum Rx.Revenues from OptumHealth should be aided by organic growth acquisition-related growth in care delivery. The segment has been indulging in market expansion in care delivery, as well as growth in consumer health engagement products and services, behavioral health services and health financial services. Increase in the number of consumers served and a rise in average revenue per consumer will contribute to the segment’s top line.

1847,UNH,"The U.S. trade deficit, which has been the major reason for the ongoing tariff and trade war concerns, dropped for the second consecutive month in April. The deficit narrowed 2.1% to $46.2 billion from a revised $47.2 billion in March, marking the lowest level since September.However, the trade deficit is still up 11.5% so far this year from the year-ago level, and is on track to widen in 2018 to the highest level in a decade.Inside the Strong NumbersThe drop came on the heels of a 0.3% increase in exports to a record $211.2 billion, buoyed by higher shipments of industrial materials, soybeans and corn. Meanwhile, imports dipped 0.2% to $257.4 billion. Though trade deficit with Mexico narrowed 29.8% to $5.7 billion in April as exports to the country hit an all-time high, it widened with China by 8.1% to $28 billion. The United States had a $0.8 billion trade gap with Canada.In the first four months of 2018, exports to Mexico, Canada and the European Union have recorded double-digit growth, indicating that United States is expanding strongly in these markets. As a result, the data has bolstered the confidence in the robust economic growth given that the recent decline in deficit is expected to boost GDP in the second quarter.The rise in exports and shrinking trade gap will definitely benefit exporters, leading to a surge in mega-cap stocks. Tariffs: A Threat?Trump is going fierce with its anti-trade policies that could endanger the growth in exports seen so far in the year. He slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union last week after their temporary exemptions expired on Jun 1.The move also led to retaliation from these countries targeting American products worth billions of dollars. The European Union is seeking to hit back with $7.5 billion of levies on U.S. exports, including motorcycles, denim, cigarettes, cranberry juice and peanut butter, as early as Jun 20.  Mexico plans to retaliate by targeting a wide range of U.S. farm and industrial products and has said it would slap tariffs on imports from the United States, including whiskey, orange juice, steel, aluminum and other products.A trade war is also brewing with China as Washington and Beijing have threatened tit-for-tat tariffs on goods worth up to $150 billion each in order to reduce the United States' $375.2 billion trade deficit with China. Talks to avert a full trade war between the world’s two largest economies have so far failed to produce a fruitful deal though China has offered up to purchase nearly $70 billion worth of U.S. agriculture and energy products if the Trump administration steps back from tariffs.Why Mega Caps?Mega-cap stocks (with a market cap of $100 billion or more) belong to the largest and most recognizable brands in the world. They tend to be the most stable in an adverse economic scenario while at the same time offer capital appreciation in a booming market. Mega-cap stocks have a global footprint, strong cash positions and enjoy leading market positions with most of them offering huge dividends.These stocks are less volatile compared to small caps and thus are well protected in a market downturn. However, they might not experience exponential growth as small caps do in a rising stock market. 5 PicksGiven this, we have highlighted top-ranked mega-cap stocks that pose solid fundamentals and have the potential to move higher in the coming days.

1851,UNH,"In its concerted efforts to enhance shareholder value, the board of directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will propose a 20% increase on the quarterly dividend of 75 cents per share. Shareholders as of record on Jun 18, 2018 are expected to get the meatier dividend on Jun 26, 2018.Last June too, the company had hiked its payout by same percentage from 62.5 cents to 75 cents. UnitedHealth has an impressive track record of disbursing quarterly dividends and raising the payout annually, thus witnessing a five-year CAGR of 35.78%.The company’s current dividend yield of 1.21% is higher than 1.06% for the industry.Apart from higher dividends, this diversified health and well-being company’s share repurchase program has also been renewed for lowering share counts and boosting its bottom line. The company has been authorized to buy back 100 million shares or approximately 10% of its outstanding shares. This decision by UnitedHealth’s board members would replace the Jun 2014 share buyback program under which, there were around 29 million shares left for repurchase as of May 31, 2018.This dividend hike is supported by the company's strong balance sheet with increasing cash flows from the past several years (except 2013), a trend which continued in the first quarter of 2018 (cash flow from operations soared 60% year over year).The company has been quite aggressive when it comes to share buybacks. UnitedHealth’s strong capital position cements investors’ confidence in the company, benefiting it going forward.In the past year, shares of the company have surged 36.9%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 28.8%. Earlier in February, another company in the same space, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report), increased its quarterly dividend by 25%. Prior to that in January, Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) hiked the same by 7.1%.Zacks Rank & Another Key PickUnitedHealth holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another stock worth considering from the same space is WellCare Health Plans, Inc.

1852,UNH,"Credit rating giant Moody’s Investors Service has placed a downgrade rating review of Ba2 senior debt rating for WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report) and Baa2 insurance financial strength (""IFS"") rating for its subsidiary WellCare of Florida, Inc.The agency decided to review the ratings after the company announced its intention to acquire Meridian — consisting of Meridian Health Plan of Michigan, Inc., Meridian Health Plan of Illinois, Inc. and pharmacy benefits manager, MeridianRx — for a transaction value of $2.5 billion.This strategic move will enable WellCare expand its Medicaid portfolio to as many as 13 states with a leading market share across six of the lot.Factors Driving Rating ActionThe rating agency is concerned about the increase in leverage ratio due to usage of debt to fund the Meridian buyout. It estimates the company’s debt-to-equity ratio to deteriorate from 35% as of Mar 31, 2018 to 44% or above, depending on the amount of debt issues. The company is expected to issue debt worth $0.6 billion and $1 billion and draw on the revolver credit of up to $400 million.WellCare’s debt-to-EBITDA is supposed to increase from 1.9x to 2.8x. A significant amount of goodwill is also expected to increase along with the decline of EBITDA coverage of interest income.Additionally, standard integrations risks associated with this kind of large-scale acquisition is another concern.However, Meridian’s consolidation will likely prove accretive and improve WellCare’s scale and geographic diversification.Moody’s might review its current ratings downgrade when the deal draws to a close or prior to that if additional information allows the rating giant to reach a particular conclusion. Moreover, the agency wants to analyze Meridian’s financial performance in order to understand its financial plans.WellCare gave an indication to bring adjusted debt-to-capital ratio below 40% within a year of the transaction’s completion date. This will be achieved by paying a revolving credit line used for financing the deal along with increasing retained earnings.The ratings of the company have been a reflection of its decent demographic presence, consistent growth, solid capital levels and a low leverage, relative to peers. However, factors like lack of non-risk business, relatively small size and government business concentration are partial offsets.Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have rallied 13.39% year to date, outperforming the industry’s rise of 7.8%. Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the Medical-HMO industry can also check out other stocks worth considering like Anthem, Inc.

1854,UNH,"It takes just one super deal to turn the odds in your favor. Did the clinical laboratory services market just spin the wheel of fortune? Let’s see what happened.On May 24, Quest Diagnostics announced an expanded long-term strategic partnership agreement with UnitedHealthcare, a business of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to operate as a preferred national laboratory for all of the company’s members starting Jan 1, 2019. This expanded agreement will provide in-network access to Quest Diagnostics’ complete portfolio of laboratory services to more than 48 million eligible members.Under the expanded tie-up, the companies are going to join forces on a variety of value-based programs. At the same time, Laboratory Corporation of Americas Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), popularly known as LabCorp, has been hogging the spotlight on the news of the company losing its exclusive right to serve UnitedHealthcare post Jan 1. Meanwhile, LabCorp announced the extension of its partnership agreement with Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) the next day. Per the expanded agreement, LabCorp will serve as a preferred national laboratory for almost all of the company’s members starting next year. The extended agreement will provide in-network access to LabCorp’s complete portfolio of laboratory services to over 20 million eligible members.According to CNBC, Quest Diagnostics will lose its exclusivity to serve as a preferred laboratory partner to Aetna’s members.Notably, both the diagnostic testing lab stalwarts’ stocks have been trading higher than the S&P 500 index since May 24.Per Morgan Stanley’s analyst Ricky Goldwasser, these deals will result in the elimination of the long-time problem of contract overhang and will thereby result in a cognitive environment for pricing in the near term. He also commented ""... Labs are relative safe havens within the health care services sector.""Conforming to this idea, we believe that there are other factors which work as growth drivers for the clinical laboratory services market. Let’s delve deeper.Here we need to consider MarketsandMarkets data which shows that the global clinical laboratory services market is headed to reach a worth of $146.41 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 5.2% between 2017 and 2022.Most of the analysts believe an aging demography is primarily acting in favor of this. Per an article commissioned by the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, 8.5% of the global population is aged 65 years and above.Strengthening emerging markets are also going to provide impetus to the burgeoning global clinical laboratory services market. According to an article published in Report Buyer, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region will be the largest market for the clinical laboratory services between 2017 and 2022. Growing disposable income among the middle-class people along with increasing access to state-of-the art clinical laboratory technologies will drive the upside.According to some analysts, technological advancements in the form of integrated workflow management systems and database management tools are helping the companies expand their sample processing ability every year. Meanwhile, enhancements in laboratory testing technology will continue to boost demand for laboratory services.Stocks to Watch Out ForHere we highlight three companies that are striving to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the clinical laboratory services market.Genomic Health, Inc. (GHDX  -  Free Report): Based in Redwood City, CA, Genomic Health develops and markets genomic-based clinical laboratory services that analyze the underlying biology of cancer, enabling physicians and patients to make treatment-related decisions.This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 226.4%.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Secaucus, NJ, Quest Diagnostics is a leading provider of diagnostic testing information and services in the United States and globally.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average earnings beat being 3.4%.DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Denver, CO, DaVita is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure or end stage renal disease. It also provides related lab services in outpatient dialysis centers.This Zacks Rank #3 company has delivered positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters, the average beat being 0.9%.PAMA: A DownerLike all other markets, the clinical lab space has its own issues to deal with.Changes in governmental regulations may have a significant impact on company operations. In the last couple of years, several reimbursement issues have been hurting revenues. Majority of the companies are concerned about the CMS' (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) latest Medicare reimbursement reduction as a result of the implementation of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA).This has been a major dampener for testing laboratories. As said by LabCorp earlier, the new PAMA rates published by CMS do not reflect the intent of Congress when it directed CMS to implement market-based Medicare rates for lab testing. The statement says, “The process CMS followed to determine these rates was fatally flawed and failed to account for significant segments of the lab market by excluding 99 percent of all U.S. labs from reporting data and limiting data collection to 1 percent of laboratories, dominated by independent labs.”However, per an article on GenomeWeb, companies like Myriad Genetics (MYGN  -  Free Report), Veracyte and Luminex Corporation among others, which have their own proprietary tests, will for obvious reasons enjoy an edge and more control over pricing.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1856,UNH,"We expect higher revenues at UnitedHealthcare and Optum segments to drive UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) first-quarter results scheduled to release on Apr 17, 2018. Results should benefit from a reduction in corporate tax, partly offset by decline in premium revenues due to minimum loss ratio and lower net health insurance fee recapture effects.Alongside, the company is expected to incur additional investment and operating costs in order to accelerate existing initiatives and artificial intelligence, data analytics, individual health record custodianship, digital health, net promoter score improvements and health related initiatives in local communities. These accelerated investments will lead to $200 million to $300 million in incremental operating expense for 2018. A part of these spend will be borne by the company in the first quarter, which might increase operating expense.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsRevenue Growth at UnitedHealthcare: This segment is expected to witness an increased revenue led by growth in the number of individuals served across its business lines and price increases for underlying medical cost trends, which might be partially offset by a reduction in the number of people served in ACA-compliant individual products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is $44.7 billion, up 11.5% year over year.Higher Membership: We expect membership enrollment growth at the company. This should be led by broad-based growth across group sizes and regions in the commercial group market on the back of gains in services to small groups, which should drive membership in risk-based benefit plans. Fee-based commercial group business might be under pressure due to the non-renewal of one public sector customer. We expect to see higher Medicare advantage membership from growth in individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. Strong customer retention and new sales should cause higher membership in Medicaid.Higher Contribution from Optum: Results should also show an increase in revenues from its health services’ segment Optum, driven by higher contribution from sub-segments OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx. Revenues and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic and acquisition-related growth in care delivery. OptumInsight should see growth in revenue management services and business process services, whereas OptumRx should see an upside from client and consumer growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the segment is $23.6 billion, up 11.3% year over year.The bottom line should further get a cushion from the shares bought back in the first quarter.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predictsOur proven model does not conclusively show that UnitedHealth is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: UnitedHealth has an Earning ESP of -1.05%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Though UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), its negative ESP makes our surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Humana Inc.

1857,UNH,"Key bank earnings that are scheduled for release this week and next will likely to provide a better understanding of the sector’s near-term prospects. At present, the central short-term concern for banks will be one-time U.S. tax charges, which may affect their full-year profits. However, a lower U.S. corporate tax rate is expected to favor profitability in the long run.Encouraging economic environment, a low tax rate and high Fed rate hike prospects have clearly shifted attention to the bank stocks, which will kick-start the first-quarter earnings season. In this context, Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) which are scheduled to report on Apr 16 and Apr 18, respectively, assume greater significance. Both banks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major stocks reporting earnings from Apr 16 to Apr 20 include The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceBank of America has gained 37.2% in the last one year and outperformed the broader industry that has moved up 22.3% over the same period. In comparison, U.S. Bancorp has not only underperformed the broader industry but also Bank of America, gaining only 2.5% over the same time frame.ValuationCompared with the S&P 500, the industry is clearly undervalued. This implies that the industry has upside potential for the near future. The industry has an average trailing 12-month P/B ratio – which is the best multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next – of 1.77, which is below the S&P 500’s average of 3.75. Hence, it might be a good idea to focus on stocks belonging to this particular industry.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 1.91 U.S. Bancorp is undervalued than the S&P 500 but overvalued than the industry. However, Bank of America with a P/B ratio of 1.28 is less pricey compared to both the S&P 500 and the industry. Dividend YieldU.S. Bancorp’s dividend yield over the last year is 2.34%, higher than the broader industry’s figure of 2.04%. With a dividend yield of only 1.57%, Bank of America shareholders earn a comparatively lower dividend yield than both its smaller competitor and the broader industry.Return on Assets (ROA)Return on assets (ROA) is one of the key financial ratios for banks as they rely heavily on their assets to create revenues. A positive ROA indicates that the company has reported gains from its assets for the period in question. Coming to U.S. Bancorp and Bank of America, ROA for the trailing 12-months (TTM) is 1.32% and 0.83%, respectively. U.S. Bancorp has a higher ROA than not only Bank of America, but also the industry, which has ROA of 0.99%.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Bank of America has delivered positive surprises in three of the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 8.8%. On the other hand, U.S. Bancorp has delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 1.2%.When considering Earnings ESP, U.S. Bancorp has an ESP of +0.56%, while Bank of America has an ESP of -0.37%. Then again, U.S. Bancorp’s earnings estimates for the current year have increased by 0.5% over the last 60 days, while the same metric for Bank of America has advanced by 0.8%. ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Bank of America holds an edge over U.S. Bancorp, when considering valuations and price performance. Additionally, when we take a more comprehensive look at the companies’ previous earnings performance and estimate revisions, Bank of America is the better stock.However, when considering return on assets and dividend yield, U.S. Bancorp holds an edge over Bank of America. What clinches the case in favor of U.S. Bancorp at this point of time is that it has a better ESP than Bank of America. This is why it may be a good idea to bet on U.S. Bancorp over Bank of America as both prepare to report earnings over the next few days.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1858,UNH,"Over the last few months, Laboratory Corporation of Americas Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) (popularly known as LabCorp) has been dominating headlines on several developments including strategic partnerships and divestments. Following the company’s laboratory collaboration with Appalachian Regional Healthcare and Mount Sinai, it has formed one more joint venture, this time with UnitedHealthcare, a business of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report).In fact, this is the renewal of both entities’ long-term strategic partnership to create more simplified and personalized care recommendations for 48 million people enrolled in UnitedHealthcare plans. Per UnitedHealth, LabCorp will continue to serve as UnitedHealthcare’s exclusive national laboratory provider until Jan 1, 2019. However, financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.  Notably, as part of the expanding relationship, both companies are going to join forces on a variety of value-based programs. This alliance will help bringing advanced lab services in accountable care arrangements between UnitedHealthcare and more than 1,100 hospitals plus 110,000 physicians.Progress on Strategic CollaborationsSignificantly, LabCorp has fortified its footprint in the diagnostics space through both organic and inorganic means plus plans to coordinate with leading companies and academic institutions to build a wider portfolio of tests.The company continues to increase its scale and competencies in clinical laboratory medicine via acquisitions ranging from routine capabilities to highly esoteric testing. Among its recent associations, LabCorp has formed one multi-year, comprehensive laboratory teamwork with Appalachian Regional Healthcare. Also, under the new agreement with Interpace Diagnostics, Dianon Pathology, a member of the LabCorp Specialty Testing Group, the company will perform the thyroid biopsy analysis.Additionally, worth mentioning are the company’s two major health systems partnerships, Mount Sinai Health System and PAML, respectively. PAML is a Pacific Northwest-based market-leading reference and outreach laboratory. Per LabCorp, these anchor health systems will gradually emerge as research hubs, improving access to trials as well as Covance's site activation and investigator besides patient recruitment capabilities.Other recent coalitions include a strategic partnership with Thermo Fisher (TMO  -  Free Report), which enabled the launch of Thermo Fisher Oncomine Dx target panel for non-small cell lung cancer patients. Also, Labcorp works on developing and operating patient service centers within select Walgreens stores, courtesy of its drug retailer Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report).

1859,UNH,"Health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) has renewed its long-term strategic partnership with LabCorp, a leading global life sciences company providing comprehensive clinical laboratory and end-to-end drug development services.Per the agreement, LabCorp will continue to serve as UnitedHealthcare’s exclusive national laboratory provider till Jan 1, 2019. However, effective this date, Quest Diagnostics will become an “in network” lab for more than 48 million enrollees covered under the UnitedHealthcare plans. UnitedHealth has entered into a long-term agreement with Quest Diagnostic for the same.Via these agreements, UnitedHealth intends to bring the accountable care arrangements (ACOs) model of payments to the diagnostic companies. Both companies will together provide a variety of value-based programs, with the same aligned incentives and enhanced patient experience to lab services, like what we see in accountable care arrangements with UnitedHealthcare and more than 1,100 hospitals and 110,000 physicians.This would result in payment based on final outcome and quality of care provided compared with fee for service, which emphasized volume of care rather than quality.Under the fee-for-service model, unnecessary lab tests were prescribed by physicians which resulted in high reimbursement from insurance companies. A shift to value-based care is the need of the hour to make the healthcare system more efficient and reduce medical cost.UnitedHealth expects that within 10 years, half of all Americans will be receiving health care from physicians operating in highly evolved and coordinated value-based care designs because the outcome clearly demonstrates improved quality and consumer satisfaction while reducing the cost of health care. The company is working toward this structural shift from fragmented fee for service.Year to date the stock has gained 10.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 7.8%.Value-based reimbursement of services has gradually gained ground, but now all the major players Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report), Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) are moving full speed ahead.UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1862,UNH,"After an exponential rise throughout 2017, the U.S. stock markets are witnessing volatility in 2018 so far. Both the major indexes — Dow 30 and S&P 500 — are in the red at present. Stock markets entered correction territory in February due to high inflationary expectations. Following a short resurgence, stocks continued to suffer in March due to President Trump’s tariff policies and the tech stock plunge, which can be attributed to certain company-specific issues.Moreover, U.S. stock markets plummeted on the first trading day of April. The broad-based market selloff in Apr 1 was the worst start to April since the Great Depression of 1929. However, the markets recovered thereafter primarily on the back of strong expectations from first quarter 2018 earnings results.Despite an overall decline, a strong bunch of 13 stocks out of the total portfolio of 30 stocks in the Dow has provided positive returns so far this year. Consequently, it would be a prudent move to invest in some of these stocks with favorable Zacks Rank at the moment.Dow Meltdown: Temporary PhenomenonU.S. stock markets opened on a positive note in 2018. However, markets took a U-turn in February due to fear of inflation which aggravated in March owing to President Trump’s trade policy.Subsequently, the blue-chip index shed 4.3% and 3.7% in February and March, respectively. On Mar 19, Dow plunged 335.60 points or, 1.35%, and closed at 24,610.91. This was the point when this closely watched equity market index ventured into the negative territory for the first time this year.The blue-chip index recovered in April with a gain of 0.4% so far this month. This occurred after trade war fears declined following conciliatory statements from the United States and China. However, on Apr 11, Dow lost 0.9% again as Trump announced his intent to launch a potential military attack on Syria, which is a close ally of Russia.Notably, the blue-chip index is still down 2.1% year to date. However, a closer look at the index’s composition will portray a different story. In 2017, 21 out of 30 stocks of Dow provided double-digit returns. Year to date, 13 stocks are already in the black while three have provided double-digit returns.Solid Earnings MomentumStrong earnings growth potential of major components is likely to aid the blue-chip index return to positive territory in the near-term. Earnings momentum is expected to continue in the first quarter of 2018 buoyed by strong economic fundamentals. Total earnings of the S&P 500 index is expected to be up 16% from the same period last year backed by 7.4% year-over-year growth in revenues. (Read More: Bank Earnings in the Spotlight)Newly introduced tax reforms and deregulation measures are likely to act as a major catalyst for Q1 earnings momentum.  The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35% to 21%. Moreover, repatriation of income will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%. President Trump has also promised removing 75% of the regulations during his tenure, which is likely to help private employers.Robust U.S. EconomyOn Mar 21, the Fed raised GDP growth forecast for 2018 to 2.7% from 2.5% in December 2017. A survey among economists conducted by The Wall Street Journal predicted U.S. GDP would rise 2.8% in 2018.Notably, a strong labor market is acting as the major driver of economic growth. The unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low of 4.1% in March, while workers’ hourly wages rose 8 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.82. In the first quarter of 2018, the labor market added 202,000 jobs on an average per month, better than the Q1 of previous two years.For March, the Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence index stands at 127.7, the second highest since November 2017. Business sentiment also remains healthy. Under Trump’s presidency, the U.S. manufacturing sector is witnessing strong business spending at factories for expensive durable items such as machinery and vehicles.Our PicksStock markets momentum remained largely unhindered despite recent volatility. Steady economic activities and business-friendly policies adopted by the government will pave the way for further stock market growth.At this stage, we narrowed down our search to five stocks within the Dow Jones Industrial Average, each of which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1864,UNH,"Health insurer Aetna Inc.’s (AET  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of $3.19 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.97 by 7.4%. Moreover, the bottom line improved 17.7% from the prior-year quarter.Aetna Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Aetna Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aetna Inc. Quote The year-over-year improvement in earnings was attributable to strong performance across the company’s core businesses. Also, a favorable prior-year reserve development more than offset higher-than-expected flu-related medical costs.Soft RevenuesAetna recorded revenues of $15.22 billion, which declined 1.7% from the year-ago figure of $15.49 billion. This downside was primarily driven by the company’s divested domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses during fourth-quarter 2017. However, the improvement was partially offset by higher adjusted revenues in the Health Care segment.Total expense ratio of 17.9% increased 190 basis points year over year. Pre-tax margin of 10.1% expanded slightly by 10 basis points year over year.The company’s total enrollment decreased to 47.9 million from 50.7 million in the year-ago quarter.Segmental Performance UpdateStarting from first-quarter 2018, Aetna realigned its business segments in order to be consistent with the changes brought in its management structure and internal management reporting. On the basis of this realignment, the company will now conduct its operations in the Health Care segment.The company will provide the remaining portion of its financial results in the Corporate/Other category.Health CareAdjusted revenues were $15.1 billion, up 2% year over year. This upside was attributable to higher membership in the company’s Medicare products, a positive impact of the reinstatement of HIF (Health Insurer Fee) in 2018 along with taking on the new accounting guidance with regard to revenue recognition for the quarter under review. However, lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products as well as the company’s Medicaid products, partially offset this upside.Pre-tax adjusted earnings of $1.5 million remained flat year over year on higher membership in Medicare products and previously announced exit from individual Commercial products. However, lower membership in Aetna’s Commercial and Medicaid products substantially offset the upside.Total healthcare medical benefit ratio (MBR) fell 210 basis points year over year to 80.4% due to higher medical costs, attributable to a more severe flu season during the reported quarter compared with the prior-year period.Financial PositionTotal assets were $59.2 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, up 7.3% year over year.Long-term debt decreased 4.6% year over year to $7.8 billion.Debt-to-capitalization ratio was 35.8% as of Mar 31, 2018 compared with 37% as of Dec 31, 2017.Zacks RankAetna currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other Health Maintenance OrganizationsAmong other players from the industry having reported first-quarter earnings so far, the bottom line of Anthem, Inc.

1868,UNH,"The healthcare sector is fast catching up with the digital revolution. Some of the trending hashtags in the healthcare space are #3DPrinting #BigDataAnalytics #BioPrinting and #ArtificialIntelligence, with #Blockchain being one of the favorites.Now, let’s take a look at how blockchain technology has been opening up avenues for investors who are keen on betting on the healthcare space.Blockchain’s Claim to FameBlockchain came into the limelight as the underlying technology for the most popular cryptocurrency — Bitcoin.An article on Investor’s Business Daily has defined blockchain technology as a shared public ledger, also known as a distributed database, which tracks and records transactions in a transparent and tamper-proof way.The estimates for the uptake of this technology are mind-boggling. Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DB  -  Free Report) expects blockchain systems to record transactions for about 10% of worldwide GDP by 2027. Furthermore, Gartner Group believes blockchains have delivered $4 billion in business value-add or technology innovation in 2017, with that likely to swell to $21 billion, $176 billion and $3.1 trillion by 2020, 2025 and 2030, respectively (per the article on Investor’s Business Daily).Blockchain and HealthcareGiven the rising need for integrating data across plans and providers, the Healthcare sector is poised to gain the most from blockchain’s distributed ledger technology. This hi-end technology has the power to revive the healthcare industry by reorganizing operations, generating new business models and integrating patients’ medical records.On Apr 2, leading health care companies like Humana (HUM  -  Free Report), MultiPlan, Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group’s (UNH  -  Free Report) Optum and UnitedHealthcare formed an alliance to launch a pilot program on this revolutionary technology. This program will study how the technology can be applied to cut down costs related to data management along with enhancing data quality and accuracy.In February, a Medicalchain ICO project, leveraging on the blockchain technology to maintain health records, was launched. Medicalchain allows different organizations like doctors, hospitals, laboratories, pharmacists and health insurers to seek permission for accessing a patient’s health record and store these transactions on the distributed ledger.3 Major Factors Driving the Blockchain & Healthcare IntegrationSystems for recording and managing medical data are slow, centralized and often extremely vulnerable. This in turn leads to a chain of issues that are adversely impacting overall healthcare services. Let’s discuss such problems in detail.Escalating Administrative CostsDoctors, hospitals and diagnostic information service providers, all have been shelling out roughly $2.1 billion every year to manage and hold records of healthcare provider data.We take a note that, recently a major alliance has been formed between Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report). The corporate behemoths came together to put a check on spiraling medical treatment costs by forming an independent health care company for employees in the United States.Medical Error — Leading Cause of DeathU.K.-based publisher of medical journals and clinical research, BMJ stated in a 2016 podcast that around 250,000 deaths every year in the United States are caused by medical errors (per an article on Crypto Currency News). The blockchain technology gives providers instant and complete access to a patient’s medical records.Growing Need to Strengthen Data SecurityThere is a growing need for healthcare organizations to prevent data hacking and phishing while maintaining confidentiality of patient’s health information. In this regard, a Cognizant research report states that around 49% of respondents in a survey stated that the transparent and tamper-proof nature of the transactions stored using the blockchain technology platform helps enhance customer satisfaction.Challenges Impeding the TransitionSince blockchain is a relatively new technology, it indeed is a challenge for key decision makers to understand its functionality and applicability.One of the most common problems faced by adopters of this technology is to maintain and streamline operations between different blockchains. Complicating the situation is the availability of various networks, each with different market strategies and structures. These networks are continuously competing to become the TCP/IP standard for blockchain. Per a Cognizant report, 62% of the respondents have cited this issue as a major bottleneck.Legal and regulatory issues also make adoption of this technology tough. Per a Cognizant report, healthcare payers and providers need to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) standards for governing the privacy and availability of Protected Health Information which impedes the uptake of blockchain.  Wrapping UpBlockchain technology holds immense potential to completely alter the healthcare space by addressing the key issues plaguing it.  In the words of Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld, blockchain “is the biggest opportunity set we can think of over the next decade.”Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1871,UNH,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has decided to raise 2019 Medicare Advantage reimbursement rate by 3.4%. Notably, CMS previously proposed a hike of 1.84% in February but this rate increase is higher than expected.Following the announcement, shares of companies with exposure to the MA business like UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) rallied.Medicare Advantage (“MA”) plans were initiated by the government some years ago to control the rising cost of Medicare, a government program for the retirees. Notably, this MA plans were administered by private insurance companies. The health insurers often add extra benefits to make these plans more appealing to consumers, thus justifying its name — Medicare Advantage. The government reimburses a certain amount per enrolee to the health insurers in return of the care provided.Why Is Government Pitching for High Reimbursement Rates?MA reimbursement rates for private plan increased by 0.45%, 0.85% for 2018, and, 2017, respectively. The higher-than-expected increase in reimbursement rate for 2019 is meant  to attract the private health insurance players with the aim of increasing managed care participation. This move will alleviate government healthcare which is reeling under high Medicare costs.According to CBO, total Medicare spending is expected to increase from $708 billion to $1.4 trillion from 2017 to 2027.  Medicare spending is anticipated to rise more rapidly relative to GDP owing to a number of factors, including the aging population and faster growth in health care costs compared with growth in the economy on a per capita basis. In an effort to decrease the government’s burden of rising healthcare costs, it intends to rope in health insurers who are effective in managing costs.In fact, the government has actually witnessed cost reduction by delegating Medicare to the private players and is encouraging customers to opt for Medicare Advantage. The recent higher-than-expected rate highlights the government’s efforts to stabilize these plans and provide enough resources to the insurance companies to support beneficiaries enrolled in private Medicare plans.A Cash Cow for Health InsurersMeanwhile, these plans have been highly profitable for the health insurers. Since MA members have higher medical utilization rates, they bring in about three times more revenues than commercial members. This trend has aided top-line growth of the companies engaged in MA. Further, the health insurers have been able to maintain profitability in these plans by keeping claim cost down via measures such as preventive healthcare and accountable care organizations. This business has proven to be boon for the health insurance industry.In a year’s time the industry has gained 33.7% compared with the S&P 500 growth of 11.9%.MA — the Catalyst Behind Mergers and Acquisitions in the IndustryThe lucrative nature of this business along with the players’ intention to stake a claim in this rapidly growing market has fueled a number of mergers and acquisitions in the industry.According to KPMG, MA has only been around since 2003 but it is rapidly gaining popularity as a health plan and also among seniors dissatisfied with traditional Medicare. MA plans are in great demand amid the baby boomers, a rapidly growing generation, presenting an immense business opportunity.  KPMG projects the baby boomers population to be nearly 72 million by 2030 and almost 87 million by 2050. Per Anthem CEO Gail Boudreaux, 11,000 baby boomers age into Medicare eligible population ever single day.Analysis from Strategy&, PwC’s strategy consulting business, projects annual revenues for MA plans to rise from US$215 billion in fiscal year 2017 to more than $500 billion by 2025.The most recent merger speculation doing rounds is that of Walmart’s intention to buy Humana (which has nearly two thirds of its revenues coming from MA). Notably, this buyout also hinges around the coveted MA business. Its crystal clear that Walmart is planning to cash in on the MA business via Humana, an established player in this field.Recently Anthem stated that it is working to capture its fair share of the MA market.Other big acquisitions in this arena in  were UnitedHealth Group’s buyout of XLHealth Corporation, Preferred Care Partners and Medica HealthCare Plans. Further, Cigna's acquisition of HealthSpring, Humana’s takeover  of MD Care and Aetna Inc.'s (AET  -  Free Report) buyout of Genworth’s Medigap business are also noteworthy.  In the same vein, WellCare Health Plans, Inc. acquired Universal American Corp. last year and is still on hunt for MA opportunities.Bottom LineGiven that MA is one of the few areas which has a bipartisan support, its future remains bright. Industry analysts believe that the recent increase in reimbursement rates will lead to strong enrollment growth in this business in next five years.Also the players thirst for MA business still remains unquenched; consequently we expect more mergers and acquisitions on this front.Among the companies discussed above UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Anthem, Humana and Aetna all carry a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1872,UNH,"On Monday, President Trump stepped up the rhetoric on pharma companies, saying that his administration would soon take action to bring down drug prices. This is in keeping with promises he made on the campaign trail as well as comments made last year and during his State of the Union address.Meanwhile, industry watchers have grown skeptical about Trump’s intermittent pronouncements on this issue. Also, key government databases which reveal the quantum of funds spent on healthcare have not been updated recently, raising questions on the administration’s seriousness about taking action.Given this backdrop, it makes good sense to invest in select biotech stocks, especially those of small companies focusing on developing cutting edge treatment.Drug Price Cuts around the Corner?On Monday, Trump delivered a speech on the federal government’s initiatives to fight the country’s opioid addiction crisis at Manchester, New Hampshire. During his speech, Trump launched into pharma companies, raising the issue of exorbitant drug pricing once again.Trump said that consumers in the United States were paying more for drugs than many other countries across the world and his administration would work toward changing that situation. The President said that citizens of the United States would witness “drug prices falling very substantially” but characteristically avoided mentioning any specifics.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also pitched in during the event to reveal that an entire raft of proposals would be introduced to reduce the price of prescription drugs. Azar too refrained from mentioning concrete plans, choosing only to praise UnitedHealth Group Incorporated’s (UNH  -  Free Report) decision to pass on discounts obtained from pharma companies to customers.Skepticism on Concrete Action AboundsApart from the comments made on the election trail, Trump has called for strong action on drug prices intermittently. In November last year, when Trump appointed Azar to his current position, he claimed that the former chief of the U.S. arm of Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) would be “a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices.” Trump even chose to take up the issue during his State of the Union Address saying drug prices would come down during his tenure.But little action has followed all this tough talk. A much discussed executive order on drug pricing has failed to materialize despite the fact that pharma companies have raised prices of several drugs during Trump’s tenure. Trump met leading pharma officials before completing his first month as President and even had them seated at this table at the World Economic Forum in Davos.Further, Trump has hired several former pharma industry employees for his administration, including Azar, during whose tenure prices of several drugs increased more than 100%. Meanwhile the Department of Health and Human Services has failed to update databases which reveal the quantum of government funds spent on healthcare, including the costs of drugs.This is proving to be advantageous for pharma companies since they can now avoid revealing details on drug pricing. This in turn affects efforts by researchers and non-profit groups who work toward lowering the prices of key drugs.Our ChoicesIndustry watchers feel that pharma investors have gotten used to Trump’s rhetoric on drug prices and largely choose to ignore any such comments. Meanwhile, Trump has inducted several former pharma industry employees into his administration, appointing some to key positions.This is why the outlook for pharma companies, especially those from the biotech industry focusing on unique treatments, remains undimmed. Investing in select biotech stocks looks like a good option at this point. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (BHVN  -  Free Report) is a biopharmaceutical company which focuses on the identification and development of orphan neurologic indications and other neurological pathways.Biohaven Pharmaceutical has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1874,UNH,"Following Cigna Corp.’s (CI  -  Free Report) announcement to buy the pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co. (ESRX  -  Free Report), rating agencies A.M.Best and Moody’s has sprung into action.Under the terms of the deal, Cigna will pay $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the newly combined company. Upon closure, Express Scripts’ shareholders will own approximately 36% of the combined company.A.M. Best has placed under review with negative implications the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “a” of the key life/health subsidiaries, health maintenance organizations, New Zealand and European insurance companies of Cigna.The FSR of A- and Long-Term ICRs of “a-” of Cigna Supplemental Benefit Companies, as well as the Cigna HealthSpring companies have also received the same treatment.A.M. Best has placed under review with negative implications the Long-Term ICR of “bbb” and the Long- and Short-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR; Short-Term IR) of Cigna.The move sent the shares down, declining 1.75% to close at $164.39 in last trading session.Since the announcement of the deal, the stock has lost 13% against the industry’s growth of 2.1%.The rating agency's concerns stem from Cigna’s higher leverage ratio due to the use of $22.5 billion of new debt to finance the Express Scripts transaction. The funding will expectedly cause the leverage ratio to go up to 49%, while its goodwill plus intangibles to equity ratio will likely exceed 125%. Though the company’s capacity to service its debt, as measured by interest coverage ratio, will fall under 10x, the level is still considered as strong.The deal, being one of the biggest in Cigna’s history, might pose significant execution risks.  There is also a fear of customer losses from Express Scripts, which might dent the combined entity’s growth to some extent.Last week, another rating agency, Moody's Investors Service placed Cigna’s debt ratings on review for downgrade (senior at Baa1) as well as the A1 insurance financial strength ratings of some of its operating subsidiaries.Despite initial skepticism from the rating agencies, we believe that Cigna will be able to secure back its favorable rating after it utilizes the synergies from the acquisition to pay back debt.The transaction is expected to result in total cost synergies of $650 million and double-digit accretion to earnings in the first year after its closure. As a result, Cigna expects the deal to increase earnings per share from $18 to $20-$21 in 2021.Cigna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks worth considering in the same space are Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report). While Centene sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), UnitedHealth holds the same rank as Cigna.

1876,UNH,"Benchmarks closed mixed on Thursday with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ending in negative territory, even as the Dow finished in the green. Special counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly subpoenaed Trump Organization for Trump’s business-related documents. This factor along with trade war fears weighed on investor sentiment.The S&P 500 fell for fourth straight-day, its longest such stretch of decline since last December. However, the Dow managed to post a one-day rise of around 116 points, after investors indulged in bargain hunting, seeking out blue-chip stocks on the dip.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.5%, or 115.95 points, to close at 24,873.66. However, the S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,747.33. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,481.74, losing 0.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 3.3% to close at 16.67. A total of 6.65 billion shares were traded on Thursday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.08 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.31-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Trade War Fears, Mueller’s Subpoena Drag IndexesLate on Tuesday, Trump reportedly said that the U.S. is looking to impose “tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports.” Further on Thursday, he stated that the U.S. is thinking of imposing tariffs of more than $30 billion on Chinese imports“as part of a package of anti-China measures,” per a Wall Street Journal report. Trump’s protectionist stance raised concerns over a possible retaliation by other countries including China.Additionally, The New York Times reported that special counsel Robert Mueller has subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents relating to Trump’s businesses. This subpoena was issued in connection with an inquiry into Russian involvement in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Following this development, two key indexes, S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted losses for the fourth consecutive session.The Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) decreased 1.3%, becoming the worst performing sector among the S&P 500. Some of its key holdings, Monsanto Company , CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) and Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) fell 4.8%, 3.3% and 2.3%, respectively.Investors’ Bargain Hunting Boost the DowRecent uncertainty resulted in decline in stock prices, which encouraged investors to buy on the dip and focus on blue-chip stocks. Following this development, the Dow was the only key index that managed to end in the green. Dow component UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) increased 1.8% and was the biggest contributor to the blue-chip index’s gains on the day. UnitedHealth Group has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1877,UNH,"The Dow traversed a difficult week, declining over three consecutive trading sessions. Investors remained concerned over the prospects of a trade war following President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump’s decision to dismiss Secretary of State Rex Tillerson added to investors’ jitters. Ultimately, investors looking to pick up blue chip stocks on the dip helped the index finish in the green on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 1.8% on last Friday, moving past the 25,000 mark for the first time since Feb 28. Upbeat jobs data and lower wage growth subdued inflationary concerns and curbed rate hike fears. The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, exceeding the consensus estimate of 208,000 job additions. However, average hourly wages rose only 0.1% in February, lower than January’s 0.3% increase.The index gained 3.3% last week. President Trump signed his tariff plan into law per which fresh levies of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports will be imposed. However, the plan excludes countries like Canada and Mexico, offering Trump a chance to renegotiate terms of the NAFTA with the two countries. Also, the United States wants to discuss national security issues with both these countries.The Dow This WeekThe index declined 0.6% on Monday. Investors remained concerned about the prospects of a trade war following Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum. Fears of this nature dragged industrials lower during the session, a decline which weighed on the broader markets.Three Dow components from this sector, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) declined 1.9%, 0.6% and 2.9%, respectively.The index lost 0.6% on Tuesday after the Trump administration dismissed U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Additionally, Trump ordered Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) to abandon the planned takeover of QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report), following which shares of Qualcomm declined and weighed on the broader markets.Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.2% in February, in line with the consensus estimate. This figure was lower than January’s increase of 0.5%. This development significantly reduced rate hike fears.The index decreased 1% on Wednesday, ending in the red for the third consecutive trading day following concerns over a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. Any hostile move from China will jeopardize Boeing’s performance, which is why its shares fell 2.5%, weighing on the Dow, which registered a one-day decline of around 250 points. Shares of 3M declined 1.4%.The index rebounded on Thursday, increasing 0.5%. Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly subpoenaed Trump Organization for Trump’s business-related documents.

1878,UNH,"Jubilant Republicans delivered a tax bill to President Trump before Christmas, as promised. The Republican tax plan got the final approval by the House that gave Corporate America a massive permanent tax break. This in turn will encourage corporations to invest more in the United States, resulting in a rise in wages, jobs and a stronger economy.While miners, energy, retailers, tech, banks and pharma are expected to enjoy the biggest gains from the tax package, health insurers and hospitals are poised to lose. Needless to say, moneyed Americans like Trump will also make the most of the tax overhaul.House Gives Final Approval to Tax BillThe House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years, sending a $1.5-trillion tax bill to the President for signature. The House was compelled to vote again, after it was discovered that the bill they had earlier passed violated some of the necessary rules for Senate Republicans to pass it with simple majority. The House, nevertheless, passed the tax reform bill by 224-201 majority, while the Republican-led Senate had earlier passed it by a vote of 51 to 48.Republicans successfully countered opposition from Democrats to pass the bill that will slash corporate taxes and provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. The headline-grabbing move was that the corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented next year, instead of being delayed until 2019.Republicans also repealed the 20% corporate alternative minimum tax, while any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%. Immediate offset of spending on short lived capital equipment is expected to further save U.S. companies around $32.5 billion in 2018, as per Congress’s joint committee on taxation.Winners & Losers From the Republican Tax BillAmong the largest beneficiaries of the tax bill include mining, accommodation and food services that can make use of the allowance for short lived equipment. Levies for repatriating overseas profits will boost major automakers like General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor, according to UBS. Meanwhile, the reduction in effective rate will be a shot in the arm for energy players as they pay the second-highest tax rate at 37%, per Bloomberg Intelligence.For retailers, the bill will be beneficial on multiple fronts. A tax relief among the wealthy and middle-class will increase discretionary income that may boost demand for consumer goods, while big consumer product makers such as The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and Pepsico have large cash holdings offshore that can be used for innovation and deal making, noted Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ken Shea.One-time low tax rate on foreign profits will also help multinationals including large tech majors to bring funds held overseas back to the United States. Bringing back massive overseas cash pile will help tech companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, pay dividends and M&A activities.Let us not forget that tech behemoths like Apple Inc. AAPL, Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Oracle hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan.Banks also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut to 20% (read more: Wall Street Hits Record Highs on Tax-Cut Optimism: 5 Gainers).American biopharma companies, in the meanwhile, make up one-third of the top 30 U.S. firms with the most cash abroad. A slashed tax rate for repatriated offshore cash, thus, will benefit big drug makers like Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) ($39 billion offshore), Gilead Sciences ($32 billion), Pfizer (about $22 billion) and Merck & Co. (about $20 billion), according to a recent Credit Suisse report.The report further added that lowering of corporate tax rates will b enefit certain drug makers that pay high effective tax rate and have lower foreign income. The main companies among them are Bioverative (36% effective tax rate), United Therapeutics (37%) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (33%).However, the bill is a mixed bag for health care. Repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate won’t help health insurers and hospitals. The provision required every American to have health insurance coverage or less pay a fine. Ending of such a provision will reduce the number of people who buy insurance coverage. And for hospitals, a lesser number of insured people mean fewer paying customers.But, for individual UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report), a drop in the effective tax rate will boost profits by as much as 15%, according Ana Gupte, an analyst at Leerink Partners. The health insurer had payed about 32.5% income tax in the third quarter.Wind Up: Big Victory for TrumpThere is no doubt that passing of the bill is a great victory for Trump, both politically and personally. He had pledged to provide such business-friendly policies since his election years.  Such promises have also helped the broader equity markets gain traction and the major bourses hit a series of record highs this year. Further, these measures are likely to help the markets sustain the current bull run heading into 2018.In addition, a legislative win is beneficial for Trump and his family. Remember, the tax bill trims the ultra-rich individual tax bracket from 39.6% to 37%, while the “pass-through” provision will provide a major windfall to wealthy investors like Trump.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

1880,UNH,"The mega merger of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) with Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) announced recently has sent jitters across the hospital sector, which is already suffering from low patient volumes, soaring costs, increasing bad debts, and an uncertain regulatory climate among other issues.Increasing EncroachmentThe deal between a health insurer, Aetna and a pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy store company, CVS Health, is expected to eat into the business of hospital companies. The companies aim to bring affordable cure to patients at increased convenience. This implies greater emphasis on value-based care rather than fee for service care.The players are structuring their offerings in a way that should keep patients away from hospitals. In this regard, they are being provided necessary services at home or an outpatient location. This should shift patient traffic for emergency rooms away from hospitals.“The overuse of emergency department adds an estimated $38 billion in wasteful spending every year, so tremendous savings can be realized by utilizing local care solutions in a more integrated fashion,” according to Aetna’s CEO Mark Bertolini.Further competition is being posed by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), which is voraciously spreading its business in this space via its OptumCare unit by acquiring doctor clinics, urgent care facilities and surgery centers. Last week, UnitedHealth Group’s Optum unit announced that it would pay nearly $5 billion to buy DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc.’s (DVA  -  Free Report) Medical Group and its clinics and urgent care centers.The expansion of UnitedHealth and CVS Health in outpatient facilities is likely to create challenges for big names in the hospital industry such as Tenet Healthcare, HCA Holdings and Community Health Systems. The country’s nonprofit hospital industry may also not be spared.The industry underperformed the S&P 500 index last year, as evident by growth of just 2.8% compared with a rally of 20% by the former.Recourse Being TakenPlayers in the hospital industry are coming together to gain in scale and size to face growing invasion. According to a Wall Street Journal report, hospital operators Ascension Health and Providence St. Joseph Health are mulling to merge which should create the nation’s largest hospital chain.Two major Midwestern hospital operators, Advocate Health Care and Aurora Health Care, are combining to lead cost-effective operations. Catholic Health Initiatives and Dignity Health are merging, bringing together 139 hospitals and projecting combined revenues of $28.4 billion.Consolidation is the Name of the GameConsolidation in the hospital industry is already rampant, driven by the increased need by players to build scale and new capabilities, increase service offerings, and expand geographically to find a solid footing in an uncertain healthcare environment.According to the latest analysis by Kaufman Hall, a leading provider of strategic and financial consulting services, hospital and health system partnership transactions for 2017 were total 87 as of the end of the third quarter, implying that transactions may exceed 102 deals completed in 2016. Last quarter, 29 transactions were announced, slightly less than 31 deals announced in the second quarter.With the trend not likely to see any reversal anytime soon, we expect further deals down the line.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1885,UNH,"Following the recent announcement by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) to buy DaVita Medical Group — a unit of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) — the rating agency A.M.Best has sprung into action.In fact, the credit ratings of UnitedHealth as well as its insurance and health maintenance organizations’ subsidiaries were kept intact by A.M.Best.The acquisition to be made by the company’s unit — OptumCare — is expected to enhance the number of its outpatient facilities in California, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico and Washington.  Also, the buyout would strengthen Optum’s geographic presence of its primary and specialty providers, and care delivery locations.The latest deal is in sync with company’s goal of providing efficient care at affordable cost. UnitedHealth has also bought SurgicalCare and Advisory Board and seems to be on an acquisition spree in 2017.  From the point of view of financial leverage, the rating agency notes that the deal is likely to be financed by a combination of cash and debt that might raise the leverage ratio. However, the same is expected to be brought down to more manageable levels of approximately 40%, on repaying debt.UnitedHealth’s deleveraging action to bring its leverage ratio to nearly 40% level at the end of third-quarter 2017 from much higher levels in 2016 and 2015 raises A.M.Best’s optimism on the company’s debt management abilities.In fact, the rating agency views favorably the company’s interest coverage ratio which stands at north of 10 times. Additionally, A.M.Best’s significant financial flexibility backed by its sizeable commercial paper program, parent company cash, subsidiary dividends and credit facility is commendable.UnitedHealth is better placed than other companies in the same space with respect to access to unregulated earnings and cash flows from its Optum unit.However, the company’s goodwill which exceeds 180%, remains a concern. This is because it puts pressure on UnitedHealth’s balance sheet. Yet, UnitedHealth has not undertaken any write down of goodwill and the recent acquisitions have added to the segment’s earnings.In the past six months shares of UnitedHealth have gained 21%, higher than the industry's growth of 20%. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1887,UNH,"UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) Optum unit has announced the buyout of DaVita Medical Group, a unit of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report), for $4.9 billion in cash.This acquisition will be made by OptumCare — a sub-segment of Optum — the company’s health services segment. OptumCare provides primary and urgent care delivery services business.This is the company’s third deal this year to expand its medical services business. It is expected to close in 2018. In March, the unit bought Surgical Care Affiliates for about $2.3 billion. Last month, Optum also bought the health unit of Advisory Board Co., which advises hospital systems.The company is on an acquisition spree to build its Optum segment gradually. In this regard, the Catamaran and the MedExpress buyout in 2015 are worth mentioning.The expansion of this segment, which complements its core health benefits business under UnitedHealthcare, should poise the company strongly for growth in an increasingly regulated market.In the last year, shares of UnitedHealth have gained 38%, in line with the industry's growth it belongs to.UnitedHealth has been continuously adding related businesses to transform itself from just an insurance company to a comprehensive healthcare provider. The company will now offer a bouquet of services that include selling of health insurance coverage to pharmacy benefit management to improve physician practices.This transformation is also necessitated by the company’s need to control soaring medical costs to protect margins. Getting vertically integrated, better equips the company to provide superior healthcare services at reasonable costs by ruling out duplication of services and playing a more direct role in medical services.Meanwhile, an increasing trend of vertical consolidation is being witnessed across the industry, which is itself undergoing rapid transformation owing to heightened regulation, soaring medical costs, increased consumerism, shift to value based care.Another deal in the same vein is that of the buyout of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report), which would enable the surviving company to sell a range of services and products from drug to insurance cover.We strongly believe consolidation in the sector to continue, which would lead to more deals of this kind going forward.UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1888,UNH,"Shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) decreased 1.2% at market close on Apr 17, 2018 despite beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and revenues. This was primarily due to the fact that its top- selling drug, Remicade witnessed a 17% decline in sales, owing to recent competition in the United States.The company’s revenues increased 12.9% on a year-over-year basis to $20.1 billion in first-quarter 2018 and came ahead of the consensus mark of $19.5 billion.Increase in sales was driven primarily by strong sales of cancer drugs, favorable foreign exchange trends and recent acquisition activity. In June 2017, JNJ in its biggest ever acquisition bought Swiss biopharmaceutical company, Actelion for $30 billion.Johnson & Johnson reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $2.06 for first-quarter 2018, up 12.6% year over year and 18.4% on a sequential basis. It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01.Segment Sales and OutlookThe company reported increase in sales by geographical segments. U.S. sales increased 6.1% to $10.0 billion from $9.4 billion in the year ago quarter, while International sales increased 10.9% to $10.1 billion from $8.4 billion.Moreover, on a business-segment basis, the company reported improvements in all the three segments. Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical devices revenues increased 5.3%, 19.4% and 7.5% respectively.Although the company is facing headwinds related to sales of some of its key drugs like Remicade and Zytiga, certain new drugs are expected to make up for the loss. Its blood cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica delivered strong sales growth in the quarter. However, the company’s high dependence on the pharma segment is a concern, as the consumer and medical devices segment failed to register attractive growth.Although J&J still expects 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.00-$8.20, it increased its revenue guidance to a range of $81.0-$81.8 billion from $80.6-$81.4 billion expected earlier.In the current scenario, we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that have a relatively high exposure to Johnson and Johnson (see all Health Care ETFs here).Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to healthcare stocks and tracks the Health Care Select Sector Index.

1889,UNH,"The recent announcement by Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) to acquire pharmacy benefits manager, Express Scripts Holding (ESRX) corroborates the fact that the healthcare industry is shifting gears.The coming together of two different sections (health insurers and the pharmacy benefit managers) of the healthcare space asserts that business boundaries are getting blurred. Healthcare companies are making concerted efforts to transform themselves into comprehensive healthcare providers, a one-stop solution for their customers.Recent Spate of DealsThe first deal of this kind was CVS Health's acquisition of Aetna, announced last December. The transaction, valued at nearly $77 billion, is slated to go through in the second half of 2018.  Following this news, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) announced the buyout of the primary and urgent care services of DaVita Inc. for nearly $5 billion.However, UnitedHealth can be considered a pioneer in this aspect, having acquired Catamaran, a pharmacy benefit management company in 2015. The buyout has proved highly accretive to UnitedHealth and contributed meaningfully to its results.What’s the Driving Factor?Pressure to slash costs to protect margins and the need to counter growing competition are the primary catalysts for the merger and acquisition wave sweeping through the industry.  Insurers are under pressure to protect margins due to high medical cost, growing consumerism and high regulations. Meanwhile, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) are facing the prospect of fierce competition especially given that the tech giant, Amazon.com Inc., is making inroads in the pharmacy business. Amazon recently announced a joint venture with JPMorgan Chase and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway in order to curb medical costs for their employees.Teaming up with other forward or backward integrated companies consequently seems the best survival strategy to provide businesses with additional strength and a wider spectrum.Given the vertical integration nature of these deals, odds of getting a clearance from regulators seem high. Cigna’s merger with Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Aetna’s with Humana were blocked by regulators last year, on concerns that the combination would stifle competition in the healthcare industry since both the companies had overlapping businesses.The Impact of These CombinationsPBMs provide a wide range of services including formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy and infusion services,. It also provides retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management. They function to negotiate of prices with drugmakers looking for additional rebates and discounts so as to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers.Their clients include insurance companies with the focus on providing drugs that are beneficial as well as cost-effective. Tie up with PBMs better equips health insurers to negotiate discount with drug manufacturers which should lower insurers’ medical costs.These combinations should be well-positioned to cater to the health needs of populations especially the 50% of Americans with chronic conditions that account for more than 80% of all health care costs. Getting vertically integrated would better equip health  insurers to provide superior healthcare services at reasonable costs, by ruling out duplication of services and playing a more direct role in medical services.Consequently along with providing growth opportunities for business these evolving entities would also better serve customers. Such changes therefore bode well for both the consumers and the producers.U. S. healthcare expenditure has been on the rise and though ways are being devised to control costs, a reversal in trend seems difficult to achieve. Companies in this space are thus set to thrive given continued demand for better healthcare needs.Promising Stock PicksWe therefore point out some stocks in the space that carry a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have outperformed the industry’s growth of 34.5% in a year’s time.

1891,UNH,"Waves of mergers and acquisitions have been heating up the healthcare space this year that could change the landscape of healthcare business. This is especially true given that health insurers are trying to consolidate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain.The latest catalyst is the health insurer Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), which has planned to acquire the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding (ESRX  -  Free Report) for $67 billion, including $15 billion in debt. The moves comes three months after a drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report) agreed to buy the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), for $207 per share or $69 billion (read: 4 ETFs to Gain From CVS-Aetna Deal).Inside The DealUnder the terms of the deal, Cigna will pay $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the newly combined company. Upon closure, Cigna shareholders will own approximately 64% of the combined company.The merged company would create a one-stop shop for customers' healthcare needs, ranging from sale of drugs to insurance cover. It would benefit consumers by bringing together the medical care and pharmacy benefits at one roof to improve treatments and lower costs.The combined company could pose a bigger threat to UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), the largest U.S. health insurer having its own pharmacy benefits unit, and CVS after it completes its merger with Aetna. The move is also to stave off threats from Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), which is making huge expansion in the world of pharmacy business. The e-commerce giant recently announced a joint venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) in order to curb medical costs for their employees.The transaction would result in total cost synergies of $650 million and double-digit accretion to earnings in the first year after it closes. As a result, Cigna expects the deal to increase earnings per share from $18 to $20-$21 in 2021. The deal is expected to close by Dec 31, 2018 and is subject to approval from shareholders of both companies and anti-trust regulatory approvals (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).ETF ImpactThe announced merger has put the spotlight on a few healthcare ETFs that could be the best ways for investors to tap the opportunity arising from the CI-ESRX deal.iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the Dow Jones U.S. Select Healthcare Providers Index with exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment. In total, the fund holds 44 securities in its basket with Cigna and ESRX occupying the fourth and fifth position, accounting for over 5% share each. The fund has amassed $493.7 million in its asset base while volume is light at about 24,000 shares per day on average. It charges 44 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk outlook (read: Trump's 2019 Budget Blueprint: ETF Winners & Losers).SPDR S&P Health Care Services ETF (XHS  -  Free Report)The fund uses an equal-weight methodology to each security by tracking the S&P Health Care Services Select Industry Index. Holding 49 stocks in its basket, CI and ESRX account for 2% share each. The fund has accumulated $91.5 million in its asset base and trades in a paltry volume of around 6,000 shares a day. Expense ratio comes in at 0.35%. The ETF has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook (read: 4 Sector ETFs & Stocks Set to Explode Higher on Tax Cuts).First Trust Health Care AlphaDEX Fund (FXH)This fund follows an AlphaDEX methodology and ranks stocks in the space on various growth and value factors, eliminating the bottom-ranked 25% of the stocks. This approach results in a basket of 73 stocks with ESRX and CI taking 2.4% and 1.4% share, respectively. Health care providers & services is the top sector with 38.4% allocation, followed by healthcare equipment (23.5%), and biotech (18.9%). This fund has AUM of $974.5 million in its asset base and trades in volume of around 85,000 shares. Expense ratio comes in at 0.62% annually.

1892,UNH,"As we saw during yesterday’s closed market futures activity, the Dow looks to gain over 200 points out of the gate this morning. This follows a 200+ gain — and new record high — on Friday as Q4 earnings from some of Wall Street’s biggest banks kicked off a new season of earnings reports.Ahead of Tuesday’s opening bell — starting a new holiday-shortened week as Q4 earnings season heats up — we look toward a small amount of earnings results, but from key companies. After today’s close, we look toward CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) and Pinnacle Finance PNFT earnings. Already this morning, we see two Q4 results from the banking world.Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) posted a beat on both top and bottom lines in its Q4 report, with earnings of $1.28 per share topping the $1.19 expected and the $1.14 from the year-ago quarter. Revenues for the final calendar quarter of 2018 brought in $17.3 billion, slightly ahead of the $17.1 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate.The banking major took a one-time charge of $22 billion ($8.43 per share, non-cash) to account for adjusted deferred taxes based on the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Higher revenues and slightly lower expenses helped the bank beat quarterly estimates. For more on Citi’s earnings results, click here.Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report) is another finance company reporting Q4 earnings this morning, and also surpassed expectations: $1.28 per share beat the Zacks consensus by 7 cents, and revenues in the quarter were way out in front of estimates, $830 million versus the expected $819.6 million. This result also represents a 15% year-over-year gain in quarterly revenues.Over the previous 4 quarters, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-rated Comerica had posted an average earnings beat of 10.1%. The bank also declared a charge based on the new tax law to the tune of $107 million. For more on Comerica’s earnings results, click here.

1893,UNH,"On Wednesday, only a few days after the CVS (CVS  -  Free Report) and Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) deal helped shine a light on the quickly changing healthcare industry, UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) announced that it will buy a unit of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) for nearly $5 billion.UnitedHealth, the country’s biggest health insurer, announced that its Optum division reached an agreement to acquire DaVita Medical Group for roughly $4.9 billion in cash. This deal, which is expected to close in 2018, is aimed to help expand UnitedHealth’s primary and urgent care services.UnitedHealth hopes to pair DaVita Medical Group’s 300 medical clinics, 35 urgent-care centers, and six outpatient surgery centers—which reach around 1.7 million patients a year—with Optum’s massive insurance division.“Combining DaVita Medical Group and Optum advances our shared goal of supporting physicians in delivering exceptional patient care in innovative and efficient ways while working with more than 300 health care payers across Optum in ways that better meet the needs of their members,” Optum CEO Larry C. Renfro said in a statement.Optum also runs its own primary and urgent care centers, surgery centers, and senior and advanced care centers. Officials at both companies noted that the deal aims to help improve and streamline the ability to treat patients.This move is part of a growing shift for health insurers to play a more direct role in actual medical services. Many health insurers now want to be able to provide their own patient care as often as possible. The deal will hopefully cut costs and improve care, given the proximity and number of care centers—especially for people with non-life threatening, chronic conditions.The move comes after CVS announced its acquisition of healthcare benefits giant Aetna on Sunday. The $69 billion deal will allow the companies to offer more healthcare services at CVS stores.UnitedHealth's latest deal is its second acquisition in 2017 aimed at bolstering its offerings beyond insurance. In March, UnitedHealth purchased Surgical Care Affiliates for $2.3 billion.Shares of DaVita soared 12% premarket on the back of the announcement. Since then, the stock has cooled a bit and now hovers up around 10% at $67.20 per share, which is still $3 below its 52-week high.UnitedHealth saw its stock price dip in early morning trading, but shares have since gained around 0.80%. CVS stock dipped slightly on Wednesday following the UnitedHealth and DaVita deal.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1895,UNH,"The healthcare space is consolidating with the latest development being the potential buyout of Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report). A drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS has agreed to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna for $207 per share or $69 billion.This would be the biggest deal of the year and the first tie-up of a retailer, an insurer and a pharmacy benefit manager in history. As such, the proposed deal would change the landscape of healthcare business as well as streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain (read: Top-Ranked ETFs in Focus on Rumored CVS-Aetna Deal).Inside The DealUnder the terms of the deal, Aetna shareholders will receive $145.00 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share. Upon closure, Aetna shareholders will own approximately 22% of the combined company and CVS Health shareholders will own approximately 78%.The merged company would create a one-stop shop for customers' healthcare needs, ranging from employer healthcare and government plans to managing benefits and running drug stores. By owning Aetna, CVS will become the first triple healthcare player: a drugstore, a pharmacy benefit manager and now an insurer. It would be in a better position to negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers. This is because CVS is one of the key players in the pharmacy benefit management business in the United States and often negotiates drug benefits for insurance plans and employers (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).Additionally, the combined company could pose a bigger threat to UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), the largest U.S. health insurer having its own pharmacy benefits unit. The move is also to stave off threats from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report), which is making huge expansion in the world of pharmaceutical drugs and has already received pharmacy-wholesaler licenses in a dozen states.The transaction would result in cost synergies of $750 million and low-to-mid single-digit accretion to earnings in the second full year after the transaction closes. It is expected to close in the second half of 2018 and is subject to approval from shareholders of both companies and anti-trust regulatory approvals. Including the assumption of Aetna's debt, the total value of the transaction is $77 billion.However, the transaction is expected to attract high antitrust scrutiny because of its sheer size and overlaps in Medicare Part D — a government program to subsidize prescription drug costs. Notably, CVS has a market capitalization of $76.1 billion while AET has a market cap of $59.1 billion. As such, the approval of the transaction might call for certain divestitures of Medicare prescription drug contracts.ETF ImpactThe announced merger has put the spotlight on a few healthcare and consumer ETFs that could be the best ways for investors to tap the opportunity arising from the CVS-AET deal.iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the Dow Jones U.S. Select Healthcare Providers Index with exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment. In total, the fund holds 45 securities in its basket with Aetna occupying the third position, accounting for 7.4% share. The fund has amassed $486.3 million in its asset base while volume is light at about 26,000 shares per day on average. It charges 44 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Consumer Staples ETF (CNSF  -  Free Report)The fund targets companies that have the potential to outperform the broad U.S. consumer staples sector and tracks the MSCI USA Consumer Staples Diversified Multiple-Factor Capped Index. Holding 28 stocks in its basket, CVS Health takes the sixth spot, accounting for 6.1% of the portfolio. In terms of industrial exposure, more than half of the portfolio is dominated by food beverage tobacco while household and personal product and food & staples retailing take the remainder with a double-digit exposure each. This ETF has attracted $2.6 million in its asset base and trades in a meager volume of about 500 shares. It charges 35 bps in fees per year and currently has a Zacks ETF Rank of 5 (Strong Sell).PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio (PMR  -  Free Report)This fund offers exposure to the general merchandise stores by tracking the Dynamic Retail Intellidex Index. In total, the product holds 30 securities with CVS taking the fourth spot at 5% of assets. In terms of industrial exposure, specialty retail takes the top spot at 35%, while drug stores (13%), hypermarkets (13%) and food retail (11%) round off the top three positions. The fund has accumulated just $14.5 million in its asset base and charges 63 bps in fees per year. Average daily volume is paltry at 2,000 shares. The ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy), with a Medium risk outlook (read: Best ETFs & Stocks From November's Top Sector).VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the 26 largest retail firms by tracking the MVIS US Listed Retail 25 Index. Of these, CVS takes the ninth position with 4.2% share. The ETF has a certain tilt toward specialty retail, which accounts for 32% of the portfolio, while Internet direct marketing (22%), hypermarkets (12%), departmental stores (10%), and healthcare services (8%) round off the next four spots. The product has amassed $60 million in its asset base and charges 35 bps in annual fees. Volume is light as it exchanges around 13,000 shares per day.

1896,UNH,"Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) will soon be acquired by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report), per a definitive merger agreement.This mega-merger between a pharmacy health care provider, CVS and an insurance company, Aetna, is expected to close in the second half of 2018. Valued at nearly $69 billion, the deal is subject to approval by shareholders of both the companies, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.Notably, the merger-agreement has a greater probability of getting an approval from the regulators since it will be a vertical integration as compared to the horizontal combination (which was feared to create a monopoly in the market and stifle healthy competition among rivals, if passed) of Aetna-Humana Inc. (HUM) deal, which was inked earlier this year.Additionally, the deal seems to be encouraging as it would result in a deadly combination of Aetna’s strong position and its expertise in the health benefits space coupled with CVS’ deep knowledge of the consumers and its leading position in the pharmacy benefits market.This combined entity is anticipated to create a mammoth healthcare set-up with wide-ranging operations from sale of drug to insurance cover.What’s in Store for Aetna?The deal will add to Aetna’s scale and size, and equip it to negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies in a better way. Consequently, this would lower the cost of acquiring prescription drugs, thereby enabling the company to share the savings with its consumers through more customer-friendly insurance plans like enhanced frills or lower premium. This, in turn, might ultimately lead to market-share gain.So far this year, the stock has surged 45%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 42%.Gain for ShareholdersAetna shareholders will receive attractive value from the transaction, including $145 per share in cash and 0.8378 shares of CVS Health common stock. Also, approximately 22% of the combined company will be owned by them. Consequently, these shareholders will be able to be a part of the success and high growth potential of the combined company in the near term.Shareholders will benefit from deal which should result in enhanced competitive positioning, low- to mid-single digit accretion in 2019 including the ability to deliver $750 million in near-term synergies.Consolidation in the Health Care SpaceMergers and acquisition (both horizontal and vertical) in the space is rife, given the necessity of the players to gain in scale and size to weather the changes taking place within the industry.  Such deals (pharmacy benefit managers with insurance companies) are the need of the hour at the backdrop of a changing industry, which is rapidly seeing a rise in consumerism.Also, the increased incidence of specialty drugs that are paid through medical and not pharmacy benefit organizations, necessitates the coming together of medical and pharmacy benefit companies.The takeover of Catamaran by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) back in 2015 was in line with this trend.Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider  Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1897,UNH,"Rumors are rife that CVS Health Corp. CVS is in advanced stages to acquire the health insurer Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) for $66 billion.Pharmacy benefit managers work primarily for insurers and employers and seek to negotiate the drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and drugstores to reduce the pocket-pinch for consumers. This in turn lowers the medical cost for insurers.This news drove the shares of Aetna to a new 52-week high of $192.37. The stock has surged 45% year to date, in line with the industry's growth. We believe, this deal has a greater probability of getting a nod from the regulators since it will be a vertical integration as compared to the horizontal combination (which was feared to create a monopoly in the market and stifle healthy competition among rivals, if passed through) of Aetna-Humana deal, which was blocked earlier in the year.The deal seems a good complement, given that it would lead to a deadly combination of Aetna’s strong position and its expertise in the health benefits space with CVS’ deep knowledge of the consumers and its leading position in the pharmacy benefits market.This combined entity would create a mammoth healthcare set-up with wide-ranging operations from sale of drug to insurance cover.What’s in the Offing for Aetna?The deal will add to Aetna’s scale and size and equip it to negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies better. This would as a result lower the cost of acquiring prescription drugs, enabling the company to share the savings in with its consumers by way of more customer-friendly insurance plans like enhanced frills or lower premium, thus ultimately leading to market-share gain.Consolidation in the Health Care SpaceMergers and acquisition (both horizontal and vertical) in the space is rife, given the necessity of the players to gain in scale and size to weather the changes taking place within the industry. Such deals (pharmacy benefit managers with insurance companies) are the need of the hour at the backdrop of a changing industry, which is rapidly seeing a rise in consumerism.Also, the increased incidence of specialty drugs that are paid through medical and not pharmacy benefit organizations, necessitates the coming together of medical and pharmacy benefit companies.The takeover of Catamaran by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) also falls under this category.Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider  Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stocks in the same space is Triple-S Management Corp.

1906,UNH,"We believe UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) health services business named, Optum, will be a key driver for fourth-quarter earnings. Notably, Optum serves the global health care marketplace including payers, care providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers.The company is investing in this segment with an aim to diversify earnings and seek protection from the highly regulated health services business, which has been significant for the company.  Its revenue CAGR of 21% from 2011 to 2017 (on the basis of expected revenues) is impressive. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues from this segment would be $23.98 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 8.2%.Revenue growth from this segment is expected to be driven by increased contribution from each of its sub-segments namely OptumHealth, OptumInsight and Optum Rx.At OptumHealth, the top line should be aided by growth and market expansion in care delivery as well as increase in consumer health engagement products and services, behavioral health services and health financial services. Also, rise in number of consumers served and an improvement in average revenue per consumer will contribute to the segment’s revenues. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues of $5.4 billion represents 18.8% growth year over year.Meanwhile OptumInsight’s revenues will see accretion from growth in business process management services and data analytics. In fact, this segment has been witnessing an increase in revenue backlog, which reflects strong demand for its solutions. The trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.24 billion, up 7.9% year over year.OptumRx, the company’s pharmacy management arm, has achieved sufficient scale in the PBM business from the acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager — Catamaran — in 2015. Revenues in this segment have been increasing over the past many quarters owing to acquisitions and organic growth. In the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth from a surge in adjusted script grown. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $16.5 billion, up 4.1% year over year.UnitedHealth’s solid market share, growing Optum business, diversified premium revenue and disciplined capital management are also anticipated to aid overall earnings.

1907,UNH,"UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter earnings are expected to benefit from increased number of individuals served across its government businesses.The company is an industry leader and has been growing its enrollment consistently from past several quarters owing to its huge market share in each of the business line it operates.Growth in Medical Membership: We expect medical membership growth in the to-be reported quarter to witness an increase in number of members served in its government business, partially offset by a decline in the international and commercial segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for medical membership is 49.3 million, up 1.4% year over year.This growth in medical membership will be driven by:Higher Enrollment in Public and Senior Markets: Government business, which primarily consists of Medicare and Medicaid, has been an area where UnitedHealth has invested tremendously in the recent years and intends to grow further. Currently, the government business is in huge demand. This is because of increasing baby boomer population, which has been a major contributor to membership growth.Notably, membership in this line of business has secularly risen over the past several quarters. The upside was owing to its relation with AARP and increasing number of Medicare Advantage (MA) plans with 4 stars and the same is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for membership in the Government business is 15.4 million, up 11.7% year over year.Medicare Membership to Grow: Strong membership growth in  MA business must have been led by a combination of premium and benefit stability, rising stars rating performance and improved service, and clinical performance and high retention rates in the fourth quarter. In fact, UnitedHealth’s distinctive product value and consumer experience have enabled it to increase market share in MA, which must have supported enrollment growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for membership in the MA business is 4.4 million, up 21.8% year over year.Higher Medicaid Enrollment: Also, Medicaid enrollment must have gained from the company’s expansion into newer states, contract renewals as well as growth in higher acuity, special needs membership. Increased adoption of states to move Medicaid to managed care should have led the company to gain Medicaid market share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for membership in the Medicaid business is 6.6 million, up 11.7% year over year.Growth in enrollment will be partially offset by:Lower Customers in International Business: However, membership from the company’s international operations that is primarily concentrated in Brazil is expected to remain under pressure due to macro-economic contraction in the private healthcare market.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for membership in the International business is 4.1 million, down 3.3% year over year.Decline in Commercial Enrollment: Furthermore, medical membership growth is likely to be partially offset by a decline in Commercial enrollment, which will be under pressure due to exit from individual exchange markets. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for membership in the Commercial business is 29.8 million, down 2.7% year over year.UnitedHealth’s solid market share, growing Optum business, diversified premium revenue and disciplined capital management are also anticipated to aid overall earnings.

1911,UNH,"First-quarter earnings (reported so far) have showed all-around strength backed by a strong economy. Even the Fed, in a recent comment, stated that “economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.” Business investment “continued to grow strongly,” reinstating the firm footing that the U.S. economy is on.Importantly, the U.S. economy featured a record-low unemployment rate and gradual wage increase, both of which bode well for the healthcare sector. High employment increases demand for healthcare, and in turn the size of the healthcare market. This in turn pushes up the number of participants with the entry of new hospitals or expansion of existing hospitals, expansion of products and services by insurers, higher demand for diagnostic and lab service operators, and more.Moreover, an increase in wages would raise consumers’ propensity to spend on costly healthcare services (it is to be noted that U.S. healthcare is the costliest in the world). While insurance covers a large part of healthcare spending, the rise of high-deductibles health plans in recent years had kept consumers away from the market when the unemployment rate was high and wage growth was low. High deductible requires the insured to pay the initial amount (which is quite high), before the insurance coverage kicks in.The overall bullishness reinforces our sentiment that the growth cadence for the sector should continue. Let’s take a look at the factors affecting Q1 results for payers in this sector.Acute Flu SeasonThe 2017-2018 flu season was severe and has been a shot in the arm for the hospital operators, diagnostic and lab service providers, and companies in the drug supply chain. Most of the hospital companies that reported first-quarter results saw an increase in emergency rooms and inpatient admissions on account of flu.According to an article in Pharmacy Times, this flu season broke records in terms of higher-than-average hospitalization rates. According to the report, the overall and all age-specific hospitalization rates surpassed the end-of-season hospitalization rates for the 2014-2015 season, which was also an influenza-A predominant season categorized as high severity.Nevertheless, increased flu activity has been a pain for insurers, having been slapped with high claim costs as more patients seek treatments and file for claim on their health insurance cover.Aging Population to Fuel DemandThe aging U.S. population has been one of the main drivers for healthcare services, as retirees demand more healthcare services in their old age. The graying population of America has led to an unprecedented rise in demand for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, a private version of the Medicare plan provided by the government to the retirees.While previously Medicare was provided by the government to Americans, saddled with high cost in recent years, the government is increasingly outsourcing this program to the private health insurance, which has effectively managed costs for this program. This has led to an increase in private participation in the MA market. These plans have been highly profitable for health insurers. Since MA members have higher medical utilization rates, they bring in about three times more revenues than commercial members, which has helped top-line growth of the companies engaged in MA. Also, health insurers have been able to maintain profitability in these plans by keeping claim cost down via measures such as preventive healthcare and accountable care organizations. This business has proven to be a cash cow for the health insurance industry. Health insurers UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana Inc., Centene Corp. that have already reported earnings results this quarter have reported an increase in membership in MA, which has aided revenue growth.High CostWe, however, expect to see high capital costs for hospitals as companies invest in the electronic health record system. Moreover, high labor expenses in its largely unionized workforce would cause a rise in labor and wage expenses, which should weigh on their margins. For health insurers, a number of acquisitions made recently should lead to an increase in acquisition integration costs. Adoption of technology would entail greater expenditure too, thereby raising operating costs.Tax ReformAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which became effective in December 2017, companies in the health care space project a reduction in the corporate income tax (CIT) rate.  Most of the companies that have reported first-quarter results so far have seen higher margins on account of lower taxes.The tax reform, however, repealed Obamacare's key requirement that all Americans obtain health insurance, which would cause an increase in uninsured rate. But since this provision will be effective in 2019, we would not feel an impact in the first quarter earnings.3 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Heading in to Q1The aforesaid factors will surely help healthcare companies to emerge as winners in Q1. The healthcare industry is a part of the broader Medical sector.For the Medical sector, we now have Q1 results from 83.1% of the sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index.

1913,UNH,"Dow breached a fresh all time high to surge past the psychological 24,000 milestone on Thursday. The blue-chip index’s rally was fueled by rising optimism about the prospects of tax reforms after Senator McCain promised his support for the Tax Bill. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 also hit a record close following an increase in oil prices after OPEC extended its curbs on oil output till 2018. Finally, initial jobless claims hit a near 45-year low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased 1.4%, to close at 24,272.35. The S&P 500 Index (INX) gained 0.8% to close at 2,647.58. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,873.97, increasing 0.7%. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,704 to 1,071.

Such a stellar rally was buoyed by increased hopes of tax reforms following Senator John McCain’s statements. McCain’s is seen as an important vote in getting the new tax code implemented.After Republican Senators voted on Wednesday to initiate a formal debate on the Tax Bill, McCain stated that he would vote in favor of the Bill. This not only increased chances of the Bill being passed by the Senate on Friday but also boosted investor sentiment.As a matter of fact, members of the GOP can successfully push through the Bill despite losing two votes. This can happen under special budget rules provided all the Democrats and Independents vote against the Bill. In such a case, Vice President Mike Pence could cast his tie-breaking vote to achieve a majority.Senate was expected to vote later on Thursday and if the Bill proposed by the upper chamber is passed, the Senate and House would then have to prepare a new Bill to be presented to President Trump.Also supporting the Dow’s run in intraday trade were shares of United Health Group (UNH  -  Free Report), which gained 2.7%.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?                The S&P 500 also closed at a record, gaining 21.5 points in the process.

The Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLI) and Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLI) increased 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively. Further, S&P 500’s rally was also supported by an increase in oil prices following OPEC’s decision to extend curbs on oil production till the end of next year.Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 index (RUT) of small cap stocks gained 1.4 points to close 1,543.9. The small cap index hit an intraday record of 1,549.37 earlier in the session, following increased optimism around tax reforms after McCain’s comments.Finally, the Nasdaq added almost 50 points to end the session in the positive territory. A rally in major tech stocks such as Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) supported gains for the tech-heavy index.

1914,UNH,"Benchmarks finished mixed on Wednesday as investors rotated out of tech stocks to financial stocks. Investors moved to financial stocks after both Yellen and Powell gave enough hint of a rate hike next month. Meanwhile, the second estimate of the U.S. GDP showed that the economy grew at its fastest pace in three years, which further boosted investors’ sentiment.  While the Dow posted an all-time record finish, the Nasdaq took a beating due to decline in tech stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased 0.4%, to close at 23,940.68. The S&P 500 Index (INX) lost 0.04% to close at 2,626.07. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,824.39, decreasing 1.3%.

The CBOE VIX increased 2.8% to close at 10.31.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Nasdaq tanked almost 88 points to end in the negative territory. The tech-laden index posted its worst single-day drop since Aug 17. Such losses were triggered after the investors rotated out of the tech stocks to financial stocks. Yellen’s comments that a burgeoning U.S. economy would pave way for the future of rate hikes encouraged the investors to move to financial stocks.Moreover, Powell had commented on Tuesday that he would continue to work toward raising interest rates at the same time as gradually unwinding the Fed’s humungous balance sheet. This also bolstered gains for the financial stocks.Shares of major tech players such as Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) all declined 4%, 2.7%, 2.1%, 2.4% and 5.5%, respectively.

Although, eight of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500 ended in the green, gains were negated by sharp losses for the tech stocks. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) declined 2.2%. Such losses for the tech stocks weighed heavily on the broader markets.Finally, the Dow amassed 103 points to close at a record high following better-than-expected GDP data in the third quarter. Such a stellar showing by the blue-chip index was also supported by gains for UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), shares of which increased 3.1% and 2.3%.U.S. GDP Exhibits Highest Rate of Growth Since 2014According to the second estimate, the gross domestic product of the United States expanded at an astounding 3.3% in the third quarter of 2017. This also marks it fastest pace of growth since the third quarter of 2014. Per the report from the Commerce Department, consumer spending, the biggest contributor to economic growth advanced 2.3% in the 3Q17. Further, spending on business equipment shot up 10.4% in the period, also notching up a three-year high. Meanwhile, corporate pre-tax profits have surged 5.4% year-over-year.However, some analysts stated that such figures are rather aggrandized and do not present a true picture of the health of the economy. They have reasoned that inventories accounted for as much as 25% of the GDP growth and if excluded from the calculation, the U.S. GDP stands at 2.5% annual rate of growth.In her final testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Janet Yellen commented that the economic growth is largely broad based “across sectors as well as across much of the global economy.” However, price data in the GDP report clearly indicated that inflation remained well below the targeted 2%.Economic DataThe Fed’s Beige Book report showed that the economy has expanded at a modest to moderate pace.

1915,UNH,"On the recent conference call, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) reiterated its 2017 guidance that was earlier provided with the third-quarter earnings release in October. The company also gave a strong view for 2018.Adjusted earnings per share of nearly $10 are expected to be generated on revenues of approximately $201 billion. The 2017 earnings and revenue guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 24% and 9%, respectively.For 2018, UnitedHealth expects adjusted EPS in the range of $10.55-$10.85, considerably higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.99. The company issued guidance for revenues in the band of $223-$225 billion, much ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $200.11 billion.Cash flows from operations are expected within $13.3-$13.8 billion.The earnings outlook for 2018 is backed by the company’s expectation of higher contribution from its Medicare advantage business, which is anticipated to grow enrollment by nearly 11% and revenues by approximately 13%. The company seeks to achieve this growth on the back of a strong performance in Star Ratings.A key earnings driver for UnitedHealth is its Optum business, a perfect complement to its core managed care operations. The unit is expected to post revenues and operating earnings in the range of $99-$100 billion and $7.8-$8.0 billion, respectively, thus pointing to year-over-year growth of 9-10% and 16-19%, respectively. Numerous acquisitions in the unit have brought it fast-paced improvement and have been very accretive to the company’s overall earnings.Investors took the above news positively, driving the shares up to hit a 52-week high at $216.31.In the past six months, the stock has gained 22.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 20.6%.UnitedHealth has a tradition of providing views conservatively and then beating on its earnings and revenues to surprise investors. Since 2009, the company has surpassed expectations in 24 of the 28 reported quarters.  More good news is that the company is well-positioned for long-term growth by virtue of its diversification, a strong track record, an elite management team and exposure to several higher-growth businesses. Its business model which has a lesser exposure to the Obamacare exchanges and Medicaid (which are on gun point of repeal and replace) provides it a good defence against the changes to be bought.UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks from the healthcare sector are WellCare Health Plans Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report), Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) and The Joint Corp. (JYNT  -  Free Report).

1917,UNH,"We expect UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) results for the fourth quarter of 2107 to show broad-based growth across all segments of the enterprise. The company will reslease results on Jan 16, before the opening bell.Notably, UnitedHealth Care segment is expected to witness an increase in membership across its employer-sponsored, Medicare, Medicaid and international medical benefit offerings, which should drive revenue growth.Factors Likely to Impact Fourth-Quarter Earnings:Higher Revenues from Medicare Business: UnitedHealth has been performing strongly in its government business, which includes Medicare and Medicaid. We expect a solid Medicare Advantage performance to continue in the fourth quarter, driven by the combination of premium and benefit stability, rising stars rating performance, improved service and a clinical performance, all leading to record retention rates.Revenues in the Medicare & Retirement line of business are expected at $16.4 billion per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, thereby reflecting year-over-year growth of 17%.Higher Enrollment in Public and Senior Segment: The company’s Medicaid business is also performing well with continued growth in membership enrollment. The same is expected in the fourth quarter through new contract awards from states for Managed Medicaid business as well as for expanded services for additional segments of the Medicaid eligible population.We expect to see increased enrollment in the fourth quarter on higher membership in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid plans. Enrollment in the company’s Public and Senior segment is likely to be 15.4 billion per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, up 11.7% year over year.Revenue Growth from Optum: Results should also show a rise in revenues from its health services’ segment, Optum, driven by higher contribution from subsegments namely, OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP.

The company’s negative ESP thus leaves the case inconclusive.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few companies worth considering with the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this quarter:  Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings performance on Feb 6. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.58% and a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

1919,UNH,"Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has extended the existing partnership with Tivity Health, Inc. (TVTY  -  Free Report) through Dec 31, 2022. Per the terms of the alliance, Humana would offer Tivity Health’s SilverSneakers fitness program to its Individual Medicare Advantage and Group Medicare Advantage members.What is SilverSneakers?Tivity Health’s SilverSneakers, founded in 1992, is an overall wellness program offered to Medicare-eligible and group retiree members of participating health plans. It offers a variety of options for all fitness levels and abilities with access to exercise equipments, classes and fun social activities at thousands of locations across the nation.Apart from Humana, another leading health insurer — UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) —  has also been providing Tivity Health’s SilverSneakers programs to its members.What Aids Humana?Humana is associated with SilverSneakers since 2004. The company has been successful in significantly motivating its Medicare Advantage members to actively improve their physical health. The extension of the alliance enables Humana to remain committed toward its Medicare Advantage members in order to help them achieve their best health.Humana’s constant approach toward connecting health and lifestyle has led it to include SilverSneakers as a key element in many of its Medicare Advantage plans to take care of one’s complete health with both physical benefits and social enrichment.The pact with SilverSneakers reflects the company’s focus on preventive healthcare, which benefits both the consumers and the company.  Preventive healthcare saves the consumers from serious sickness by educating them about various health precautionary measures.

1920,UNH,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.’s (WBA  -  Free Report) Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to witness comparable prescription growth as well as strength in retail prescription market. Several planned developments, early benefits of new pharmacy contracts as well as an increase in volume owing to previously announced pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters. We expect this momentum to get reflected in fiscal first-quarter 2018 results, which are scheduled for release on Jan 4.Moreover, rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have been strengthening the retail pharmacy market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board expects this trend to continue. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Challenges in the Retail Pharmacy USAPer management, the pharmacy business is affected by reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix toward 90-day at retail (one prescription that is equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions) and Medicare Part D prescriptions. Moreover, the company expects these factors to affect first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Moreover, collaborations among generic producers and a rise in generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) raise caution.The speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the retail pharmacy market has aggravated matters. To counter competition, Walgreens Boots will have to add more digital and customer-friendly programs.Intensifying competition owing to mergers and acquisitions is also a matter of concern. In this regard, CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report). Following the announcement of the CVS-Aetna deal, another leading health service company — Optum, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) — announced plans to acquire DaVita Medical Group, a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report). Moreover, it is being speculated that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) might soon announce the acquisition of health and well-being company, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) to fend off competition.Steps to Counter ObstacleWalgreens Boots has been leaving no stone unturned to counter challenges.In this regard, the company has been developing and expanding relationships with commercial third-party payers to permit new and enhanced market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks. Notably, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network fixed by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens Boots, as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently-owned pharmacies in the United States.Per management, the prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time. The company’s 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is a lower margin one in comparison to 30-day prescriptions. However, it helps the company tap into opportunities pertaining to patients with chronic prescription needs. It also offers increased convenience and cost efficiency. The company’s U.S. loyalty program, Balance Rewards, also bodes well. Notably, as of Aug 31, 2017, the number of active Balance Rewards members totaled 88.2 million.Rite Aid Deal a PositiveWe currently look forward to the company's agreement to purchase a limited number of Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) stores. While the transition process of these stores is underway, the company expects this phased acquisition to be completed by spring 2018. Notably, Walgreens Boots has purchased 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total transaction value of $4.375 billion.Although the deal is not going to impact the yet-to-be-reported quarter’s results, a number of aspects of it should prove beneficial in 2018. In this regard, the final Rite Aid deal agreement retained the clause to allow Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreens Boots’ affiliate at a cost equivalent to Walgreens Boots’ for about 10 years. Also, Rite Aid will provide Walgreens Boots with certain transition services for up to three years post deal closure.This apart, the deal’s financial value is quite attractive. Post the transaction’s initial closing, synergies of $300 million are expected to be realized within four years. This will be derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.Per Walgreens Boots, this modified merger contract will extend its growth strategy and offer operational plus financial benefits. It will also help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U.S. markets, including the Northeast. Notably, the stores to be purchased are located primarily in the Northeast and Southern United States, while the sites of three distribution centers to be bought are in Dayville, CT; Philadelphia, PA and Spartanburg, S.C. However, to achieve the desired results, the company will have to incur huge expenditures to fully integrate and rebrand the retained stores.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Walgreens Boots is likely to beat earnings in first quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Walgreens Boots has an Earnings ESP of +3.97%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Walgreens Boots carries a Zacks Rank #2.

1923,UNH,"Humana, Inc.’s (HUM  -  Free Report) strong Medicare business positions it for long-term growth. Medicare membership has witnessed a five-year CAGR (2011-2016) of 6.6%. The same trend continued in the first nine months of 2017 as well.The company has been witnessing a consistent growth in revenues since 2002. In fact, the company’s revenues have increased at a CAGR of 16% over the last 11 years. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare contributed significantly to the company’s top line. However, the Trump administration is making every effort to repeal and replace the ACA. Despite the unpredictable nature of regulations and its impact on the industry, Humana continues to be an attractive pick for investors.The company maintains a consistent record of earnings outperformance. In each of the last four quarters, Humana’s bottom line surpassed expectations with an average beat of 6.6%. Following strong third-quarter 2017 results, the company raised its earnings and revenue guidance for 2017. This upbeat guidance boosts shareholders' confidence in the stock.The company aims to create shareholders’ wealth through capital deployment strategies like share repurchases and dividend payments.Year to date, its shares have gained 18% compared with a 36% increase registered by the Zacks Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) industry. However, its solid third-quarter results, raised guidance and strong fundamentals are likely to benefit the stock going forward.However, Humana has been incurring mounting loss in its Individual Commercial business that has been weighing on the company’s bottom line and top line. It has been witnessing significant decline in enrollment in this business. Along with other health insurers like Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana is planning to scale back its participation on this loss-making business in 2018.

1924,UNH,"President Donald Trump’s plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare have created quite an uproar among health insurers.

Hence, revenues of the companies offering these plans are likely to witness a consistent improvement in their government businesses.Moreover, an aging U.S. population that has boosted the overall demand for medical coverage is likely to prove favorable.ObamaCare has significantly benefitted the industry through a reduction in uninsured population, boosting medical enrollment and aiding bad debt management. This trend is likely to drive the fourth-quarter results as well.A diversified product portfolio along with proposed mergers and consolidations are also likely to accelerate growth for health insurers in terms of global expansion as well as strengthening of foothold in existing markets.However, the companies have been facing higher losses on public exchanges that have compelled them to scale back operations or plan an exit from the business.Moreover, health insurers have been seeing escalating operating costs related to regulations, investments in information technology along with fees and taxes that continue to hurt profits.

1927,UNH,"You can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always guarantee superior returns. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision. A company’s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio — the Interest Coverage Ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.What’s the Strategy?Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), which is engaged in designing, building, overhauling, and repairing of ships, has a VGM Score of B and an expected EPS growth rate of 15% for 3-5 years.

1928,UNH,"Tenet Healthcare Corporation (THC  -  Free Report) is a provider of healthcare services through general hospitals and related healthcare facilities. The company has significantly grown inorganically over past many years. It has expanded scale of business, boosted operating capacity and geographical presence through numerous acquisitions, partnerships and strategic alliances. It has also joined forces with companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, Cigna Corp (CI  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana, Centene and many more.Apart from buyouts, the company has been divesting its non-core and unprofitable business units to repay its debt and maintain financial liquidity. In December 2017, the company disclosed its intention to put up its Conifer segment for sale to offer quality health solutions to its clients including its own hospitals and maximize shareholders’ value.Tenet Healthcare is undertaking cost reduction initiatives to lower annual operating expenses by $250 million, with annualized run-rate savings to be achieved by 2018 end. Nearly 75% of the savings are likely to be achieved from actions within the company’s hospital operations and other segment. During the first nine months of 2017, the company’s total operating expenses decreased 1.5% year over year.Tenet Healthcare’s board is going through a reshuffle since Aug 31, 2017 for ensuring the right mix of opinions, skills and experience aimed at enhancing value of the company. To date, three new independent directors with significant healthcare, financial and operational expertise have been appointed. The board will continue its search for additional independent directors who can further enhance its expertise.In a year's time, shares of Tenet Healthcare have lost 1.6%, underperforming the industry’s rally of 6.4%. However, the company’s relentless efforts to create value for investors and other fundamentals are likely to favor the stock going forward. Notably, the stock has a Value Score of A.However, the company’s top line has been declining over the last two quarters due to reduced admissions, inpatient and outpatient surgeries, emergency department visits and total outpatient visits. These can be attributed to the high deductible plans that result in more out-of-pocket expenses of the patients.Another headwind for the company is its rising level of debt. This has led to a rise in interest expenses which, in turn, weighs on the bottom line.Zacks RankTenet Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1929,UNH,"Anthem, Inc.

The deal will allow the company to serve more than 130,000 members in Florida.Share Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, the stock has surged 42%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 38%. Given its progress on fundamentals and strong recent results the rally in the stock should stay alive.Industry TrendMedicare Advantage, a private version of the government-sponsored health insurance for retirees that provides extra benefits and services to seniors, has been in huge demand from the rising population of baby boomers.A number of acquisitions small and big have materialized as the players have been scrambling to grow in this line of business. Some of the notable ones are Cigna Corp.’s (CI  -  Free Report) acquisition of HealthSpring and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) buyout of XL Health Inc.The failed mergers of Anthem Inc. with Cigna Corp. and Aetna with Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) were also aimed at expanding the Medicare Advantage business.Our TakeThis deal comes as no surprise to us given Anthem’s desire to grow in the lucrative MA business. This deal will help especially after its blocked merger with Cigna, which would have made it one of the largest players in the MA market.  The company recently acquired HealthSun, one of the fastest-growing integrated Medicare Advantage health plans and health care delivery networks in Florida.The company is aggressively seeking to put its capital to use and is readily open to attractive acquisitions.

1930,UNH,"Investors seeking momentum may have Vanguard Healthcare ETF (VHT  -  Free Report) on radar now. The fund recently hit a new 52-week high. Shares of VHT are up approximately 29.2% from the 52-week low of $120.38/share.But could there be more gains ahead for this ETF? Let’s take a look at the fund and the near-term outlook to get a better idea of where it might be headed.VHT in FocusVHT focuses on providing exposure to healthcare stocks in the U.S. equity markets. It charges 10 basis points in fee per year and has top holdings in Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Unitedhealth (UNH  -  Free Report) with 9.6%, 5.9% and 5.2% allocation, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017) (see all Health Care ETFs here).Why the Move?The earnings season is off to a strong start with companies in the sector beating estimates. In a latest executive order, Trump aimed at scrapping a key component of Obamacare. The President said that he wanted to end subsidies to insurers that cost $7 billion this year and help millions of low-income Americans pay medical expenses. However, the uncertainty was reduced to some extent as news of the two political parties coming to a bipartisan deal started doing the rounds. Senators of both parties said they reached a deal to stabilize Obamacare for the short term and allow insurer subsidies. This in turn led to a rally in healthcare stocks.More Gains Ahead?Currently, VHT has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium Risk outlook. Moreover, the ETF has a weighted alpha of 22.6. So, there is a promising outlook ahead for those who want to ride this surging ETF a shade further.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1934,UNH,"Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report) is well poised for long-term growth on the back of its membership base that has strengthened due to strategic acquisitions, growing national accounts in the commercial segment and the Medicaid expansion in the government segment. Apart from this, Anthem’s revenues have also been driven by net investment income that started increasing since 2016 due to the interest rate hikes.Anthem’s capital management, backed by solid cash position, also impresses.  The company has been witnessing a consistent rise in its cash flow from operations. This has enabled Anthem to continuously enhance shareholders’ value through several capital deployment initiatives like share repurchases, dividend payouts, etc. In a year’s time, its shares have gained 61%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 40%.The company maintains a consistent record of earnings outperformance. In each of the last four quarters, Anthem’s bottom line surpassed expectations with an average beat of 11.5%. Following strong third-quarter 2017 results, the company raised its earnings and revenue guidance for 2017 for the second time this year. This upbeat guidance boosts shareholders' confidence in the stock.However, Anthem has been incurring mounting loss in its public exchange business that has been weighing on the company’s bottom line and top line. It has been witnessing significant decline in enrollment in this business since 2016. Along with other health insurers like Humana Inc (HUM  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report), Anthem is planning to scale back its participation on this loss-making business in 2018. Although curtailment of this business is likely to save the company from losses, it will lead to a fall in revenues.Moreover, the company’s rising level of debt not only increases financial risks but also raises interest expenses, which weighs on margins.Anthem has also been suffering from higher expenses over past few years, primarily caused by increasing benefit expenses along with selling, general and administrative expenses. This continues to hurt the company’s profitability.Zacks RankAnthem presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

These gains continued into Thursday with the index closing at yet another record high.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow declined by 0.1% last Friday as investors were reluctant to participate in intraday trading ahead of the Christmas holidays.

These deals are either mergers and acquisitions, or joint ventures with local insurance companies.Some of the deals made by the players in this field reflect the emerging trend of globalization.  Recently, Aetna acquired U.K.-based Bupa Group’s Thai business — Bupa Thailand — which will significantly fortify the presence of the former in Asia. Earlier, it had bought U.K.-based company, InterGlobal, which offers private medical insurance to groups and individuals in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Europe.Another insurer, Cigna, operates in India through a joint venture with TTK Group.Notably, UnitedHealth seems focused on achieving fast-paced growth and mergers and acquisitions remain its top priority. In 2017, the company made a number of acquisitions in its health services segment — Optum. The latest deal includes the buyout of DaVita Medical Group — a unit of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) — which was announced early this month.Expansion of the Optum segment remains one of its primary goals, followed by growth of international operations.In last six months, the stock has gained 20%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 18%.UnitedHealth currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1939,UNH,"Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) has completed the acquisition of HealthSun, one of the fastest-growing integrated Medicare Advantage health plans and health care delivery networks in Florida.Financial terms of the transaction were kept under wraps and the consolidation is expected to be slightly accretive to the company’s earnings in 2018.Benefits for AnthemHealthSun is a perfect fit for Anthem given its rapidly-expanding Medicare Advantage (MA) business with vast presence in Florida, the state which houses a large retiree population.Anthem should benefit from HealthSun’s superior health care services through an effective network of primary care clinics, pharmacy support and transportation services plus a narrow network of physician specialists and integrated medical cost management.The acquisition aligns with Anthem’s long-term strategy to grow in the thriving Government business. The integration will allow the company to serve more than 650,000 members in Florida.Share Price PerformanceYear to date, the stock has surged 59% outperforming the industry’s growth of 43%. Given its progress on fundamentals, the recently inked buyout deal should keep alive the momentum in the stock going forward.Industry TrendMedicare Advantage, a private version of the Government sponsored health insurance for retirees, which provides extra benefits and services to senior citizens, has been in huge demand of late from the rising population of baby boomers.A number of small and big acquisitions have been witnessed by the industry with the involved parties scrambling to grow this line of business. Some notable takeovers are Cigna Corp.’s (CI  -  Free Report) acquisition of HealthSpring and UnitedHealth Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) buyout of XL Health Inc.The unsuccessful mergers of recent times namely Anthem Inc.’s with Cigna Corp. and Aetna’s with Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) were also aimed at expanding the Medicare Advantage business.Our TakeThe above-mentioned deal comes as no surprise to us, given the company’s desire to flourish in the lucrative MA business. This deal will boost the company to progress in the business line, especially after its blocked merger with Cigna, which could have elevated it as a leading player in the MA market.  The company is also on track to acquire America’s 1st Choice, a privately held Medicare Advantage organization for profit offering HMO products including Chronic Special Needs Plans (C-SNP) and Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plans in Florida.The company is aggressively seeking to put its capital to fruitful use and is readily open for attractive acquisitions and we expect to hear more from its end on these lines.Anthem carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1942,UNH,"Humana Inc.(HUM  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8, before the market opens.The company has a decent surprise history. It pulled off positive surprises in all of the last four quarters with an average beat of 7.2%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.84% on the back of strong performance by its Retail segment. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The company’s retail segment has been performing well over past many quarters driven by its Medicare and Medicaid expansion initiatives. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter as well. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $11.2 billion that reflects a slight decrease of 1% year over year.The company’s consistent growth in premium revenues has been largely driven by Medical membership growth. Humana has seen solid medical membership increase in its Individual Medicare Advantage and Group Medicare Advantage businesses. For the quarter, Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 14 million, up 48% year over year.Other FactorsThe standalone Prescription Drug Plans membership is likely to have grown, adding significantly to the Medicare business.Nevertheless, Humana is expected to suffer from rising benefit expenses that keep putting pressure on margins.Individual commercial membership is expected to remain a drag due to the rise in premiums along with benefit redesigns in place since the beginning of 2016. Along with other companies like Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report), Humana has also started scaling down this business and plans to exit it in 2018. This segment is expected to affect the company’s results in the third quarter as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Humana is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Humana has an Earnings ESP of -1.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $3.32 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $3.27.

1943,UNH,"Centene Inc. (CNC  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted net income per share of 97 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.2%. Earnings, however, declined 18% year over year on higher expenses.For the fourth quarter, total revenues grew 8% to $12.8 billion from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many states in 2016 and 2017. Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.3 billion by 4%.Full-Year UpdateFor 2017, the company reported adjusted earnings of $5.03, up 13.5% year over year. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.8%.Centene reported total revenues of $48.4 billion, up 19% year over year. The rise was primarily driven by Health Net's results throughout the year, impact of growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many states in 2016 and 2017.At the end of the year, managed care membership totaled 12.2 million, up 7% from 2016.Quarterly Operational UpdateHealth Benefit Ratio (HBR) for the fourth quarter was 87.3% compared with 84.8% in the prior-year quarter. This reflects a year-over-year improvement of 250 basis points (bps).In the quarter, adjusted selling, general & administrative (SG&A) ratio was 10.5%, up 110 bps year over year. The deteriorationis a result of increased business expansion costs over the prior-year quarter. Notably, revenues recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016, relating to the minimum MLR amendment in California, had reduced the quarter’s adjusted SG&A expense ratio. Hence, the expense ratio for the fourth-quarter 2017 appears higher compared to the year-ago quarter.Total operating expenses of $12.6 billion at the end of fourth quarter increased nearly 11% from the prior-year quarter.Centene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Centene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Centene Corporation QuoteFinancial UpdateAs of Dec 31, 2017, Centene had cash and cash equivalents of $4 billion, up 3.6% from 2016 end.Total assets of $21.8 billion grew 8.2%.As of Dec 31, 2017, Centene’s long-term debt totaled $4.7 billion, up 0.9%.For 2017, cash inflow from operations was $1,489 million compared with $1,851 million at the end of 2016.2018 GuidanceCentene expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.95-$7.35, up from the previously guided range of $5.47-$5.87.Total revenues are expected to be in the range of $60.6-$61.4 billion, up from the earlier guidance of $60.0 billion to $60.8 billion.HBR is expected in the range of 86.2-86.7% compared with the previous guidance of 86.3% to 86.8%.Adjusted SG&A expense ratio is expected in the range of 9.2-9.7%, up from the previous guidance of 9.0% to 9.5%. Shares outstanding is expected be between 199.1 million and 200.1 million, down from the previous guidance of 201.1 million to 202.1 million.Zacks Rank and Performance of Other PeersCentene sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1946,UNH,"The healthcare sector has been in the spotlight lately. President Donald Trump targeted drug companies and accused them of charging extremely high prices (read: ETFs in Focus as IMF ups Global Growth Forecast).Market Movers""Prescription drug prices are out of control. The drug prices have gone through the roof,"" Trump said in a meeting, adding, ""The drug companies frankly are getting away with murder. We want to bring our prices down to what other countries are paying.""In a latest executive order, Trump aimed at scrapping a key component of Obamacare. The President said that he wanted to end subsidies to insurers that cost $7 billion this year and help millions of low-income Americans pay medical expenses.The uncertainty was reduced to some extent as news of the two political parties coming to a bipartisan deal started doing the rounds. Senators of both parties said they reached a deal to stabilize Obamacare for the short term and allow insurer subsidies. However, changes in the deal might be in the cards as it has to be passed by the Congress and signed by Trump first.“The solution will be for about a year or two years; it’ll get us over this intermediate hump” Trump said. Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the healthcare sector.Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to healthcare stocks and tracks the Health Care Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $17.6 billion and charges a moderate fee of 14 basis points a year. It has 62 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as almost 50% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings (read: Should You Keep Your Portfolio Healthy with Biotech ETFs?).From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Pharmaceuticals, Biotech and Health Care Providers & Services, with 33.6%, 21.9% and 19.1% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Unitedhealth (UNH  -  Free Report) with 11.1%, 6.8% and 6.1% allocation, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017).  The fund has returned 17.9% in a year and 19.0% year to date (as of Oct 16, 2017). XLV currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.Vanguard Healthcare ETF (VHT  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to healthcare stocks and tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Health Care 25/50 Index. It has AUM of $7.2 billion and charges a moderate fee of 10 basis points a year. It has 360 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as almost 45% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Pharmaceuticals, Biotech and Health Care Equipment, with 30.5%, 24.6% and 17.9% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Unitedhealth with 9.6%, 5.9% and 5.2% allocation, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017).  The fund has returned 19.6% in a year and 20.6% year to date (as of Oct 16, 2017). VHT currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook.Bottom LineXLV is more popular than VHT, as is evident from its higher AUM. However, VHT may be more appealing to investors, owing to its cheaper expense ratio.  VHT also has a more diversified exposure in terms of number of holdings.Moreover, VHT outperformed XLV both on a year to date basis and in a year. VHT returned 1.6% more than XLV so far this year whereas in a year, it returned 1.7% more than XLV.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

The company’s revenues of $19.7 billion increased 10.3% in third-quarter 2017 on a year-over-year basis and 4.5% on a sequential basis. It came ahead of the consensus mark of $19.28 billion.Increase in sales was driven primarily by strong sales of cancer drugs and recent acquisition activity. Earlier this year in June, JNJ in its biggest ever acquisition  bought Swiss biopharmaceutical company Actelion for $30 billion.Johnson & Johnson reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.9 for third-quarter 2017, up 13.1% year over year and 3.8% on a sequential basis.

The President said that he wanted to end subsidies to insurers that cost $7 billion this year and help millions of low-income Americans pay medical expenses. Moreover, Trump took a dig at drug pricing and accused companies of getting away with murder by charging sky high drug prices.The uncertainty was reduced to some extent as news of the two political parties coming to a bipartisan deal started doing the rounds. Senators of both parties said they reached a deal to stabilize Obamacare for the short term and allow insurer subsidies. However, changes in the deal might be in the cards as it has to be passed by the Congress and signed by Trump first.In the current scenario, we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that have a relatively high exposure to Johnson and Johnson (see all Health Care ETFs here).Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to healthcare stocks and tracks the Health Care Select Sector Index.

1950,UNH,"The year 2017 has failed to turn things around for CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report). This leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care has underperformed the S&P 500 market year to date. The stock has lost 5.4% as against the S&P 500 market’s 20.4% gain.During the first-quarter 2017 earnings call, CVS Health’s President and Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo said, “We continue to expect 2017 to be a rebuilding year, but our goals remain clear, and we fully intend to return to healthy levels of growth.” Unfortunately, little of this could materialize. The company is still grappling with issues from the past along with other challenges.2016 Deals Major BlowsCVS Health is still trying to recover from the setback caused by Prime Therapeutics’ collaboration with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) in August 2016. Owing to this, CVS Health lost access to Prime’s 22 million members. Notably, Prime Therapeutics is the fourth largest Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) in the United States owned by 14 leading Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans.Another major blow was dealt at the end of 2016 when the TRICARE retail pharmacy network managed by Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) restricted CVS pharmacies, including those in Target stores, from participating. This network, with more than 57,000 locations, included Walgreens Boots as a member instead.Thanks to these developments, CVS Health’s shares lost 15.2% in the last five months of 2016.   2017 Hasn’t Been Kind as WellCVS Health’s Retail/Long Term Care (LTC) business has been sluggish since first-quarter 2017 largely due to declining same-store sales, continued reimbursement pressure and a rise in the generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed).The company’s Retail/LTC business was also majorly impacted by weak operations in hurricane-ravaged areas like Texas, Louisiana, Florida and Puerto Rico. The company has valued the hurricane impact at about $55 million — primarily costs to cover insurance deductibles.The speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the PBM market has aggravated matters for CVS Health. To counter competition, CVS Health will have to add more digital and customer-friendly programs.CVS Health ~ A Force to Reckon With“If there is no struggle, there is no progress”Nothing could be more apt than this remark by Frederick Douglass. CVS Health, with a massive market cap of $74.52 billion, has been leaving no stones unturned to bounce back.Mergers & Acquisitions to Strengthen PBM BusinessIn a historic decision, CVS Health decided to acquire the United States’ third-largest health insurance company Aetna (AET) in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $207 per share or almost $69 billion (considering a rough estimate of Aetna's debt, the total transaction value is projected at $77 billion). The company expects the takeover to close in the second half of 2018, subject to approval by the company’s shareholders, regulatory bodies as well as fulfillment of certain other customary closing conditions. CVS Health expects $750 million of near-term synergies from the deal, with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post closure of the transaction.Many view the merger as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gains and solid cost cutting at CVS Health’s PBM business.Apart from the Aetna deal, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently owned pharmacies across the United States. Through this initiative, the company intends to promote cost saving and enhance clinical outcomes which will eventually reduce costs for CVS Health’s PBM customers.Initiatives to Boost Retail/LTC BusinessThe company has also been striving to return to growth in the Retail/LTC business. Management claims that CVS Health is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share in 2018 and beyond. The company’s tie-up with OptumRx, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to provide a 90-day Pharmacy solution to OptumRx commercial clients was made available at the beginning of July. CVS Health is also poised to gain from programs such as Health Tag and ExtraCare Health Card. Subsequently, the company is planning to collaborate with PBMs and health plans to offer a menu of services such as MinuteClinic services, Infusion and Long Term Care. Also, Store Brands is an area of both strength and opportunity for CVS Health. The company’s latest initiatives like next-day and same-day delivery and automatic refills of prescriptions with a text message also seem promising.Recognizing the growing opportunities in the digital market, CVS Health has also been focused on enhancing its online and mobile capabilities in 2017. Building on the strength of its digital tools within pharmacy, with 60% of patients using them, the company is focused on offering advanced services to customers. These services range from Curbside program to same-day delivery options as well as enhanced mobile functionality and ExtraCare. Moreover, CVS Health has been enthusiastically working with Instacart and is now delivering from 2,800 stores.Is There a Rebound in the Cards?CVS Health has been firing on all cylinders of late. The company recently inked a five-year agreement with Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) to provide services including claims processing and prescription fulfillment to support IngenioRx, a new PBM. Notably, the agreement will be implemented on Jan 1, 2020, and will run through Dec 31, 2024.While such measures will help smoothen the bumpy ride for the company, 2018 might come with a fresh set of surprises and challenges. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)Broadly speaking, the effects of the massive corporate tax cut from 35% to 21% as proposed under the U.S. tax reform bill are yet to be implemented. Per some analysts, the bill will result in a substantial decline in the effective tax rate for companies in 2018.Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s favorable Value Style Score  of A raises our confidence in the stock. Our Value Style Score highlights all valuation metrics and represents them as one score that cautions investors regarding “value traps” and helps them find stocks that are actually trading at a discount.The company also has a favorable price to earnings ratio of 12.5 as compared to the S&P 500 market’s 21.3 and broader industry’s 13.2.Bottom LineIn a market, where mergers and acquisitions have been historically altering the landscape along with challenges like legal regulations and reimbursement pressure, it will be interesting to see how CVS Health deals with the odds and delivers the promised long-term earnings growth of 10%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1953,UNH,"Benchmarks finished in negative territory on Tuesday following slump in both healthcare and energy stocks. Blue-chips like Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan announced that they will together form a healthcare company in order to cut related costs for their U.S. employees, which in turn weighed on the healthcare sector.Additionally, recent increase in U.S. shale production led energy stocks downward. Moreover, rising bond yields had a broad-based negative impact on all the three key indexes. The S&P 500 experienced its worst one-day performance since August, 2017 and Dow witnessed its biggest one-day drop since last May.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1.4%, or 361.90 points to close at 26,076.89.

A total of around 8.1 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.1 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 4.17-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.98-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.What Moved the Benchmarks?On Tuesday, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) made an announcement that together with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) a healthcare company will be built in order to cut costs for their U.S. employees and improve worker satisfaction.

The sector witnessed its highest one-day drop since last October. Dow components UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) and Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) decreased 4.4% and 1.6%, respectively.Additionally, on the earnings front, Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share and revenues that beat their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Both WTI and Brent crude prices decreased to 1.6% and 0.6% to settle at $64.50 per barrel and $69.02 a barrel, respectively.Decrease in oil prices had an adverse impact on the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), which slumped 2%, becoming the second worst performing sectors of the S&P 500.

Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which increased from 2.695% to 2.725% on Tuesday, reaching its highest settlement in almost four years. Higher treasury yields also weighed on the broader equity markets.Stocks That Made HeadlinesC.H. Robinson Surpasses on Earnings & Revenues in Q4C.H.

1958,UNH,"A fair share of the buoyancy in Wall Street this year can be attributed to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The blue-chip index has been continually hitting record highs, with the latest being the 23,000-mark touched on Oct 17. The index actually set out on an astounding rally since Trump’s win and crossed a “new 1,000-point threshold for the fourth time this year.”It topped 19,000 for the first time in its 120-year history on Nov 22, 2016. And apart from some occasional dips on Trump’s policy-related uncertainty, there was no looking back. This year itself, the index hit more than 20 record highs. As a result, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) is up 15.3% this year (as of Oct 17, 2017).Instrumental StocksStocks that acted as tailwinds in the last six months were the likes of Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report).On Oct 17, 2017, International Business Machines Corp (IBM  -  Free Report), another major component of DIA, posted a beat on both lines. JNJ too beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales. UnitedHealth comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its membership growth led to the outperformance. UNH and JNJ were up 5.5% and 3.4% on Oct 17 while IBM added more than 5% after hours.Trump’s Tax Reform Proposal  At the end of September, Trump revealed his much talked-about tax plan, suggesting comprehensive tax cuts for individuals and corporations. Some of the key suggestions are a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% and slashing of the number of individual tax brackets to three from seven.Goldman sees 2018 earnings for the S&P 500 companies to get a boost of 12% while Bank of America Merrill Lynch believes that the new rate would benefit earnings by about 11% in 2018. Quite expectedly, Dow Jones exhibited a nice stretch on hopes of tax reform (read: ETFs to Benefit from Trump Tax Plan).Upswing in the Manufacturing SectorDomestic factory activity jumped to a more than 13-year high in September thanks to higher new orders. An uptick in manufacturing numbers can act as a strong tailwind to Dow Jones Industrial Average’s forward growth, in our opinion. After all, Dow Jones-based ETF DIA invests about 20% weight, the highest allocation, in the industrial sector (read: 3 ETFs to Play Upbeat Global Manufacturing).Good News from Oil Patch Furthermore, it has been noticed lately that Dow Jones shares a deep relationship with oil price movement.Though energy sector rally spreads optimism over the broader market as a whole, in most cases, on a particular day of oil surge, the spurt in the Dow Jones is steeper than that of the S&P 500, or vice versa.In such a scenario, the American Petroleum Institute (API) recorded a steep drawdown of 7.130 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories, against the S&P Platts’ analyst survey that expected stockpiles to fall by 3.9 million barrels for the week ending Oct 13.ETFs That Were Benefited Other Than DIAInvestors should note that leveraged Dow ETF plays favored investors for obvious reasons. Two choices are ProShares Ultra Dow30 (DDM  -  Free Report) and ProShares UltraPro Dow30 (UDOW  -  Free Report). All these Dow Jones-related funds outperformed the S&P 500-based fund (SPY) in the last six months (read: 10-Minute Guide to 10 Most Popular Leveraged ETFs).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

1959,UNH,"The U.S. health insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) reported upbeat third-quarter results. It topped our estimates on the bottom line and raised its full-year outlook.Net operating earnings per share of $2.66, comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 and were 22.6% higher year over year. Higher revenues, strength in both its segments, UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and membership growth led to the outperformance.The company posted net revenues of $50.3 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues were up 8.7% year over year. The company reported medical care ratio of 81.4%, up 110 basis points year over year.Buoyed by its strong earnings performance, the company raised its outlook for 2017 earnings. The company now expects 2017 GAAP net earnings to touch $9.45 per share (versus $9.20 to $9.35 per share guided earlier) and adjusted net earnings to near $10.00 per share (versus previous guidance of $9.75-$9.90).Market ImpactThe market has welcomed UNH’s earnings beat and its strong outlook. Shares of UNH jumped as much as 5.5% following its earnings announcement on about 3.28 times elevated volumes. After all, the stock has a VGM (Value, Growth, Momentum) Score of B and its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 28%.Since UnitedHealth is the first insurer to report earnings and a bellwether, the result has acted as a cornerstone for the broad health insurance sector with stocks of other players in the space in green at the close on the day. Some of these players include Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) – up 2.9%, Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report) - up 1.9%, Cigna (CI  -  Free Report) – up 1.2% and Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) – up 1.4%.Given UnitedHealth’s strength to lift the health insurer corner of the broad health care space and the solid run up in its share price, some ETFs heavily invested in UnitedHealth could be worth watching for investors seeking to ride out the recent surge. Below we highlight a few ETFs.iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report)This ETF has exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment. In total, the fund holds 45 securities in its basket with United Health at the top spot that accounts for the largest 14.19% share.

1960,UNH,"Benchmarks finished higher on Tuesday after a slew of strong corporate earnings led gains for healthcare stocks. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 closed at record levels, with the blue-chip index touching the psychological 23,000 milestone for the first time in its 120-year history. Meanwhile, industrial production for September rebounded after two straight months in the lull.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,997.44, gaining 0.2%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.1% to close at 2,559.36. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,624, decreasing a little below half a point.

The CBOE VIX increased 4.1% to close at 10.32.Dow Breaches 23,000The Dow gained 40.48 points on Tuesday and surpassed the 23,000 psychological milestone in midday trading for the first time. The blue-chip index also hit a fresh intraday record of 23,302.20. This also marked the Dow’s fastest ascent to 1,000-point milestone since the mid of July. In its history spanning over a century, the blue-chip index has registered the fourth 1,000-point increase within a year for the first time — the largest so far.Economists believe that such a stellar showing by the blue-chip index has partially been due to optimism built around hopes of tax cuts after the new tax code was formulated by President Trump. Gains have also been in part due to a strong corporate earnings and broadly encouraging economic conditions.Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) have contributed the most toward Dow’s significant 1,000-point ascent since Aug 2 — when blue–chip index surpassed the 22,000 mark for the first time, adding 142 and 121 points, respectively. For the year, the two stocks have rallied 65.9% and 41.2%, respectively, so far. The most recent exuberance of the Dow, however, was supported by shares of Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), which added 87 points and 97 points, respectively.

Investors are also observing whether such high stock valuations actually support earnings. Strong earnings from bank and healthcare stocks also contributed significantly toward gains. The S&P 500 advanced 1.72 points to close at a record high. Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, seven ended in the positive territory with healthcare stocks leading the gainers. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) gained 1.3% on Tuesday.Health care stocks were sent higher by gains for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report), shares of which gained 3.4% and 5.5%, respectively, after the two companies posted earnings beat in the latest quarter.Johnson & Johnson reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales.

(Read More)Economic DataIndustrial production for the month of September surged 0.3%, surpassing the consensus estimate of an increase of 0.1%.

1962,UNH,"Health insurer Aetna Inc.’s (AET  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter earnings of $1.25 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18. Earnings, however, declined 23% from the prior-year quarter.The decline in earnings was primarily due to lower favorable development of prior-period health care cost estimates in Aetna's Health Care segment and targeted investment spending on growth initiatives. These were to some extent offset by lower losses in the company’s individual commercial products.Weak RevenuesAetna recorded revenues of $14.74 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.89 billion. Also, revenues compared unfavorably with the year-ago number of $15.72 billion. The downside was primarily due to lower premiums in Aetna's Health Care segment, including lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products, and the temporary suspension of the Health Insurer Fee  (HIF) in 2017.Total expense ratio of 20.5% declined 240 basis points year over year. Pre-tax margin of 4.8% decreased 160 basis points year over year.The company’s total enrollment decreased to 49.4 million from 52.79 million in the year-ago quarter.Aetna Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Aetna Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aetna Inc. QuoteSegmental Performance UpdateHealth CareAdjusted revenues were $14.5 billion, down 4% year over year. The downside was due to lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products, lower membership in Medicaid products and the temporary suspension of the HIF. This was somewhat offset by higher premium yields in Commercial and Government businesses and membership growth in Medicare products.Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $662 million, down 31.3% year over year due to lower favorable development of prior-period health care costs estimates, higher targeted investment spending on Aetna's growth initiatives and the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the HIF in 2017, partially offset by reduced losses in Aetna's individual commercial products.Total healthcare medical benefit ratio (MBR) rose 220 basis points year over year to 84.3% due to deterioration in Commercial and Government benefit ratios.Group InsuranceDuring the fourth quarter, the company completed the sale of a substantial portion of its Group Insurance segment consisting of its domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses.This sale adversely impacted the quarter’s revenues and pre-tax adjusted earnings of $237 million and $16 million, respectively, which were down 61.8% and 57%, respectively.Large Case PensionsAdjusted revenues came at $71 million, up 11% year over year led by higher premiums in fourth-quarter 2017.Financial PositionTotal assets were $55.1 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, down 20% year over year.Long-term debt declined 57% year over year to $8.2 billion.Debt-to-capitalization ratio was 37% of Dec 31, 2017 compared with 53.6% as of Dec 31, 2016.Business UpdateDuring the quarter, the company sold a substantial portion of its Group Insurance segment consisting of its domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses through an indemnity reinsurance arrangement. The sale is expected to result in an after-tax gain of approximately $710 million ($1.1 billion pretax).Also, Aetna entered into an agreement, in the quarter, to be acquired by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) for nearly $69 billion.  The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018.Zacks Rank, Peer Performance, Upcoming ReleaseAetna currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1963,UNH,"Health insurer Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has signed an agreement to acquire Kindred-at-Home, a unit of Kindred Healthcare Inc.Details of the DealTPG Capital and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and Humana have formed a joint venture to buy Kindred for nearly $4.1 billion including the acquired company’s debt. Humana will occupy a 40% stake for $800 million in Kindred-at-Home, which will be separated from the rest of the company after the deal. The transaction will see light by the summer of 2018 and will be slightly accretive to the company’s earnings per share in 2019 and beyond.Essence of the Deal for HumanaThe deal will provide a vertical integration for Humana and aligns with the company’s strategy to grow in the home healthcare arena. The deal will allow the company to provide an improved care to patients at low cost.This transaction will provide Humana with an extensive geographic coverage with approximately 65% overlap with Humana’s individual Medicare Advantage membership. The company will also have full access to extensive clinical capabilities to better serve its members.A deal of this kind comes as no surprise to us given that the company had kept its eyes wide open for such attractive acquisitions after its failed merger with Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) earlier in the year. The company’s balance sheet with strong financial flexibility also provides enough support for capital deployment activities.Last week, the company’s board of directors approved a new share repurchase program to buy back its common stock worth up to $3 billion.Share Price PerformanceYear to date, the stock has rallied 21%, significantly underperforming the industry’s growth of 43%. Nonetheless, the recent announcement, a well-poised Medicare business as its solid balance sheet should drive the shares higher.Industry TrendA spate of similar deals is witnessed in the industry of late, driven by the increasing trend of health insurers foraying into patient-care business. The mega merger of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) with Aetna aims to dispense affordable cure to patients at their convenience closer home or at an outpatient location.Further competition is lent by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), which is voraciously spreading its business in this space via its OptumCare unit by acquiring doctor clinics, urgent care facilities and surgery centers. Recently, UnitedHealth Group’s Optum unit announced that it would pay nearly $5 billion to buy DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc.’s (DVA  -  Free Report) Medical Group along with its clinics and urgent care centers.The central tenet for all these deals is to cut costs and improve care. These developments mark the coming forward of health insurers to play a more direct role in providing actual medical services and move beyond offering insurance.These deals seeking to reduce hospitalizations, lower emergency room visits and allowing physicians and clinicians to extend their care all the way to a patient’s home are, however, detrimental to hospital companies’ business and survival.Going ForwardThe ripple of shakeup in the health care industry started by CVS-Aetna deal continues to trend higher. One after another player continues to join the bandwagon of consolidation. Given the urgent need (in the rapidly-transforming health care industry) for increase in heft and size, restraint of sky-high medical costs plus diversification of business, we won’t be surprised if we hear more of deals along similar lines going forward.Humana carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1965,UNH,"While Wall Street is scaling multiple highs on Trump’s pro-growth reforms, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been an outperformer since election last year. This is because a strong rotation in leadership in the large-cap domestic space has benefited Dow Jones more than its other large-cap counterparts like the S&P 500 (read: High Beta ETFs & Stocks for Market-Beating Returns).Notably, the Dow Jones has returned 24.2% since the Election Day compared to a gain of 18.9% for the S&P 500.

1966,UNH,"Healthcare, particularly Obamacare, had been at the receiving end of President Trump, even before he assumed office. The Republicans’ repeal and replace efforts have, however, failed, with the American Health Care Act (AHCA) not getting enough support in the House, thanks to a solid opposition from both conservative and moderate lawmakers.Failure of Last-Ditch EffortsThe most recent effort, in the form of the Graham-Cassidy bill, also failed to get any success, due to numerous suggestions having been not well received by the industry participants. Among the most unpopular of them were putting an end to individual and employer mandate, giving a block grant to Medicaid, loosening provisions with regard to pre-existing conditions, elimination of Obamacare subsidies that lower premiums, deductibles and co-pays, plus ending cost-sharing subsidies by 2020.Also, CBO (Congressional Budget Office) analysis of the proposal fund that millions of Americans would lose health coverage due to $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid through 2026, and that the bill would have resulted in loss of health insurance coverage, has destabilized insurance markets and decreased access to affordable coverage and care for commoners.A Short-Lived Relief?Though the failure of final attempts to undo Obamacare brought a sigh of relief to the industry, it should only be temporary, given the recent comments made by Chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Mark Walker, who stressed efforts to continue with the fight to remove Obamacare.How to Play the Sector?Amid this conundrum, investors primarily want to invest in stocks with a robust business model to protect and shield from market swings. Many good players from the space have remodeled their business mix, diversified into new product classes, new territories and added new functionalities to provide them with an armor against market vagaries.Insurers’ share price performance and steadily growing business profits stand as a testament to their ability to successfully sail through these high tides, created by these ill-fated reform proposals ever since.  Though the repeal-and-replace efforts have been creating noise causing investors to shy away from the sector, it would be unwise to turn a blind eye to some stocks in this space, which offer solid businesses to serve up handsome returns over time.These stocks sporting a favorable Zacks Rank are indicative of witnessing positive estimate revisions over time, which generally translate into rapid price appreciation.They also pride over a positive earnings surprise history and have outperformed the industry’s increase of 44% in the past year.

1967,UNH,"CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.7%. Its trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise is 2.7%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsCVS Health is optimistic about sustaining the solid year-over-year earnings trend in 2017 on gains to be realized from the Pharmacy Services segment. The performance is being driven by higher specialty pharmacy and pharmacy network claim volumes as well as brand inflation. Management stated that the company’s specialty business is its top priority in gaining new and retaining existing customers. CVS Health is poised to capitalize on this opportunity on the back of wide and differentiated offerings, including Specialty Connect.Management expects drug price inflation, product launches, higher utilization and new PBM clients to fuel growth. We expect the Pharmacy Services segment to be a stable growth platform.In this regard, we are also impressed with CVS Health’s robust PBM selling season, reflecting solid progress from last quarter. While gross new business totaled $6 billion, net new business reached $2.3 billion. These figures take into account the FEP (Federal Employee Program) specialty contract loss but exclude the impact from individual Medicare Part D program. CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuoteHowever, increased generic dispensing and price compression have been partially offsetting growth in this space. Moreover, there are several timing factors that have affected the cadence of profit delivery last quarter. One such aspect was the timing of profitability in Medicare Part D business. Per the company, the same is expected to continue through the fourth-quarter as well.Largely due to weaker margin performance in the PBM client and retail network claims administration process, CVS Health now expects adjusted operating profit growth in mid-teens at the Pharmacy Services segment for fourth-quarter 2017 and around 4% for full-year 2017.Apart from the timing of Medicare Part D profitability, the company expects higher benefits from the streamlining initiatives in the back half of the year. Taking that into consideration, the company projected fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share and consolidated operating profit growth at the low end of the $1.88-$1.92 and 5.75-8% range, respectively.Here are some other factors that might also influence CVS Health’s fourth-quarter results:The company maintains fourth-quarter operating loss projection for its Retail/LTC segment at the low end of the 1.0% to 3.5% range, largely due to restricted network changes. Notably, the decision to restrict CVS Health from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully insured prime networks have continued to affect Pharmacy sales and script comps. Moreover, total same-store sales are expected to decline 1-2.8% in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.However, the company has been striving to return to growth in the Retail/LTC business. Management claims that CVS Health is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share. The company’s tie-up with OptumRx, part of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to provide a 90-day Pharmacy solution to OptumRx commercial clients was made available at the beginning of last July. CVS Health is also poised to gain from programs such as Health Tag and ExtraCare Health Card.The company is planning to collaborate with PBMs (Pharmacy Benefit Management) and health plans to offer a menu of services such as MinuteClinic services, Infusion and Long Term Care. Also, Store Brands is an area of both strength and opportunity for CVS Health. The company’s latest initiatives like next-day and same-day delivery and automatic refills of prescriptions with a text message also seem promising.Notably, for the fourth quarter, the company’s adjusted script comps are expected to rise 1-2%.CVS Health has projected a 2.5-4.25% rise in consolidated net revenues during the fourth quarter. Specialty business is expected to record strong growth and the SilverScript business is likely to maintain momentum. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter total revenues of $47.58 billion reflects a 3.5% increase year over year.Aetna Deal: The company’s latest announcement to buy all outstanding shares of a diversified health care benefits company — Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) — in a total transaction value of $77 billion is also encouraging. On the deal’s closure (expected in the second half of 2018), CVS Health estimates $750 million of near-term synergies with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post the completion of the transaction.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that CVS Health is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  CVS Health has an Earnings ESP of -0.13%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CVS Health carries a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of $1.89 billion reflects a 10.5% increase year over year.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as these have the right combination of elements to beat earnings this time around:Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (AMPH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +194.12% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1968,UNH,"WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report) has issued guidance for 2018 and kept it intact for 2017. The company has retained its practice of providing outlook conservatively and beating estimates to surprise investors.The company’s interesting surprise history shows that it has surpassed estimates in 21 of 28 reported quarters in the past.What the Recent Guidance IncludesBottom Line Higher Year Over Year: For 2018, the company expects its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) at $8.40-$8.65, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 2.4%. The bottom-line growth will be driven by accretion from the Universal American acquisition, Medicare Advantage organic growth, maturation of new Medicaid business, PBM contract renegotiation and selling, general and administrative cost leverage. However, these will be partially offset by the ACA industry fee reinstatement and a decrease in Florida Medicaid rate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for EPS of $8.63.       Stronger Top Line: Adjusted premium revenues are expected in the range of $17.95 billion- $18.475 billion, representing an 8.4% rise year over year. This upside will be backed by organic growth across all three businesses of Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and MA Part-D. The acquisition of Universal American Corp. will further accrue to the top line.  Improvement in Medical Costs: The company also projected an improvement in MLR (Medical Loss Ratio) across all three business lines on the back of a continued momentum from clinical and operational initiatives and the HIPF reinstatement.Though earnings will be supported by the above factors, the following might hurt the bottom line.Rise in Interest Expenses: The health insurer estimates interest expenses of $69-$72 million for 2018, comparing unfavorably with its 2017 forecast of $68-$70 million.Other Charges: Medicaid premium taxes of $120-$125 million plus $51-$56 million of acquisition related amortization expenses.Higher Effective Tax Rate: Effective tax rate for 2018 is predicted in the band of 51-53%, up from 32.5-33% for 2017. However, we consider this as a conservative outlook and expect the tax rate to benefit from the corporate tax reform.Share Price PerformanceIn the last 12 months, the stock has gained 41%, in line with the industry’s growth.Our TakeAll in all, the issued view upholds the company’s strong fundamentals and its ability to perform in an industry confronting stiff competition, rising medical costs and high regulatory uncertainty.Recently other health insurers namely, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) and Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) came out with their respective earnings guidance for 2018.UnitedHealth expects adjusted EPS of $10.55-$10.85, up 7% year over year calculated at the midpoint.Centene estimates adjusted EPS in the range of $5.47-$5.87. This new guidance is also 14% higher than the midpoint of the range projected for 2017 adjusted EPS.WellCare Health sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Another top-ranked stock Magellan Health, Inc. (MGLN  -  Free Report) also boasts the same bullish Zacks Rank as WellCare Health’s. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Magellan Health beat estimates in three of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 0.9%.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

1969,UNH,"The role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S. healthcare sector has been evolving. From being just third-party administrators of prescription drug programs, PBMs have come a long way. PBMs currently play a major role in managing pharmaceutical spending and enhancing health benefits for end-users.Notably, PBMs are mainly accountable for the development of formularies, discussing discounts with major drug manufacturers and pharmacy contracts. These firms also play an important role in the settlement of prescription drug claims.As per Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, PBMs have the potential to save as much as 30% in total drug spending relative to unmanaged purchasing (data published in ‘The Economic Benefits of Pharmacy Benefit Managers’ by Orszag and Green).Undoubtedly, the PBM market is expected to continue the solid trend. Per a report by Market Research Reports.biz, the PBM market will see a CAGR of 7.16% between 2014 and 2019.Factors Driving PBMHistorically, there have been a number of factors supporting growth in the PBM market. Rising healthcare expenditures along with higher cost of drugs and other healthcare services have driven demand for PBMs who act as middlemen between the payer and other entities in the system.We are also encouraged by a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board on rising U.S. healthcare spending. Per the report, the U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of Gross Domestic Product (based on assumptions that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).The PBM market largely benefits from an aging population which tends to depend on drugs and pharmacy benefit plans. Per a report by Technavio, nearly 14.4% of the U.S. population is aged 65 years and above which buoys optimism.Many analysts believe that rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have also been strengthening the PBM market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board predicts a continuation of this trend. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Per a 2017 Economic Report on U.S. Pharmacies ad Pharmacy Benefit Managers, specialty drugs accounted for about one-third of the pharmacy industry’s revenues in 2016.Mergers & Acquisitions Change PBM LandscapeThe PBM market has always been dominated by a handful of large players. In 2007, CVS’ merger with Caremark Rx to form CVS Caremark, now CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report), had a huge impact on the functions and scope of PBMs. Again, CVS Health announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report).People in support of the merger view it as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gain and solid cost cutting at CVS Health’s PBM business. Notably, a horizontal integration increases the chances of monopolistic practices in the market.Following the announcement of the CVS-Aetna deal, another leading health service company — Optum, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) — announced its decision to acquire DaVita Medical Group, a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report).Moreover, it is being speculated that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) might soon announce the acquisition of health and well-being company, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) to counter competition.3 Stocks to Scoop UpAs the PBM industry is constantly expanding, this industry is worth keeping an eye on. Here are three PBM companies with promising prospects.CVS Health: Headquartered in Woonsocket, RI, CVS Health, with its subsidiaries, provides integrated pharmacy health care services. This leading PBM company has a market cap of about $73.8 billion. Its earnings are estimated to grow 9.1% in the next three to five years.Apart from the Aetna deal earlier, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network fixed by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently owned pharmacies across the United States. Through this initiative, the company intends to promote cost saving and enhance clinical outcomes which will eventually reduce costs for CVS’ PBM customers.CVS Health Corporation Price CVS Health Corporation Price | CVS Health Corporation QuoteExpress Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Saint Louis, MO, Express Scripts operates as a PBM company in the United States, Canada and Europe. The company has a market cap of about $38.83 billion. Its earnings are estimated to grow 9.7% in the next three to five years.Notably, the company’s PBM segment offers clinical solutions, specialized pharmacy care, home delivery and specialty pharmacy, retail network pharmacy administration, benefit design consultation, drug utilization review, drug formulary management, administration of a group purchasing organization, and consumer health and drug information services. Moreover, this segment provides Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance marketplace products.The company recently announced plans to acquire privately-held and evidence-based medical benefit management services provider — eviCore healthcare. Notably, by integrating eviCore's medical benefits management (MBM) platform with its PBM offering, Express Scripts intends to combat rising healthcare costs.Express Scripts Holding Company Price Express Scripts Holding Company Price | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteRite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report): Operating through Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments, Rite Aid owns a chain of retail drugstores in the United States. The company has a market cap of about $1.91 billion.Notably, the company’s Pharmacy Services segment provides PBM services and a range of pharmacy-related services. This segment also provides prescription adjudication services for other PBMs, offers integrated mail-order and specialty and compounding pharmacy services, and provides infertility treatment as well as drug benefits under the Medicare Part D program.Rite Aid Corporation Price Rite Aid Corporation Price | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteBottom LineAlthough these companies have solid prospects, they are exposed to challenges like legal regulations, reimbursement pressure and the speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the PBM market.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1970,UNH,"Markets enjoyed a month of spectacular gains powered by a strong earnings performance and hopes surrounding tax reforms. Significant progress was made on the new tax law during the month, further raising the hopes of investors.Meanwhile, bullish tech earnings were the highlight of the thirdquarter earnings season characterized by notable revenue growth. The ECB cut its bond purchases but extended the duration of its monetary stimulus package.October’s PerformanceLast month, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increased 4.3%, 2.2% and 3.6%, respectively. While, the Dow and the S&P 500 posted their seventh straight month in gains, this was Nasdaq’s fourth straight monthly gain. All the three benchmarks have posted their biggest monthly rise since February. Moreover, this also happens to be the Dow’s longest streak of such gains since April 2012 and also the longest for the S&P 500 since May 2013.Meanwhile, the House of Representatives passed a $4.1 trillion budget bill for 2018. Moreover, the House of Representatives cleared the budget blueprint with majority of the Republicans voting in favor of the move.Further, the ECB announced plans to extend the quantitative easing program. Also, the release of the Federal Open Market Committee minutes clearly hinted at a rate hike in December. President Trump chose not to certify Iran’s compliance with a nuclear deal struck in 2015.Dow Breaches 23,000The Dow gained 40.48 points on Oct 17 and surpassed the 23,000 psychological milestone in midday trading for the first time. This also marked the Dow’s fastest ascent to 1,000-point milestone since mid July. In its history spanning over a century, the Dow has registered the fourth 1,000-point increase within a year for the first time.Economists believe that such a stellar showing by the blue-chip index has partially been due to optimism built around hopes of tax cuts after the new tax code was formulated by President Trump. Gains have also been in part due to a strong corporate earnings and broadly encouraging economic conditions.Bullish Domestic DataEconomic data released during August was largely encouraging in nature. The ISM manufacturing index soared to 60.8% in September, up from 58.8%, marking its highest increase since 2004. ISM Services Index for September came in at 59.8%, marking its highest level since Aug 2005. Construction Spending surged 0.5% in the month of August, surpassing the consensus estimate of an increase of 0.2% for the period. With this, the index gained 2.5% from last year.PPI for September increased by 0.4% while CPI increased by 0.5%. Retail sales in the United States for the month of September increased 1.6%, marking its highest increase in more than two years.Consumer spending surged 1%, in September, marks its highest level in almost 8 years. Such a rally can be attributed to the fact that the residents of hurricane ravaged Texas and Florida replaced their flood-damaged automobiles.First Estimate for Q3 GDP Looks PromisingThe U.S. economy expanded at a solid 3% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the third quarter of 2017, according to Commerce Department data. Such an expansion came on the heels of 3.1% growth in the second quarter. It also marks the first time of two consecutive quarters of 3% growth or more since mid-2014 for the economy. However, the report did not specify as to how much of an impact hurricanes Harvey and Irma had on the growth of the economy in Q3.Economists commented that the primary factor behind such a growth was an increase consumer spending, backed by broadly encouraging economic conditions and strong government outlays. The main engine of the economy grew at 2.4% over the quarter after a 3.3% gain in the second quarter.Moreover, business investment increased 3.9% while inventories rose 0.7%. Also, the trade sector advanced by 0.4%. The PCE Price Index increased by 0.3%, logging an annual gain of 1.3% which was an improvement from the 0.9% pace recorded in the second quarter.Hurricanes Cause Job Losses, Unemployment SlipsAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. economy lost about 33,000 jobs in the month of September. This marks the first time since 2010 that the economy has lost jobs within a month. Economists stated that two devastating hurricanes Harvey and Irma were the primary reasons behind such job losses.Analysts commented that as many as 1.5 million people were out of jobs — the highest figure in last 20 years. The worst affected sector was the restaurant industry where as many as 105,000 people lost jobs. Meanwhile, the government raised its estimates on job openings in the month of August to 169,000 from 156,000 initially.The unemployment rate decreased to 4.2% in September from 4.4% in August. The consensus estimate for the period showed that the unemployment rate would remain unchanged. Unemployment is now at its lowest level since 2000 and the report by BLS stated that the metric was not affected by the hurricanes.Third-Quarter Earnings Coming to third-quarter earnings, there is clear momentum on the revenue front, with growth notably accelerating from other recent periods. Total revenues for the 272 S&P 500 members that have reported results, as of Friday, Oct 27, are up 6.7% from the same period last year, which compares to 5.5% top-line growth for the same group of companies in the preceding quarter. (Read: All-Around Strength in Q3 Earnings Season)Impressive third-quarter 2017 earnings by tech heavyweights such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Intel Corp. INTC have been the highlight of this earnings season. Shares of IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) soared 9% on Oct 18, after the company posted better-than-expected earnings results. Shares of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) surged 1.6% on Oct 16, after the company reported strong third-quarter 2017 earnings.Health care stocks were sent higher on Oct 17, by gains for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report), shares of which gained 3.4% and 5.5%, respectively, after the two companies posted earnings beat in the latest quarter.Among notable disappointments, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) declined on Oct 12 after the company’s fixed income trading revenue dipped around 27% to come in at $3.2 billion in the third quarter of this year. Meanwhile, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) declined after the company’s cost of credit increased 15% due to global consumer banking as well as high credit reserve build. On Oct 24, shares of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) nosedived 6.3% after missing the third-quarter earnings estimate by a wide margin despite top-line growth.Tax Reforms Make ProgressAround the end of September, President Trump and his aides unveiled tax reforms which effectively lower taxes on businesses and individuals. The proposal seeks to decrease the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%. Moreover, the pass-through business taxes would be slashed to 25%.In its first definitive move toward tax reforms, the House of Representatives passed $4.1 trillion 2018 budget legislation on Oct 5. However, a few members from President Trump’s team voted against the bill along with Democrats, objecting to parts of the tax reform proposal. The Democrats opposed the passage of the Bill, terming the move as ""a vehicle for achieving partisan tax reform.""In a 51-49 vote late on Oct 19, the Senate approved the budget blueprint for fiscal year 2018. Such an outcome “unlocks” a procedure using which the tax code can be changed using only Republican votes. Moreover, the tax Bill can now be used to lower the projected revenue by almost $1.5 trillion over a ten-year period.Ultimately, House of Representative passed the budget blueprint on Oct 27. Reports from Bloomberg surfaced on Oct 30 that legislators from the House who are involved in the formulation of the new tax code were considering a possible ‘phasing-in’ of the corporate tax-rate cut. This would effectively reduce the current rate of corporate tax — at 35% — to 20% by 2022.FOMC MinutesMinutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), released on Oct 11 confirmed that a rate hike would take place in December, the third instance in 2017. Though, the Federal Reserve officials remained largely divided over raising interest rates, majority of the bankers vouched in favor of raising rates. The ones debating against increasing rates reasoned that hiking rates at a time when inflation is lower than the target of 2% might cause major setbacks for the U.S. economy.After the meeting ended, the Fed chose to leave the interest rates unchanged in the range of 1-1.25% and decided to start unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The much anticipated unwinding of the humungous balance sheet of the Fed was announced at the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee last month. The Fed is slated to begin the gradual unwinding process this month and plans to trim assets by $10 billion each month.However, the Fed panel announced one rate hike before 2017 ends and three further hikes in 2018. Experts therefore speculate that this would come in December when Fed meets for the final time before the year ends.4 Star Performers for OctoberI ran a screen on Research Wizard for companies with the following parameters:(Click here to sign up for a free trial to the Research Wizard today):Percentage price change over the last 4 weeks greater than or equal to 20%Forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) for the current financial year (F1) less than or equal to 20.

(UNH  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter net operating earnings per share of $2.66, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 and increasing 22.6% year over year.Higher revenues, strength in both its segments, UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and membership growth led to the outperformance.UnitedHealth has a tradition of guiding conservatively and then beating its own estimates to surprise investors.

This will further disrupt the public exchange markets. But UnitedHealth is better off than others in the industry given its well-diversified business which shields it from strict regulations.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookUnitedHealth with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) has got this reporting cycle off to a flying start.

1972,UNH,"Good news is here, investing friends! Q3 earnings results are not only clear and present, but results are better than expected among most household name stocks ahead of the bell this morning. In a quarter rife with stresses from the nation’s capital, natural disasters both here and abroad, and other stock market headwinds, stronger-than-expected earnings are providing a good tonic for us this morning.Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) tore the cover off the ball, figuratively speaking. The Wall Street investment giant easily surpassed top and bottom-line estimates: $5.02 per share beat the $4.31 expected, and revenues of $8.3 billion topped the $7.6 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate.

Sales of $962.1 million did top the $960.8 million expected, but these numbers are both down from the $1.1 billion reported in Q3 2016. Baby boomers buying fewer bikes looks to be the culprit here; in related news, Peter Fonda is 77 years old.New Import/Export NumbersSeptember results for both import and export prices beat expectations this morning, up 0.7% last month from the 0.6% consensus, as well as the unrevised headline from the previous month. Exports performed even better, up 0.8% as opposed to the +0.5% expected. Imports year over year are in-line at +1.9%, while exports are +2.7% since this time last year.

This has become possible following easing political tensions between the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region and the federal government of Iraq. The company had called off operations in the region in October 2017 owing to increasing disputes.Post the Kurdistan independence referendum (September 2017), which was strongly opposed by the Iraqi government, the latter seized the oil fields in Kirkuk and Kirdustani regions. The move reduced the revenues of the region to half owing to the loss of over 350,000 barrels of oil production per day, raising supply concerns in the region.However, with the dispute abating of late, Zacks Rank #3 Chevron has started to take necessary steps to remobilize staff and equipment in the region to recommence operations at the Sarta 3 block in Kurdistan.Chevron is the chief operator of the block holding 80% interest in the Sarta product-sharing contract (PSC).

1977,UNH,"As expected, a plethora of earnings reports have hit the tape this morning, including more of the bigger Wall Street banks and other household brands. Put simply, results are mostly good but ultimately mixed thus far. Let’s try to slog through what we’ve found at this hour.
"
1978,UNH,"Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) beat estimates on both top and bottom lines, but shares are selling off following this earnings report on drastically lower fixed income revenues. Earnings of $3.95 per share beat the $3.51 in the Zacks consensus estimate, on sales of $7.887 billion, well ahead of the $7.57 billion expected. But it was the 40% drop in Fixed Income, Commodities and Currencies (FICC, a staple of Goldman Sachs’ holdings) and the second quarter in a row of poor performance in this segment.
"
1979,UNH,"Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) also topped estimates: 46 cents per share on $22.83 billion beat the 43 cents and $21.91 billion, respectively, in the Zacks consensus. An after-tax windfall of $103 million related to the sale of its non-consumer credit card business helped achieve the quarterly beat on the top line. This is at least the fifth quarter in a row of posting an earnings beat for the North Carolina-based bank major.
"
1980,UNH,"Healthcare product retailer Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by 4 cents per share to $1.83 in the quarter, though revenues of $18.84 billion missed the $18.90 billion expected. However, guidance for both sales and earnings for fiscal 2017 were revised upward within the earnings report, helping JNJ shares rise 2% immediately following the results.
"
1981,UNH,"Defense contractor giant Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) surpassed the Zacks consensus for both earnings and revenues: $3.23 per share beat the $3.10 anticipated, and quarterly sales of $12.69 billion beat the $12.46 billion expected. The company’s Aeronautics segment grew 19% year over year, helping boost Lockheed’s results in the quarter, and the shares are trading up in today’s pre-market.
"
1982,UNH,"Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated healthcare provider United Health (UNH  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates for its Q2, on revenues that marginally surpassed our consensus. Earnings of $2.46 per share beat by 8 cents in the quarter, and sales of $50.1 billion was a smudge above the $49.97 billion expected. The company has raised its forecast for fiscal 2017, and this marks at least the fifth quarter in a row of an earnings beat. Shares are up modestly at this hour.

1985,UNH,"Benchmarks ended in the red on Tuesday after recent political tensions weighed on sentiment despite strong quarterly earnings results. Better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings results and updated 2018 earnings projection from UnitedHealth led key U.S. indexes to reach new highs initially.However, all the three indexes fell at the close with the Dow posting its biggest reversal in a day since Feb. 10, 2016 after briefly moving above the 26,000 mark for the first time. Additionally, oil prices fell after investors decided to lock in gains, which in turn weighed on the energy sector. Markets were closed on Monday due to Martin Luther King Jr. Day.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 7.68 points to close at 25,792.86. The S&P 500 fell 0.4% to close at 2,776.42. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,224.00, losing 0.5%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 14.5% to close at 11.63. A total of around 8.30 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.48 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.04-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.18-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.What Weighed On the Benchmarks?Markets lost some of its early shine on Tuesday and closed in negative territory after special Counsel Robert Mueller reportedly subpoenaed President Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon last week. A subpoena of this kind was issued by Mueller for the first time over the investigation of a possible link between Russian officials and members of Trump election campaign.Additionally, oil prices fell after investors decided to lock in recent gains. Oil prices moved more than $70 a barrel recently, which prompted investors to indulge in profit-taking on Tuesday. Decrease in oil prices led the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) to decline 1.3%, emerging as the worst performing sector of S&P 500.Some of the sectors key components, including Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) fell 1.2% and 0.6%, respectively. Both Chevron and Exxon Mobil hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Out of the 11 key S&P 500 sectors, eight of them managed to close in the red. However, Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) was one of the three S&P 500 sectors which increased on Tuesday. Gains in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) contributed to the sector’s rally.UnitedHealth’s shares increased 1.9% after the diversified healthcare company reported fourth quarter earnings per share and revenues that beat their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, both the top and bottom line rose year-over-year. UnitedHealth also revised its 2018 financial outlook to reflect the effects of the U.S. corporate tax law changes.

1986,UNH,"U.S. stocks continue to extend their winning streak with the S&P 500 carving its sixth straight record close on Oct 5, the longest since June 1997. The market value-weighted index also completed its eight-day long winning streak, the longest since 2013. The broad index has posted its 43rd record close in 2017 so far and is up 350% from the low hit in March 2009. In fact, the index has more than doubled in the decade ever since its pre-crisis peak of October 2007.So, what has driven the S&P 500 higher? Investors cheered the first step toward enacting major tax reforms later this year after the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives approved a 2018 budget resolution. Renewed optimism over tax cuts propelled the buying of assets perceived as risky, including financial and tech stocks.Investors’ sentiments were also buoyed by narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit and rebound in exports, which might boost the economy in the third quarter. The U.S. economy is already growing close to the range projected by the White House, while both manufacturing and service sectors accelerated at a record pace last month. Banking on such bullish trends, investing in fundamentally sound stocks listed under the S&P 500 seems judicious.House Passes $4.1-Trillion BudgetThe House of Representatives, led by Speaker Paul Ryan, passed a $4.1-trillion budget legislation that paved the way for them to rewrite the much awaited tax code later this year. The budget aims to repeal Obamacare and also contains $1.1 trillion in non-entitlement outlays, including nearly $622 billion for defense.The far-reaching plan will trim taxes for individuals as well as corporates. The tax plan aims to create three individual tax brackets with rates of 12%, 25% and 35%, while the corporate tax is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%. These tax reforms will put the economy in overdrive, which will offset the revenue loss and not add to national debt that is now above $20 trillion.Republicans’ major tax bill, known as budget reconciliation, required a simple majority in the Senate. The final tally was a narrow 219 to 206, with majority adopting the House of Representatives’ version of the budget.Financials and Technology Led Advancers in the S&P 500 Banks face high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%. Banking on such optimism, shares of banks scaled north.Among tech behemoths, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), Oracle ORCL and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas. The tax plan seeks to encourage such multinationals to bring those profits back to the United States by cutting the tax rate. Shares of these companies scaled higher, with Netflix turning out to be the biggest gainer on the S&P 500, ending the day 5.4% higher at $194.39.Other sectors, including telecom, consumer staples and consumer discretionary, that tend to pay more to Uncle Sam also benefitted immensely.Investors Happy on Solid Economic DataThe U.S. international trade deficit fell by nearly $1 billion in August from July, while exports rose slightly to $128.9 billion in the month. This is quite encouraging as analysts had feared that hurricanes might affect trade data for August, with exports delayed due to storms.The U.S. GDP, in the meanwhile, expanded 3.1% in the second quarter, the fastest in more than two years. It is also up slightly from a previously reported 3%. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment drove the upside. A key yardstick of manufacturing activity in the United States also scaled a 13-year high in September, while non-manufacturing activity picked up to a 12-year high. According to the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), the manufacturing index climbed to 60.8% in September from 58.8% in August. The non-manufacturing gauge came in at 59.8% last month from 55.3% in the prior month.5 Top S&P 500 Stocks to Buy NowWith the S&P 500 scaling record highs on tax cut hopes and a strengthening economy, investing in sound stocks from the index seems a prudent choice.

1988,UNH,"The Dow endured a volatile week even as Republicans tasted success on the tax legislation front. This development boosted bank stocks that eventually helped the Dow to touch new highs. Tech stocks had a good week, notching up gains over three successive trading sessions. Meanwhile, oil stocks remained volatile even as a spike in gasoline inventories led to losses for the sector on Wednesday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow declined by 0.2% last Friday after news related to the former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn raised market uncertainty. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI regarding his interaction with the Russians and promised full cooperation to the investigating team.However, some of Friday’s losses were curbed following news that the U.S. Senate Republicans had made legislative progress on the tax cut Bill. For the week, the Dow and the S&P 500 closed in positive territory, while the Nasdaq ended with losses.The index gained 2.9% over last week, posting its best weekly increase since December 2016. During the week, Dow breached a fresh all-time high to surge past the psychological 24,000 milestone on rising optimism about the prospects of tax reforms after Senator McCain promised his support for the tax cut Bill.Further, Jerome Powell’s comments that he would follow Yellen’s path in terms of monetary policies also boosted investor sentiment. Also, key economic data like GDP registered the highest growth rate since 2014, while consumer confidence hit a 17-year high. However, Flynn-related news raised market uncertainty on Friday and curbed some of the week’s gains.The Dow This WeekThe index gained 0.2% on Monday. U.S. Senate Republicans finally approved the tax cut Bill over the last weekend which boosted bank stocks that eventually helped the Dow to touch new highs. Additionally, strong rate hike chances post Fed’s Dec 12-13 meeting had a positive impact on the broader financial sector.The index decreased 0.5% on Tuesday after investors speculated over the possible effects of retaining the alternate minimum tax provision in the final draft of the tax Bill. Meanwhile, the ISM Service Index for November declined from the 12-year high it had hit a month earlier.Shares of The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) declined 2.7% following reports from CNBC's David Faber that the company was in talks to buy some key assets of 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). This development was the biggest drag on the Dow.The index lost 0.2% on Wednesday after energy stocks declined following a sudden plunge in oil prices. Meanwhile, the technology sector posted its second straight day of gains. According to the EIA, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories slumped 5.6 million barrels to 448.1 million for the week ended Dec 1.However, the EIA reported that gasoline inventories jumped 6.8 million barrels, in contrast to analysts’ forecasts of a rise of only 1.145 million barrels. This led to a decline in oil prices. Both the two key oil behemoths, Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) decreased 0.7%.The index rebounded on Thursday, gaining 0.3%, after tech stocks notched up gains for the third consecutive day. Further, investors maintained a close watch on any developments related to the Republican Tax Bill. Also, markets waited for Friday’s jobs report to gauge the strength of the labor market as a Fed rate hike seems more or less certain.Components Moving the IndexApple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) has won the long-pending case against Chinese manufacturer, Xiaomi over the registration of “Mi Pad” as an European Union (EU) trademark, per Reuters. The tech giant had filed a complaint with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) in 2016 over Xiaomi’s application of Mi Pad as an European trademark in 2014. Apple stated that the name is similar to that of its iPad trademark.Following EUIPO’s support to Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Apple, Xiaomi appealed to the General Court, the second highest court of the European Union. The plea was rejected this Tuesday saying that the similarity of the signs might lead to confusion among users.Per the ruling, “additional letter ‘m’ at the beginning of ""Mi Pad"", is not sufficient to offset the high degree of visual and phonetic similarity between the two signs."" However, Xiaomi can still appeal at EU's highest court, European Court of Justice, against the ruling. (Read: Apple Wins Against Rival Xiaomi in EU Trademark Case)UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) Optum unit has announced the buyout of DaVita Medical Group, a unit of DaVita Inc.

(Read: UnitedHealth to Buy DaVita Medical, Expands Optum Business)Chevron recently announced its capital and exploratory spending program for 2018. Budget for capital projects is reserved at $18.3 billion, lower than this year’s estimate of $19.8 billion. Per the company, capital spending for the next three years will be in the range of $17-$22 billion per annum. Of the total budget for 2018, $5.5 billion is meant for affiliated companies' expenses.The overall 2018 budget is 4% lower than the one provided for 2017. It has been declining for the last four years. Per the company, it is focusing on growth projects, which will add to the company's cash flow in the next two years, including the Permian Basin assets. Completion of several projects and enhanced efficiencies in the company’s operations were also responsible for the lowered budget for 2018.  The company however expects production to grow in the coming year driven by its Permian Basin play. To sustain the current producing assets, the company will bear costs of around $8.7 billion, of which $3.3 billion will be utilized for the Permian Basin. Per Zacks Rank #3 Chevron, $1.0 billion will be used for other shale and tight rock investments. The company's assets in the Tengiz field of Kazakhstan were allotted $3.7 billion while the downstream projects were allotted $2.2 billion. (Read: Chevron Unveils $18.3B Capital Expenditure Budget for 2018)Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is set to rechristen itself in a bid to emerge as an omni-channel retailer officially. The big-box retailer is doing away with the “hyphen” and “stores” from its name and will be known as “Walmart Inc."" effective Feb 1, 2018. Wal-Mart has a Zacks Rank #2 (Strong Buy).Management stated that the company’s current name is used only in few legal places as it is more popular as just “Walmart,"" given its seamless operations across stores, online as well as its app. Thus, this name change will bring uniformity and reveal Walmart’s unified and omni-channel existence universally.

The merger is expected in first-quarter 2018.

Although a company spokesperson declined to comment on such news, an unnamed union source confirmed the veracity of the news. GE has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The job cuts are mostly centered on the power and grid businesses that GE bought from Alstom in 2015 and will affect employees in Switzerland, Germany and Britain. Billed as one of the largest acquisitions of GE at about $10 billion, the transaction increased the employee count of the company by approximately 65,000 with the addition of several field offices and manufacturing sites across the world.

Over the last five trading days, the Dow has lost 0.9%.Next Week’s OutlookInvestors are likely to breathe easier with the Republicans achieving significant success on the tax legislation front. Meanwhile, tech stocks have rebounded strongly after remaining depressed in the recent past over valuation concerns. Investors have also largely priced in the upcoming Fed rate hike.The only negative for markets at this point seems to be the volatility in oil prices, which makes its presence felt on the odd trading day. If most of the economic reports slated for release next week, including crucial data on retail sales, remains encouraging, stocks are likely to notch up steady gains in the days ahead.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Some point to the length of the current bull market as sign enough that bear days are on the horizon.On the other side of things, people point to the strength of technology firms such as Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (APPL) and their ability to make more profits as reasons to be optimistic the run will continue.Coupled with the recent GOP tax overhaul, which will see the corporate tax rate fall from 35% to 21%, investors hope the bull market still has legs.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1991,UNH,"The likes of Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth (UNH  -  Free Report) have helped lift the Dow to new heights in 2018, while early gains from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) just might have signaled that the tech sector is on track for another outstanding year.However, as investors begin to review the 2018 investment landscape, much talked about social media firms might not be a bad place to start, as their use and importance for advertisers is set to expand this year.One company that might stand to benefit from greater social media usage in 2018 is the sometimes-maligned Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report).Recent UpdatesThe market research firm eMarketer noted in a recent report that social media use in the U.S. is expected to climb to new heights in 2018, which is a positive sign for Twitter, as it could use any boost in the daily or monthly active user category that it can get.This year, the U.S. social media user base is expected to hit 200 million, which is just 32 million shy of the entire U.S. adult television audience and would account for over 61% of the total U.S. population. Social media use will also reportedly fall just 29 million users short of the total digital video audience.Twitter has also recently received a few notable upgrades. In mid-December, J.P. Morgan (JPM) upgraded Twitter from “Hold” to “Overweight” and upped its price target to $27 per share. J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth called the social media company “one of our top” small- to mid-cap picks for 2018.""We believe both the TWTR story and financial results will strengthen over the next year as the company continues to build on its differentiated value proposition for users & returns to revenue growth,"" Anmuth wrote in a note to clients.On Tuesday, Aegis Capital analysts upgraded Twitter to a “Buy.” The firm noted that 2018 will mark ""an inflection point"" for the social media company. Aegis said that it expects Twitter to become GAAP profitable, sparked by “sustained double-digit growth” in daily active users.Current Fundamentals During the third-quarter, Twitter grew its DAU base by 14% year-over-year. This marked the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in this category. Twitter was also able to grow its monthly active user base by 4% in Q3. The social media company now boasts 330 million MAUs.The company also began to tout its first real foray into live streaming last quarter. Twitter noted that it streamed over 830 live events in Q3, with 74% reaching a global audience. Twitter also noted that it signed 30 new “live” deals.Twitter is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth and a “B” for Momentum in our Style Scores system, helping the company earn an overall “B” VGM score.Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Twitter is expected to see its revenues and earnings dip, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. However, 2018 is when analysts project that Twitter is set to finally break out of its time in the red.For Twitter’s full fiscal 2018, the company’s bottom-line is expected to hit $0.45 per share, while its full-year revenues are projected to reach $2.59 billion, marking a 7.84% year-over-year jump from its 2017 projections.In terms of long-term earnings growth potential, Twitter is expected to expand its EPS figures at an annualized rate of 21.50% over the next three to five years. Alone, this figure might help investors regain confidence in Twitter, and investors might be even more excited if they pair this EPS growth projection with the expectation that social media use will grow rapidly in 2018.Shares of Twitter have skyrocketed over 46% in the last 12-weeks alone, which blows away the S&P 500 and the “Internet – Software” industry average. However, in spite of this massive run, shares of Twitter rest 4.5% below their 52-week high as of Tuesday’s close.This means that investors could buy shares at a somewhat discounted price ahead of what many predict will be a stellar 2018 for Twitter. The company is set to report its fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb. 8.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Earnings also improved 23.2% year over year, primarily on the back of higher revenues.Operational UpdateFor the quarter, total revenue grew 10% to $12 billion year over year, primarily driven by growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many of the states in 2016 and 2017.This was partially offset by lower membership in the commercial business in California.

This deterioration of 30 basis points (bps) was due to growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, which operates at a lower HBRIn the second quarter, adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses ratio was 9.3%, up 30 bps year over year. This deterioration was due to higher variable compensation expenses based on performance of the business in 2017 and increased business expansion costs.

1993,UNH,"The Dow continued to trade within a tight band during a week dominated by earnings. Investors refrained from posting big bets on Monday, leading to the index ending mostly unchanged. Earnings results guided the Dow’s fortunes over the next two trading days of the week. However, it was a deal between two retailing majors which led to losses for a key component, and hence for the index itself on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow closed at a record high for the third time in a row last Friday. The 30-stock index registered its 25th record close for this year, increasing by 0.4% as tech stocks gained. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) all posted better-than-expected earnings results.But shares of these banking-behemoths fell after reporting decline in trading sales. Investors also digested a couple of poor economic reports on retail sales and inflation, which led market participants to believe that the Federal Reserve may turn dovish.The index gained 1% last week even as all major benchmarks posted solid gains. The indexes overcame a series of bottlenecks from tech overvaluation fears to Russia’s involvement in the U.S. election to climb back into record territory.The Dow This WeekThe index declined a meager 0.04% on Monday as investors refrained from placing big bets ahead of a busy earnings week. Investors geared up for key quarterly earnings results of major players that were slated for release during this week.The index declined 0.3% on Tuesday weighed down by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report). Shares of the banking behemoth slipped after reporting a staggering 40% drop in second-quarter bond trading revenue. Meanwhile, shares of Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) hit a record high following larger than expected subscriber additions in the second quarter. Netflix’s gains helped other benchmarks close in the green.The Dow gained 0.3% on Wednesday. Benchmarks closed at record highs on Wednesday boosted partly by broad-based gains in technology shares. Meanwhile, IBM Corp’s (IBM  -  Free Report) disappointing quarterly results limited the Dow’s advance. Nevertheless, the blue-chip index still managed to finish at a record high.The deal between Sears Holdings Corp. SHLD and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) weighed on home improvement retailers on Thursday. This in turn dragged the Dow 0.1% lower after Home Depot Inc (HD  -  Free Report) lost 4.1%. However, shares of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report) gained momentum on expectations of better-than-expected quarterly results, banking on strong cloud performance and tax benefits.Components Moving the Index American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.47 beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. However, earnings witnessed a sharp 30% year-over-year decline. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-than-expected results were mainly backed by a lower tax rate and the effect of share buyback. However, when comparing year-over-year, the bottom line suffered as the year-ago earnings reflected the $1.1 billion gain recorded from the sale of the Costco Wholesale Corp. COST co-brand portfolio.The company reaffirmed its earlier EPS guidance of $5.60–$5.80 for 2017.

1995,UNH,"Health insurer Aetna Inc.’s (AET  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of $2.45 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.06 by 19% and also grew 18% year over year. The upside reflects continued strong performance in the company’s Health Care segment as well as lower transaction and integration-related costs in 2017 compared to 2016.Operational UpdateHowever, operating revenues of $14.9 billion not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.1 billion by approximately 1% but also declined 5% year over year. The downside stemmed from lower premiums in Health Care segment that includes lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products and the temporary suspension of the health insurer fee (HIF) in 2017.Adjusted expense ratioimproved 10 basis points (bps) to 17.5% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the temporary suspension of the HIF and Aetna's expense management initiatives. This was largely offset by targeted investment spending on the company’s growth initiatives.Total company expense ratioimproved 50 bps from the year-ago quarter to 17.4%, primarily due to lower transaction and integration-related costs.Third-quarter after-tax net income margin was 5.6 %, up 180 bps year over year.  The adjusted pre-tax marginwas 9.2%, up 70 bps from the prior-year quarter. The upside was primarily driven by strong performance in the Health Care segment. This was, however, partially offset by the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the HIF.Medical membership totaled 22.2 million on Sep 30, 2017, down 4.1% year over year.Segmental Performance UpdateHealth Care segmentTotal revenues were $14.3 billion, down 5.3% year over year. Adjusted revenues came at $14.2 billion, down 6% from the prior-year quarter. The downside was due to lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products, lower membership in Medicaid products and the temporary suspension of the HIF. This was somewhat offset by higher premium yields in Commercial and Government businesses and membership growth in Medicare products.Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, flat year over year. This consistent performance reflects strong performance across Aetna's core Health Care businesses and reduced losses in its individual Commercial products. This was, however, partially offset the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the HIF.Total healthcare medical benefit ratio (MBR) rose 10 bps to 81.9% on the back of improvement in Commercial benefit ratio owing to reduced losses in Aetna's individual Commercial products and improved performance across its core Commercial business. This was, however, partially offset by a deterioration in the Government MBR.Group InsuranceTotal revenues of $650 million increased 4.7% from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted revenuesof $631 million grew 2.4% year over year driven by higher premiums in Aetna's life and disability products.Pre-tax adjusted earningswere $34 million, up 54% from the third-quarter 2016 due to higher underwriting margins in disability products, partially offset by lower underwriting margins in life products.Large Case PensionsTotal revenues came at $80 million, up 14% over the third quarter of 2016.

1996,UNH,"After a deluge of strong earnings reports from tech titans, the biggest story on Wall Street is the potential buyout of Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report). This is especially true, as a drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS has proposed to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, or around $66 billion according to various sources.This would represent the biggest deal of the year and the first tie-up of a retailer, an insurer and a pharmacy benefit manager in history. As such, the proposed deal would change the landscape of healthcare business as well as streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain.The merged company would create a one-stop shop for customers' health care needs, ranging from employer healthcare and government plans to managing benefits and running drug stores. By owning Aetna, CVS will become the first triple healthcare player: a drugstore, a pharmacy benefit manager and now an insurer. It would be in a better position to negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers. This is because CVS is one of the key players in the pharmacy benefit management business in the United States and often negotiates drug benefits for insurance plans and employers.Additionally, the combined company could pose a bigger threat to UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), the largest U.S. health insurer having its own pharmacy benefits unit (read: Ride On UnitedHealth Q3 Strength with These ETFs).The move is also to stave off threats from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report), which is making huge expansion into the world of pharmaceutical drugs and has already received pharmacy-wholesaler licenses in a dozen states.However, the transaction is expected to attract high antitrust scrutiny because of its sheer size and overlaps in Medicare Part D, a government program to subsidize prescription drug costs. Notably, CVS has a market capitalization of $77.76 billion while AET has a market cap of $53.35 billion. As such, the approval of the transaction might call for certain divestitures of Medicare prescription drug contracts.ETF ImpactThe proposed merger has put the spotlight on a few healthcare and consumer ETFs that could be the best ways for investors to tap the opportunity arising from the CVS-AET deal. These funds have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting their outperformance in the coming months.iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the Dow Jones U.S. Select Healthcare Providers Index with exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment. In total, the fund holds 45 securities in its basket with Aetna occupying the second position, accounting for 7.3% share. The fund has amassed $482.5 million in its asset base while volume is light at about 26,000 shares per day on average. It charges 44 bps in annual fees (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Consumer Staples ETF (CNSF  -  Free Report)The fund targets companies that have the potential to outperform the broad U.S. consumer staples sector and tracks the MSCI USA Consumer Staples Diversified Multiple-Factor Capped Index. Holding 28 stocks in its basket, CVS Health takes the fifth spot, accounting for 5.8% of the portfolio. In terms of industrial exposure, more than half of the portfolio is dominated by food beverage tobacco while food & staples retailing, and household and personal product take the remainder with a double-digit exposure each. This ETF has attracted $2.5 million in its asset base and trades in a meager volume of about 200 shares. It charges 35 bps in fees per year.VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the 26 largest retail firms by tracking the MVIS US Listed Retail 25 Index.

1999,UNH,"Tuesday, July 18th, 2017As expected, a plethora of earnings reports have hit the tape this morning, including more of the bigger Wall Street banks and other household brands. Put simply, results are mostly good but ultimately mixed thus far. Let’s try to slog through what we’ve found at this hour.Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) beat estimates on both top and bottom lines, but shares are selling off following this earnings report on drastically lower fixed income revenues. Earnings of $3.95 per share beat the $3.51 in the Zacks consensus estimate, on sales of $7.887 billion, well ahead of the $7.57 billion expected. But it was the 40% drop in Fixed Income, Commodities and Currencies (FICC, a staple of Goldman Sachs’ holdings) and the second quarter in a row of poor performance in this segment.Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) also topped estimates: 46 cents per share on $22.83 billion beat the 43 cents and $21.91 billion, respectively, in the Zacks consensus. An after-tax windfall of $103 million related to the sale of its non-consumer credit card business helped achieve the quarterly beat on the top line. This is at least the fifth quarter in a row of posting an earnings beat for the North Carolina-based bank major.Healthcare product retailer Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by 4 cents per share to $1.83 in the quarter, though revenues of $18.84 billion missed the $18.90 billion expected. However, guidance for both sales and earnings for fiscal 2017 were revised upward within the earnings report, helping JNJ shares rise 2% immediately following the results.Defense contractor giant Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) surpassed the Zacks consensus for both earnings and revenues: $3.23 per share beat the $3.10 anticipated, and quarterly sales of $12.69 billion beat the $12.46 billion expected. The company’s Aeronautics segment grew 19% year over year, helping boost Lockheed’s results in the quarter, and the shares are trading up in today’s pre-market.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated healthcare provider United Health (UNH  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates for its Q2, on revenues that marginally surpassed our consensus. Earnings of $2.46 per share beat by 8 cents in the quarter, and sales of $50.1 billion was a smudge above the $49.97 billion expected. The company has raised its forecast for fiscal 2017, and this marks at least the fifth quarter in a row of an earnings beat. Shares are up modestly at this hour.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author? Click here>>

2002,UNH,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because UnitedHealth Group is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for UNH in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.39 per share for UNH, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.38 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for UNH, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 0.42% heading into earnings season.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annUNH returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that UNH has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for UnitedHealth Group, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2003,UNH,"Healthcare stocks are back in focus as the “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” scenario plays out. A lot has been happening in this part of the medical sector with efforts to “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” not meeting with much success and basically collapsing.A quick look at the events that have unfolded over the past few months shows that “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” has been a key goal for President Trump who had said that his first course of action, once elected, for Obamacare would be to ask Congress to repeal it immediately. However, the President and Republican party leaders first suffered a setback in March this year with a healthcare bill (the American Healthcare Act or Trumpcare) being pulled from the House floor when it became clear that there would not be enough votes to pass the bill.Then in June, the Senate issued its version, the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, with certain changes being made -- however, four Republican Senators (Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, and Mike Lee) issued a joint statement saying that they were not ready to vote for the bill due to several reasons but were open to negotiation and obtaining more information before the bill was brought to the floor. While the Senators acknowledged that the draft bill was an improvement to the current health care system, they noted that it did not appear to accomplish the goal of repealing Obamacare and making health care more affordable.Last week, the Senate came out with a revised version of its bill but this too failed to garner full support with Senators Mike Lee and Jerry Moran announcing earlier this week that they will not vote for the current version of the bill. Moreover, moderate senators were concerned by the cuts to Medicaid.Repeal Now, Replace LaterWith efforts to “Repeal and Replace Obamacare” failing, the focus has now shifted to repealing Obamacare without an immediate replacement -- the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017. But what will the repercussions be if such a move is taken?According to a report issued by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) yesterday, enacting this legislation would cut federal deficits by $473 billion over the coming decade. However, the number of uninsured people would go up by 17 million in 2018 and average premiums in the nongroup market would increase by about 25%.Once the ACA’s expansion of eligibility for Medicaid and subsidies for insurance purchased through the marketplaces established by the ACA are eliminated, the number of uninsured Americans would go up by 27 million in 2020 with premiums rising about 50%. 2026 would see the uninsured go up by 32 million with premiums doubling compared to the current law. Given these numbers, it doesn’t seem likely that “Repeal Now, Replace Later” will get much support.Impact on Healthcare StocksAs the “Repeal Now, Replace Later” scenario plays out, hospital and insurance stocks will remain in the limelight. Insurance stocks have had a very strong run so far in 2017 with the Zacks-categorized Medical - Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) industry outperforming the S&P 500 with the industry climbing 22% compared to the overall market gain of 10.7%. Not surprisingly, the HMO industry is among the top 13% of the Zacks-ranked industries with key players like Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Magellan Health, Inc. (MGLN  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) are Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Hospital stocks have also had a pretty decent run so far this year though this sector will be under pressure if Obamacare gets repealed without a suitable replacement. This is because hospitals benefited under Obamacare with more than 20 million people gaining coverage. Repealing and/or replacing Obamacare without a suitable replacement would result in a significant increase in the uninsured population which does not bode well for hospitals. The Zacks-categorized Medical-Hospital industry is currently among the bottom 30% of the Zacks-ranked industries.With healthcare reform expected to remain a key topic of discussion, expect volatility and uncertainty in this corner of the healthcare market in the near-term.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

QuoteQuarter DetailsAcadia Healthcare’s revenues for the third quarter declined 2.4% to $716.7 million from the prior-year quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.5%. The decline could be attributed to higher provision for doubtful accounts.Same facility revenues increased 5.5%, with a 3.5% increase in patient days and a 1.9% increase in revenue per patient day.The same facility revenue growth can be attributed to the addition of more than 600 new beds to existing facilities in the 12 months ended Sep 30, 2017.

2006,UNH,"Anthem Inc.’s (ANTM  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted net income per share of $2.65 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.41 by 10%. The bottom line also jumped 8.2% year over year.Operating revenues of $22.1 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.1%. The top line, however, grew 4.6% year over year due to premium rate increases as well as higher enrollment in the Medicaid, Medicare, and Local Group insured and self-funded businesses.Operational UpdateMedical enrollment increased 0.9% year over year to 40.3 million members. The rise was primarily recorded by commercial & specialty business as well as fully insured and self-funded Local Group businesses. Medicare and Medicaid enrollment also contributed to the appreciation. This upside was partially offset by a decline in membership in the National Account and Individual businesses.Total expenses increased nearly 5.1% to $21.3 billion in the reported quarter, mainly due to a 7% rise in benefitexpenses and 3% increase in selling expenses, both on a year-over-year basis.Anthem’s benefit expense ratio of 87% deteriorated 150 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter. This was largely due to the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. However, the impact of a retroactive revenue adjustment in the Medicaid business and improved medical cost performance in the Individual and Large Group businesses were offsets.The Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expense ratio of 13.6% increased 120 bps from the year-ago quarter. This was due to one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and the impact of fixed cost leverage on operating revenue growth. However, the rise was partially offset by increased spend to support growth initiatives during the quarter.Segment UpdateCommercial & Specialty BusinessOperating revenues were $10 billion in the third quarter, up 4.1% year over year.Operating gain totaled $534.6 million, down 16.2% year over year due to increased spend to support growth initiatives during the quarter and the impact of the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. The decrease was partially offset by improved medical cost performance in the Local Group and Individual businesses.Operating margin was 5.3%, down 130 bps year over year.Government BusinessOperating revenues were $12 billion in the third quarter, up 5% from the prior-year quarter.Operating gain was $457.5 million, down 4.5% year over year. The downside reflected increased spend to support growth initiatives during the quarter and the impact of the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. However, the deterioration was partially offset by the timing impact of a retroactive revenue adjustment in the Medicaid business.Operating margin was 3.8%, declining 40 bps year over year.Other  Operating revenues were $7.3 million in the third quarter, up 21.7% from the prior-year quarter.The segment reported an operating loss of $10.1 million, narrower than an operating loss of $38.5 million in the prior-year quarter.

The ISM Services index hit record high since Aug 2005, hinting at broadly encouraging economic conditions.

This also marked its highest level since Aug 2005 when the index logged a reading 61.3%. The report from ISM also stated that non-manufacturing sector showed strong growth despite hurricanes Harvey and Irma ravaging swathes of Texas and Florida. This augurs well for the economy. Of the 17 non-manufacturing sectors which were surveyed, 14 depicted growth in the last month.

2010,UNH,"In recent times, we have witnessed catastrophic hurricanes making landfall on the U.S. soil, missile launches over Japan by North Korea, global terror attacks and cyber breach at credit bureau Equifax and the Securities and Exchange Commission.The Dow Jones, however, continued to scale record highs despite the bad tidings. The blue-chip index extended its winning streak to six straight sessions after President Trump’s closest confidant Rex Tillerson denied that he has considered stepping down. Trump administration, in the meanwhile, is moving ahead with his new tax plan that further helped stock traders breathe a sigh of relief.But, the primary catalyst that is helping the 30-stock index gain ground is bullish economic data. The ISM services index expanded at the fastest clip in 12 years on the heels of a solid ISM manufacturing report. Needless to say, the U.S. economy is growing close to the range expected by Trump and some other Republicans. This has provided a fillip to U.S. corporate profits, while the Federal Reserve’s intention to hike rates exhibited the underlying strength of the economy.Given the positives, investing in blue-chip dividend paying stocks seems tempting at the moment. These stocks provide higher returns at lower risks, which are undoubtedly the ‘holy grail’ of investing. Dividend payers, moreover, have remarkable financial strength and are immune to market vagaries. After all, this month is traditionally known to be the most volatile for the broader market. The daily percentage change this month is 1.44%, compared with 1.08% for the other months.Before we cheery pick such stocks, here’s a look at the factors that helped the Dow Jones kick off October on a high note:Best Service Sector Growth in 12 YearsNon-manufacturing activity picked up in the United States to scale a 12-year high in September. Services Purchasing Managers’ Index was boosted by a rise in production and new orders. According to the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), the non-manufacturing gauge came in at 59.8% last month, its highest reading since August 2005.The new orders index registered 63%, six points higher than that recorded in the previous month, while the production index, climbed to a five-month high of 61.3%. This encouraging report on service growth showed a steady recovery of the economy from the hurricane-related setback.Factory Activity Hits 13-Year HighA key yardstick of manufacturing activity in the United States scaled a 13-year high in September, courtesy of two major hurricanes. Increased demand for rebuilding supplies somewhat drove manufacturing activity. New orders, production, new export orders and hiring increased last month.According to the ISM, the manufacturing index climbed to 60.8% in September from 58.8% in August. Notably, 17 of the 18 industries reported growth last month, led by textile mills and machinery. Only furniture manufacturing witnessed a decline (read more: U.S. Manufacturing Activity Hits 13-Year High: Top 5 Winners).Economic Recovery Solid, Corporate Earnings EncourageThe U.S. GDP expanded 3.1% in the second quarter, the fastest in more than two years. It is also up slightly from a previously reported 3%. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment drove the upside. Increased spending on goods and services pushed consumer expenditure up 3.3% in the said quarter.The resilience of the domestic economy boosted earnings results. Total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index were up 11.1% from the same period last year on 5.5% higher revenues. This marked the second straight quarter of double-digit growth. Earnings growth is also expected to enter the positive territory in Q3. Total Q3 earnings are poised to be up 3.2% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues (read more: Handicapping the Q3 Earnings Season).Trump’s Tax Policy ProposalsTrump has urged the Congress to proceed faster with the corporate tax cut and had recently held a bipartisan group of House members at the White House to discuss a tax deal. He has been working on a major tax overhaul in more than three decades. Ever since 1986, the tax code hasn’t been restructured, when President Ronald Reagan along with a divided Congress broadened the tax base and slashed marginal tax rates.Trump proposed a multi-trillion-dollar tax cut that would boost the U.S. economy and drive corporate profits. Such a tax cut included trimming of the business tax rate to 20% from 35%. Low corporate tax will benefit businesses of all sizes, as most of them will see an improvement in the bottom line (read more: 5 Stocks Blistering Higher on Tax Reform).5 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy for Solid GainsThanks to the bullish factors, there has been a particularly sharp rally in the Dow.  The companies under the index are slated to gain further in the near term as they have large market capitalization, strong balance sheets and solid cash flow. They also return record amount of money to shareholders in the form of dividends.We have, thus, selected five blue-chip dividend paying stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2012,UNH,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because UnitedHealth is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for UNH in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.62 per share for UNH, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.58 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for UNH, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 1.58% heading into earnings season. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

2013,UNH,"We expect health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter results on Oct 17, before market opens.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that UnitedHealth has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.94%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.61 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.56.The positive ESP is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteWhat is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?We expect the quarter’s results to show broad-based growth across the enterprise.Its segment, UnitedHealth Care, is expected to witness an increase in membership across its employer-sponsored, Medicare, Medicaid and international medical benefit offerings.The company has been performing strongly in its government business which includes Medicare and Medicaid. We expect solid Medicare advantage performance to continue in the third quarter driven by the combination of premium and benefit stability, rising stars rating performance, and improved service and clinical performance, all leading to record retention rates.The company’s Medicaid business is also performing well with continued growth in membership enrollment. The same is expected in the third quarter through new contract awards from states for Managed Medicaid business, as well as for expanded services for additional segments of the Medicaid eligible population.We expect to see increased enrollment in the third quarter driven by increased membership in Medicare Advantage, Commercial and Medicaid plans.Results should also show an increase in revenues from its health services’ segment Optum, driven by higher contribution from sub-segments OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx.Earnings will, however, be partially offset by a reduction in the number of people served through individual products as the company withdrew from almost all individual public exchange markets.The company’s bottom line will be cushioned by cost-control initiatives and capital management by way of share buyback.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies in the same space that you may also consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Humana Inc.

2015,UNH,"Health insurers have been in focus since the election of President Donald Trump, who intended to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The issue, however, remained unresolved due to lack of votes and hence, regulatory uncertainty continues to linger.The most recent effort by Senate Republicans to repeal the ACA, failed to meet success after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) decided not to hold a vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill.Health Insurers Continue to ImpressDespite facing stringent regulations, health insurers have shown impressive operating performance over the past several quarters, with most of the top players clocking solid top line, bottom line and membership growth. Their strong capital position also reflects profitable operations.Further, health insurers are well positioned for long-term growth on the back of continuously increasing demand for government plans that primarily include Medicare and Medicaid plans. The aging U.S. population has boosted the overall demand for medical coverage. Hence, revenues of the companies dealing with these plans have seen consistent rise in government business.The ACA has largely benefitted the industry through a reduction in uninsured population, consequently adding to medical enrollment and bad debt management.Business diversifying strategies with primary focus on ancillary services and products have boosted insurers’ revenue base.However, losses on public exchanges are a major headwind for the insurers.Increasing operating costs related to regulations, investments in information technology, levy of fees and taxes also weigh on health insurers’ margins. The insurers, however are trying to manage this cost issue with the help of Accountable Care Organizations.Stocks in FocusDespite the challenges, health insurance stocks have had a bull run with the industry gaining nearly 5% for the third-quarter 2017, outperforming the S&P 500 average of 4%. The HMO industry is among the top 3% of the Zacks-ranked industries with key players like Triple-S Management Corporation (GTS  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) and Select Medical Holdings, Corp. (SEM  -  Free Report). While Triple-S Management sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), the other three stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Triple-S Management, a leading health maintenance organization has rallied 40%, outperforming the industry. The company has also seen its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 being revised upward by 377% and 38.2%, respectively, in the past 90 days.UnitedHealth Group, a leading diversified health and well-being company has outperformed the industry in the third quarter of 2017, evident from its gain of 5.6%, outperforming the industry. The company has also seen its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 being revised upward by 1% and 0.2%, respectively, in the past 90 days.Centene, a multi-national healthcare company of the United States has gained 21% in the third-quarter of 2017, outperforming the industry. The company has also seen its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 being revised upward by 3.4% and 2.4%, respectively, in the past 90 days.Select Medical, another leading managed care company has gained 25.1% in the third-quarter of 2017, outperforming the industry.

2016,UNH,"UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) has witnessed a rating action from Moody's Investors Service. Moody's affirmed the senior debt rating of the UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company (UHIC) unit at ‘A3’ and the insurance financial strength (IFS) rating at 'A1.’Moody’s also upgraded the outlook on UnitedHealth and UHIC to stable from negative.Looking back, Moody’s had put the company’s rating on negative watch following its acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager Catamaran in 2015. This raised the company’s leverage ratio as the deal was financed by debt.The rating action takes into account the company’s leadership position in the industry, its diversified business product profile, its profitable health benefits and health service segments. Consistent cash generation by UnitedHealth has enabled it to lower its debt levels.An offsetting factor is the company’s use of debt for acquisitions, which makes it more leveraged. Also, high goodwill and lower risk based capital ratio (as at the end of 2016) is another blip.Volatility in medical cost and regulatory uncertainties are the other headwinds facing the company.Nevertheless, the rating agency is of the opinion that the company will continue to post strong earnings driven by stable medical utilization trends, disciplined medical management, and efforts toward reducing debt levels to 40% from 44% as of Mar 31, 2017.In the last one year, the stock has returned 32%, a little lower than the Zacks categorized Medical - HMOs industry’s gain of 35%. However, the underperformance is not a matter of concern and we expect shares to gain traction soon, given the company’s strong fundamentals.Early during the year, two major players in the same industry — Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) — got their respective debt ratings affirmed, with a stable outlook from Moody’s, after they mutually terminated their merger.UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Another stock in the same space with the same Zacks Rank is Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report).Cigna is expected to deliver a positive earnings surprise when it reports second-quarter results on Aug 4, since it has a favorable Zacks Rank and an Earnings ESP of +0.81%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhoneIt could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2020,UNH,"Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report) is one of the largest publicly traded managed care organizations in terms of membership. Strategic acquisitions, national accounts in the commercial segment and the Medicaid expansion in the government segment have significantly boosted the company’s membership base.Anthem’s revenues have also grown on the back of net investment income that started increasing since 2016 on the back of interest rate hikes.The Indianapolis, IN-based company’s capital management, backed by solid cash position, also impresses.  Sufficient generation of cash flows have enabled the company to enhance shareholders’ value through several capital deployment initiatives like share repurchases, dividend payouts etc.The company maintains a consistent record of earnings outperformance. In three of the last four quarters, Anthem’s bottom line surpassed expectations with an average beat of 8.6%. Following strong second-quarter 2017 results, the company raised its earnings and revenue guidance for 2017 that further boosts shareholders' confidence in the stock.However, loss incurred from public exchange business continues to hurt the company’s bottom line and top line, as evident from a significant decline in enrollment in this business since 2016. Although management has been taking steps to ensure both a stable and sustainable returns from individual market, we remain cautious. Along with other health insurers like Humana Inc (HUM  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group, Inc (UNH  -  Free Report), Anthem is planning to scale back its participation on this loss-making business for 2018.Moreover, the company’s rising level of debt not only increases financial risks but also raises interest expenses, which weighs on margins.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!    It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2021,UNH,"Markets closed slightly higher on Friday after healthcare stocks surged after Senator McCain decided not to support the repealing of the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, shares of Apple tumbled after iPhone 8’s release was met with a less than impressive response. This weighed heavily on the Dow, which ended in the red. Further, tensions between North Korea and the United States escalated after Kim Jong-un retaliated against President Trump's comments at the United Nations.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,349.59, losing 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.1% to close at 2,502.22. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,422.69, increasing 0.1%.

This crushed Republicans’ hopes of pushing through the Graham –Cassidy legislation which also implies repeal of the Obamacare plan.Such a statement from McCain sent healthcare stocks higher. The SPDR Health Care Select Sector ETF, which was down 0.5% in the afternoon, pared losses to finish just 0.1% lower. Shares of Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corp. (CIG  -  Free Report) both gained 0.2%. This boosted the overall markets.However, uncertainty about the success of the Graham-Cassidy legislation sent the shares of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) lower by over 1.6%. This weighed heavily on the Dow.Apple Suffers Worst Weekly Loss in a YearApple (AAPL  -  Free Report) suffered its worst weekly loss in a year’s time after it dipped about 1% after speculations over lack of demand of its recently launched smartphone iPhone 8 weighed on the broader markets. Speculations regarding low demand for iPhone 8 arose after the response to its launch was less than exuberant. The company possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This weighed heavily on the Dow and the blue-chip index shed almost 10 points to end in negative territory. Also adding to woes of the Dow was a decline in the shares of UnitedHealth Group. Meanwhile, Russell 2000 index breached record after it closed at 1,450.78, gaining almost 7 points or 0.5%. This also marked the small-cap index’s first record close since Jul 25.Geopolitical Tensions with North Korea EscalateIn the latest of a series of threats, North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho announced that the country was planning to test a hydrogen bomb in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. This test would mark North Korea’s first outside its borders. Coincidentally, this comes right after North Korea’s Kim Jong-un retaliated against Trump’s comments at the United Nation General Assembly.Earlier, Trump had issued fresh sanctions against North Korea in response to the country’s missile launching spree. He also promised to blacklist individuals and organizations engaging in business with North Korea in an announcement on Thursday. Market watchers chose to ignore such developments as analysts feel that investors have become immune to tensions with North Korea.Weekly RoundupFor the week, the Dow and the S&P 500 gained 0.4% and 0.1% respectively. However, the Nasdaq posted a weekly loss of 0.3%. President Donald Trump made his debut speech at the United Nations General Assembly and urged member states to combat ‘rogue’ nations. Meanwhile, Fed announced the much anticipated unwinding of its $4.5 trillion balance sheet at the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting, deciding to keep the benchmark interest rates unchanged. However, it indicated a rate hike was likely in December.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2022,UNH,"UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) looks all the more attractive now in an industry that is witnessing massive regulatory disruption from renewed repeal and replace efforts. Its business model which has lesser exposure to Obamacare exchanges and Medicaid (which are on gun point of repeal and replace) provides it a good defense against any changes that might be  introduced.The company is rather a big player in Medicare which has support from the Trump presidency. The market also has a huge growth potential from high demand from baby boomers for this plan.The stock has been witnessing upward revisions over the last 90 days, indicating analysts’ optimism about its earnings growth potential.

The company’s recent guidance also points toward top-line growth, cementing our confidence in the stock.Bottom Line Growing at Double Digits: Similar to the top line, UnitedHealth’s earnings per share have also been growing for the past several years.  This has been achieved on the back of its premium growth, expense management, disciplined underwriting and share buybacks. A strong guidance for 2017 is being viewed favorably by investors.Financial Strength: The company has a strong track of cash flow. It also remains committed to enhance shareholders’ value through share buybacks and dividend payouts. The company’s strong free cash flow has enabled it to deleverage its balance sheet.Superior ROE: Further, UnitedHealth’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) reinforces its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 21.5%, has increased in the past three years, and  remains higher than the ROE of 20% for the industry, reflecting is tactical efficiency in using shareholders’ funds.Other StocksSome other top-ranked players in the same space are Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report), Magellan Health, Inc. (MGLN  -  Free Report) and WellCare Health Plans Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report).  Each of these stocks carries the same Zacks Rank as UnitedHealth.

2023,UNH,"Once again efforts are being made to repeal and replace Obamacare via the Graham-Cassidy bill.This bill is another attempt to undo Obamacare, after repeal and replace efforts by Trump hit the rocks due to insufficient votes.The ChangesA number of proposals included in the plan would alter Obamacare. Among  the most unpopular of these are putting an end to individual and employer mandate, giving a block grant to Medicaid, elimination of  Obamacare subsidies that lower premiums, deductibles and co-pays, and ending of cost sharing subsidies by 2020.Strict provisions relating to pre-existing conditions are also likely to be loosened. While insurers will have to provide coverage for pre-existing conditions (something that Obamacare also required), they will have the ability to charge more to sicker patients.Concerns of Industry ParticipantsIn a letter addressed to the leaders McConnell and Schumer, America’s Health Insurance Plans (“AHIP”) expressed its concerns that the bill, if passed, might have on the health care industry. The group is of the opinion that the proposal fails to stabilize the individual insurance market, which provides subsidized plans to low-income people. It will also cause people with pre-existing conditions to fall out of the insurance net and disrupt the Medicaid market. This would make health insurance less affordable and unattractive, ultimately causing more people to forego insurance, thereby leading to an increase in the uninsured rate.Bernard Tyson, chairman and CEO of the sprawling Kaiser Permanente nonprofit health system, also holds a similar view on the proposal.Overall, the various participants of the health care sector remain unsupportive of the bill and are lobbying against it.Impact on Health Care CompaniesThe companies having high exposure to exchange business and Medicaid such as Centene Corp. (CNC  -  Free Report) and Molina Health Care (MOH  -  Free Report) are likely to suffer the maximum earnings decline.Hospital companies in general are expected to suffer from the likely increase in uninsured patients which will lead to a rise in uncompensated care and consequently increase their bad debt. Volumes will also be expected to remain under pressure as people shy away from medical help due to high deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.Nevertheless, companies having more diversified operations such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Cigna are relatively better positioned to sail through.The concern was reflected in the decline of 0.8% in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) on Sep 19, just after the proposal was made.The health care sector has been in the limelight since Donald Trump took charge. Thenumerous proposals of repeal and replace , from time to time, has sent shock waves across the industry. The sector however, has been able to shrug off all concerns and perform strongly as evident by a gain of 18.8% year to date compared with the 11% returns by the S&P 500.  Going ForwardSep 30, is the deadline for the bill to pass the Senate with a simple majority vote (50 rather than 60), under the rules of reconciliation. The bill is fast gaining support, this time also likely from a key Republican governor, Doug Ducey of Arizona. This could lug along the support of Senator John McCain, who voted against the last repeal bill.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2024,UNH,"Public exchanges, formed to serve the underprivileged and patients, have not been too successful in serving the insurers. This is evident from losses incurred by most of the health insurers participating in these exchanges.Affordability-Risk Pool Trade OffThe exchanges saw a deluge of very sick patients buying insurance cover online, thanks to the subsidies provided to the enrollees. They, however, failed to attract sufficient enrollments from healthy and young individual, which was required to balance the risk-return trade off. This led to increase in claims on business conducted on these exchanges.Let us discuss how the big four insurers have been affected by this public exchange business.Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report), one of the nation’s largest health insurance companies, recently announced that it would pull back its participation from public exchanges, expecting a loss of $200 million in 2017. Aetna incurred pre-tax operating losses of $450 in 2016.Lackluster results from this line of business prompted the company to substantially reduce its risk exposure to these products for 2017. Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, is another big insurer offering plans on Affordable Care Act (ACA). Anthem suffered a decline in enrollment in 2016 and the same continued in the first-half 2017.This prompted the company to scale back its participation in this loss-making business for 2018. It pulled out of exchange plans in 11 states for 2017.Although management has been taking steps to ensure both a stable and sustainable individual market as well as a smooth transition for consumers, uncertainty remains.UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) lost more than $1 billion on the exchanges in 2015 and 2016. After two years of losing money from plans sold on the ACA insurance exchanges, it exited nearly all of the exchanges for 2017. UnitedHealth presently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has already declared that it will exit its Individual Commercial business in 2018. After incurring mounting losses in this business in 2015 and 2016, Humana pulled back its participation from 11 states in 2016. The insurer anticipates incurring a modest $45 million loss on ACA exchange plans in 2017, excluding the effect of which, it estimates the earnings per share for 2017 to be at least $11.50. The company also carries Zacks Rank #3.Continued UncertaintyThe health insurers that have been making significant losses on ACA exchange plans are uncertain about thefinal verdict from the Trump administration. This is because the administration has been vocal about removing cost reduction subsides that help insurance companies pay claims of patients buying coverage on public exchanges.These players have been lobbying to keep these subsidies intact, which would otherwise lead to the health plan enrollees facing cost increases of 20-25% for 2018 coverage.The U.S. Senate is working on a bipartisan approach for shoring up the ACA’s public exchanges by funding cost-sharing subsidies for low income patients.The uncertainty on the CSR funding puts a question mark on the sustainability of these  exchanges. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, it will not be surprising to see an exodus of insurance companies from these exchanges.  This exit will lead to more Americans finding themselves with fewer healthcare options, causing an increase in uninsured rates, defeating the central tenet of the Health Care Reform Act.4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye OnWith news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace, the cybersecurity industry looks like a promising investment opportunity.

2026,UNH,"On Sep 13, shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $200.8.In a year, the stock has returned 46.5%, slightly outperforming the gain of 45.2% logged by the  industry and 15.7% by the S&P 500 index.What Led to the New High?The company’s recent acquisition announcements have  possibly led to this rally.According to sources, the company has entered into an agreement to buy a Chilean company, BanMedica. It is a vertically integrated healthcare services company offering health insurance and medical services through its clinics in Chile, Peru and Colombia. The deal boosted investor confidence as it would provide new geographic diversification.Shares also must have gained from the recently signed agreement to take over the health care business of The Advisory Board Company .

It will also strengthen UnitedHealth’s already strong health service segment, Optum.   These moves enable the company to shift its focus from core business, health benefits, which struggles with stringent regulations and an uncertain industry environment.The company is therefore working on growing other parts of its business which have little or no regulatory interference and has higher profitability. This will enable it to adapt to the government regulations and tap growth opportunities.A couple of other stocks in the same space, Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and Centene Corp.

2027,UNH,"The Healthcare sector has been in the limelight since the election of President Donald Trump, a vehement opponent of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). His proposed changes (some of which go against the interest of the insurers), via the proposal to repeal and replace, raised concerns across the space.Repeal and replace, however, has been left hanging in midair due to lack of sufficient government support. Therefore, continued regulatory uncertainty persists in the sector.Industry TrendsThe health insurance industry, meanwhile, continues to grow profitably as evident from the rise in its top line, as by most companies in the recently reported quarter. Many companies like Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group Inc.(UNH  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) raised their outlook for 2017. This is indicative of significant growth opportunities in the industry.Players in the industry are well positioned for long-term growth on the back of continuously increasing demand for government plans that primarily include Medicare and Medicaid. Revenues of the companies dealing with these plans like UnitedHealth Group, Anthem and Humana have been witnessing consistent upticks on the back of government business.Thanks to the ACA, the industry has been benefiting from a reduction in the uninsured population that aided in medical enrollment as well as helped companies lower bad debts.Rapidly increasing business diversification, focus on ancillary services and products contributing significantly to the insurers’ revenues help the companies combat the effects of stringent regulations.Also, as the median age of the U.S. population grows, overall demand for medical coverage continues to rise.Nevertheless, health insurers continue to suffer from underperforming public exchanges as these businesses have resulted in significant losses for most of the players.Increasing operating cost related to regulations, investments in information technology, levy of fees and taxes also weigh on health insurers’ margins.Although the U.S Senate has rejected the appeal of President Trump to repeal and replace the ACA as part of regulatory reform, an uncertainty has risen regarding the future of the deal. This is expected to result in higher uninsured rates and weak patient volume in the United States.The Congressional Budget Office’s estimation also states that reduction in government spending will lead to a loss of insurance for 23 million people over the next 10 years.Industry Rank & Price PerformanceDespite the challenges, the health insurance industry is currently ranked #20, which represents the top 8% of the Zacks Industry Rank.It has also been able to perform well as evident from its rally of 47.8% in the last one year compared with 16.4% gain registered by the S&P 500.Stocks Worth ConsideringWe bring to you three health insurance stocks that have a solid Value Score, a favorable Zacks Rank and has delivered average positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters.Aetnais a provider of healthcare, dental, pharmacy, group life, disability, and long-term care benefits.

(UNH  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18, before the opening bell.Last quarter, UnitedHealth surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.72%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackWe expect the quarter’s results to show broad-based growth across the enterprise.Its segment, UnitedHealth Care, is expected to witness an increase in membership across its employer-sponsored, Medicare, Medicaid and international medical benefit offerings. This will be partially offset by a reduction in the number of people served through individual products as the company withdrew from almost all ACA Individual markets.Results should also show an increase in revenues from its health services segment Optum, driven by higher contribution from subsegments OptumHealth and OptumInsight and OptumRx.The company’s bottom line will be cushioned by cost-control initiatives and capital management by way of share buyback.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that UnitedHealth is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: UnitedHealth has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

2030,UNH,"Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) is on a stellar run. Continued strong growth in membership, superior performance of business units along with solid capital position, and an upbeat outlook with strong fundamentals have propelled the stock.The same is reflected in the company’s share price, which has gained a whopping 38% year to date, significantly outdoing the mere 1.4% growth for the industry it belongs to.Cigna with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) looks all the more impressive at a time when the healthcare sector is grappling with stringent regulations and remains under considerable regulatory uncertainty. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The returns compare favorably with gains of 23.5%, 31%, 34% for UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), respectively.  So what led the momentum in the stock?    The stock is gaining from the company’s strong performance. Its Global Supplement business has been  growing for the past many years, a trend which continued through the first half of 2017. For 2017, the company expects adjusted income from operations of $310 million to $330 million (up from the previous guidance of $295 million to $315 million), which translates into a year-over-year growth rate of nearly 9% (calculated at the midpoint).We expect the segment to grow on the back of its leading innovations, direct-to-consumer distribution capabilities, and easy-to-understand, affordable products that are designed to fill in gaps in coverage and locally licensed and strongly managed talent.Also, its Seniors market — Medicare Advantage (MA), MA Part D, and Medicaid businesses — is poised for strong growth. Cigna forayed into the Medicare Advantage market (where it was virtually nonexistent) by acquiring HealthSpring Inc. We expect high single-digit revenue growth from this line of business in the long term.Membership growth, which has been steady for quarters now, has been seen this year too. We expect a rise in membership going forward, given its diversified product portfolio, a wide agent network and superior service.  For 2017, the company expects global medical customers to grow from 500,000, to 600,000 lives over year-end 2016, reflecting the strong growth experienced by the company across its Commercial market segments.Its strong capital position is impressive. The company’s cash flow from operations has been increasing consistently for the last three years and the trend continued in the first half of 2017. Its disciplined capital management strategy involves investments in its business portfolio, strategic mergers and acquisitions, and share repurchases.Above all, the recent guidance raise by the company cements our confidence in the stock. Cigna expects adjusted income from operations to grow 19% to 23% (versus the previous outlook of 12% to 18%). Revenue guidance of $41.1 billion translates into a year-over-year increase of 3.5%. Cigna’s earnings per share projection of $9.75 to $10.05 (versus the previous outlook of $9.35-$9.85) hints at growth of 37.7% over 2016 (calculated at the midpoint of the guidance).Given the bunch of positives, we expect momentum in the shares of Cigna to continue in the coming quarters.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2032,UNH,"On Aug 29, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) hits a 52-week high of $255.91. The improvement is believed to have been driven by strong second-quarter results, guidance raise and the recent completion of accelerated share buyback.Notably, the stock has surged 43% in the last year, almost in line with the industry’s rally of 42% but significantly outperforming the S&P 500 index’s rise of 12.2%.In fact, investors are optimistic on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s strong second-quarter earnings that topped Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.3%. This uptick was owing to solid performance by both the Medicare Advantage business segment and Retail segment.The company’s raised guidance (for the second time this year) is also encouraging.

2033,UNH,"The broader U.S. market has been wavering for the last few days. First, tensions between President Donald Trump and North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un were sky-high thanks to nuclear activity by the latter. Second, U.S. stocks have been guilty of overvaluation for quite some time.Finally, the disbanding of President Trump’s Manufacturing Council and Trump’s warning of a government shutdown sparked off political anxiety in America. The latest Fed minutes also showed that policymakers are wary of weak inflation. Meanwhile, some U.S. economic readings have come in weak.The net result is 0.9% one-month slide in the S&P 500-based ETF (SPY  -  Free Report) and a 1.4% decline in the Nasdaq 100-based ETF (QQQ  -  Free Report). But the Dow Jones Industrial Average-based ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) gained about 1.3% in a month (as of August 23, 2017).Let’s find out what led the Dow ETF scrape past the other two:As per an article published on nytimes, the two indexes – The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones – “usually move within a percentage point or two of one another.”  But in the last three months (as of August 23, 2017) DIA returned (up 4.8%) almost double that of SPY (up 2.4%). Along with nytimes, we believe that the key cause of this divergence is Boeing shares.Let’s delve a little deeper and find what other stocks were possible for this divergent performance and what could be the future of SPY and DIA.Boeing’s Exposure to DIA & SPYBoeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) holds the top spot in DIA with about 7.42% exposure while the stock is nowhere in the top-10 holdings of SPY. Boeing shares added about 30.5% in the last three months (as of August 23, 2017).Apple’s Exposure to DIA & SPYApple (AAPL  -  Free Report) shares have about 5% exposure in DIA while its weight in SPY is relatively less at 3.95%.UnitedHealth Group’s Exposure toDIA & SPYUnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) shares have about 6% exposure in DIA with no exposure in the top-10 holdings of SPY.McDonald’s Exposure to DIA & SPYMcDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) shares gained about 8.1% in the last three months. DIA puts about 5% of its portfolio in MCD while SPY’s top-10 holdings are void of MCD.Visa’s Exposure to DIA & SPYVisa (V  -  Free Report) has over 3% weight in DIA unlike SPY. As a result, VISA’s sharp ascent offered an edge to DIA over SPY.Can the Edge of DIA Hold over SPY?The DIA’s edge over SPY may lose in the coming days given the not-so-great prospect of McDonald’s and Visa as evident from the VGM scores. However, the index as well as the fund are likely to be favored by Boeing and UnitedHealth Group thanks to their bullish VGM score and Zacks Industry Rank.Apple shares are likely to play a moderate role in DIA as well as SPY’s performance as the stock has a decent VGM score of C but belongs to a downbeat Zacks Industry Rank in the bottom 5%. Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2034,UNH,"Dow achieved the historical milestone of 22,000 for the first time on Wednesday. This stellar showing was a result of surge in the shares of Apple after the tech behemoth posted outstanding earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Broadly encouraging economic conditions also drove the Dow past the psychological milestone. The S&P 500 also finished in the green, however, the Nasdaq’s lackluster performance continued as it was dragged down to close in the red due to familiar tech overvaluation issues.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today’s Ahead of Wall Street article.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) breached all the records to finish above the 22,000 threshold for the first time on Wednesday and notched its seventh straight daily rise. The blue-chip index closed at 22,016.24, an all-time high, rising by 0.2% or 52.32 points in the process. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.1%, rising 1.22 points to close at 2,477.57. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,362.65, declining 0.29 point. A total of around 6.5 billion shares were traded on Monday, above the last 20-session average of 6.1 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,871 to 866. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by 2,114 to 601.Dow Hits 22,000, Buoyed By Apple’s Earnings Outperformance Dow breaches yet another record in 2017. The blue-chip index, for the first time, achieved the psychological milestone of 22,000. This historic benchmark was achieved within 107 trading days of Dow hitting 21,000.This stellar showing was made possible by Apple Inc.’s upbeat earnings. Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) reported spectacular results for third-quarter fiscal 2017, driven by the impressive Service segment performance. iPhone sales were also steady in the quarter. Earnings of $1.67 per share and revenues of $45.4 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 and $44.7 billion, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, earnings grew 17.6% and revenues increased 7.2%. (Read More: Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings & Revenues Beat Estimates, Stock Up)Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) has also contributed to the Dow’s upward journey. Boeing reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.56 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.32 and increasing from last year’s loss of $0.44 per share. Furthermore, the escalating geopolitical risks involving Syria and North Korea has led to an increased demand for defense products. (Read More: Boeing Stock Flies to All-Time High After Q2 Earnings). The other companies which have added to the Dow’s performance Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report).Other Factors that Drove the Dow HigherSome other factors which have contributed to the Dow’s historic feat are broadly encouraging economic conditions, Fed’s hesitance to increase the interest rates any further and weakening dollar in the international markets.The private sector added 178,000 jobs in July although this was lower than the economists’ expectation of 185,000 jobs. But this would certainly lower the unemployment rate which hovered around 4.3% in the month of May, according to The Bureau of Labor Statistics. The recent addition of 178,000 jobs would go a long way in lowering the unemployment rate. Further, a steady GDP growth has also made the economy favorable for more investment and spending.The Fed increased interest rates three times since December. However, at the end of its two day policy meet, the Fed refrained from increasing the interest rates any further. This raises question on the ability of the Trump administration to deliver on the campaign trail promises and the investor sentiment was hurt leading to losses in the broader markets. On the other hand, this turned out to be a boon for the rate sensitive sectors such as utilities which would benefit from the move. Also, this boded well for the banks in general and boosted the bank shares thereby leading to broad based gains.The Dow consists of 30 large-cap companies which have overseas operations. For the record, the dollar has fallen more than 10% since the start of the year. This makes the US-based goods cheaper in the international market and an increased demand for the same. Also, foreign profits were worth more in dollars. This also resulted in broad based gains for the economy.Stocks That Made HeadlinesARRIS Beats Q2 Earnings Estimates, Revenues LagARRIS International plc’s (ARRS  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

2035,UNH,"Health insurer Aetna Inc.’s (AET  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of $3.42 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.34 by 46% and also grew 55% year over year. Aetna’s bottom line displayed improvement due to higher net income as well as lower transaction and integration-related costs.Operational UpdateTotal revenue of $15.5 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.30 billion by approximately 1.3%. Revenues, however, declined 2.5% year over year due to lower premiums in Aetna's Health Care segment.Adjusted expense ratioimproved 60 basis points (bps) to 16.5% from the prior-year quarter. This was primarily due to the temporary suspension of the HIF in 2017 and the execution of Aetna's expense management initiatives, partially offset by targeted investment spending on its growth strategies.Total expense ratioimproved 110 bps from the year-ago quarter to 16.4% in the second quarter, primarily due to lower transaction and integration-related costs.Second-quarter after-tax net income margin was 7.7 %, up 270 bps year over year.  Adjusted pre-tax marginwas 11.7%, up 280 bps from the prior-year quarter. The upside was primarily driven by strong performance in Aetna's Health Care segment, partially offset by the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the HIF in 2017Medical membership totaled 22.1 million on Jun 30, 2017, down 1.6% year over year.Segmental Performance UpdateHealth Care segmentAetna’s Health Care segment recorded both total revenue and adjusted revenues of $14.8 billion, down 2.6% year over year. The downside primarily stemmed from lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products and temporary suspension of the HIF in 2017. This was somewhat offset by higher premium yields in the company’s Commercial and Government businesses and membership growth in its Medicare products.Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.8 billion, up 38.5% year over year primarily due to continued strong performance across its core Health Care businesses. The increase also reflects Aetna's updated estimates of risk adjustment payables for the prior year for individual and small group ACA compliant products.Group InsuranceTotal revenue of $642 million declined 0.8% from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted revenuesof $627 million dropped 0.5% from the last-year quarter.Pre-tax adjusted earningswere $42, down 26.3% from second-quarter 2016 due to lower revenues.Large Case PensionsTotal revenue of $81 million dropped 1.2% from second-quarter 2016.

Molina Healthcare also estimates that total pre-tax costs associated with the Restructuring Plan will be approximately $130–$150 million for the second half of 2017, with an additional $40 million to be incurred in 2018.Molina Healthcare expects a reduction of $200 million to annualized run-rate expenses resulting from staff reductions expected to be achieved by the end of 2017 and in time for full realization in 2018.Direct delivery operations will be restructured during the second half of 2017 and Marketplace participation will be terminated in Utah and Wisconsin in 2018.2017 GuidanceAt the end of first-quarter 2017, the company projected earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share to be $2.53 and $2.90, respectively for 2017.However, at the end the second quarter, the company withdrew its 2017 earnings guidance owing to uncertain medical cost trends in the Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, and Puerto Rico health plans, uncertainty around the funding of Marketplace cost sharing subsidies and potential variability in the timing of benefits achieved and costs incurred as a result of the Restructuring Plan.Our TakeDespite its numerous restructuring initiatives, Molina Healthcare's disappointing second-quarter results along with several headwinds faced by the company make us skeptical of its ability to return to profit any time soon. The company’s internal road blocks along with continued regulatory uncertainty in the health insurance industry will make the operating conditions difficult in days ahead.Zacks RankMolina Healthcare currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other InsurersAmong the other firms in the medical sector that have reported second-quarter earnings so far, the bottom lines of Anthem Inc.

2042,UNH,"Humana Inc.’s (HUM  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 operating earnings per share of $3.49 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by approximately 13%. The bottom line improved 6% year over year, primarily driven by the company’s individual Medicare Advantage and Individual Commercial businesses,partially offset by lower pretax earnings in the Group and Specialty and Healthcare Services segments.Operational UpdateAdjusted consolidated revenues of $13.3 billion grew 2% on higher Retail segment revenues from the company’s Medicare business, excluding the impact of revenues from its Individual Commercial business. However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.6 billion.Humana’s adjusted consolidated benefit ratio of 83.4% deteriorated 90 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017.Adjusted consolidated operating cost ratio of 10.7% improved 130 bps from the year-ago quarter, also due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for 2017.Quarterly Segment ResultsRetail SegmentRevenues from the Retail segment were $11.30 billion, up 3% year over year, primarily owing to higher revenues from the company’s Medicare Advantage business.Benefit ratio of 85.8% deteriorated 50 bps year over year, primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017. The segment’s operating cost ratio of 8.5% improved 130 bps year over year because of the same reason.Adjusted pretax income of $613 million jumped 18% year over year, primarily due to lower benefit and operating cost ratios.Group and Specialty SegmentRevenues from the Group and Specialty segment were $1.83 billion, down 2% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due a decline in average group fully-insured and ASO commercial medical membership.Benefit ratio deteriorated 100 bps year over year to 78.4%, due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2017. Operating cost ratio improved 110 bps year over year to 21.6%, due to the same reason.Adjusted pretax income of $102 million decreased 19% year over year due to the timing of revenues under the company’s TRICARE contract primarily relating to medical cost trend incentives and amounts for additional services requested under the contract.Healthcare ServicesRevenues of $5.98 decreased 5% year over year, primarily due to the company’s Pharmacy Solutions business as well as the impact of the optimization process associated with its chronic condition management programs.Operating cost ratio remained flat year over year at 95%.Adjusted pretax income for the segment was $281 million, down 3% year over year due to ongoing pressures in the company’s provider services business. This reflects lower Medicare rates year over year in specific geographies, as well as the impact of the optimization process associated with the company’s chronic care management programs.Individual Commercial SegmentIndividual Commercial membership was 0.2 million as of Jun 30, 2017, down 77% year over year, primarily due to a decline in number of countries where the company offers on-exchange coverage as well as the discontinuance of off-exchange products.Benefit ratio of 34.8% rose 106 bps from second-quarter 2016. The year-over-year improvement primarily resulted from the effect of the $208 million increase in the PDR in the prior-year quarter, planned exits in 2017 in certain markets that carried a higher benefit ratio, and per-member premium increase.The segment’s operating cost ratio deteriorated 140 bps from the year-ago quarter to 16.2%, primarily due the loss of scale efficiency from market exits in 2017The company witnessed a pretax income of $118 million, which compared favorably with a pretax loss of $225 million in the prior year quarter. This was owing to the exit from certain markets in 2017 and per-member premium increases.Humana Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Humana Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Humana Inc.

The improvement was primarily driven by higher earnings year over year and the timing of working capital changes, partially offset by the portion of taxes paid in the quarter related to the merger termination fee.Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateIn Feb 2017, Humana’s board of directors approved a $2.25 billion share repurchase authorization, which will expire on Dec 31, 2017.The company subsequently entered into an agreement with a third-party financial institution to bring into effect a $1.50 billion ASR program under the authorization.Given the outstanding ASR, the company did not execute any share repurchases in the second quarter.The company paid cash dividends to its stockholders of $57 million in the second quarter.Guidance Raised Humana increased its 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to $11.50 from the previous guidance of at least $11.10.

The bottom line also jumped 1.2% year over year.Operating revenues of $22.2 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.3 billion.

The rise was primarily recorded by commercial & specialty business as well as fully insured and self-funded Local Group businesses. This upside was partially offset by a decline in membership in the National Account and Individual businesses.Total expenses increased nearly 6% to $21.2 billion in the reported quarter, mainly due to a 3% rise in total selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and 2.3% higher interest expenses, on a year-over-year basis.Anthem’s benefit expense ratio of 86.1% deteriorated 190 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter.

However, improved medical cost performance in the Local Group and Individual businesses was an offset.The SG&A expense ratio of 13.8% improved 20 bps from the year-ago quarter. This was primarily driven by the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017, the impact of operating expense efficiency initiatives taken by the company and fixed cost leverage on operating revenue growth.

2047,UNH,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive prospects.However, one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy. While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks, GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only eight.Here are four stocks that made it through the screen:Pasadena, CA-based East West Bancorp Inc. (EWBC  -  Free Report) is the holding company for East West Bank, East West Capital Trust I, East West Capital Trust II and Risk Services Inc.
