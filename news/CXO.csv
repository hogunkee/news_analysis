2,CXO,"EOG Resources (EOG) is the IBD Stock Of The Day, with the shale oil producer nearing a buy point amid reports of tightening crude oil stocks.XThe firm has been dubbed the ""Apple (AAPL) of oil"" due to its use of technology to aid operations since breaking away from Enron in 1999. It has impressed analysts with its use of big data to aid in drilling operations. The firm holds prime positions in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, and Permian formations. It is also the country's biggest shale oil producer.On the charts, the stock is forming a bullish base-on-base move. The base-on-base pattern can be very profitable, since the formation usually occurs among the strongest stocks during a market correction.EOG shares jumped 3.55% to finish at 123.93 on the stock market today as crude prices rallied. The stock looks set to strike a new buy point of 128.13 after forming a six-week flat base, MarketSmith analysis shows. This comes hot on the heels of the stock forming a 13-week cup base.While other top shale stocks like Continental Resources (CLR) are nearing their own buy points too, EOG has better institutional sponsorship and a tighter base.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEOG also is the leading shale oil producer in the Eagle Ford formation in south Texas. While the Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico is the bigger shale area with the most activity, a lack of pipelines means producers are having trouble getting oil to market and have been selling oil at a discount. But the Eagle Ford is closer to shipping points on the Gulf Coast.EOG's fundamentals are just shy of being among the best stocks, which is reflected in the firm's IBD Composite Rating of 92. Winning stocks often have a 95 or higher score in the early stages of a new price run.However it has an excellent Relative Strength Rating of 82, which measures a stock's price performance over the last 12 months. The Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production group is also performing well, and currently holds a Group Relative Strength Rating of A+.The Houston-based company previously impressed by posting a loss in only one year during the three-year oil glut. In addition, it held its debt-to-equity ratio to a modest 38%. Among E&Ps with market capitalization above $10 billion, that combination was only equaled by Concho Resources (CXO) and Diamondback Energy (FANG).Company management has previously boasted about its development of smartphone apps and its massive haul of data to aid drilling.Facebook (FB) and Snapchat (SNAP) are far from the most valuable apps on EOG workers' iPhones.

3,CXO,"More than $1 billion a day. That's the price tag for a Permian Basin pipeline crunch that's increasingly affecting investors as much as it is West Texas oil drillers.Eight of the top explorers focused on the booming U.S. shale region have lost $15.6 billion in combined market value in about two weeks, as shipping constraints devour the profit they can fetch for a barrel of crude. Parsley Energy (PE) shares have wilted 16% in that time; Diamondback Energy (FANG) has been defanged, down 18%.Even as production soars, dwindling pipeline space and a rail and trucking shortage have raised shipping costs, boosting the discount Permian producers take to offload their oil. The bottleneck benefits refiners who can buy cheaper crude and pipeline owners with extra space, but it's dragging down explorers.""You just don't want to touch these Permian names,"" said Gabriele Sorbara, a Williams Capital Group analyst in New York. ""They are falling off a cliff.""Relief may not come until 2020, when new pipelines are expected to be up and running. For now, here's a rundown of winners and losers amid the space crunch:Being a ""pure play"" shale producer, even a Permian stalwart, is no longer the ticket to success for energy equities.Since May 21, the price of benchmark West Texas intermediate crude has fallen about 10% and companies focused primarily on the Permian have been shunned. The hardest fall: Concho Resources (CXO), which has lost $4.1 billion off its market capitalization as of Tuesday.As of Wednesday, oil in Midland, Texas, was trading for about $19 a barrel below Brent crude, the global benchmark price.Even Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), with relatively strong finances and secure pipeline contracts, has been swept up, Williams Capital's Sorbara said by phone. It's lost $3.2 billion in market value, or 9%, since May 21.While the shortages are real, he deems much of the market sell-off ""overblown,"" since even discounted Permian crude is selling for well above where many producers set their budgets earlier this year.Investors, though, are fleeing to the relative safety of larger names with more diverse portfolios such as Occidental Petroleum (OXY), whose shares are flat over the past couple weeks. The Permian's biggest oil producer also pumps in the Middle East and Colombia, with roughly 40% of its output this year based on higher international crude pricing, Capital One Securities said in an analyst note.The company also operates pipelines and a Gulf Coast export terminal that will benefit from cheaper U.S. crude prices. ""The largest companies or companies with diverse portfolios can rotate capital around,"" Sorbara said. ""If you're a pure play, the only thing you can do is step on the brakes.""With bottlenecks between the Permian and major Gulf Coast refiners, operators in other parts of the country served by less-congested pipelines have a relative advantage, analysts say.That includes Delek US (DK), CVR Refining (CVRR) and HollyFrontier (HFC), with refineries in New Mexico, Arkansas and northeastern Texas, among other locations, according to Barclays. Delek gets about 78% of its crude from the Permian, HollyFrontier gets 39% and CVR gets 14%, the bank said in a June 5 analyst report.Delek shares have climbed 7.5% in the past two weeks while CVR is up 3.3% and HollyFrontier is up 1%.""Simply put, we think U.S. refiners win big with lower input costs,"" analysts including Justin Jenkins at Raymond James & Associates said in a June 4 note.Enterprise Products Partners and Magellan Midstream Partners also stand to benefit from the blowout in Midland prices as they own crucial pipelines in the Permian and dock space on the Gulf used for exports — and have plans to add more.""The very idea of congestion is beneficial,"" said Sandy Fielden, director of oil research at Chicago-based Morningstar. ""If I'm going to pitch my new pipeline or expand my pipeline, and I'm going to hold my open season, I can expect to see a full crowd there anxious to sign up quickly.""Enterprise started full service in April on its 416-mile Midland-to-Sealy pipeline, which can carry some 575,000 barrels per day of crude from the heart of the Permian to key export facilities in Houston. They also own the lion's share of crude storage tanks and docks along the Gulf.Magellan operates and owns part of the 400,000-barrel-a-day BridgeTex pipeline, transporting oil from the Permian to Corpus Christi, Texas. That route is scheduled for expansion in early 2019 because of added interest. The company said last month that almost all existing customers on its Longhorn pipeline, connecting the Permian to Houston, have renewed their contracts for two years.

13,CXO,"A barrage of energy-industry news drove oil stocks to the head of the market over the past week, sending oil prices to their best week since April, and their best monthly advance since April 2016.U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate was up more than 8% for the week, trading above $74 a barrel for the first time since November, 2016. Brent crude gained 5%, holding just below the $80 mark.The result sent oil-related industry groups to five of the market's 10 largest gains for the week. Deep sea drillers Transocean (RIG), Ensco (ESV) and Noble (NE) scored gains between 8% and 16%. Among domestic producers, EOG Resources (EOG), Concho Resources (CXO) and RSP Permian (RSPP) were among the biggest winners.The June 22 meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries set the stage for the week's price gains.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMany oil industry analysts had feared the group, along with partner countries led by Russia, would boost production quotas by a million barrels per day or more — a move that could have risked an oil price crash. Instead, OPEC agreed to a nominal 600,000 bpd increase. That wasn't the 500,000 or less that oil traders had hoped for, but it was bullish enough.Oil prices began surging Tuesday, after a U.S. State Department official told reporters that global oil buyers would be required to cut imports from Iran to zero by November. Buyers who failed to respect the rule would face harsh U.S. sanctions. Iran exports more than 2 billion barrels per day to countries including China, India and Turkey.Also on Tuesday, uncertainty increased regarding oil exports out of Libya. New reports said a Libyan militia leader had handed control of some of the country's largest export terminals to a Benghazi-based rival of the state-owned oil company.Oil prices received a data squeeze on Tuesday and Wednesday, as both the American Petroleum Institute and the Energy Information Administration reported draws of more than 9 million barrels on U.S. oil inventories in the week ended June 22.

The report forecast the country's imports of liquefied natural gas would rise 82% by 2023. Global LNG imports over that same period were forecast to increase 29%.Bloomberg followed up with a report that Qatar Petroleum planned to invest $20 billion in U.S. oil and gas projects over the next five years. In addition, Chief Executive Officer Saad Sherida al-Kaabi said the company — the world's largest seller of LNG — planned to invest an additional $5 billion in other related U.S. projects, such as chemicals.On the domestic front, pipeline heavyweight Kinder Morgan (KMI) said its Texas Pipeline subsidiary would partner with Apache (APA) and a unit of Blackstone Energy Partners to develop a $2 billion Permian Highway Pipeline Project. The natural gas pipeline targets the transport of 2 billion cubic feet per day from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast.The expanded gas line will boost the production potential for oil producers in the Permian Basin. A build up of natural gas, which is a byproduct of the basin's oil production, can slow oil output if gas storage facilities and take-away capacity reach their limits.The news from the IEA and from Kinder Morgan was mixed for IBD Leaderboard watch list stock Cheniere Energy (LNG). Cheniere owns and operates Louisiana's Sabine Pass LNG export facility.The stock market also had some say.

22,CXO,"Permian Basin oil producers are set to deliver quarterly reports at a rapid pace this week. A total of eight oil stocks among IBD's 16 Stock Spotlight names are due to report. Three that are focused on the busy Permian Basin in west Texas — Viper Energy Partners (VNOM), Callon Petroleum (CPE) and Matador Resources (MTDR) — are due to report by Wednesday.Viper was extended Monday afternoon, trading about 8% above a 26.29 buy point on the stock market today. The stock broke out from a cup base early in April. Viper is listed among the oil stocks of the explorers and producers group, but it is maybe a bit more akin to a real estate investment trust. A shell landowner company operated by Diamondback Energy (FANG), Viper focuses on wells that are steady producers but are past their initial production surge. The stock pays a dividend that yields a fat 6.8% on an annualized basis.After four quarters of triple-digit sales and earnings growth, analyst consensus projects a downshift in the company's first quarter. Targets call for a 59% EPS increase and a 79% revenue jump. Those are down from average earnings growth of 249% and average sales growth of 119% over the past four quarters.However, Viper steadily topped EPS growth expectations in each of those four quarter, by margins ranging from 4% to 23%. The company reports after Tuesday's closing bell.Callon remained in buy range on Monday, up about 3% from a 13.40 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. The base formed within a longer, 17-month consolidation. But the stock's relative strength line has been pressing to new highs since late March.The stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating (which indicates institutional buying) is a B. That is not the best possible, but is similar to top oil stocks such as Continental Resources (CLR) and Concho Resources (CXO).Callon is among the smaller domestic oil producers. It has a midcap market capitalization of $2.8 billion and generated $356 million in revenue last year. It extracts oil specifically from the Permian Basin. For shale oil enthusiasts, Callon focused most of 2017 on developing horizontal legs of wells, particularly in the Wolfcamp and lower Sprayberry layers beneath the Permian's Midland Basin region.The company grew its proved reserves 50% in 2017 to 137 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE). It increased production by 50%, to 8.37 million barrels, about 22,940 BOE per day. (The BOE measure converts gas and oil into a single calculation.) For 2018, the company had planned to ramp up from a four-rig drilling program to five rigs by mid-February.Management had outlined spending at $500 million to $540 million for the year. Callon's debt-to-equity ratio was around 33% at the end of the year. That's less than half the average ratio of nearly 73% across the 84-stock group.Analyst consensus is looking for EPS growth to accelerate to 110% for the quarter. Revenue is expected to increase 47%. Callon reports after Tuesday's close.Matador Resources is only a slightly larger midcap. Its market capitalization is around $3.6 billion and it brought home $544 million in 2017 revenue. Regionally, the company is more spread out. It operates wells in the Delaware Basin portion of the Permian, straddling the Texas-New Mexico line. It also operates in south Texas' Eagle Ford shale region and in portions of the Haynesville shale, along the North Louisiana-Texas border.Matador increased its oil production by 54% and its gas production by 25% in 2017. Total production equaled an estimated 38,936 BOE per day. The company increased its total proved reserves 44% in 2017, to 152.8 million BOE. Most of that increase occurred in the Delaware Basin.Matador has six quarters of triple-digit earnings advances under its belt. Analysts' consensus expects a 94% EPS gain and a 44% jump in revenue when the company reports after Wednesday's close.On Monday, Matador shares traded just below new highs, as well as a cup-base buy point at 34.06. Its RS line was pushing to new highs, and the Accumulation/Distribution Rating was a B-.RELATED:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal6 Oil Stocks Offer Buy Points As Earnings Come DueStock Market Runs Into Resistance At 50-Day Line

31,CXO,"Jagged Peak Energy (JAG) is living up to its name, both for the wild ride its stock has taken since debuting a year ago as well as its gumption in taking on the heavyweights.X A new initial public offering, especially one in the cyclical energy sector, isn't for the faint of heart. But shareholders who can stomach the volatility could see big gains from this emerging growth stock as it challenges the likes of Concho Resources (CXO), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Parsley Energy (PE) that explore for and produce oil and natural gas in the energy-rich Permian basin of Texas.Jagged Peak specifically targets the southern Delaware sub-basin of the Permian, venturing into an overlooked pocket of a very well-established region. It's one that most oil explorers and producers avoided on geological worries — and its contrarian bet is paying off, said analyst Irene Haas at Imperial Capital.""Jagged did the hard work and cracked the code,"" Haas wrote in a recent note to clients. Its ""fault-bounded"" model circumvented concerns that the setting's gentle ramp would allow shallow water sediment to seep in and dilute organically rich shale, she explained.In a phone interview with Investor's Business Daily, Haas said Jagged Peak's out-of-the-box thinking combines with a first-mover advantage to make the young company one to watch. It got land that few others wanted cheaply and early on, entering the basin in 2012 and ending 2017 with 75,000 oil-saturated acres and 1,400 drillable locations. The area eventually saw a land grab in 2016 to 2017.Haas started her coverage of Jagged Peak shares in October with an outperform rating and on Wednesday raised her one-year price target on the stock by a dollar to 19. She believes the company is well positioned to generate multiyear growth, with top-tier economics in the form of a strong balance sheet and low debt. It had $4 million in cash, $394 million in liquidity and $35 million in long-term debt as of September 2017.Her target price represents 36% upside from a price just under $14 on the stock market today and 27% from its January 2017 IPO of 15.After clearing a 14.10 cup-with-handle entry in November, the stock had a 17% run-up in less than two months, and is now consolidating under the 50-day moving average.Jagged Peak drilled its first well in 2013 and completed three in 2014. While these early wells were challenging, they proved the area is productive, Haas said. The company completed seven wells in 2015 and 11 in 2016, ramping up to 46 in 2017, using six rigs and three crews.She describes its assets as ""the oiliest among peers"" in the Permian, with a high oil mix of about 80% on average, allowing the young company to break even with West Texas Intermediate crude as low as $28.50 per barrel.Analysts see a bullish outlook for exploration and production companies, as well as the broad energy sector dominated by oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Oil trades at its highest price in about three years as the dollar slumps, at around $65 a barrel, after falling to $26 in 2016 from highs of $108 a barrel in 2014.Higher oil prices have led some analysts to raise earnings and cash flow estimates for explorers and producers.""Oil north of $60 is a welcome sign,"" said Stewart Glickman, a CFRA analyst, adding oil companies ""are starting to hedge more and more of their 2018-2019 production to lock in pricing.""For oil companies, break-even prices vary widely by basin and even by well, but $50 is often seen as a sustainable level. At current prices, a broad swath of U.S. oil companies can afford to grow their operations, access the capital markets and pay dividends to shareholders.IBD'S TAKE: An IPO should never be bought on the first day or two of trading. Initial euphoria can be met by selling soon after, so it's important to let the dust settle. Learn how to buy a great new IPO.But pure-play Permian companies such as Jagged Peak and RSP Permian (RSPP) have an edge against rivals. They typically enjoy lower break-even costs than industry peers, getting a rate of return even when oil prices are low.""Their well economics of drilling are better,"" Glickman told IBD. ""The per-barrel cost of producing oil is better in that area.""But risks are pervasive. As shale production surges, drilling speeds and efficiency improve, and fracking technology gets better, oil majors see an opportunity. Both Exxon and Chevron are making massive shale bets, boosting investments in the Permian by billions of dollars in 2017 and 2018.Jagged Peak cited competition from ""larger or more integrated competitors"" in a 10K annual report filed with regulators in March. Well economics would suffer if ""congestion"" in the Permian were to cause the cost of consumables like fracking sand to spin out of control, though that scenario hasn't yet played out, Glickman said.Jagged Peak also relies heavily on just two customers, Trafigura Trading and Sunoco Partners Marketing, which drove a combined 88% of total revenue in 2016. The loss of either of these buyers would be a material blow, at least in the short term.Moreover, the company uses hydraulic fracturing, a controversial method to extract oil and gas by blasting rock formations with chemicals. The process contaminates ground water and pollutes the air, critics argue. Federal agencies like the EPA as well as several states seek to regulate or limit its use. Meanwhile, traditional oil-and-gas companies face intense competition from growing demand for renewable energy.For now, Jagged is riding the shale wave that has seen U.S. oil production surpass more than 10 million barrels per day.The company's drilling performance continues to improve, with overall cost per foot declining 17% in the third quarter of 2017 compared with performance in the first half of the year.""One remarkable drilling achievement is a Whiskey River Wolfcamp well with a 9,900-foot lateral that was drilled with a single lateral drilling assembly in a total of 141 hours,"" Chief Executive Joe Jaggers said in November. The well, he noted, went in 22 days ""from spud to rig release"" — meaning, from the time the first drill hits to when the well goes online.While reducing drilling days for its wells, the company has significantly boosted its average daily production.Production volumes jumped 30% in the third quarter of 2017 vs. the previous quarter and 201% vs. a year ago. The company expects to produce 17.5 million to 17.8 million barrels of oil per day in 2017, representing a growth at the midpoint of 216% over 2016.For the third quarter of 2017, Jagged reported adjusted net income of $15.4 million, or 7 cents per share, in line with estimates. Revenue of $70 million missed. CEO Jaggers linked that performance to ""completion delays primarily related to fracking operations,"" including reliability of equipment and experience of crews from service providers.While this IPO has just a few quarters of earnings and sales under its belt, analysts foresee furious growth.Consensus estimates call for EPS of 27 cents in 2017 as a whole, vaulting 144% to 66 cents in 2018 and then 56% to $1.03 in 2019, according to Zacks Investment Research.Revenue is seen at $269 million for 2017, growing 117% to $585 million in 2018 and 36% to $797 million in 2019.""We expect the company to continue to execute, which should lead to multiple expansion,"" Imperial Capital's Haas said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Do Schlumberger Results Point To A Boom In Fracking Sand?

35,CXO,"The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average undercut their 50-day moving averages but on Friday those two indexes and the Nasdaq composite rallied strongly. Walmart (WMT) sold off as earnings, guidance and online sales were weaker than expected. Hot recent IPO Roku (ROKU) tumbled on its revenue outlook. Home Depot (HD) beat and gave bullish guidance. Fed policymakers seemed slightly hawkish. Rite Aid (RAD) agreed to an Albertsons buyout.X The major averages suffered modest losses through Thursday, closing near session lows several times, while the Dow Jones and S&P 500 index fell back below their 50-day moving averages. But on Friday, all three indexes surged more than 1%, closing the week higher. Walmart (WMT) and Roku were big weekly losers. Treasury yields popped to fresh four-year highs on Fed minutes, but they backed off somewhat.The world's largest retailer reported better-than-expected Q4 sales and same-store sales, but earnings missed estimates. U.S. online sales grew 23%, less than half Q3's 50% annual rise, as Walmart (WMT) struggles to compete with Amazon.com (AMZN). Walmart still sees 40% e-commerce growth this fiscal year. But its earnings guidance was light. Walmart online chief Marc Lore denied a report he might leave the retailer. Walmart said it will roll out a more-upscale home furnishings shopping portal. Walmart stock crashed 10% on Tuesday.Amazon, for its part, reportedly plans to roll out six more cashierless Amazon Go convenience stores after recently opening its first Go store in Seattle to the general public.Federal Reserve policymakers still backed gradual interest rate hikes in 2018 at their Jan. 30-31 meeting. But they see stronger growth prospects in 2018 than they did in December, in part due to the Trump tax cuts. Fed officials see inflation rising to 2% over time.

Broadcom has asked Qualcomm investors to vote for its slate of six nominees to Qualcomm's board at the company's March 6 shareholder meeting.Grocery giant Albertsons, under private ownership for over a decade, announced it would merge with Rite Aid (RAD). The combined company, which will be public will have a value of $24 billion, including debt.

HP Enterprise (HPE), the server, networking equipment and data center gear maker also gave upbeat Q2 guidance, hiked its dividend 50% and boosted its stock buyback program. Printer-and-PC maker HP Inc. (HPQ) also guided higher for Q2 and the full year.

Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) was just shy on same-store sales. Wingstop (WING) shares fell Friday on a weak 2018 EPS outlook.MGM Resorts International (MGM) missed Q4 earnings per share estimates, while sales topped, helped by the casino-resort operator's opening of MGM National Harbor in December 2016.

Copper revenue surged 52% on higher prices and an output boost, while BHP's iron ore division saw 4% growth. The mining giant pushed back against structural changes sought by activist hedge fund Elliott Advisors but boosted its dividend and said it's expediting the sale of its $10 billion in U.S. shale assets.General Mills (GIS) will buy natural cat and dog food maker Blue Buffalo Pet Products (BLUE) for about $8 billion, or $40 a share.Intuit (INTU) earned 35 cents a share in its Q2, beating views by a penny.

37,CXO,"Major indexes traded mostly flat in afternoon trading Wednesday, leading some observers to believe that the expected major tax reform legislation has already been baked into the stock market's advance. However, another view could be that U.S. equities are holding on to solid gains for the fourth quarter and are not showing any signs of heavy selling.XMeanwhile, one of the hottest exchange traded funds dropped hard for a second straight session, but the two-day correction for Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) looks normal after a 250% run-up from a Nov. 22 breakout past 985.10 in a deep cup with handle.Bitcoin Investment Trust fell as much as 24.8% intraday and briefly undercut its short-term 10-day moving average. The ETF is now down 16% to 2,518, still holding a 155% post-breakout gain.At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite was still trading flat, but at 6964 the tech-rich index is still up nearly 0.4% for the week and holding a 7.2% gain since Oct. 1. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average squeezed out fractional gains. Volume is running mildly lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges.Steel, oil and gas, metal ores, air freight and gold mining shares led the market's upside, offsetting sharp drops in desktop software, tobacco, dairy, hospital, restaurant and electric utility stocks.The Dow utility average, sinking 1% and 1.6% on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, sank another 0.4% amid a rebound in interest rates. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note is trying to clear 2.50%.The CME Group's Fed Watch tool now shows a 56% probability that the Federal Reserve will hike the fed funds rate on overnight bank loans by a quarter point to a 1.5%-1.75% target range when it meets on March 21, 2018. As noted in a prior IBD Stock Market Today column, Bitcoin Investment has had such a monster run that the 50-day moving average is irrelevant as a technical tool to determine the right time to sell the hot security. Instead, a clean break of the 10-day line would be a good trigger for holders to capture at least partial profits in a core position.Bitcoin, which now trades a record 112,000 shares on average over the past 50 sessions, broke out of a deep yet satisfactory cup with handle on Nov. 22 by surpassing the high of the handle at 985 by 10 cents.

However, Monday's breakout from a new flat base at 176.34 has failed to bear fruit so far. Shares are virtually break-even at 174.43, hovering just below the proper entry.While Monday's nice gain showed little gusto in terms of volume, on Friday the iPhone marketer showed heavy institutional activity as shares rose 1%. In that session, 40.2 million shares exchanged hands, 49% above the stock's 50-day average. That's a sign of persistent demand ever since Apple broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 in early January.Go to that breakout and volume was limp. But investors were waiting for quarterly results. And volume gushed higher on Feb. 1 after Apple began reporting its string of new year-over-year increases in both the top and bottom lines.Earnings in that December-ended fiscal first quarter edged up 2% to $3.36 a share, halting a three-quarter slide. Then earnings ramped up 11%, 18% and 24% in the next three quarters.Wall Street sees profit rising 12% to $3.77 a share in the December-ending fiscal first quarter of FY 2018 on a 10% pick-up in sales to $86.23 billion.Meanwhile, Concho Resources (CXO), a former big market winner, rose more than 3% to 144.46 in slightly higher than normal turnover and is close to surpassing a new 147.87 buy point in a nearly six-week flat base.That flat base sits on top of a much larger, wilder base that has elements of both a double bottom and a cup with handle. See the mild three-week pullback in October? The 6.2% drop from 137.28 to 128.86 generated a good handle that showed quiet volume and a downward slant along the lows.Both of these elements are necessary ingredients for a good handle, which is essentially a final shakeout of uncommitted shareholders before the stock sees a big jump in institutional demand, sparking a breakout.Concho, which specializes in the Permian Basin and West Texas, is staging a solid turnaround in fundamentals. It showed falling earnings and net losses for eight straight quarters through Q3 of 2016. But in the past two quarters, Concho has boosted profit 100% and 41% on revenue gains of 43% and 46%.The relatively weak 69 RS Rating, as seen in Stock Checkup, reflects the stock's long basing action. Watch to see if that rating improves quickly. The EPS Rating is 68 on a scale from 1 to 99, but that masks Wall Street's consensus estimate for earnings to rise 150% this year to $1.85 a share and up 28% to $2.36 in 2018.West Texas Intermediate near-term oil futures jumped 0.8% to $58 a barrel.

45,CXO,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages hit record highs as Congress finally passed the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cut plan. Chevron (CVX) was one of several oil and commodity stocks to moved past buy points. Bitcoin fell sharply as CME futures launched and more companies joined the blockchain craze. Micron Technology (MU), Red Hat (RHT), Nike (NKE), Darden Restaurants (DRI) and Winnebago (WGO) were notable earnings reports while economic data were generally upbeat.X The S&P 500, Dow industrials and Nasdaq set all-time bests on Monday ahead of Congress' approval of tax cuts on Wednesday, then moved sideways. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 0.3% for the week and the Dow 0.4%. Energy stocks, which could be big winners under the new 21% corporate tax rate, were leaders, with Chevron, Diamondback Energy (FANG) and several other oil plays to hit buy zones. There were several notable earnings reports as companies got ready for the post-Christmas week.Bitcoin futures from CME Group (CME), the world's biggest futures exchange, launched on Sunday with an opening trade at $20,650, but tumbled to just under $14,000 Friday, in sync with Cboe (CBOE) Bitcoin futures. Spot prices tumbled intraday below $11,000. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that Goldman Sachs (GS) was developing a trading desk for cryptocurrencies, with a possible debut in June, which would make it the first big bank to be a cryptocurrency market maker. And amid a growing market fixation on anything blockchain, Long Island Iced Tea Corp. vaulted a cool 183% Thursday after the iced-tea seller said it was rebranding itself as Long Blockchain (LTEA) to focus on ""the exploration of and investment in opportunities that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology.""Diamondback Energy (FANG) broke out in strong volume Wednesday, with Chevron (CVX), Concho Resources (CXO) among those clearing buy points on Thursday. BPBP, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) were among those breaking out in less-impressive trade. Energy stocks are seen as big winners from the tax cuts, while crude prices are holding at two-year highs. U.S. crude inventories fell in the latest week but production hit yet another high. Saudi Arabia reportedly is looking at buying natural gas shale assets in Texas. Meanwhile, several mining stocks, including Vale (VALE) and Rio Tinto (RIO), also broke out.Memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter and guided much higher than views for the current quarter. Micron earned an adjusted $2.45 a share in the quarter ended Nov. 30, up nearly eight times the 32 cents reported in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 71% to $6.8 billion. Analysts expected Micron to earn $2.20 a share on sales of $6.39 billion. For the current quarter, Micron expects to earn an adjusted $2.58 a share on sales of $7 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street had been modeling $1.95 and $6.08 billion. Shares rose 4%.Consumer spending and the housing market turned it up a notch in November as the economy fires on pretty much all cylinders. Third-quarter GDP growth was revised down a tick to 3.2%, still the best pace since the first quarter of 2015, as business investment extended its recent strength. Consumer spending rose 0.6% on the month, while wages rose 0.4%. Consumers saved just 2.9% of income in November, the weakest in a decade, which is probably a reflection of greater optimism in the economic outlook. Existing-home sales surged 5.6% to a 5.81 million annual pace, the best in 11 years, as the supply of homes for sale got even tighter. New-home sales skyrocketed 17.5%.Nike (NKE) reported a 5% sales drop in North America, its second straight quarterly decline. But the No. 1 sports brand comfortably topped expectations as Q2 profit fell 8% to 46 cents a share and revenue rose 5% to $8.55 billion vs. views for 39 cents EPS and $8.39 billion. China sales rose 15%. Adidas (ADDYY), Under Armour (UAA) and Puma are creeping on Nike's tail, but a recent Cowen survey said Nike is still the top sports footwear present expected under Christmas trees this year. Shares fell 2.3% Friday.FedEx (FDX) easily beat Q2 forecasts, delivering 14% EPS growth to $3.18 while revenue grew 9% to $16.31 billion, and raised guidance to $12.70-$13.30 per diluted share for the year, up from prior outlook for $12-$12.80. FedEx Express revenue rose over 8%, Ground segment revenue grew 12%, and Freight sales rose 10%. Shares rose 4.15%. The report come as FedEx and UPS (UPS) are in peak holiday delivery season, having beefed up staffing to meet delivery goals. UPS has encountered some delays in getting packages to customers.Red Hat (RHT) reported Q3 profit that edged views while revenue, operating margin, and billings also topped estimates. The open source Linux software company is ramping revenue from new products — OpenShift and OpenStack — for hybrid cloud computing, analysts said. For the current quarter Red Hat estimated revenue in the range of $758 million to $763 million, above the consensus of $755 million. It projects adjusted earnings of 81 cents, topping the consensus estimate of 75 cents. Full-year revenue guidance was raised by $21 million at the midpoint to $2.906 billion. But shares sank 4.55%.Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) reported adjusted second-quarter earnings of 73 cents, up 14%, while revenue rose 14.6% to $1.88 billion, both beating views. Same-restaurant sales rose 3.1% overall. Darden also raised its full-year guidance. Meanwhile, Jack in the Box (JACK) agreed to sell its Qdoba burrito chain to Apollo Global Management (APO), the latest private-equity buyout of a restaurant chain in 2017.RV icon Winnebago (WGO) on Wednesday trounced Q1 earnings views. Shares fell 4.6% Wednesday amid concerns about creeping costs in its motor home segment, but closed up 0.7% for the week. REV Group (REVG), which sells RVs along with an array of specialty vehicles missed quarterly estimates. But the recent IPO rebounded from a steep Wednesday morning loss soar 11% for the week, hitting record highs.Stitch Fix (SFIX) topped estimates in its first-ever earnings report. Analysts said they were impressed with the online tailor's performance, with revenue of $295.6 million, up 25%. Concerns were raised, however, about the Stitch Fix's declining gross margin amid heavy capital expenditures. The recent IPO fell 9.8% on Wednesday but rose 5.6% for the week.Accenture (ACN) reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations. The Dublin-based global tech consulting and services said it earned $1.79 a share, up 13%, with revenue rising 12% to  $9.5 billion.Biogen (BIIB) reported that a much-followed experimental Alzheimer's drug did not meet success criteria after 12 months in a Phase 2 trial. The study will continue to 18 months. Shares fell 3.3% on Thursday.Cintas (CTAS) saw earnings climb 14% to $1.31 in its fiscal second quarter. Revenue rose 24% to $1.61 billion. Both beat estimates. Cintas also raised full-year guidance. Shares of the IBD 50 stock and workwear provider reversed from a record high Friday to close the week down a fraction.Boeing (BA) and Embraer (ERJ) confirmed they are in talks, sending the Brazilian jet maker sharply higher. But Brazil's government reportedly is opposed to an outright sale. 
"
46,CXO,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose slightly Monday morning, while Bitcoin's wild ride took another leg down.During Thursday's session, chip giants Intel (INTC) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) undercut recent breakouts while Facebook (FB) drifted below its 50-day moving average. Those issues come as energy stocks power up, with Chevron (CVX) among Thursday's powerful moves into buy zones.X S&P 500 futures rose 0.15% vs. fair value. Dow futures were up a fraction. Nasdaq 100 futures were slightly above fair value.Bitcoin futures were falling yet again this week, with CME and Cboe futures tumbling to about $14,100. CME futures opened trading on Sunday evening at $20,650. Several Bitcoin- and blockchain-related stocks were retreating as well.Long Blockchain (LTEA), which surged 183% on Thursday on its decision to change its name from Long Island Iced Tea, was down 31% in premarket action. Riot Blockchain (RIOT) lost 12% and Overstock.com (OSTK) 5.5%.Intel fell 1.7% to 46.76 in Thursday's stock market trading, dropping below a 47.40 buy point cleared on Wednesday. Volume was 44% above normal, slightly more than on Wednesday's breakout. However, Intel's action, by itself, is not that concerning or surprising.While you never want to see a stock fall below its entry point, Intel had surged 9.9% over four days in heavy volume from near the bottom of a cup-like base. Breakouts from cup bases without handles are less likely to succeed, because after a big run up, a pullback is natural as weak holders exit. The Dow technology giant could retake that buy point, ideally in robust trade.But other chip action renewed concerns about the broader chip sector.KLA-Tencor fell 3.4% to 108.62, easily dropping below the 110.11 entry crossed on Monday. Volume was below normal, suggesting big institutions weren't dumping shares. Then again, Monday's breakout volume was just OK, 9% above average. You want to see volume at least 40%-50% higher than normal on breakouts.Meanwhile, chip groups were among Thursday's losers with chip equipment down 2%. Few chip-equipment makers are trading above their 50-day lines, with ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT) among those finding resistance there recently. Among chipmakers, Micron Technology (MU) is still above that support area, but fell 2.9% Thursday. That erased more than half of Micron's 4% pop Wednesday following the memory giant's strong earnings and guidance.Facebook nudged down 0.25% to 177.45 on Thursday, barely undercutting its 50-day line. Since breaking out past a 175.59 buy point in late October, Facebook has made little progress, briefly dropping out of buy range a few weeks ago. Facebook's Relative Strength line has been nudging lower since the start of November, reflecting the FANG stock's underperformance in recent weeks.Facebook rival Snap (SNAP) sank 0.8% to 15.37 on Thursday. But that completed a handle in its first-ever proper consolidation. That lowers the potential entry slightly to 16.55 from 16.98. Keep in mind that Snap's new base is well below its highs, so the stock could face upside resistance. Also, the Snapchat operator is struggling with user growth and finding a path to profitability in the face of intense Facebook competition.Energy stocks and groups were market leaders for a second straight session. Oil prices are at two-year highs while Trump tax cuts should especially benefit the oil and gas industry.Chevron rose 3.25% to 124.82 on Thursday, retaking a 120.99 entry with volume that was nearly double normal. Concho Resources (CXO) also broke out on strong volume, while EOG Resources (EOG), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) were among the oil stocks breaking out on less impressive trading. But those moves still added to the general optimism surrounding the sector.Diamondback Energy (FANG) surged 5%, becoming extended after leading the way with a high-volume breakout Wednesday.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: The Next Potential Pitfall In WashingtonThese Oil, Mining Stocks Hit Buy Zones On Global Growth, Trump Tax Cuts: Investing Action PlanArtificial Intelligence Software To Grow Nearly 30 Times By 2025You'll Never Guess Who's Pivoting To Blockchain NowHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

47,CXO,"Futures for the S&P 500 index were little changed late Wednesday. The major averages edged lower during the regular session. Diamondback Energy (FANG) cleared a buy point in double-normal volume. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) has pulled back since edging past an entry in so-so trade. Fellow Dow industrial components Microsoft (MSFT), Walt Disney (DIS) and Pfizer (PFE) have retreated back into their bases after getting an inflated boostX Volume is sometimes overlooked by investors. But it's a key indicator of institutional support. It's good to see volume rising at least 40%-50% above normal on a breakout. Low-volume breakouts can succeed, but the odds are much lower.S&P 500 and Dow futures rose slightly vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.1%.Diamondback Energy rose 4.9% to 117.24 in Wednesday's stock market trading, blasting above a 115.03 flat-base buy point. Volume was 110% above the 50-day moving average, and really picked up in the afternoon.There's no guarantee that Diamondback's move will succeed. Several recent Diamondback breakouts failed or went nowhere. But the strong volume is positive. And there are reasons to be encouraged beyond the price-and-volume action.The shale operator has five straight quarters of strong earnings growth. Analysts predict a 56% EPS gain in the current quarter. Crude futures at two-year highs also bodes well going forward.Oil and gas groups dominated IBD's top-performing industries on Wednesday, with mining and steel also faring well. Shale and other energy plays dominated the S&P 500's biggest winners.Several energy stocks are closing in on buy points. That includes fellow shale plays Concho Resources (CXO) and EOG Resources (EOG), as well as oil majors such as Chevron (CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA).Diamondback was added to IBD's Leaderboard on Wednesday.Apple rose 1.4% to 176.34 on Monday, just nudging past a 176.24 base-on-base entry. But volume was just 8% above normal. A Nomura downgrade pushed the iPhone maker below its entry on Tuesday, with Apple nudging down 0.1% on Wednesday to 174.35.If Apple retakes that 176.34 entry in bullish trade, the chart would look a lot more inviting.Microsoft, Pfizer and Disney are exceptions that prove the rule on volume's importance. They all moved into buy range on Friday in powerful volume. But last Friday was a triple-witching expiration day, pushing up market volume sharply. On those days, gains in heavy volume aren't necessarily a sign of conviction buys by mutual funds and other big institutions.The three Dow components certainly haven't followed through this week.Microsoft has retreated 1.5% to 85.52, back below the 86.30 flat-base entry. Disney lost 1.9% on Wednesday to 109.69, dropping under its 110.93 buy point in a somewhat messy double-bottom base. There were some indications that, after a strong opening weekend, ""The Last Jedi"" ticket sales sagged on Monday and Tuesday.Pfizer has skidded 2% this week to 36.46, undercutting its 36.88 entry.RELATED:The Big Picture: Will 2018 Be A Repeat Of This Year's Bull Run?Apple Just Hit A Buy Point, Joining These 3 Dow StocksEnergy Stocks And Industry NewsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

48,CXO,"Major indexes held on to light gains in afternoon trade Thursday while a hot Bitcoin-tracking exchange traded fund ushered its first key sell signal since blasting out of a deep cup with handle on Nov. 24.X Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) got showered by sellers for a third straight session as shares dropped more than 24% in trading running double its 50-day average.At 1,807, it was also the first time for the ETF to slide significantly below the 10-day moving average, a key sell signal for short-term trading.The 10-day moving average represents the average closing price over the past 10 trading sessions and can help determine an early exit for a stock or a highflying ETF that has broken out of a proper base such as a cup with handle or a flat base.Meanwhile, Chevron (CVX) led an impressive rebound among integrated oil and gas firms as the Dow Jones industrial average member surged more than 3% to 125.24 in heavy turnover. That gain hoisted the San Ramon, Calif., energy giant further above a 120.99 buy point in a six-week flat base.That flat base is part of an even longer consolidation. Chevron's buy zone goes up to 127.04.Other strong stocks in the oil patch include EOG Resources (EOG) and Diamondback Energy (FANG), which is one of four stocks to join IBD Leaderboard in December. Diamondback is now 7% past a 115.03 buy point and thus extended in price. The right time to buy a stock following its breakout is when it is still within 5% of the proper entry. In Diamondback's case, the buy zone goes up to 120.78.Other exploration and production stocks breaking out include Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) (flat base, 65.93 buy point), Norway's Statoil (STO) (flat base, 21.12) and Concho Resources (CXO) (base on base, 147.87).At 2:45 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 posted gains of around 0.4% and still look poised for weekly gains. The Nasdaq composite slightly lagged, up nearly 0.3%. Small caps are outperforming with the Russell 2000 up more than 0.7%.The Dow transports cooled off a bit, trading virtually flat, after running up four sessions in a row and rising almost 3.4% over that period. One of Thursday's top industry groups is shipping transport, up more than 4% as a group. But none of the companies in the 31-member industry group holds a Composite Rating of 90 or higher. The highest-rated name is Genco Shipping & Trading (GNK), a thinly traded dry bulk carrier. The stock has formed a handle on a base that resembles a double bottom. The buy point is 13.83, a dime above the handle's high.While Genco sports a lowly Composite of 65 on IBD Stock Checkup, the RS Rating is strong at 89 and the Accumulation/Distribution Rating is positive at B.On the Dow industrials, at least seven stocks are up 1 point or more, including Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs (GS). The investment bank rose 2.2% in active turnover and is aiming to move out of the 5% buy zone after clearing a saucer with handle at 247.84.On an adjusted basis, Goldman has notched five quarters in a row of rising earnings growth. Revenue has increased 22%, 18%, 31%, 6% and 11% vs. year-ago levels over the same time frame.Back to Chevron, the Street sees earnings rebounding 459% to $1.23 a share in the fourth quarter. In the year-ago quarter, profit dropped 38%.Yet amid the recent strength in crude oil prices, boosted in large part by OPEC's success in extending its pact to cut supply through the end of 2018, Chevron's top line has enjoyed a startling turnaround.Diamondback, an expert in the Permian Basin region and West Texas, rallied for a fourth straight session and jumped more than 3% to 120.96 in strong turnover. Mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares in the midcap energy play have risen for at least 18 quarters in a row. In the third quarter, 979 funds owned a piece of Diamondback, up from 584 funds in Q3 of 2015 and 731 funds in Q3 of 2016.Analysts see earnings rising 191% this year to $5.10 a share, which would be an record for the Midland, Texas-based firm that was incorporated in 2011. In 2018, earnings are seen rising another 24% to $6.30 a share.Pretax margin was 25.6% in 2016.The SMR Rating is a top-notch A on a scale of A to E as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.

The company hasn't changed its planned activity levels in 2017 and is on track to run approximately 20 development rigs across its U.S. resource plays by the end of the year.""During the quarter, we had some of the best drill-bit results in Devon's history with 50 new wells averaging 30-day rates in excess of 2,100 Boe per day,"" said CEO Dave Hager in a statement. ""Importantly, we delivered these prolific wells with a capital investment that was below the low end of our guidance range for the third consecutive quarter.""Stock: Devon rallied 0.3% late after gaining 2.5% to end at 36.90 in the regular session.

Production rose 12% to 626,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, after adjusting for divestments.""Looking to 2018, we will continue to demonstrate financial discipline as a foundational principle,"" CEO Al Walker said in the release. ""We will remain focused on returns by continuing to allocate upstream capital toward the higher-margin assets in our portfolio, which should generate substantial free cash flow in a $50 oil-price environment, with total capital spending, including Anadarko midstream spending on infrastructure in the Delaware Basin, inside of discretionary cash flow from operations.""Stock: Anadarko fell 1.6% late after finishing up 1.4% at 49.37.

52,CXO,"For the past two years, shale exploration and production companies have focused on growing the flow of oil, but now the focus may be shifting toward the flow of cash.XConcho Resources (CXO), Apache (APA), EOG Resources (EOG) and a slew of other U.S. shale producers report third-quarter results this week. While U.S. crude prices have climbed to $54 a barrel they have struggled to stay above $50 ever since prices collapsed in 2014, and producers' spending vs. cash flow will likely be a key metric for investors.The outlook for capital expenditures is dimming, as companies focus more on financial returns and operating within their cash flows vs. expanding production, oilfield service provider Schlumberger (SLB) said earlier this month.""In North America land (operations) where companies added capex, production growth is falling short of expectations,"" CEO Paul Kibsgaard said on the earnings call with analysts. ""This has led to moderating investment appetite.""Early reports from shale companies echoed this sense of caution. On Friday, Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) reported Q3 results that fell short of Wall Street estimates and reaffirmed its total 2017 program spending forecast of $845 million.""We remain committed to delivering positive free cash flow in 2017 and beyond, while continuing to focus on improving our corporate returns and increasing our return of capital to shareholders through prudent capital allocation,"" Chairman and CEO Dan Dinges said in a statement.Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said he will be looking for a focus on wellhead profitability in the shale earnings reports and expects companies to be less aggressive about production.""Before it was a rush to raise production now it's a rush to produce profitability,"" he said. ""It could be positive if companies said they were going pull back and focus on cash.""Among U.S. oil giants, however, the spending picture is mixed. Chevron (CVX)  said Friday it would spend less money than expected this year, while Exxon Mobil (XOM) said it would spend more next year to increase drilling in U.S. shale plays. That could be a reflection of the uncertainty that continues to permeate oil markets, which increasingly look to the U.S. oil patch as the swing producer.""I think there's still one more big surge coming from U.S., which will knock prices down,"" Ian Taylor, CEO of Vitol Group, said at the Oil & Money conference in London last month.He expects Brent crude to fall to $45 per barrel in 2018 as U.S. shale production increases vs. $60 today.Shares of EOG Resources, a bellwether of the industry that is known as the ""Apple (AAPL) of oil"" for its tech advances, were up 1.1% at 99.53 on the stock market today, climbing further into buying range after breaking out from a 98.47 cup-with-handle base on Friday.U.S. crude futures closed up 0.5% to $54.15 a barrel on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Concho Resources, Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Devon Energy (DVN) kick off the busy earnings week, reporting results after the market closes Tuesday. Concho's earnings are seen falling 19% to 26 cents per share but revenue is expected to jump 44% to $622 million.Anadarko is expected to report a loss of 56 cents per share up from a loss of 89 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is seen rising 23% to $2.32 billion. Last month, Anadarko announced a $2.5 billion share buyback plan.Devon's EPS is expected to soar 333% to 39 cents from 9 cents a year ago but revenue is expected to fall 25% to $3.16 billion.Laredo Petroleum (LPI) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) are scheduled to report Wednesday. Analysts expect Laredo's EPS to rise 8.3% to 13 cents with revenue up 14.4% to $183 million.Pioneer's EPS is seen jumping 123% to 29 cents as revenue climbs 8.3%b to $1.3 billion.In Q2, Pioneer lowed its outlook of how many higher-value oil barrels it would produce in 2017. But at the Oil & Money conference, Pioneer said it plans to quadruple production over the next decade thanks to increasing output from Texas.CEO Timothy Dove said that the company's break even is $20 per barrel, giving it more room to expand and more cushion if oil prices fall.Apache and EOG Resources are due Thursday.Analysts see Apache reporting a loss of 2 cents per share vs. a 3-cents-per-share loss in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is expected to dip 2.1% to $1.41 billion.EOG is seen swinging to a profit of 10 cents per share vs. a loss of 40 cents per share a year ago.

Revenue is expected to climb 22% to $2.58 billion.Results: EPS of 19 cents on revenue of $2.64 billion.

EOG considers premium inventory wells that have a minimum 30% rate of return at $40 per barrel oil prices.EOG estimates the First Bone Spring play has 540 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) net resource potential and 540 remaining net premium wells. The Woodford Oil Window play has an estimated 210 million BOE net resource potential and 260 net premium wells.So far this year, EOG has added 2,000 net premium locations, which is four times the number of wells the company expects to complete in 2017.""We have amassed an enormous, high-quality portfolio of assets by capturing sweet-spot acreage in the best oil plays in the U.S.,"" Chairman and CEO Bill Thomas in a statement. ""Combined with our consistent operational proficiency and innovative technology, this gives us great confidence in the long-term sustainability of our unique premium growth and high-return model.""Devon Energy (DVN) was also active in the Bone Spring play during Q3, and Concho Resources (CXO) has acreage there too. Continental Resources (CLR), who is scheduled to report Q3 results Tuesday, has Woodford Oil Window assets as well.Stock: EOG rallied 1% late. Shares closed 0.65% higher at 102.95 on the stock market today, still in a buy zone after clearing a 98.47 buy point on Friday. But if the after-hours gain carries over to regular trading Friday, the stock will be extended above the buy range.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.EOG earned the nickname the ""Apple of oil"" for its for reputation as a leading technological innovator, allowing it to weather historically low oil prices by finding ways to pump more cheaply.The company has its own proprietary smartphone apps that allow employees to make real-time decisions on the use of different bits and other drilling techniques while out in the field.Earlier Thursday, Apache (APA) reported Q3 EPS of 4 cents on revenue of $1.58 million. Analysts expected EPS of 5 cents and revenue of $1.42 billion.Several shale companies have already reported this week, including Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), Laredo Petroleum (LPI), Concho Resources, Devon Energy and Anadarko Petroleum (APC).In general, they have been focused on cash-flow discipline instead of boosting production, though Pioneer and Laredo increased their capital spending forecasts for this year.RELATED:Pioneer Natural Resources Crushes Earnings Views; Laredo Q3 MixedShale Earnings: Concho Resources, Devon Energy Beat, Anadarko Misses

Tesla (TSLA) topped forecasts while General Motors (GM) and other U.S. automakers reported weak domestic sales. Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) crashed as it and other fiber-optic plays had weak guidance or results. The U.S. economy continued to grow and hire at a moderate pace.The major market averages continued to split. The Dow Jones industrial average continued to rack up small gains, climbing 1.2% and topping 22,000 for the first time. The S&P 500 edged up 0.2% while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.4%. Apple, Tesla had well-received June quarter results, while many stocks had big double-digit percentage gains or losses. Optical stocks were losers on Applied Optoelectronics and others.Consumer electronics giant Apple beat Wall Street's sales and earnings targets in the June quarter and guided higher for the September quarter, easing concerns about a late iPhone 8 launch. Earnings rose 18% while sales climbed 7% to $45.4 billion. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qorvo (QRVO) also topped estimates, implying healthy business from Apple. Apple advanced 4.6%, but closed below a buy point after clearing it on Wednesday. Apple chipmakers struggled.RELATED:This Is Why Apple Is Bullish On Q4 Sales (It's Not The iPhone 8)Tesla (TSLA) reported a smaller-than-expected adjusted loss, while second-quarter revenue more than doubled from the year-ago quarter to reaching $2.79 billion. Tesla received several price-target hikes following its quarterly earnings report that beat views, though analysts expressed concern about the electric car company's ability to execute on its ambitious production schedule for the new Model 3. Analysts also are concerned about Tesla's cash burn. But the stock rose 6.55%, clearing its 50-day moving average.Here's What Analysts Like And Don't Like About Tesla EarningsBefore Ordering A Tesla Model 3 Or Chevy Bolt, Look At This ChartApplied Optoelectronics sees weak revenue for the current quarter, shocker given that the optical stock had raised or beaten guidance several times this year. It cited some slower demand from a large customer, which could be Amazon. Applied Opto, the No. 1 stock in the No. 1-rated Telecom-Fiber Optics group, crashed 34% Friday. Acacia Communications (ACIA) and Infinera (INFN) also had bad news late Thursday. Earlier in the week, Macom Technology Solutions Holdings (MTSI), an optical-related chipmaker, sees weak China demand. However, Oclaro (OCLR) reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter profit and revenue and sees strong demand in the current fiscal year. But Oclaro shares still plunged for the week.RELATED:Applied Optoelectronics Plunges On Weak Guidance; Opticals HitJuly was a rout for U.S. auto sales, marking the biggest monthly decline since August 2010. General Motors (GM) saw sales plunge 15% vs. the expected 9% to 11%. Ford Motor (F) sales declined nearly 8% vs. an expected 5% to 6%. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) sales declined 11% vs. an expected 7%. Industrywide U.S. auto sales rang in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.77 million in July, Autodata reported, marking the third straight month below 17 million. The auto giants pointed to planned fleet sales cutbacks, but their retail sales also retreated. Toyota (TM) saw U.S. sales unexpectedly rise, while Japanese peers Nissan (NSANY) and Honda (HMC) had smaller-than-expected declines.RELATED:U.S. Auto Sales Tumble 7%, Worst Drop In Nearly 7 YearsThe U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in July, slightly more than expected. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.3% while average hourly wages rose a solid 0.3%. The report is more evidence of tighter labor markets, though it likely won't shift the Federal Reserve's policy path in the near future. Meanwhile, ISM surveys signaled still-strong manufacturing growth while some decelerating growth in the service sector.Grubhub (GRUB) and Yelp (Yelp) both topped second-quarter earnings and revenue estimates late Thursday. As part of a long-term partnership, Grubhub will pay $287.5 million in cash to acquire Yelp's online food ordering and delivery business, Eat24. The partnership comes as Amazon (AMZN) is getting more aggressive in the food delivery market. Grubhub rose 9.2% on Friday while Yelp shot up nearly 28%.Symantec (SYMC), Qualys (QYLS) and FireEye (FEYE) reported better-than-expected June-quarter results, following computer security peer Proofpoint (PFPT) last week.

Shares fell 6%.Video game publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) reported better-than-expected June-quarter results, while mobile and online games publisher Zynga (ZNGA) delivered a mixed report. Activision climbed 4% through Thursday to fresh highs, but retreated 3.1% Friday on its mixed guidance. Take-Two spiked 9.5%, breaking out past a buy point to its own high. Zynga was little changed, in a consolidation at 3-year highs.RELATED:Activision Blizzard Beats Second-Quarter Views, Offers Mixed OutlookVideo Game Publisher Take-Two Rockets On June-Quarter BeatBoeing (BA) announced that it would get into the avionics business, to make controls and electronics for aircraft and spacecraft. The aerospace giant said the unit would first supply parts for its own aircraft but eventually sell to other firms. Analysts worried that would hurt suppliers like Rockwell Collins (COL) and Honeywell (HON). Boeing also announced a pricing deal with Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) on supplies for its 787 Dreamliner. Spirit has a similar deal with Airbus (EADSY) for its A350. Spirit Aero, which also announced strong earnings, soared 17.2%.The ObamaCare exchanges are still perilous for insurers' earnings health, but Medicare is a cash cow. Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), which will both complete their exit from the individual insurance markets at year end, both sailed past earnings estimates thanks to momentum in their Medicare Advantage businesses, and their shares vaulted to record highs. Aetna earnings ballooned by 55% and Humana earnings grew 6%, both smashing views. Cigna (CI) and WellCare Health Plans (WCG) also reported strong earnings. But Molina Healthcare (MOH), which saw the exchanges as a big growth opportunity, reported a loss of $4.10 a share in Q2, largely blaming its ObamaCare exchange business. Molina will pull out of the Wisconsin and Utah markets and scale back its presence in Washington state. In its remaining markets, Molina said it will hike premiums at least 30% in 2018. Molina shares tumbled.RELATED:Aetna Trounces Expectations As Big ObamaCare Insurer CrashesVulcan Materials (VMC) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), huge suppliers of construction aggregates, both reported earnings below views. Both companies cited wet weather across the Southeast for delaying shipments. Vulcan said some coastal Texas energy and highway projects were pushed back, while Illinois business has been hit by the state's budget crisis. As proxies for infrastructure spending, the stocks soared after President Trump's surprise election. While there hasn't been any movement on infrastructure at the federal level, both companies are upbeat about growing backlogs and stronger pricing, and Wall Street analysts seem convinced that they'll gain traction later this year.RELATED:Trump Touts Market Prowess As Trump Stocks Erase Post-Election GainsEOG Resources (EOG), Oasis Petroleum (OAS), and Devon Energy (DVN) reported mixed quarterly results, while Diamondback Energy (FANG), Rice Energy (RICE) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) beat and Concho Resources (CXO), Parsley Energy (PE) missed.

63,CXO,"Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said using artificial intelligence could help ensure it always drills for oil in the best places, as the energy sector embraces technologies that are transforming transportation, e-commerce and finance.While Tesla (TSLA) has been pursuing autonomous driving and Amazon (AMZN) is pushing its Alexa bot as a personal shopper, the oil industry has been slower to go high tech. But more companies are applying data analytics to oil exploration and production.Pioneer Natural Resources said Thursday that it isn't using AI yet, though it's been using predictive analytics.AI would help ""narrow the outcomes on these wells,"" meaning Pioneer could always drill in the sweet spot and avoid duds, Chris Cheatwood, the company's executive vice president for business development and geoscience, told analysts on a conference call.Pioneer expects AI to be the future, and as it looks to produce 1 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day by 2026, it won't need to hire a lot more people, he added.The company and Oak Ridge National Laboratory are also working together to look at advanced materials and coatings, smart parts and sensors, advanced material design, and additive manufacturing, according to a March statement from the lab.Shares of Pioneer fell 3% to 165.63 on the stock market today as a sell-off in oil prices overshadowed its strong quarterly report late Wednesday. Pioneer hit a nine-month low intraday.U.S. crude sank 4.8% to a five-month low of $45.52 a barrel, back to where prices were before OPEC began its production cuts.The shale producer swung to an adjusted profit of 25 cents per share in Q1, beating analyst views by 8 cents. Revenue jumped to $1.47 billion, also above views. Total production costs eased to $6.31 per BOE from $6.42 in Q4, but costs for Permian horizontal wells climbed 19% sequentially to $2.33 per BOE, and Permian vertical costs rose 2.5% to $14.36. Eagle Ford costs dipped 1.5% sequentially to $10.71.Production rose 3% vs. Q4 to 249,000 BOE per day, and management sees Q2 output of 254,000-259,000 BOE a day. While some analysts questioned if that guidance was light, Pioneer said its planned addition of wells is weighted toward the latter part of Q2 and the latter part of the year.Despite the uptick in Permian-area costs, Pioneer doesn't see cost inflation affecting its bottom line this year, noting it has long-term contracts for sand used in fracking and has access to cheap water, though it sees water use in the Permian doubling in 2017 vs. 2014 levels. Labor costs are up 2%-3%.Also late Wednesday, Continental Resources (CLR) reported adjusted EPS of 2 cents vs. a loss of 41 cents a year ago, in line with Wall Street views. Revenue was $685.43 million, above views for $642.83 million. Production expenses rose 5% vs. Q4 to $3.78 per BOE but were little changed vs. a year ago.On Thursday, CEO Harold Hamm told analysts during a conference call that service costs are only seeing a slight uptick in a few areas and have stabilized.Continental sees Q2 production of 220,000-225,000 BOE per day, up from 213,755 in Q1. Fracking crews in the Bakken formation will rise to nine by midyear from seven now.Despite the recent dive in crude prices, Hamm noted ""signs pointing toward better prices very quickly"" but added that fracking crews could be withdrawn promptly, depending on market conditions.Shale companies can extract oil profitably at lower prices due to new technologies and techniques that have improved efficiencies. Continental expects to be cash-flow neutral with U.S. crude at $50-$55 a barrel.

Devon Energy also reported a profit and announced $1 billion in asset sales primarily in the Barnett Shale basin.Diamondback shares climbed 2% Wednesday, and Devon fell 1.75%.The earnings reports come as U.S. crude inventories start to decline. The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that stockpiles fell by 930,000 barrels last week while gasoline stockpiles rose by 200,000 barrels. Analysts were expecting a crude decrease of 2.3 million barrels and a gasoline increase of 1.3 million.Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said crude inventories plunged by 4.2 million barrels as gasoline stockpiles fell by 1.9 million barrels.Meanwhile, U.S. crude production continues to climb, rising to 9.29 million barrels a day last week from 9.27 million, according to EIA.U.S. crude futures rose 0.3% to settle at $47.82 a barrel, after dropping Tuesday to their lowest levels since late November.But the International Energy Agency recently questioned the ability of increased U.S. shale production to offset a decline in conventional oil projects as demand rises.The agency expects liquids production from U.S. shale plays to expand by 2.3 million barrels per day by 2022 at current prices. But conventional resources sanctioned for development last year fell 30% to 4.7 billion barrels, and overall exploration spending will be down for a third straight year to less than half of 2014 levels, with offshore projects especially hit.RELATED:BP Beats, Sees Stronger Cash Flow; ConocoPhillips Reports Surprise Loss

65,CXO,"Diamondback Energy (FANG), Concho Resources (CXO), Continental Resources (CLR) and other U.S. exploration and production companies will report earnings this week, likely providing more information on capital spending, production outlooks and oilfield service costs.Senior Robert W. Baird oil and gas analyst Daniel Katzenberg said he expects some increases in production outlooks for the year and said any increases in output without a corresponding bump in capital spending would be major a confidence boost for investors.Liquids production from U.S. shale plays is expected to expand by 2.3 million barrels per day by 2022 at current prices, and could grow more if prices rise further, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency.The number of oil rigs in operation has swelled for 15 straight weeks, according to Baker Hughes data, suggesting continued U.S. production gains in the near future.Even oil majors like Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (CVX) have turned their investment focus to expanding their holdings in the Permian Basin while curtailing spending in other areas.But the IEA worries that U.S. production won't be enough to offset the decline in investment in conventional drilling as demand for crude grows.But questions remain about service costs. Katzenberg doesn't think cost inflation will be an issue for E&Ps until WTI crude hits $60 per barrel.He said the average estimate is for a 20% increase this year, but he's only forecasting a 10% increase as improvements in drilling will offset some of the cost increases.IBD'S TAKE: Q1 reports from U.S. E&P companies will shed some light on how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts given by service providers during the crude price bust.""However, given investor trepidation, updated cost commentary, and its impact on 2017 plans, remains the biggest risk to the group over the earnings period, in our opinion,"" Katzenberg  wrote in note dated April 20.Diamondback Energy, Devon Energy (DVN) and ConocoPhillips (COP) are scheduled to release first-quarter results Tuesday.

66,CXO,"U.S. shale production has been surging as companies like EOG Resources (EOG) and Diamondback Energy (FANG) take advantage of the recovery in prices, but is it enough to make up for weakness in conventional plays?With break-even prices in shale plays like the prolific Permian Basin dropping to just $40-$45 from over $60, producers are pouring money into oilfields again. On Thursday, U.S. crude futures settled down 1.3% at a one-month low of $48.97 a barrel.Liquids production from U.S. shale plays is expected to expand by 2.3 million barrels per day by 2022 at current prices, and could grow more if prices rise further, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency.Meanwhile, conventional resources sanctioned for development last year fell 30% to 4.7 billion barrels in 2016, and overall exploration spending will down for a third straight year to less than half 2014 levels, with offshore projects especially hit.Conventional oil accounts for the largest share of global oil production, at 69 million barrels per day out of the total 85 million barrels, and just 6.5 million barrels come from U.S. shale.That's left the IEA and other energy watchdogs worrying that the U.S. won't be enough to fulfill the world's growing need for crude.""Every new piece of evidence points to a two-speed oil market, with new activity at a historic low on the conventional side contrasted by remarkable growth in US shale production,"" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement. ""The key question for the future of the oil market is for how long can a surge in U.S. shale supplies make up for the slow pace of growth elsewhere in the oil sector.""Oil majors like Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have focused on expanding their holdings in the Permian Basin while they step back from offshore projects.

67,CXO,"X EOG Resources (EOG), the so-called ""Apple (AAPL) of oil,"" matched Q1 earnings views late Monday and beat revenue forecasts, while the shale producer touted record performance from its new Permian Basin wells.While dozens of shale companies have reported or are about to report, EOG's reputation for innovation makes it stand out, especially as U.S. oil prices have fallen back below $50 a barrel. To generate bigger profits at that level, producers have to find ways to extract oil as efficiently as possible.Houston-based EOG swung to a per-share profit of 15 cents, matching estimates, as revenue soared 93% to $2.61 billion, topping forecasts for $2.41 billion.Crude production climbed 18% year over year to 315,700 barrels of oil per day. Average completed well costs were down 6% vs. 2016 averages in the Eagle Ford, Delaware and Bakken formations.

In November, management said 75% of its cost savings were from efficiencies vs. discounts received from service providers, though some analysts have said the real number is likely a half to a third.Executives may detail additional technological advances. EOG will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. ET Tuesday.Meanwhile, other shale producers are looking into technologies normally associated with Silicon Valley, Last week, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said its looking into using artificial intelligence to help ensure it always drills for oil in the best places and is working with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to test advanced materials and coatings.Also after the close Monday, Oasis Petroleum (OAS) reported its adjusted Q1 loss narrowed to 5 cents a share, beating by 2 cents, as revenue soared 119% to $285.1 million, above consensus for $252.1 million. Total production jumped 25.6% to 63,192 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day. Lease operating expenses were $7.71 per BOE, up from $7.60 in Q4 and $6.78 a year earlier.Oasis shares rallied 2% after hours.Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) and Sanchez Energy (SN) will release results Tuesday.So far, shale firms aren't seeing much cost inflation, despite surging activity in the Permian Basin.

69,CXO,"Good things, they say, come in small packages. That can be true for chart patterns, too. One example: the square-box base. As the shortest possible base within IBD's collection of winning patterns, it can form in as few as four weeks and lasts no more than seven weeks.For chart readers, square boxes seem to happen in the wink of an eye.Aruba Networks cleared a square box on Aug. 27, 2010. Latin American brewery giant AmBev (ABEV) (also known as Companhia de Bebidas das Americas) topped one the week ended Sept. 3, 2010. Ebix (EBIX) cleared a square box that formed within a larger base in the week ended Sept. 24. All have since gained 20% or more.Like a flat base, a square box corrects no more than 15% from top to bottom. Volume tends to dry up through the correction and surges at the breakout. The buy point is the highest intraday price within the pattern, plus a dime.The flat base must last a minimum five weeks, but can be much longer than a square box. Unlike the rounded bottom seen in a cup or in two down legs in a double bottom, the flat base's shape looks like its name implies — flat, sideways movement.The square box is the newest base in the CAN SLIM arsenal. It was introduced in the fourth edition of ""How to Make Money In Stocks,"" written and published in 2009 by IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil. ""I've noted this pattern over recent years,"" O'Neil wrote, ""but finally we've studied, measured and classified it.""As with all bases, you typically start your count of weeks for a square box during the first down week. That means the first week to log a Friday close that's below the prior Friday's close. A good example is Southwest U.S. oil producer Concho Resources (CXO).  Concho broke out of a cup-with-handle base in the week ended Aug. 7, 2009 (1). It quickly eased into a shallow correction the next week. It dipped 12%, and briefly touched its 10-week moving average during the fourth week of its pullback. A square box — as well as a base-on-base pattern — was born.Concho rose off its 10-week line in weak trade for three days. Heavy trading then boosted it above the base's 35.37 buy point (2) as the stock gained 11% for the week. This was a telltale sign of institutional buying. At the time, Concho marked an 88 Composite Rating and a 78 for Relative Price Strength.It pulled back to its 10-week moving average twice as it climbed 24% over the next two months. Then Concho slipped into what would become a second square-box base in November (3).Notice in this square box how the lows from week to week were close in price — 40.24 in the week ended Nov. 20, 2009, then 40.33, 40.19 and 40.35. In the week ended Dec. 18, Concho jumped 9% and cleared its new buy point of 44.08, or 10 cents above the highest price within the box (4). The stock also leapt to an all-time high.Volume that week was weak, however (5). Perhaps this explains why the stock soon formed a seven-week cup-with-handle from January to February of this year (6).Because a square box or flat base is a base pattern, it is included in a stock's base count. Look for a 20% gain from a prior base's buy point before counting it as a separate base, though. A square box can also form as part of a base-on-base pattern, which counts as a single base.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the Oct. 28, 2010, edition of IBD.

70,CXO,"XExchange traded funds tracking major stock indexes rose on Thursday, led by the energy and financial sectors. Gains in oil, gas and bank stocks came as oil rallied for a third straight day on the heels of an extended slump.Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) and Industrial Select Sector SDPR (XLI) nudged higher at the opening bell on the stock market today. Their exchange traded fund stablemates investing in other S&P 500 sectors were flat to lower.A rebound in crude prices is giving the beleaguered energy sector a much-needed boost this week. XLE is eyeing its first weekly gain after three down weeks, but is poised for its third monthly loss in this young year.Early on Thursday, United States Oil (USO) punched up more than 1% to build on a 2.2% surge the prior day. The commodity exchange traded product tracks the price of West Texas Intermediate, or light sweet crude, which approached $50 a barrel in the morning session.The energy sector will have the best growth out of all 11 S&P sectors as earnings finally grow after contracting for two consecutive years, Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research, wrote earlier this month. She expects that cyclical sectors — financials, information technology and materials — will follow energy's lead with double-digit earnings growth in 2017.""They will also largely be the drivers of revenue growth, which is expected to improve to 5.1% in 2017, from less than 3% in 2016,"" Bell wrote.Those three S&P sectors are tracked by XLF, Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB).In identifying 10 companies with the largest year-over-year profit and revenue growth this year, Bell found only three made both lists: Cimarex Energy (XEC), Chevron (CVX) and Concho Resources (CXO) — all of which are energy companies.All three are S&P 500 oil and gas firms, which means XLE counts them among its 36 holdings.""We would point out that when coming off such a deeply negative base of earnings and revenue growth, like the energy sector is, lofty growth rates are more easily achieved,"" Bell added.ETF investors should keep in mind that sector earnings growth and performance often don't match up. That contrary fact is easily explained — the stock market tends to look ahead rather than look back.XLE was the top-performing sector SPDR ETF in 2016, vaulting 28% despite being the earnings laggard. Investors bet in large part on the turnaround in earnings growth expected this year.The ETF reversed lower Thursday around 10:30 am ET.IBD'S TAKE: As the Trump and Fed agenda emerge, read IBD Leaderboard and The Big Picture every day to assess whether the stock market has more room to run.RELATED:What Is Going On In The ETF Market?Find And Track The Best ETFs

72,CXO,"Papa John's (PZZA) and Concho Resources' (CXO) quarterly results were mixed, Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) posted a surprise drop in earnings.Estimates: The pizza chain is expected to report earnings per share of 66 cents, up 6.5%. Revenue is seen rising 7% to $446.85 million.Results: EPS of 69 cents on revenue of $439.6 million. System-wide North America comp sales rose 3.8%.Outlook: Full-year EPS growth of 8%-12%, with the midpoint below consensus for 12% growth.Stock: Papa John's dropped 2.5% late. Shares closed down 0.4% at 85.63 in the stock market today, moving back above its 50-day line after undercutting that key support level in the morning. The stock is currently in a flat base with a 90.59 buy point.Like Domino's Pizza (DPZ), Papa John's has been at the forefront of mobile ordering technology. Digital ordering platforms seem likely to become more important in the restaurant industry as more people do more things via their phones and find more reasons to stay in.Domino's and Papa John's remained rare bright spots in the industry last year. Other restaurants struggled with, among other things, bad weather, discounting, cheaper groceries relative to menu prices and difficulties in keeping up with a strong performance in 2015, analysts have said.Estimates: EPS rising 19% to 38 cents, with revenue up 9.5% to $497.51 million.Results: EPS of 29 cents on revenue of $484.7 million. Same-store sales up 1.2% at company-owned restaurants and 2% for domestic franchise restaurants.Outlook: Comp sales at company restaurants for the first 55 days of Q1 were up 1.5%. For fiscal 2017, 30 new company restaurants and food cost deflation of 1%-2%.Stock: Texas Roudhouse sank 9% late. Shares finished 0.9% lower at 47.79, trying to hold recent support at its 50-day line. The steakhouse chain's stock was making its way through a flat base with a 50.61 buy point. The stock has been forming a handle-like pattern in the past two weeks, but technically flat bases do not have handles. Investors could treat 48.65 as an aggressive early entry.Texas Roadhouse has also held up amid restaurants' struggles. The company has said it expects the slump in food costs, particularly for beef, to last through this year, amid questions over when prices will start rising again. Potentially higher labor-related expenses could mute the effects of those lower food costs.Lower food prices can help a restaurant better manage its costs, but they also make grocery stores more competitive.Estimates: A 7-cent per-share loss, the same as a year ago, with revenue jumping 41% to $548.85 billion.Results: Adjusted EPS of 20 cents on revenue of $524.6 million as production grew 14% to 164,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day.Outlook: Full-year capital spending of $1.6 billion-$1.8 million, up from a previous view of $1.4 billion-$1.6 billion. Production growth outlook raised to 20%-25% from a prior view of 17%-20% growth. Q1 production of 172,000-176,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.Stock: Concho was unchanged late. Shares ended up 0.9% at 141.35. Shares of the oil and natural gas explorer were also in a flat base with a 147.65 buy point.RELATED:Jack In The Box Finds A 'Forgiving' Late-Night-Delivery CustomerDomino's CEO Doyle On Netflix, Trump And Pizza's 'Jetsons' Future

75,CXO,"Nuveen Large Cap Growth Opportunities Fund's (FIGWX) recent surge since the elections and since the Federal Reserve's December rate hike has given retirement-account and other investors reason to cheer.In the trailing three months going into Thursday, the $300 million fund's 10.45% gain topped 93% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged an 8.66% advance. The broad market, measured by the S&P 500, gained 8.33%.For the Nuveen fund, that's way better than the mere 34% of direct rivals it outpaced in the past 12 months with a not-so-shabby 24.20% return.The difference between now and the earlier period? Within their overall investment approach, fund managers Harold Goldstein and David Chalupnik favored stocks likely to get an extra tailwind from the elections and from rising rates. Those had to be stocks that fit their basic approach, which is the pursuit of stocks they think will have faster earnings growth than the market expects.They paid for that by cutting stable and defensive consumer staples stocks by 7% in the fourth quarter and consumer discretionary stocks by 6%, the fund's fourth-quarter commentary notes.The managers pumped up their financials by 7%, mostly the day after the elections. They boosted technology by about 3% and energy by 2%.They began positions in Signature Bank (SBNY), SVB Financial (SIVB), Raymond James (RJF) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD).All of those newcomers have very strong Composite Ratings from IBD in the high 80s or 90s. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.In addition to a sterling 96 Comp Rating, SVB Financial is the No. 3-ranked bank in IBD's superregional industry group, thanks to growth metrics like four years in a row of earnings per share (EPS) growth and a 39.7% annual pretax margin.IBD'S TAKE: SVB Financial is ranked No. 3 in the No. 1-rated Banks-Super Regional group. See which superregional bank is No. 1, and how these financials stack up on easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data at IBD's Stock Checkup.The bank is headquartered in Silicon Valley, a hotbed of innovation. Its nonbanking businesses include asset management, private wealth management, brokerage and investment services, funds management, and business valuation services.Raymond James is No. 2 in IBD's Finance-Investment Bank-Bankers group. It is propelled by factors like its fourth-quarter 47% EPS growth and eight straight quarters of increasing ownership by mutual funds.In tech, the fund opened a position in Broadcom (AVGO), a chipmaking company whose EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters. On IBD's Leaderboard, the company makes analog and digital semiconductor systems for wireless communications and broadband communications.Goldstein and Chalupnik like the semiconductor space's economic sensitivity. And they like Broadcom's role among leaders of consolidation within its industry.In energy, the fund added new positions in Concho Resources (CXO) and Parsley Energy (PE), and added to its stake in Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).""(We) added exposure to several growth-oriented exploration and production firms as a result of the generally improved outlook for oil pricing and supply,"" the managers wrote.In health care, the fund's overall weight stayed basically unchanged in the immediate postelection period. But the fund made individual stock moves.It started a stake in Incyte (INCY), which the managers call a fast-growing young biotech firm with an exciting pipeline of cancer-fighting treatments.To pay for Incyte, the fund used proceeds from the sale of two drugmakers, Allergan (AGN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which it had owned a long time.The managers think Allergan has grown so large that it can no longer grow much faster than its industry. They sold Bristol-Meyers because test results dimmed the outlook for a lung cancer therapy it was developing.The managers summarized their approach this way: ""The portfolio continues to be reasonably balanced from a sector standpoint as well as measured by other factors. The fund's largest overweight is in the area of companies with high growth potential that we believe can perform well somewhat independent of the economic cycle. We are always looking for exceptional growth companies that we believe have solid and/or improving fundamentals, a reasonable valuation and an approaching catalyst.""RELATED:Why This Victory Munder Fund Likes Semiconductor Gear Makers And Non-ObamaCare Health StocksWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 2017

76,CXO,"Top U.S. shale stocks re-entered buy range Monday as crude prices spiked following Saturday's agreement between OPEC and top non-OPEC producers to cut output next month, but they erased much of their gains or even traded lower as oil prices pared gains.U.S. crude futures rose 2.6% to $52.83, their best close since July 2015. But oil rose more than 5% intraday.Shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) rose as high as 57.81 intraday, clearing a 54.42 buy point, but closed down 2.8% to 52.80 on the stock market today.The stock previously broke out with a 23% pop after OPEC announced its production agreement on Nov. 30, but drifted lower amid doubts that it can actually be implemented.Diamondback Energy (FANG) surged to 113.16 intraday, easily topping its 106.94 entry point, but settled off 1% at 104.99. Diamondback shot up 13% on Nov. 30 that initially put it in buy zone.Concho Resources (CXO) fell 1.1% to 140.84 after initially rising to 147.55, breaking out from its 143.70 buy point. Unlike Continental and Diamondback, Concho never quite made it into buy zone earlier, despite a 12% post-OPEC run-up.Parsley Energy (PE) and Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) held onto fractional gains, but below entry levels reached early Monday.Parsley was up 0.85% at 36.63, still less than a dollar below its 37.30 entry point, after rising as high as 38.18. Pioneer rose 1% to 188.96, back below its 193.49 buy point, pulling back from an intraday high of 195.Diamondback, Parsley, Pioneer and Concho are also big players in the Permian Basin, which has seen a spike in drilling activity as its low-cost reserves allow producers to extract oil profitably, even with prices still well below 2014 highs.RELATED:'NOPEC' Deal Could Send Oil To $60 By January, But Can It Be Enforced?Oil Soars Nearly 5% On Non-OPEC Deal, Saudi SurpriseSaudis Signal 'Shock And Awe' After Russia, Non-OPEC Nations Pledge Output CutsGeneral Electric, IBM Among 4 Megacap Stocks In Buy Range

77,CXO,"Stocks held on to decent gains with an hour left in Thursday's session. The major indexes continue to show impressive strength following Wednesday's all-around sharp advance.Meanwhile, a flotilla of oil and gas exploration stocks are testing recent buy points, illustrating the inherent volatility of the sector as well as the uncertain future for crude oil prices. They included the names Diamondback Energy (FANG), Continental Resources (CLR), Concho Resources (CXO) and Callon Petroleum (CPE).WTI near-term crude prices gained more than 2% to $50.80 a barrel. January-contract natural gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 2.4%.The Russell 2000 led the way, rising more than 1%, more than twice the nearly 0.4% gain for the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average. The Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 rallied less than 0.2%. Volume was running mildly higher on the NYSE and sharply higher on the Nasdaq.In the stock market today, equities got a boost partly due to another rally in European bourses following the ECB's decision to reduce its bond buying program. However, Europe's central bank chief Mario Draghi pledged new economy-boosting monetary measures in the new year.Germany's DAX rose nearly 1.9% while the CAC 40 of France rallied nearly 0.9%. Spain's IBEX 35 gained almost 2.1%.Back to U.S. stocks, Diamondback Energy was on pace to snap a four-session losing streak, rising 1.4% to 106.90 in thin volume. The action left the midcap oil and gas play almost right at its 106.94 buy point within a six-week cup base. The 17% decline within the cup was shallow, and the stock held above its 200-day moving average, a good sign.A cup base must be a minimum six weeks in length, while cup-with-handle patterns should be at least seven weeks long.As seen in its daily chart action over the past six to seven months, Diamondback has shown a tendency to retreat back into its base following a breakout, such as its August move past a 96.11 conventional entry. Thus, one may employ a tighter strategy of wins and losses by taking gains at 10% to 15% while cutting losses at 3% to 5%.Continental Resources, down 2.8% to 54.99, is hovering at the top of a nearly eight-week cup base that features a 55.17 entry. The Oklahoma-based domestic producer shows a relative strength line that continues to hit higher highs and higher lows, signaling outperformance vs. the S&P 500.Continental's Relative Price Strength Rating of 96 is just shy of the maximum 99 and means the stock is exceeding 96% of all companies in IBD's database in 3-month and 12-month combined relative price performance.Concho has traded sideways for several days and is just below a 142.70 entry; Callon, up 1% to 16.97, stands 3% above a 16.46 cup buy point.Elsewhere in the stock market today, fiber-optic telecom gear play Finisar (FNSR) barreled 3.7% higher to 33.43, rising more than 5% past a 31.52 flat-base buy point. The 5% buy zone extends up to 33.10.During a three-day pullback that began last week, volume accelerated and yet the stock held above its rising 50-day line, a sign of resilience. Plus, according to IBD Stock Checkup, Finisar's up/down volume ratio remains positive at 1.2. Earnings are due after the close. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) slid more than 10% to 56.07 and cut sharply through its 50-day line, a sell signal, following reports that the Chinese government is imposing a limit on ATM cash withdrawals on Macau, the only place in China where gambling is legal.Las Vegas rallied past a 53.10 cup with handle buy point on Sept. 1 and gained as much as  19.3%, just shy of the 20%-25% profit-taking sell rule.RELATED:The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull MarketThe Big Picture: Are More Blue Chip Names Breaking Out?Know This Sell Rule: Why You Should Take Most Profits At 20%-25%

79,CXO,"U.S. oil prices finished at the highest level in 15 months Wednesday, lifting shares in the energy sector and setting up buying opportunities for some shale stocks.West Texas Intermediate rose 2.6% to settle at $51.60 a barrel, and Brent futures added 1.9% to end at $52.67.U.S. oil has hit resistance at $50 earlier this year as investors feared prices at that level would induce more production and perpetuate the global supply glut. But markets are upbeat on hopes that OPEC and key non-OPEC oil-producing countries will soon agree to cut output.Also adding to oil's momentum Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported domestic oil stockpiles dropped by 5.2 million barrels last week. Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said inventories fell by 3.8 million barrels. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting an increase of 2.7 million barrels.Shares of EOG Resources (EOG) rose 2.1% to end at 95.06 on the stock market today, after testing support at their 50-day average, to present a secondary entry point after a breakout in August.Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) climbed 2.7% to 189.03, also signaling a buying opportunity after an August breakout and rebound off its 50-day line.Concho Resources (CXO) rose 2.1% to 139.47, re-entering buy range after breaking out earlier this month.Meanwhile, integrated oil major BP (BP) edged up 0.2% to 36.05, closing in on a 36.93 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. Global peers Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), however, are still making their ways though bases.IBD'S TAKE: As oil prices rise more IPOs are coming from the oil patch. Extraction Oil & Gas became the first exploration and production company to go public in two years and rallied in its trading debut last week.OPEC could formalize an agreement to trim out at its meeting next month. At the Oil & Money conference in London Wednesday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih asked non-OPEC producers to help stabilize the market along with OPEC members.""Market forces are clearly working after a testing period of sub-$30 oil prices ... .

80,CXO,"This week, Extraction Oil & Gas (XOG) will become the first exploration and production company go public in two years, while a solar company and an oilfield service provider will also debut along with a cellular network products maker.Extraction is the largest initial public offering of the four, looking to raise $550 million from 33.3 million shares at a price range of 15-18. It will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker XOG, and is scheduled to begin trading Wednesday after pricing tonight.Independence Contract Drilling (ICD) was the last E&P companies to go public, back in August 2014. Centennial Resource Production, an independent E&P in the Southern Delaware Basin, filed for a $100 million IPO in July but was then bought out by Silver Run Acquisition Corporation (SRAQ).Extraction is based in Denver with operations in the Denver-Julesburg Basin.The IPO comes as oil prices hover near year highs after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut production last month.Noble Midstream Partners (NBLX), a pipeline/transit master limited partnership formed by Noble Energy (NBL), also operates in the same basin and last month became the first energy IPO of the year.Oilfield services provider Mammoth Energy Services is looking to raise $128 million, offering 7.75 million shares at a price range of 15-18. It will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker TUSK, debuting Friday.Mammoth operates in the Utica Shale and Permian Basin. The Permian in west Texas and southeastern New Mexico is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil. Shale exploration and production companies like Diamondback Energy (FANG), Concho Resources (CXO) and Parsley Energy (PE) have focused their spending on resources in that play.IBD's TAKE: While the number of IPO filings have been down this year, there have been plenty of winners in recent months including Acacia Communications and Twilio. Azure Power Global, an Indian low-cost solar power producer, plans to raise $75 million by offering 3.4 million shares, lowered from 6.8 million, at a price range of 21-23. It will list on the NYSE under the ticker AZRE, trading Wednesday.Full Spectrum, which develops and sells products used to create private cellular networks, plans to raise $15 million by offering 1.875 million shares at 7-9 per share.

81,CXO,"U.S. stocks stumbled Monday ahead of the first presidential debate, closing near session lows as oil prices rose and banking issues fell.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all shed about 0.9%. Conservative investments did somewhat better with the Dow Jones Utility Average inched down 0.25%.Volume in the stock market today was running lower on both major exchanges as the major indexes headed toward their third session in a row of declining volume.The stock market faces two uncertainties that might be encouraging fund managers to stand back.The presidential debate between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton is scheduled for 9 p.m. ET. Any surprises at the two-candidate debate could move the market one way or another. Polls show both candidates are intensely disliked. Their populist impulses have left Libertarian Gary Johnson positioned to grab potentially the biggest third party vote since 1996, when businessman Ross Perot was also excluded from the debates but got 8% of the vote. And Green Party candidate Jill Stein threatens to roil conditions further.Why should candidates with little chance of winning matter to investors? A strong third party vote can create uncertainty in otherwise safe states, complicating the electoral college outlook for the major parties. And the stock market hates uncertainty.Economic data also could shake the Street. The final take on second quarter GDP is expected to be released Thursday before the market's open. The Street expects GDP to come in at 1.3% vs. the prior readings of 1.1% and 1.2%. The range of estimates for the final number run from 1.1% to 1.5%, according to Econoday. The GDP number could affect the outlook on interest rates.IBD'S TAKE: Doubts surrounding both the presidential campaign and the final GDP figure are keeping some money on the sidelines.Meanwhile, the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil settled at $45.93 Monday, up $1.45, or 3.3%. Oil prices and oil stocks rose as top producers offered concessions to cap output ahead of an informal meeting in Algiers on Wednesday.U.S. oil and gas explorer stocks led the day's big gainers. Texas-based Concho Resources (CXO) popped 1.2% in weak volume as the big cap tried to retake its 50-day line.

82,CXO,"In the oil business, not all shale plays are created equal.The Permian Basin has seen production rates fall less than in other basins in the U.S. during the current downturn thanks to its exceptional geology. Diamondback Energy (FANG), an exploration and production company, is dominating prime acreage in the lucrative basin.""I would say their balance sheet is one of the strongest in the E&P sector after several major acquisitions in recent years,"" Dave Meats, a senior analyst at Morningstar, said of Midland, Texas-based Diamondback.Diamondback's most recent acquisition was in July for $560 million worth of assets in the southern portion of the Permian. It also announced an offering of 5.5 million shares to help finance the deal.""(Management) was very conservative and carried out acquisitions with equity offerings,"" Meats said. ""They will have no trouble when they want to tap into equity markets again. But the downside is that serially issuing equity can potentially lead to dilution.""Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, said he liked Diamondback's chart and that the company will more than make up in revenue gains from the play to compensate for the large investment in the coming years.""What sets them from their peers is that they have a good balance sheet and good cash flow,"" Flynn said. ""Unlike some of the smaller players in the basin that took a big hit (when oil prices fell), Diamondback weathered the storm and is in a better position to take advantage of prices coming back.""The Permian in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil. Shale exploration and production companies like Diamondback, Concho Resources (CXO) and Parsley Energy (PE) have focused their spending on resources in the play.Multiple horizontal layers of deposits make the Permian more geologically desirable than other U.S. plays like the Bakken Basin in North Dakota. At Permian, producers can use a single production pad to drill down to different deposits in each layer.Diamondback has large holdings in several of the basin's formations for a total of 84,683 acres. Diamondback's total estimated proven reserves were 156.9 million barrels of crude oil equivalent as of the end of last year.In July, Diamondback raised its full-year production guidance to 38,000 to 40,000 barrels a day from an earlier outlook of 34,000 to 38,000 barrels on increased activity in the second quarter in the Permian region. Earlier the company raised its 2016 capital spending guidance to $350 million to $425 million on increased activity.""They decided to locate themselves smartly in the sweet spot of the basin,"" Meats said of Diamondback's acreage.In its September update Monday, the Energy Information Agency said production from the Permian will rise by 22,000 barrels a day this month to reach 1.999 million barrels a day in October. Production is seen falling in all other regions, including the Bakken and Eagle Ford basins.IBD'S TAKE: Diamondback shares broke out in mid-August and pumped up to a new high of 98.94 earlier this month before retreating amid concerns on oil prices. It is just one of many players in the Permian. Find other winners in the formation with this recent IBD Industry Snapshot. Diamondback Chief Executive Travis Stice said in the company's second-quarter conference call that the company expects to complete its backlog of 20 drilled but uncompleted wells by the end of the year.Drilling accounts for 40% of a new well's cost, while completion accounts for 60%, so exploration and production companies have drilled wells but waited to complete them as oil prices stayed below $45 per barrel. But oil prices have rebounded near $50 and companies are ready to start completing wells.After retreating for several days over oil-price concerns, Diamondback shares on Thursday rose 1.5%, then dipped 0.2% on Friday and ended Monday trades down 0.5%.But the market has already priced in Diamondback's prime Permian assets, and Meats warns that investors shouldn't expect to see a big upside if oil prices rise.""The only thing I would say is the market is pretty much aware of that, so the company is trading at very lofty multiples,"" he said. ""It's not a cheap stock, but a quality one.""Like other energy companies, Diamondback's major downside is its exposure to oil prices.In its July report, the International Energy Agency said that lower-than-expected demand growth out of China and concerns about the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union could put the oil market balance expected next year in jeopardy.But if oil prices fall, ""the strength of its balance sheet is a boon, and creates a cushioning layer,"" Meats said of Diamondback.Many analysts, including Flynn, are still upbeat that oil markets will balance in the coming year.""If you're doom and gloom on oil prices, you don't want to be long on this company because it's already had a good run,"" Flynn said. ""But if you're optimistic, this stock is something to keep in your back pocket.""RELATED: Who Will Win The Permian's Latest Bidding War?Apache To Spend Over A Fourth Of Budget On 'Immense' Permian PlayPermian-Focused Parsely, Laredo Benefit From Low-Cost Shale Center

83,CXO,"EOG Resources (EOG), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and other shale companies have been making headlines with acquisitions in the Permian Basin, but Chevron (CVX) has an advantage over them in the prolific formation and may soon inject billions of dollars there.The integrated oil major says it is already the Permian's largest net acreage holder, with about 2 million net acres, and is among the top producers there.Chevron is boosting its spending on unconventional plays, mostly in the Permian, and could double its outlays in the Permian to $3 billion by 2020, depending on the price of crude, said Brendan Warn, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, in a note released Monday.He added that Chevron ""has some advantageous acreage in the Permian due to its legacy position and low royalty structure"" in the region vs. smaller exploration and production companies like Diamondback, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Concho Resources (CXO).Chevron shares fell 2.8% to close at 99.43 on the stock market today, though BMO started Chevron with an outperform rating and 120 price target. Shares are consolidating in a first stage flat base with a buy point of 107.68.Concho shares plunged 4.8% to 124.52, undercutting its 50-day line.

EOG shares fell 2.8% to 90.40, currently in buy range after breaking out of a flat base with a 86.97 buy point.Oil futures fell Tuesday as the International Energy Agency cut its 2016 global demand outlook.IBD'S TAKE: Chevron has the largest net acreage in the Permian, according to the oil major, but smaller E&P companies also have major holdings in the prolific basin. Read more about stock winners in the Permian in a recent Industry Snapshot.Last week, EOG Resources  announced it would purchase privately held Yates Petroleum for $2.5 billion and will receive 574,000 acres in the lucrative basin, doubling its position in the Delaware Basin portion of the play.Parsley announced last month it would pay $400 million to expand its drilling rights by nearly 12,000 acres in the Permian, and Concho expanded its Permian holdings by 40,000 acres another deal.On Monday, the Energy Information Agency said that production from the Permian will rise by 22,000 barrels per day this month to reach 1.999 million barrels per day in October.RELATED: Oil Falls As IEA Cuts 2016 Demand Forecast; U.S. Crude Below $45Permian-Focused Parsely, Laredo Benefit From Low-Cost Shale CenterWhy Oil Stockpiles May Shoot Back Up After Massive Drop

85,CXO,"Oil rose modestly Tuesday, extending a recent advance Tuesday despite mixed U.S. economic data and reports that Iran might not join OPEC members in production-freeze talks next month.The Labor Department said its consumer price index was flat, the weakest reading since February, though the result was largely due to cheaper gasoline. Housing starts and industrial production data were surprisingly strong, however.U.S. crude futures rose 1.8% to settle at $46.58 a barrel, the highest close since July 6. Brent also climbed 1.8%, to $49.23 a barrel. But crude gave up some ground late Tuesday after the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprise increase in gasoline inventory last week of 2.2 million barrels, though the crude stockpile dropped by 1 million barrels. Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts saw a gasoline decline of 1.8 million barrels and a crude drop of 200,000 barrels.Also affecting oil Tuesday were reports Iran might not join in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' informal talks on the sidelines of a forum in Algeria in September, at which a production freeze could be on the table.A spokeswoman said that Iran hadn't made a decision on joining the meeting but added that the country doesn't expect to hit the production levels yet that it wants to reach before it would agree on a freeze.Iran was the major stumbling block to an agreement in April to freeze production at January levels. Iran's production in January remained well below historic levels, as sanctions over its nuclear program had only just been lifted.Russia could also be an issue this time around. Energy Minister Alexander Novak said he didn't see a reason for renewing talks.Among energy shares, Exxon Mobil (XOM) edged up 0.1% in the stock market today. BP (BP) shares rose 1%, just above its 50-day line, and Chevron (CVX) dipped 0.15%, just below its 50-day. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) slipped 0.1%.U.S. exploration and production company Concho Resources (CXO) said late Monday that it was paying $1.625 billion to purchase 40,000 acres in the Midland Basin in Texas, part of the Permian Shale from privately held Reliance Energy.IBD'S TAKE: Concho and EOG are among shale E&P companies that are in buy range as oil prices rise further back above $40 per barrel. Oil majors aren't faring as well. Concho will use $1.1 billion in cash and $500 million in stock to pay for the assets.Concho shares fell 3.6% to 131.50 after hitting a 15-month high on Monday, but they remained above a 130.13 buy point.The company also raised its 2016 production outlook to be up 1% to 3% from 2015 levels.Meanwhile, Parsely Energy (PE) will pay $400 million for 11,672 acres in the Midlands.Shares of Concho fell 3.4%, and Parsely Energy lost 2.4%.

87,CXO,"You can learn a lot about a stock mutual fund manager's investment approach by scanning how much of a fund's assets he puts into each sector. Those extra bets point to where the manager thinks he'll find stocks that can outperform the stock market.Take the $7.6 billion American Century Growth Fund (TWCGX). The fund's 5.02% return this year going into Thursday topped 73% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. They averaged 3.42%, while the S&P 500 was up 8.29%. The fund's 3.28% average annual gain over the past 12 months beat 83% of its peers, which averaged 0.37%. The big-cap bogey gained 6.14%.Solid returns stem from stock selection rather than sector bets, managers Gregory Woodhams and Justin Brown tell shareholders in their quarterly commentary.The fund's sector overweights are fairly modest, but they still show where the managers are looking for individual companies with strong prospects.Their largest outsized bets vs. the fund's benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index, were in information technology and energy, overweight by 2.78 and 1.29 percentage points, respectively, as of June 30, according to American Century.So far this year, the fund's energy stocks, Concho Resources (CXO) and Halliburton (HAL), are up 43% and 32%, respectively. Their weak IBD Composite Ratings of 51 and 32 and weak SMR Ratings of E and D reflect the effects on earnings of a long descent for oil prices over the past two years. But crude oil appears to have bottomed in the February and has rallied anew in the past three weeks. Both stocks are near 52-week highs, with improving Relative Strength lines.The fund's tech names carry higher ratings. They include top-10 holdings like Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN).Alphabet is up 4% this year. Earnings per share have climbed between 17% and 28% for five straight quarters. Trading around 806, shares are extended past a double-bottom basing pattern.Alphabet stock has a Composite Rating of 98. Earnings grew at a 14% average annual rate over the past five years.Facebook is up 19% so far this year. Trading around 124, shares are in a buy range from a 121.18 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: Like Amazon, Facebook is on IBD's Leaderboard of highly rated stocks with the potential to move higher.Facebook's EPS growth sped up over the past four quarters. Earnings grew 16%, 33%, 46%, 83% and 94% over the respective past five stanzas.Still, Facebook faces challenges. The social media mammoth is reportedly blocking ad blockers on its desktop site. Ad blockers can hurt ad revenue for digital publishers such as Facebook.Facebook also says it is cracking down on click-bait headlines, IBD's Bill Peters reported. Facebook stock slipped on the news. But by banishing click bait, the social media conglomerate aims to improve its users' experience, which should boost advertising in the long run.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Elaine Low reports that Facebook has nearly doubled its daily active user base over the last four years, hitting an average of 1.13 billion DAUs in June 2016 vs. 552 million in June 2012. Mobile monthly active users have nearly tripled.TJX Cos. (TJX) is up 10% so far this year. Trading around 78, it's sunk back into a basing area after issuing a disappointing outlook for Q3 earnings results.The company -- which is the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods -- is the largest off-price apparel and home goods retailer in the U.S. On Tuesday, shares slid as the company forecast third-quarter profit will be below the expectations of industry analysts. The company blamed wage increases and a strong dollar, which hurt revenue from outside the U.S.TJX raised its profit forecast for the year ending January 2017, but that was also short of expectations.Shares of United Rentals (URI) are up 7% this year. EPS grew 0%, 4% and 6% in the past respective three quarters. Sales were down in two of those frames and flat in the third.The stock has a strong 88 Composite Rating.Shares gapped up 9% on July 21 when the company reported Q2 results.

90,CXO,"The oil and gas industry will cut $1 trillion from exploration and development spending in the next several years, according to analysts at Wood Mackenzie, while fresh data Wednesday pointed to a continued retreat by U.S. producers.Investment spending is seen down $740 billion, or 22%, in 2015 to 2020, compared to previous expectations before the oil crash, and $300 billion is expected to be cut from exploration spending. Exxon Mobil (XOM) plans to cut 2016 capital expenditures by 25%. Chevron (CVX) plans to spend $26.6 billion this year but just $17 billion-$22 billion a year in 2017 and 2018.The deepest cuts are in the U.S., the report said, with capital spending down 50% this year. Shale company Continental Resources (CLR) said 2016 capital spending will be down 66% from 2015. Concho Resources (CXO) sees 2016 capital spending of $1.1 billion-$1.3 billion vs. $1.8 billion in 2015.Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude production fell 0.3% last week to 8.716 million barrels of oil per day after rising the week before.Stockpiles fell by 993,000, falling short of expectations for a decline of 1.4 million barrels, but below the American Petroleum Institute's estimate late Tuesday that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.2 million barrels.U.S. crude futures fell 1%, to settle at $48.01 a barrel. Brent crude futures dropped 1.7% to $48.97 a barrel.Continental shares closed down 0.2% on the stock market today. Concho dipped 0.2%. Exxon lost 0.3% and Chevron fell 0.6%.Despite the deep investment cuts, Wood Mackenzie estimates global production will be 3% lower than previous forecasts. Thanks to new technology and other innovations, costs in unconventional drilling were on average 25% lower than in 2014.But one country that Wood Mackenzie doesn't see making any investment cuts this year or next is Saudi Arabia, as the world's largest crude producer wants to keep pumping to secure market share.

91,CXO,"Baidu (BIDU) suffered a ratings downgrade Monday, while U.S. oil producer Concho Resources (CXO) was upgraded, and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) had its price target cut.The Chinese search giant Baidu was downgraded by Citi to neutral with a 180 price target.Last week, Baidu was among three China-based companies -- along with Tencent (TCEHY) and JD.com (JD) -- to each invest $50 million in Chinese car site Bitauto (BITA).Baidu shares lost 0.4% to 163.55 on the stock market today.Chipotle's price target was cut to 340 from 260 by Deutsche Bank, which said in a note that some customers ""may be lost for good"" following the E. coli outbreak last year.Moe's Southwest Grill beat out Chipotle as the most popular Mexican-style restaurant brand, according to a Harris Poll last week.Chipotle shares dropped intraday to their lowest level since August 2013, and fell 2.8% to 394.Concho Resources was upgraded to overweight by Morgan Stanley. The analysts also downgraded Occidental Petroleum (OXY) to equal-weight.Concho shares ticked down 0.1% to 119.67, while Occidental dipped 0.3% to 75.25.U.S. Silica Holdings (SLCA) was downgraded to neutral by D.A. Davidson. Shale companies like Continental Resources (CLR) have been using more sand to extract more oil, as the drop in prices has forced them to make wells more productive via enhanced completion techniques.U.S. Silica shares lost 3.9% to 32.26.
"
92,CXO,"Continental Resources (CLR), Concho Resources (CXO), Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) and Noble Energy (NBL) raised their production targets Wednesday as costs came down further, but a broader rebound in drilling activity isn't likely until oil prices hit $50.Continental now sees full-year average production of 205,000-215,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, up from its prior outlook of 200,000, citing strong Q1 performance. But that is still down from 2015 average output of 221,715.""The resilience of our production has allowed us to increase our production guidance for 2016 without increasing capex,"" said CEO Harold Hamm. ""This reflects the quality of our assets and the success of our enhanced completion technology.""Continental also brought online a net 10 wells that had been drilled and completed in 2015, but not actively produced until Q1.Shares rose 2% after hours.Concho sees 2016 production to be flat, up from an earlier outlook for a 5% drop to no change. Carrizo increased the low end of its full-year crude production growth target by 9% to 24,800-25,300 barrels per day, up from a prior outlook of 24,700-25,300 barrels per day. But that is still down from Q1 production of 25,806 barrels per day, up 21%, and 2015 output of 36,719 barrels.“Well-cost expectations in the Eagle Ford are now down to $4.1 million from $4.6 million previously,” said Carrizo CEO Chip Johnson in the earnings release. “This has allowed us to increase our activity in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford Shale without increasing our planned capex for the year.”Noble, meanwhile, raised its 2016 sales volume target to 405,000 barrels a day from a prior outlook of 390,000 barrels, which was essentially flat vs. 2015 after adjusting for the Rosetta acquisition.The company said total well costs fell 35% in Q1 in the Wells Ranch portion of the DJ Basin in Colorado.Jason Wangler, a managing director at Wunderlich, said that most companies gave low production guidance in Q4 in the hopes of beating it.“They kind of put out numbers that if you looked at the forecasts you thought this production is really going to fall off a cliff,"" he said. ""They did this under the belief that they’ll put out a low number to start and hopefully top that and just take one beating instead of four or five in a row.”Other companies haven't signaled an increase drilling activity. Diamondback Energy (FANG) said it wasn’t going to remove a rig it had scheduled for removal. Sanchez Energy (SN) has said it was running two rigs but cut it to one rig in Q2. Pioneer Resources (PXD) said last week it would add five to ten drilling rigs when oil hits $50.Wangler believes that companies won’t increase activity, including finishing drilled but uncompleted (DUCs) wells, until oil hits $50-$55 per barrel.Mark Hanson, an equity analyst at Morningstar agrees. “On the whole prices just haven’t risen to levels that would incentivize E&Ps to ramp up production.”He thinks U.S. crude would have to be at $50 for at least two quarters before companies would even think about boosting production not just seeing a short-term rise from an event like an OPEC meeting or supply disruption due to violence in the Middle East.Meanwhile, shale producers continued to see falling revenue in Q1.Continental’s Q1 adjusted per-share loss widened to 41 cents from 9 cents a year ago. Analysts were expecting a 37-cent per-share loss. Revenue from crude oil and natgas sales fell 30.7% to $403.6 million, below views of $441.22 million.Concho swung to an adjust loss of 5 cents a share, missing views for a break-even quarter, as revenue sank 31% to $283.6 million.Carizzo's adjusted Q1 earnings rose 14.3% to 16 cents per share, above the 13 cents Wall Street analysts were expecting. Revenue fell 11.2% to $132.4 million, under views for $123.4 million.Shares closed down 1.2%  in the stock market today. Oil gave up gains following the Energy Information Administration’s report that crude stockpiles climbed by 2.8 million barrels last week, above views for a 1.7 million barrel increase, though production fell 1.3% to 8.825 million barrels per day.Noble swung to a loss of 53 cents per share in Q1 vs. a year earlier, but it beat analysts’ views of a 57-cent per-share loss. Revenue fell 4.6% to $724 million, falling short of views for $784.5 million.Capital expenditures were $374 million, below the company’s expectation, and it sees full-year capex under its original $1.5 billion estimate.“Significant capital efficiency gains and outstanding operating performance, combined with robust liquidity, position us well in any price scenario,” CEO David Stover said in the earnings release.Noble shares rose 1.1%.Late Monday, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) said that its adjusted Q1 loss deepened to $1.12 a share, but that beat views for a loss of $1.16. Anadarko’s revenue sank 28% to $1.67 billion, below views of $1.81 billion. But sales volumes in the Delaware Basin of west Texas rose by 47%. In the DJ Basin of northeastern Colorado, sales rose 11%.

93,CXO,"Top shale oil producers like Continental Resources (CLR) and EOG Resources (EOG) are on tap to report quarterly results this week and could give an update on when drilling might start again after crude prices jumped 20% last month.U.S. oil prices are nearing the break-even level of $45 to $55 per barrel, when some producers could start bringing wells online.Some producers may have even started pumping when oil hit $40 per barrel. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Sanchez Energy (SN), which are active in Texas, already reported results in April. Pioneer boosted its 2016 production growth outlook to 12% from an earlier outlook of 10%, helped in part by increased output from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp zones.Sanchez reported a 25% rise in first-quarter production to 56,500 barrels of oil per day, above its 48,000-52,000 guidance, on better-than-expected results in the Eagle Ford’s western Catarina region. The producer brought 11 new wells online in the area.Late Monday, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) reported that its adjusted Q1 loss deepened to $1.12 a share, beating views for a loss of $1.16, while revenue sank 28% to $1.67 billion, below views of $1.81 billion. But in the Delaware Basin of west Texas, Anadarko grew sales volumes by 47%. In the DJ Basin of northeast Colorado, sales rose 11%.Despite the recent sharp rally in oil prices, some shale companies may wait and see how sustainable the upswing really is. EOG Resources  Chairman Bill Thomas said at an industry conference in March that his company won’t rush to boost output right after oil hits $60 a barrel.Producers also have to wait for capital markets to reopen and for workers and rigs to come back. Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, has said it could take nine months to a year before production ramps up again.Market headwinds also remain.

95,CXO,"Stock markets struggled for a second straight week as Apple (AAPL) tumbled to a two-year closing low. Tesla Motors (TSLA) stock skidded as skeptics doubted production plans, Under Armour (UA) lost key execs, while shale producers topped low-ball output targets, and Alibaba (BABA) reported strong revenue growth.With the market uptrend already under pressure, stocks continued to slide. The Nasdaq lost 0.8%, dropping below its 50-day moving average after undercutting its 200-day line in the prior week. Apple fell to the lowest since mid-2014, and Tesla Motors tumbled. But Facebook (FB) held on to the prior week's big earnings-related gain. The S&P 500 fell 0.4% for the week, but on Friday found support at the 50-day moving average after briefly undercutting that key area for the first time in two months.The U.S. economy added just 160,000 in April, the smallest gain in seven months. Earlier in the week, ISM's manufacturing index signaled activity barely increased last month, while productivity fell for a second straight quarter. Those headline figures suggested the U.S. is resolving the contradiction -- solid labor market gains but sputtering economic growth -- in favor of weaker hiring. But wage gains accelerated, and the workweek picked up.The week's economic data reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will not raise rates at its June meeting.The luxury electric carmaker’s 57-cent Q1 loss was a penny smaller than estimates, while its 70% surge in revenue to $1.6 billion met views. Tesla bumped up its 500,000 unit build plan by two years to 2018, due to Model 3 demand.The stock dropped 5% on Thursday, as analysts said the projection is too optimistic. For the week, Tesla sank 10.8%, falling below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Tesla partner Mobileye (MBLY) said Q1 adjusted EPS jumped 88% to 15 cents on a 65% hike in revenue to $75.2 million. Both beat expectations but marked a second straight quarter of decelerating growth. The maker of advanced driver assistance systems is working with big-name automakers on their self-driving technology. Mobileye shares fell 8.3% for the week.Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), which is a Tesla supplier, is due to report earnings next week.Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) confirmed a self-driving technology alliance, with Alphabet buying 100 plug-in hybrid minivans from the automaker to more than double its fleet of test vehicles. It is still yet to be determined who will have the first fully autonomous car ready for the consumer market and when regulators will approve their use.General Motors (GM) and ride-hailing service Lyft also plan to test self-driving electric Chevy Bolt taxis on public roads within a year, the Wall Street Journal reported.Shares of the popular athletic apparel maker tumbled nearly 12% for the week, past their 50-day moving average, as Under Armour announced the July departures of its chief merchandising officer and chief digital officer. The exits prompted a downgrade to hold from buy from Brean Capital, which nevertheless remains positive on the stock's long-term outlook. Meanwhile, comeback kid Adidas reported 22% currency-neutral sales growth in North America.Alleviating worries of a slowdown amid a lethargic local economy, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth reported a view-topping 39% Q4 sales leap to $3.75 billion -- the highest growth rate in four quarters. EPS jumped 88% to 33 cents excluding various items, but that fell short. Now Alibaba is gunning for $1 trillion in gross merchandise volume in about four years. Alibaba shares rose 2.9% for the week.

Netflix (NFLX) says it’ll stick to its business model. Apple’s negotiations with TV broadcasters have stalled but could be rekindled. Amazon.com (AMZN) also figures to be a player at some point.Continental Resources (CLR), Concho Resources (CXO), Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) and Noble Energy (NBL) raised their 2016 production targets as costs came down in Q1. But shale firms are hesitant to resume drilling until prices hit at least $50 for a sustained period of time, and not just a uptick from OPEC meetings or supply disruptions from the Middle East. ""It will be some time before we think about bringing on more rigs,"" Continental CEO Harold Hamm said on the company's conference call. Even as crude prices rebound, E&Ps will be looking to first use cash flow for capital spending and to reduce debt, then complete drilled-but-uncompleted wells (DUCs), before considering drilling again.Oil prices finished the week near $45 a barrel.After missing analyst estimates in March, the Big Three U.S. automakers -- GM, Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler -- showed only marginal improvement in April U.S. sales, seeming to confirm predictions by some analysts and industry executives that domestic demand could plateau this year. GM sales fell 3.5% vs. April 2015 to 259,447, in large part due to a drop in low-margin sales to rental fleets. Ford sales rose 4% to 231,316, but both GM and Ford were below forecasts. Fiat Chrysler rose 6% to 199,631 units, beating Edmunds.com’s 5% estimate.Meanwhile, Ford sales in China fell 11% in April, while GM’s sales there rose 7.5%, partly on a 13% pop in Cadillac sales.GM shares fell 2.6%, Ford 0.9% and Fiat Chrysler 4.6% for the week, trading near their 50-day lines.Gunmaker Sturm Ruger (RGR) on Monday handily beat first-quarter forecasts and boosted its quarterly dividend by 37%, following similarly strong results in March from rival Smith & Wesson (SWHC).Both companies have benefited from an increasingly diverse crowd of shooting enthusiasts. Regulatory concerns and widening fears following mass shootings like those in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Europe have also made guns more popular in the U.S.On Wednesday, the FBI reported 2,145,865 NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) firearm background checks for the month of April. That’s the best April on record for the system but lower than recent months, in keeping with similar patterns in previous years. The background checks are used as an indicator of gun demand, and stocks of both companies have been sensitive over the years to signs of demand topping out.Sturm Ruger rallied 5.5% Monday ahead of results and climbed 1.5% on Tuesday, but the stock found resistance at the 50-day line and ended the week up 2.6%. Smith & Wesson also wrapped the week with pared gains.

97,CXO,"Continental Resources (CLR), a top producer in the Bakken shale formation, said Wednesday it has ceased fracking operations there amid the continued slump in oil prices.The bellwether shale company had already planned to defer most Bakken completions in 2016. It has four operated drilling rigs in the North Dakota Bakken with plans to maintain that level through the year.But Continental said it currently has ""no stimulation crews deployed in the Bakken.""Shares were up 2% in after-hours trading in the stock market today.Continental posted an adjusted net loss of 23 cents per share in Q4, down from a profit of $1.14 per share a year ago. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting a loss of 21 cents per share. Revenue sank 55.6% to $575.5 million, above views for $568.2 million.But Continental was bullish on acreage in its STACK play in Oklahoma, and expects an average estimated ultimate recovery of 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per well.""Our overpressured Meramec wells in STACK are delivering some of the highest returns in the Company,"" said COO Jack Stark in a statement. ""We clearly have another high impact, long-term platform for growth underlying our 155,000 net acres of leasehold in STACK.""The company plans to average four-to-five operated drilling rigs in the STACK play in 2016.Last month, Continental guided 2016 capital spending to $920 million, down 66% from 2015. It also sees production falling during the year on lower drilling and well completion activity.Other shale companies reported Q4 results below estimates late Wednesday and further reduced capital spending plans.Concho Resources (CXO) swung to a Q4 adjusted loss of 7 cents per share from a profit of 88 cents per share a year ago, missing views for a profit of 4 cents a share.

On Wednesday, West Texas Intermediate futures settled at $32.15 a barrel, up 0.9%.Oasis shares jumped 4% after hours.Unlike Exxon Mobil (XOM)  and other integrated oil majors, shale producers don’t have downstream operations that benefit from cheap oil to help cushion profit during price slumps.Earlier this month, Cabot Oil & Gas' (COG) quarterly results swung to a loss and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) posted a better-than-expected loss but cut its spending outlook just a month after offering more bullish guidance.EOG Resources (EOG) reports Thursday.

99,CXO,"Drilling activity has crashed, but efficiencies and American ingenuity have helped make each well far more productive.The number of oil rigs fell by 26 last week to 413, the lowest since December 2009, Baker Hughes (BHI) reported Friday. That's down 19% over the last four weeks and 59.5% vs. a year earlier.But U.S. oil output, though off peak levels, has held up remarkably well. That's in large part because Continental Resources (CLR), Concho Resources (CXO) and other shale producers are becoming, well, more productive with every well. They focused on the best wells, kept the best crews, while employing new technical advances and practices. They've also been able to squeeze suppliers and services firms such as Baker Hughes, Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL).• Bakken Shale new wells should produce 737 barrels per day in March, up from 558 bpd in March 2015. That's a 32% increase -- 88.5% vs. March 2014.• Eagle Ford new wells are expected to generate 812 barrels per day in March, up from 665 bpd a year earlier. That's a 22% jump.• Niobrara new wells should produce 741 barrels per day, up 39% from 533 bpd in March 2015.• Permian Basin new wells should produce a 423 barrels per day, a 49% spike from 284 bpd a year earlier.• Utica new wells should generate 309 barrels per day, a whopping 83% increase from 168 bpd in March 2015.Continental Resources, Concho Resources and other shale firms have been able to concentrate efforts, slashing capital spending and operating costs without a big blow to production. But with oil down to $30 a barrel or lower, these companies are under heavy  strain. Continental and Concho earnings reports are due this week, with the former expected to post a loss and the latter a 96% EPS dive.As for suppliers such as Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, they've cut tens of thousands of jobs.  But those oil services giants should emerge stronger after the oil bust, D.A. Davidson said in research reports last week.Schlumberger stock rose 3.6% last week, Baker Hughes 5.6% and Halliburton 7.8%. (Halliburton is trying to buy Baker Hughes, but faces skeptical antitrust officials.) On Monday, Schlumberger rose 2.1% in the stock market today. Halliburton rose 4.75% and Baker Hughes 3.2%.Meanwhile, Concho Resources advanced 5.9% last week but Continental Resources dived 9.7%. On Monday, Concho climbed 2.9% while Continental spiked 7.1%.

101,CXO,"Saudi Arabia's oil minister quashed hopes for a near-term rally in crude prices Tuesday, ruling out a production cut while also dismissing worries of oversupply and slowing demand.At the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston, Ali al-Naimi said there would be another meeting among top producer countries, possibly in March, to freeze production and ease high inventories.But a production cut ""is not going to happen,"" he said. ""Not many countries are going to deliver, even if they say they would cut production.""Instead, al-Naimi thinks it's “easier to freeze production and let demand rise and some inefficient supplies decline.""Brent fell 4.1% to $33.72 per barrel Tuesday, and U.S. crude lost 4.6% to $31.87. Top oil stocks followed, with Exxon Mobil (XOM) closing down 1.4%, Chevron (CVX) down 4.4%, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) down 4.1% and BP (BP) down 4.3%.James Williams, a WTRG energy economist, said Saudi Arabia could still cut production later, noting the next OPEC meeting in June ""is a good time to start talking about quotas"" and offers three more months of data on declining U.S. output.But he doesn't expect Saudi Arabia to let prices go past $50 per barrel, which would spark new drilling in North America.Omar al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, pointed out that Saudi Arabia and Iran have cut off diplomatic ties with each other, and Russia is engaged in a proxy war in Syria against other OPEC members.""The idea of cutting production is never going to work in the near future,"" he told IBD. ""In order for a cut to work, you need to be able to effectively monitor each other.""Al-Ubaydli sees a drop in production from global oil markets over the next 12 months, as output from older oil fields decreases and new investment slows.""Output will decrease, but not because cartel members are sitting at a table playing with numbers,"" he said.Still, Williams noted, OPEC has survived even when member countries were at war with each other, like Iraq and Kuwait at the beginning of the 1990s.Al-Naimi also said Tuesday that he doesn't have any concerns about demand, which ""remains strong."" Markets, however, have been worried that slowing global economic growth, especially in China, could dampen oil demand.And he appeared to brush off supply fears, saying he welcomes new supplies, including shale oil. The boom in U.S. shale over the past decade has been a major driver of the current oil glut.Al-Naimi's remarks come as Saudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar, Venezuela, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to freeze their production at January levels, but only if countries such as Iraq and Iran also participate.Iraq and Iran have said they support a freeze but won't commit to join in limiting output. On Tuesday, Iran appeared unlikely to participate.Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said the proposal to cap output at January levels puts ""unrealistic demands"" on Iran, according to state-run media. Iran’s production last month remained well below historic levels, as sanctions from the West had just been lifted over its nuclear program.The probability of Iran and Iraq agreeing to a freeze eventually is ""fairly high,"" Williams said, but not until Iran boosts daily production to 4 million barrels a day, roughly its production before the sanctions.Iraq will have a hard time agreeing to terms as its central government doesn't control the oil flows from the Kurdistan region, Al-Ubaydli noted.Speaking to a room of shale firms, al-Naimi added that high-cost producers ""must find a way to lower their costs, borrow cash or liquidate."" Later he said that ""inefficient and uneconomic producers will have to get out.""Unconventional drilling is more expensive than traditional means, but shale producers have been resourceful as oil stays lower for longer. Companies were able to weather the low-price environment in 2015 by slashing costs, payrolls, drilling rigs and capital expenditure budgets. They also used new techniques on their most efficient, productive wells.But gains from drilling innovations, such as using higher sand concentrations and higher proppant volumes, are expected to slow this year, and costs have less room to drop.Top shale firms report Q4 results this week, and the latest news is expected to be grim. Earlier reports pointed to further deterioration. Last week, U.S. shale producer Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) swung to a loss below analyst views, and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) cut its spending outlook just a month after offering more bullish guidance.Continental Resources (CLR), Oasis Petroleum (OAS) and Concho Resources (CXO) are expected to announce results this week.Cabot shares plunged 10.6%.

108,CXO,"Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) raised its full-year production guidance Wednesday for the second straight quarter after reporting third-quarter earnings and revenue above analyst estimates.The shale exploration and production company's Q3 earnings plunged 71% to 20 cents per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting 12 cents. Revenue fell 21.5% to $153.95 million, above views for $146.01 million.Carrizo said quarterly oil production hit a record high of 23,573 barrels per day, 18% above Q3 2014 production levels.Oil companies have scaled back their capital spending this year as oil prices stay lower for longer. Carrizo cut its drilling and competition spending by 35% this year.But improvements in drilling technology and new cost-saving techniques like using different grades of sand proppants, drilling with rigs that easily can be moved on tracks and decreasing the space between wells have boosted production while keeping costs low.Carrizo raised its full-year oil production outlook to 22,850 to 22,950 barrels per day from an earlier outlook of 22,750 to 22,850 barrels per day.Shares dipped 0.6% to close at 39.03 in the stock market today.Continental Resources (CLR), a bellwether in the shale sector, reported a loss of 12 cents per share late Wednesday, in line with analyst expectations.Continental shares fell 3.6% to close at 33.20.

109,CXO,"Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and other oil majors reported huge declines in earnings last week, and top U.S. shale producers are seen reporting equally large drops in earnings this week as oil prices remain under pressure.OPEC has kept output high to hold prices down as it competes with U.S. shale producers, hoping that cheap crude will cool their fracking activity, a more expensive method of producing oil than conventional drilling.So far, the shale industry has been more resilient than expected as it slashed costs, focused on the most productive oil fields and deployed new technology and practices. But those moves might not be enough anymore, and producers may have to follow Big Oil with more spending and job cuts.Questions have also cropped up over how shale firms will maintain cash flow with oil prices still low, banks getting tighter and investors in capital markets turning skittish.Continental Resources (CLR), a bellwether in the shale sector, announces Q3 results Wednesday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Continental to swing to a 12-cent per-share loss from a profit of 81 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue is seen falling 45% to $638 million.Oasis Petroleum (OAS) is also on tap for Wednesday. Analysts expect the company's EPS to sink 88.5% to 6 cents and revenue to decline 35% to $238.7 million.Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) will announce on Wednesday too. The shale firm's EPS is expected to plunge 80.7% to 21 cents, and revenue is seen falling 20% to $560.2 million.Concho Resources (CXO) is slated for Thursday. Analysts see EPS diving 81% to 21 cents and revenue down 20% to $560.2 million.EOG Resources (EOG) also reports Thursday. The firm is expected to post a loss of 12 cents per share vs. an 81-cent per-share profit a year ago. Revenue is expected to decline 45% to $637.9 million.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_GRich.

110,CXO,"While new issues can be volatile, they can turn out to be some of the most profitable. When a hot, new company sells shares of itself to the public, it's tempting to buy right away. But it's often prudent to wait for new issues to form an IPO base first.Many new issues tend to be quite volatile on their first few days or weeks of trading. Don't buy into the early hype, as you may get shaken out easily.Just like other stocks, an IPO needs time to go through a consolidation period. Let it digest gains and let the early enthusiasm settle down to form a base.Unlike most bases that need at least five weeks to develop, IPO bases are different.IPO bases can be shorter. They usually run two to five weeks.Internet kingpin Google (GOOGL), which was a hot new issue in 2004, had an IPO base that spanned 15 trading days. In rare instances, IPO bases can be as short as seven days.Sometimes even less. Fitness tracker maker Fitbit (FIT) had an ultrashort IPO base of only five days.The correction in IPO bases can be shallow. Most of the time they tend to correct less than 20%. This pattern can also be a function of the market. In times of volatility, corrections in IPO bases can be as deep as 50% from the stock's price high.New issues in the areas of Internet and technology tend to experience higher volatility than those in more stable industries. New issues tend to carve out a left-side high within the first 25 days of trading.IPO bases can appear as consolidations, but they can turn out to be more common patterns such as cups, cup with handles, and flat bases.The buy point in an IPO base is the same as in most regular bases, which is 10 cents above the high on the left side of the base. But a handle can offer a lower entry. Other alternative buy points use trend lines. Or a smaller consolidation within a bigger one may produce a lower entry point.Concho Resources (CXO), a Midland, Texas-based oil exploration company, shaped a narrow IPO base shortly after going public in August 2007. The stock wavered to a high of 13.49 on Aug. 14, then consolidated for 13 sessions. The action formed a tight IPO base with a 13.59 buy point. The stock corrected less than 8%.On Sept. 4, the stock reversed higher and blew past the 13.59 entry. Volume on its breakout day was greatly higher than that of the prior session (1). Trading then picked up sharply the next day. Concho rallied 64% by late October before pulling back to its newly formed 50-day line (2).While IBD suggests that volume should be at least 40% above the 50-day average on a breakout, many new issues have yet to trade that long. So you can see how volume is doing compared with recent sessions.Find out more about leading new issues in the IPO Analysis column, which appears Tuesdays and Thursdays.To view a comprehensive course on trading IPOs, check out IBD's newest home study program, ""IPO Trading Strategies.""

""But it hasn't worked.""U.S. crude futures traded below $51 a barrel intraday, closing down 0.4% to $52.33 and off 15% since late June. Prices had surged 40% from March's low, due in part to hopes that China would revive economic growth.In April, China became the world's largest importer of crude as it filled its strategic reserve. But oil imports fell 11% in May, year-over-year, the biggest drop since November 2013.U.S. Shale Adds PressureChina was expected to account for 30% of global oil demand growth this year, according to Tamar Essner, an energy analyst at Nasdaq Advisory Services. But it may not be able to soak up the supply that's flooding out of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Meanwhile, the U.S. oil sector may be rebounding from OPEC's push to keep prices low and protect market share. The domestic rig count rose last week for the first time since December, and shale producers have shown surprising tenacity as they cut costs and focus on their most productive fields.On Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration boosted its outlook on U.S. oil prices to an average of $55.51 a barrel this year, up from an earlier view of $55.35. The EIA also raised its 2015 U.S. production outlook to 9.47 million barrels a day from a prior forecast of 9.43 million.Iran Priced In, Greece Not""We have probably seen a bottom on rig counts,"" Essner said. ""U.S. production isn't going to roll over.""Shares of U.S. shale firms like EOG Resources (EOG), Continental Resources (CLR), Sanchez Energy (SN), Concho Resources (CXO) and Laredo Petroleum (LPI) rallied Tuesday.Greece's effect on oil prices is more secondary, as uncertainty over the euro has investors scrambling for a safe haven in dollars, Essner noted. Because oil contracts are largely denominated in dollars, the currency's appreciation puts downward pressure on crude prices.But the severity of the Greek crisis, like China's stock collapse, wasn't expected by markets and therefore not priced in, said Flynn, adding that the ripple effects of Greece leaving the eurozone are unknown.""Markets were caught by surprise that Greece has gotten to this point,"" he said.The prospect of Iranian oil returning to world markets, however, was priced in, and any nuclear deal that clears the way for oil exports still has to pass political hurdles, like getting congressional approval.""People have a sense that if an Iran deal is done we are going to be flooded with oil,"" Flynn said.

Existing state and local rules will remain in force.

260,CXO,"No single stock screen will be the best in every uptrend. Different uptrends reward different kinds of stocks, and the screens reflect that reality. For example, during the last bear market, the aggressive and growthy complexion of the IBD 50 (then the IBD 100) faded.Stocks making the list on Oct. 27, 2008, included El Paso Electric (EE), Campbell Soup (CPB), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The mention of those equities alone said, ""It's a bear market.""As of early November, the 85-85 screen has been the top-performing screen over the past six months. The 85-85 was up 6.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the IBD 50 1.5%.What can be made of this? There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by CAN SLIM standards .The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

428,CXO,"As you search for winning stocks, don't forget to check out their long-term debt levels.IBD doesn't give a specific debt-to-equity level that means danger. Just keep in mind that lower is better and some other key points that we'll review here.Lower debt levels are better for a simple reason: They're more manageable. A highly leveraged company might end up earning too little to meet its debt obligations due more than one year away, leading to losses and even potential bankruptcy.Remember that you'll see different ratios that can explain a company's debt. You might see a cash flow-to-debt ratio, for example.Be aware that some firms might want to emphasize the ratio that makes them look the best.IBD is generally consistent in looking at just one ratio: the long-term debt to stockholders' equity. One place where you can find this figure is within the Stock Checkup feature at Investors.com, IBD's website.Don't Become FanaticalYou don't want to become fanatical in avoiding companies with sizable debt.Some sectors, like telecom infrastructure and energy, are simply prone to using lots of debt. Some of the market's leading stocks in recent years were far from debt-free, but this didn't hold them back from making big advances.Concho Resources (CXO) is one example. The Midland, Texas-based oil and gas explorer's debt-to-equity ratio stood at 63% at the end of 2009, but the stock still nearly doubled in 2010.TransDigm Group (TDG) provides another example. The Cleveland-based aircraft components maker sported an eye-popping debt-to-equity ratio of 299% at the end of 2010. A major reason: TransDigm is acquisitive. Even so, TransDigm's shares scored a solid gain of 33% in 2011.At the same time, you can't get everything you need from the debt-to-equity ratio.It's also smart to look at a company's regulatory filings to see if it discloses any off-balance-sheet liabilities, which are not incorporated into shareholders' equity. Retailers are known for doing this with store lease obligations. Financial firms are infamous for being creative in this area.Off The Balance SheetYou can see off-balance-sheet liabilities in sectors where you might not expect it. Take Netflix (NFLX), the DVD-rental-by-mail pioneer that's now focusing on its streaming video business.One challenge for the company is the cost of each TV show or movie that it beams over the Internet to a user.As you might expect, the Silicon Valley company has made a number of deals to get this content. What you might not expect is that these deals aren't all accounted for on Netflix's balance sheet as liabilities.With its 10-K filed with the SEC on Feb. 1, Netflix declared $3.2 billion in total liabilities. But deeper in the 10-K — on page 57 — you'll find something else worth knowing.The report says: ""The Company had $5.6 billion and $4.8 billion of obligations at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, including agreements to license streaming content that represent current or long-term liabilities or that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets because they do not meet content library asset recognition criteria.""

469,CXO,"When her industry had its focus on increasing efficiency and drilling away at problems on a cellular level, Dr. Bridget Duffy decided to wow her customers, the patients. What sick people and their families went through while they were in the hospital, she preached, was crucial to their healing.

479,CXO,"In her work, she realized that efficiency in medicine was great — to a point. If the patients didn't feel connected to staff, they weren't as willing to take their medication or show up for appointments. That flattened the bottom line for medical facilities, making them listen when she pitched her initiatives.

802,CXO,"The major indexes traded mixed during Monday's afternoon trading after a mixed bag of economic data earlier in the day.The NYSE composite, bolstered by gains in mainly defensive stocks including hospitals, grains and ethical drugs, rose 0.3%. IBD's Media-Books and Media-Radio/TV industry groups also outperformed with gains of at least 1%. The S&P 500 was up 0.2%. The Nasdaq slumped 0.3% and was trading near its session lows; it had been up 0.6% soon after the open. Volume edged higher on the NYSE and mildly lower on the Nasdaq.Stocks got an early boost on a rosy February reading from the Chicago purchasing managers index, but January pending home sales declined. January personal income rose more than expected in the U.S., up 1%, but a 0.2% gain in personal spending was weaker than forecast.Among top-rated stocks within Monday's IBD 50, some cyclical stocks were poised to finish the final day of February with gains.  Silver Wheaton (SLW) was up 2% in above-average trade. The stock on Friday worked on the fourth day of a possible handle. But on Monday, the silver streaming firm edged past the potential handle's high of 41.89, making it a shorter-than-ideal handle. The current base is third-stage, which tends to carry more risk than a first- or second-stage pattern.However, Concho Resources (CXO) and Travelzoo (TZOO) both fell more than 3% in above-average trade. The latter undercut its 50-day moving average on Feb. 3 in the heaviest volume since its rally past 20 last August, a clear sign of a correction. The online discount travel firm is forming a new base and currently stands 25% below a 53.21 peak.On the downside, First Solar (FSLR), a huge winner in 2007, slumped nearly 5% in active trade. The low-cost maker of silicon-free solar panels has fallen 12% over the past six sessions after running up fast in January. Last week the Tempe, Ariz.-based firm reported a 9% increase in Q4 earnings per share as sales fell 5% from year-ago levels.Sales grew 24% for the year, but the pace of growth has slowed considerably from a 273% annual sales boost in 2007 and 147% rise in 2008.

"
1112,CXO,"Companies planning an IPO are lining up for their usual race to market before the holiday break. And this year, energy is playing a prominent role.
"
1113,CXO,"Five oil and gas companies have set terms recently, signaling an imminent IPO. Most are master limited partnerships, some newly formed. But Laredo Petroleum is an honest-to-God operating company ramping up production in the Permian Basin.
"
1114,CXO,"The Basin is America's traditional oil mother lode, sprawling across West Texas and eastern New Mexico. Up until the last decade, it was presumed to be too mature to provide much growth.
"
1115,CXO,"But new horizontal drilling techniques have made the area hot again. Companies like Concho Resources (CXO), Approach Resources (AREX) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) are among the companies that have grown rapidly with Permian-focused strategies.
"
1116,CXO,"Laredo is making a fairly large offering by the miserly standards of post-recession IPOs, but it still represents only 15% of the company's shares. At the expected valuation, the market cap would be more than $2.3 billion.
"
1117,CXO,"Those suspicious of private-equity deals might be displeased to know that Warburg Pincus is the company's majority shareholder. However, there is no insider selling in the IPO, suggesting Warburg expects a greater return on investment in the future.
"
1118,CXO,"THE COMPANY
"
1119,CXO,"Laredo was founded in 2006 by a management team that had worked together before, forming and selling energy exploration and production (E&P) companies in Texas. In the IPO roadshow, CEO Randy Foutch said Laredo is ""different"" from these earlier projects: much larger and with growth potential further out into the future.
"
1120,CXO,"The company's current proved reserves total 137,052 million barrels of oil equivalent (mboe). Around two-thirds of this is in the Permian Basin, with most of the rest in the Anadarko Granite Wash in Oklahoma. Despite the ""petroleum"" in the company's name, it has more gas than oil in its reserves right now. However, the Permian area where it is focusing its attention is about evenly split between the two.
"
1121,CXO,"The Permian holdings were doubled earlier this year when Laredo bought Broad Oak energy. Specifically, the buyout brought Laredo a large stake in Wolfberry, an industry nickname for the combined Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. This area has become especially interesting to the oil industry lately as new production technologies have made it profitable to drill there.
"
1122,CXO,"Average net daily production is running at 22,842 boe, from 16 drilling rigs working on a little more than 1,000 producing wells. It expects to drill 250 to 300 new wells in 2012 with the vast majority of capital going to the Permian. The company has identified more than 6,000 potential drilling locations in all.
"
1123,CXO,"Laredo drills both vertically and horizontally. Management says the vertical wells are lower-risk, but the horizontal wells, whose techniques are still new and developing, can potentially yield more oil.
"
1124,CXO,"RISKS/CHALLENGES
"
1125,CXO,"The energy business is, of course, highly cyclical. Though it does hedge, Laredo's fortunes are bound to go up and down along with oil and gas prices.
"
1126,CXO,"Drilling is also inherently risky because you never know for sure how a well is going to turn out. Every drilling project requires a large amount of capital, which partly accounts for the company's debt.
"
1127,CXO,"The long-term debt totals $925 million, which is about twice Laredo's total revenue last year. The IPO will pay off part of it, but the firm will have to keep generating cash to keep up with the interest payments. The prospectus also warns that it may incur more debt in the future.
"
1128,CXO,"Laredo also says it will probably make more acquisitions to expand its holdings, which would require still more capital and bring integration risks.
"
1129,CXO,"Laredo's business is subject to various environmental and financial regulations. The prospectus notes that the federal government recently asserted control over hydraulic fracturing, a method used for extracting natural gas, where diesel additives might pollute the groundwater.
"
1130,CXO,"THE RESULTS
"
1131,CXO,"In the first nine months of the year total revenue, including Broad Oak's assets, rose 137% over the year-ago period to $371.3 million. Net income doubled to $104 million.
"
1132,CXO,"USE OF PROCEEDS

Lululemon Athletica (LULU) gapped down and dropped 1.63, or 3%, to 54.85 in heavy trading. But the stock bounced back from a 7% loss and managed to regain its 50-day line, which it…

The best performer of the threesome was a familiar name to growth investors, China-based search engine Baidu (BIDU). Baidu leapt 3.80 to 145.68 in more than twice its routine volume. The move came after reports Facebook signed an agreement with Baidu to set up a social-networking…

1144,CXO,"As stocks staggered lower in afternoon trade Wednesday, the Nasdaq sliced below its 50-day moving average for the first time since September.The Nasdaq was down 1.5%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.8% and the NYSE composite 0.6%. The S&P 500 and the NYSE remain above their 50-day line, but the margin above the line is only 1% to 2%. Volume was tracking higher across the board.Top-rated stocks weren't dodging the market's blows. Only four stocks in the IBD 50 were up. Two were energy-related — Concho Resources (CXO) and Northern Oil & Gas (NOG) — and one was a precious metal stock, Silver Wheaton (SLW). The fourth gainer was Apple (AAPL), which bounced off its 50-day line in strong volume.Other stocks were not so fortunate.Priceline.com (PCLN), which will report quarterly results after the close, dropped 3% in fast trade. The online travel booker pierced its 50-day line, trading under the key level for the first time since July.Mosaic (MOS) also violated its 50-day line. The fertilizer maker had bounced off its 50-day line in January, but that decline also came in heavy volume.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) plunged 5% in double its usual volume. The restaurant stock broke out of a base on Feb. 11, clearing a 262.87 buy point. But Chipotle is now more than 8% below the buy point. That would represent a sell rule for investors who bought the stock at that price or above it. A stock should be sold when it drops 7% or 8% below the price at which you buy it. The rule is designed to prevent deep losses that would be difficult to recover.Crude oil was up 4% as unrest continued in Libya. Gadhafi reportedly ordered the country's oil fields sabotaged.

1184,CXO,"QEP Resources, Inc. (QEP  -  Free Report) recently inked a $155-million deal to offload its oil and gas assets in the Uinta Basin, in a bid to sharpen focus on the prolific Permian play. Middle Fork Energy Partners, LLC will be purchasing the Uinta assets located in Duchesne and Uintah counties in eastern Utah.The divested assets comprise acreage of around 230,000 net acres and incorporate 605 billion cubic feet equivalents of proved reserves as of Dec 31, 2017. QEP Resources' net production in the last reported quarter, from the Uinta assets, was 54 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. Around 26% of the production was liquids.The deal is in line with QEP Resources’ strategy to streamline portfolio. The company has been entering into various strategic deals of late to sharpen focus on the more profitable Permian Basin and upgrade portfolio. QEP Resources currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.QEP Resources, Inc. Price  QEP Resources, Inc. Price | QEP Resources, Inc. QuoteIn 2016, it bought around 9,400 acres in the Permian for $600 million. Last July, it jettisoned its non-core gas assets located in southern Wyoming in a $777.5-million deal. In the same month, it inked another $732-million deal to acquire around 13,800 acres in the Permian Basin. In fact, the company allocated about 65% of its 2018 capital budget for this lucrative play as it aims to transform itself into a Permian pure-play.Even during oil slump, the Permian Basin continued to turn out as a moneymaker for many of the oil producers owing to its low cost-high margin operational structure. The region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labour and supplies, and relatively warm winters make year-round work possible. Oil production in the region has been witnessing significant growth, with its current capacity of churning around 3 million barrels per day (Bpd), which is further expected to rise another 2 million Bpd by 2025. Further, with crude pricing strength of late, more and more oil producers are likely to enhance or capitalize their Permian portfolio, increase shareholders’ return and reduce costs.As such, there has been a flurry of deals in the Permian region lately owing to its attractive economics. Oasis Petroleum Inc. (OAS  -  Free Report) dived into the Permian with a $946-million acreage buyout in December 2017. This year Concho Resources Inc.

1185,CXO,"Oasis Petroleum, Inc. (OAS  -  Free Report) recently inked two separate deals to offload some of its non-operating assets in the Williston Basin, in a bid to upgrade its portfolio. The transaction is valued at $283 million. However, details of the buyers have been kept under wraps. The divested non-core assets comprise 65,000 acres in North Dakota and Montana, having an estimated production capacity of 4,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d).The proceeds from this transaction will enable the company to pay for the acquisition of Permian acreage from San Antonio-based Forge Energy. In an attempt to diversify its holdings away from North Dakota, Oasis Petroleum acquired around 22,000 acres in the prolific Delaware Basin earlier this year. The deal has undoubtedly opened the gateway for Oasis Petroleum in the Delaware Basin, which is the most profitable area for oil explorers of late due to low production cost.Oasis Petroleum paid a huge premium for this $946-million acquisition deal, funded through cash and stock. In order to finance the deal, the company had resorted to issuing new stocks and also planned to jettison its non-core Williston assets to raise cash. In fact, it had announced its plans to sell around 200,000 acres, accounting for 8000-10,000 Boe/d, for approximately $500 million.

Shares of Parsley have gained 15.8% in the past two years, vis-à-vis the stocks in this industry that have collectively lost 5%.If you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio. Analysts are also displaying bullish sentiments on the stock, as is apparent from the upward revisions in earnings estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.70 for fiscal 2018 and $2.50 for fiscal 2019 has been revised upward by 11 cents and 12 cents, respectively, in the past 30 days.Currently, the industry to which Parsley belongs ranks within the top 15% (37 of 255) of all the Zacks industries. Further, the stock boasts a VGM Score of A and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 26.9%, which raises optimism among investors.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock an attractive buy.  Key Growth CatalystsParsley’s strategic acreage position in the low-cost Permian Basin is the foremost driving force. An extensive inventory of premium drilling locations both in the Midland and Delaware sides of the Permian Basin has been aiding in top-tier production growth since several years. The company remains committed to exploring significant growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions. Last year, it closed the $2.8-billion deal with Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC, which added 71,000 net acres to Parsley’s acreage in the Midland Basin, providing a major boost to the company’s overall acreage in the Permian Basin that now stands close to 220,000 acres.Owing to significant resource potential and prime acreage holdings, the company’s last quarterly output recorded a year-over-year and sequential increase of 66.5% and 16.3%, respectively. Notably, during the last reported quarter, the Permian pure play player placed on production 20 and 21 gross operated horizontal wells in Midland and Delaware, respectively. Oil production in Delaware increased more than 50% sequentially on the back of strong well results. Notably, Parsley’s revenue CAGR (2015-2017) was 267% owing to solid output growth that came in at 24,792 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d) in 2017 compared with 8,031 Mboe/d in 2015.In fact, Parsley Energy's quarterly oil volume has grown at the rate of 16% CAGR since 2014. This year, the company expects to generate organic oil production growth of around 50% from the 2017 level. Parsley Energy's liquids-heavy portfolio makes earnings highly sensitive to oil prices. With the macro environment expected to remain favorable and Parsley's robust operating cash margin of nearly 80%, its cash flow and balance sheet are likely to be strengthened further.The company’s aggressive cost-control strategies have boosted its cash flow and balance sheet. In the last reported quarter, the company’s lease operating cost came in at $3.43 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) compared with $3.57 per BOE a year ago. As it is, the Midland-based upstream company displays healthy balance sheet with a manageable debt-to-capital ratio of around 26%, which is lower than most peers, providing it with enough financial flexibility to tap strategic growth opportunities. Parsley also fares well in the cash-flow parameter, which is a key metric to gauge the financial health of a company. The company’s cash flow in 2017 totaled 694 million in 2017, representing a CAGR (3 years) of 100.8%.Banking on the aforementioned positives, the company is poised to carry on its momentum going forward.Looking for Other Promising Upstream Stocks?

1187,CXO,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 12.6% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CXO due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.First-Quarter 2018 ResultsConcho Resources reported strong first-quarter 2018 revenues and earnings results on the back of higher commodity-price realizations and robust production growth.The company reported adjusted net earnings per share of $1.00, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. The bottom line also improved significantly from the prior-year quarter’s adjusted income of 49 cents per share.Concho’s total operating revenues for the first quarter amounted to $947 million, which increased substantially from $612 million a year ago. The top line further surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $804 million.Operating revenues from oil sales witnessed a year-over-year increase of 58% to $793 million while gas revenues increased by 4% from the prior-year quarter to $154 million.Volume AnalysisConcho's average quarterly volume increased 26.5% year over year to 227.9 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), exceeding the high-end of the company’s guidance range. Of the volume, 63.1% consisted of liquids.

The company jettisoned its non-core acreage in Ward and Reeves counties to private buyers for $280 million. It also closed a strategic trade to upgrade its core development area in the Northern Midland Basin.Concho entered a major strategic deal in the first quarter to acquire its rival, RSP Permian Inc. The deal is expected to close by the third quarter of 2018. The $9.5-million mega-deal, to strengthen Concho’s Permian foothold, marks the largest takeover in the U.S. oil and gas exploration and production industry since 2012. It is also the biggest pure-Permian deal ever.Financial PositionAs of Mar 31, Concho had long-term debt of $2,370 million, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 19.6 %, thus witnessing an impressive decline from the leverage of 23.2% as of Dec 31.OutlookCapitalizing on its enviable acreage of low-risk top-tier assets and a multiyear drilling inventory, Concho raised its production outlook for 2018. The company now expects output to grow 18 against the prior guidance of 16-20%. Capital expenditure guidance for 2018 remains intact at about $2 billion.

1188,CXO,"Riding on the shale revolution yet again, the United States topped the global energy production charts in 2017 by churning out more than 15 million barrels per day (MMBbl/d). Retaining its status as the world's No. 1 producer of petroleum and natural gas hydrocarbons for the sixth straight year, the United States has beaten Saudi Arabia and Russia.As crude prices surged last year to above break-even levels, American drillers extracted record amounts of oil, especially from the less expensive shale plays even as Russia and Saudi Arabia withheld supplies to revive the commodity.It must be mentioned that the United States became the world’s largest natural gas operator back in 2009 when it went past Russia, while it jumped to the top of the petroleum hydrocarbons leaderboard in 2013 ahead of Saudi Arabia. As far as overall production is concerned, the United States has been the world's top producer since 2012.The Shale RevolutionWith the advent of hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) – a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water, sand and chemicals – shale production is now booming in the United States. Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract oil/gas from shale formations, the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U.S. energy supplies, playing a key role in boosting domestic reserves. As a result, once faced with a looming deficit, oil and natural gas are now available in abundance.U.S. Production Rises in 2017 to Maintain No. 1 PositionAccording to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), which provides official energy statistics from the U.S., domestic liquids supply increased by 745,000 barrels a day last year as oil prices gained 21% to around $65-a-barrel.In contrast, both Saudi Arabia and Russia saw their petroleum output decrease in 2017 as part of a broader alliance – forged in late 2016 – to limit production. The agreement, now renewed twice, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day (or 2% of global supply) off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Meanwhile, U.S. natural gas production turned around from previous year’s loss but rose by a meagre 1% in 2017. The tepid growth was mainly on account of lower prices prevailing in the early part of the year, relatively warmer winter weather (compared with 2016) and fall in power generation demand.On the other hand, Russia and Saudi churned out significantly higher natural gas in 2017 – growing at 8% and 6% year over year, respectively.Overall, U.S. production of petroleum liquids and natural gas reached an estimated 15.60 MMBbl/d in 2017.What’s Ahead?The EIA further added that U.S. petroleum production is forecast to average 17.58 MMBbl/d in 2018 and 19.14 MMBbl/d next year, continuing the positive trend from 2017. Volume from U.S. oil fields (inclusive of shale) has risen 27% since mid-2016 to more than 10.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter. In fact, domestic volumes are now breathing down the neck of top producer Russia, which pumps around 11 million barrels per day.The EIA also predicts natural gas production to set a new record in 2018, churning out 80.5 billion cubic feet on a daily basis.Shale Industry Adjusts to the New RealityNow at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers (in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.Want to Own a Shale Stock Now?While there are several leading players like Matador Resources Company (MTDR  -  Free Report), Continental Resources, Inc.

1189,CXO,"It was a week where oil prices reached their strongest level in over three years, while natural gas futures ended lower on a bearish inventory report.On the news front, energy biggies BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, driven by higher oil prices and production, while refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) agreed to acquire rival Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) for more than $23 billion.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 2.4% to close at $69.72 per barrel, natural gas prices fell 2.2% to $2.711 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: CVX & RDS.A Earnings Impress, XOM & TOT Disappoint)The U.S. oil benchmark settled at three-year highs on the possibility of United States re-imposing sanctions on Iran and sharp declines in output from Venezuela.Of late, crude prices have been supported by indications that the Trump administration might lead America's exit from the landmark Iran nuclear deal if the European allies do not agree to toughen the terms by May 12. The return of sanctions would put pressure on OPEC’s third-largest oil producer’s energy industry and reduce global supply.Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has dwindled by almost 50% since the early 2000s. Venezuela currently churns out just around 1.5 million barrels per day, much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week following a larger-than-expected increase in supplies – the first storage build of the injection season when demand is at its weakest ahead of the summer cooling period. Investors were further spooked by expanding dry gas production, which is currently at an all-time high.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    British energy giant BP plc reported strong first-quarter 2018 results on rebounding oil prices, record production and increased refinery throughput.The company’s adjusted earnings of 78 cents per American Depositary Share (ADS) – on a replacement cost basis, excluding non-operating items – surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents and the year-ago quarter’s 46 cents.

The upside can be attributed to the Permian Basin drilling program.The company said that it can exceed its previous 2018 budget estimate of $2.9 billion as it prepares for rig additions during the year-end. For 2018, Pioneer Natural intends to fund its capital expenditure from the forecasted cash flow of around $3.2 billion (based on gas price of $2.80 per Mcf and oil price of $66 per barrel).Pioneer Natural expects production between 312,000 BOE/d and 322,000 BOE/d in the second quarter of 2018.

The reading was also below the consensus estimate of 58.4.This was the lowest reading of ISM factory activity and represents the second month of declines. However, a reading of more than 50 indicates that the sector is expanding. Businesses have suffered on two fronts. First, higher input costs primarily due to imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum and second, shortages of skilled labor and a disruption in the supply chain.Moreover, the Department of Commerce reported that construction spending for the month of March plummeted 1.7%.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CXO in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 82 cents per share for CXO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CXO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.86% heading into earnings season.Concho Resources Inc.

1194,CXO,"The Q1 earnings season is past the halfway mark, with 267 S&P 500 members having already reported their quarterly numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% delivering positive earnings surprises and 73.8% beating revenue estimates.Near about half of the S&P listed energy companies have released their first-quarter results. These include Halliburton Company, Kinder Morgan, Inc., Schlumberger Limited, Baker Hughes, Hess Corporation, Valero Energy Corporation, Range Resources Corporation, Phillips 66, National Oilwell Varco, Helmerich & Payne, Inc., EQT Corporation, ExxonMobil Corporation, Cabot oil & Gas Corporation, Chevron Corporation and ConocoPhillips.Two biggies — ExxonMobil and Chevron — reported their results on Apr 27. While Chevron delivered earnings beat on higher oil prices and volumes, ExxonMobil missed estimates amid output and refinery throughput decline, along with lower margins at chemicals business.Bullish Results & ExpectationsIn the last reported quarter, earnings for the energy sector saw the strongest growth, recording a massive 136.6% year-over-year gain on 23.6% higher revenues.Also, for the first quarter of 2018, we expect the energy sector to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors. Per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 70.8% from first-quarter 2017, while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 15.4% from the year-ago levels.Q1 Oil and Gas Price Report CardOil: The first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite record high domestic production. Per EIA data, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. Crude was supported by various catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. Needless to say, such favorable developments have buoyed investors’ optimism surrounding the sector’s first-quarter results.It goes without saying that all oil-producing companies are thus poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices, as they will be able to extract more value for their products. However, the recent oil price rally has made the commodity costlier for refiners, leading to higher input cost for them.Natural gas: However, price of natural gas dropped about 7.4% in the January-March period. Along with the sequential fall, natural gas prices also remained unfavorable compared with the corresponding period of 2017. Commodity futures were $2.73 per MMBtu at the end of the quarter, down more than 14% from the Mar 31, 2017 settlement of $3.19 per MMBtu.Energy Stocks Reporting Q1 Earnings on May 1Let’s find out what’s in store for the below-mentioned five energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers on May 1.Headquartered in Midland, TX, Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) is an upstream energy player focused mainly on the lucrative Permian Basin. The company is expected to release results after the closing bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.In the last reported quarter, Concho delivered an impressive 43.48% positive earnings surprise on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth. As far as earnings beat is concerned, the company has an excellent history. Over the trailing four quarters, it surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 48.89%.It looks like Concho is all set to keep its earnings streak alive in the first quarter, as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.86% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for daily production is currently pegged at 218.2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE), higher than 181.4 MBOE reported in the year-ago quarter and 211.1 MBOE in the prior quarter. Moreover, analysts also envision higher price realizations that will further buoy its top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average oil price is expected to jump 20.2% and 11.3% from the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.Next up, we have Oklahoma-based independent energy producer Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report), which is slated to release numbers after the closing bell.  In the fourth quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 36.67% amid higher impairment charges. Nonetheless, the company surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters.However, our proven model does not show that Devon Energy is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter as it has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Weather-related issues are expected to affect first-quarter production of the firm. The company estimates total production from its assets in the first quarter of 2018 to be in the range of 530,000-554,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day, compared with 548,000 Boe achieved in fourth-quarter 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is $3,852 million for the first quarter, exhibiting a sequential decline of 3.33%.Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report), — an oil and gas producer with operations focused in the Gulf of Mexico — is set to unveil results after the closing bell.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter, with the positive earnings surprise being 18.3%. Moreover, it has topped earnings estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 15.9%.However, our proven model does not show conclusively that the company will be able to beat estimates in the to-be-reported quarter, as it carries an Earnings ESP of -0.76% and Zacks Rank #3.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average sale price of natural gas is $2.70 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), implying a year-over-year decline from $2.93 per Mcf, the estimate for gas production is pegged at 35.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf), reflecting an improvement from 29.4 Bcf in the year-ago quarter.Next in line we have Noble Energy Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report), slated to release results before the opening bell. The independent oil and gas producer mainly operates in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent and Gulf of Mexico regions.In the last reported quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 700%. The company boasts an excellent track record of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 246.16%.However, our model indicates that Noble Energy’s earnings streak might come to a halt this time around, as the company does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. While the company carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter’s total sales volume stands at 361 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), indicating a decline on both yearly and sequential basis. However, estimates for first-quarter total revenues increased 21.54% to $1.2 billion from the same period last year.Lastly, we have independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), slated to release results before the opening bell.  In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.37% on higher refining margin. As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a good history. It went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports.However, this time around, our model does not predict earnings beat for the stock, as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. While Marathon Petroleum’s retail and midstream segment bodes well, a more conservative refining outlook is likely to affect the company’s bottom line. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the refining segment’s bottom line stands at a loss of $112 million. This is also wider than the year-ago operating loss of $70 million.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

A total of 154 players belonging to the index recorded year-over-year earnings growth of 25.4% on 10.3% higher revenues.This earnings season will likely see strong performances from the Energy sector.

The production cut extension agreement by the OPEC players through 2018-end primarily supported the rally in crude.Energy Sector to FlourishFor first-quarter 2018, we expect Energy to see year-over-year earnings growth of 61.2% on 15.5% revenue growth. Among the 16 Zacks sectors, Energy will likely outshine others, with Construction expected to be next with 43.4% earnings growth.Energy is expected to be the key driver for S&P 500’s year-over-year earnings growth. Excluding Energy, the index’s first-quarter earnings growth is anticipated to drop to 18.6% from 20%. In terms of total profit, we expect Energy to earn $14.3 billion through the January-to-March quarter of 2018, significantly higher than each of the last four quarters.The crude rally primarily supported the sector as profits of Energy companies largely depend on the commodity’s price.How to Pick the Right Energy Stocks?With a wide array of companies in the Energy sector muddling up the stock picking power, the Zacks methodology could offer some relief.

1196,CXO,"Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report), a more than $22-billion market cap energy company, is set to release first-quarter 2018 financial results after the closing bell on May 1.Last quarter, the company had delivered an impressive 43.48% positive earnings surprise on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth. As far as earnings beat is concerned, the company has an excellent history. Over the trailing four quarters, it surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 48.89%.Concho Resources Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Concho Resources Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Concho Resources Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way Are the Estimates Trending?Estimate revisions help to get a clear picture of analysts’ opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter moved up by 3 cents to 82 cents per share over the last 30 days. It was further up by a penny in the last seven days. Further, the current estimate also reflects year-over-year growth of 67.3%. It is also above the last reported quarter earnings of 66 cents.On a further encouraging note, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of more than $790 million for the quarter, indicating a rise of more than 29% from the year-ago quarter. The revenue estimates are also higher than prior-quarter revenues of $780 million.Let’s delve deeper to find out what’s going in favor of the stock.Factors at PlayConcho’s core operations are focused on the prolific Permian basin, providing this upstream player with an enviable acreage of low-risk top-tier assets and a multiyear drilling inventory. Moreover, the company added various multi-well projects across its portfolio in 2017, which will drive its ambitious growth plans.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for daily production of this Midland, TX-based upstream operator is currently pegged at 218.2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE), higher than 181.4 MBOE reported in the year-ago quarter and 211.1 MBOE in the prior quarter.The company – currently executing on a strategy to remain within cash flow – expects to increase its output at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% over the 2017-2020 timeframe. Lifting its production outlook for 2018, the company expects its total output to grow 16-20%, with crude oil growth about 20%. Concho’s impending buyout of RSP Permian, Inc. (RSPP  -  Free Report) will also enhance the company’s estimated compounded annual growth rate over the 2017-2020 time frame along with providing the company with financial, commercial and operational synergies.Along with higher production volumes, higher realized prices will also aid the company.The first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite record high domestic production. Crude was supported by various catalysts including strong demand and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies.Analysts polled by Zacks envision realized prices to increase year over year, which will boost Concho’s top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average oil price is expected to jump 20.2% from the year-ago quarter to $59 a barrel. The estimate is also higher than the prior quarter’s realized price of $52.84 per barrel.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $134 million for natural gas sales in the to-be reported quarter is higher than the year-ago quarter’s $110 million. Oil sales are expected to amount to $705 million, significantly above $502 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017.Overall, rebounding crude prices and strong production growth are likely to boost the company’s performance this quarter as well.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model also shows that Concho is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company is +2.65%.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Concho carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Other Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationConcho is not the only energy firm looking up this earnings season.

1197,CXO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a big weekly build as domestic oil production reached another all-time high.Middle East Tensions Overshadow EIA DataHowever, oil traders chose to overlook bearish trends from the EIA data set and were more concerned about the uncertainty surrounding mounting tensions in the Middle East and the resultant fears of supplies being disrupted. The commodity settled at a three-year high of $66.82 per barrel yesterday after President Trump hinted at the possibility of a military strike against Syria, and Saudi Arabia claimed to have intercepted missiles fired by Yemeni rebels.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 3.3 million barrels for the week ending Apr 6, following a decrease of 4.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 100,000 barrels.Record-high domestic production and surging imports led to the larger-than-expected build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as refiner demand strengthened.In particular, U.S. output rose by 65,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.5 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.While oil inventories rose last week, stockpiles have actually shrunk in 37 of the last 53 weeks and are down nearly 105 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 428.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 20% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.1 million barrels to 36 million barrels.At 25.4 days, the crude supply cover was unchanged from the previous week. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 32.7 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their first increase in six weeks as production edged up. The 458,000 barrels build – contrary to the polled number of 2 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 238.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s rise, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains just below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were down 1 million barrels last week, slightly lower than analysts’ expectations for 1.2 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to higher demand. At 128.5 million barrels, current supplies are 15% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.5% from the prior week to 93.5%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Concho Resources Inc.

Hence, the company generated sufficient operating cashflow during 2017 for financing its capital budget.The company’s cash balance surged 41% through 2017 while long-term debt declined 4.3% — marking three consecutive years of decline. This reflects the company’s balance sheet strength.W&T Offshore has a strong earnings surprise history. The firm surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 542.8%. We appreciate the company’s solid cost-control initiatives. In 2017, the company managed to lower total expenses by nearly 50%.The strong focus of the leading upstream energy player on oil-rich prospective resources in the Gulf of Mexico is highly appreciated. W&T Offshore’s operations spread over 710,000 gross acres, which will likely support production growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther prospective players in the energy space are Antero Resources Corp. (AR  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1.

1199,CXO,"Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) is planning to offload part of its stake in Mexican oilfield to cash in on other opportunities, said Bloomberg.The integrated energy player is reportedly discussing the sale of 20% to 35% stake in the Campeche Bay oil prospect with prospective buyers, including Qatar Petroleum. Eni presently has full ownership in the massive crude discovery and anticipates to produce first oil by early next year.The stake divestment plan is in line with the company’s dual exploration model. The model reflects Eni’s intention to gain liquid assets from a potential prospect much before the field starts production. This will also help the company return cash to shareholders through dividend payments. Over the last four years, the dual exploration model has fetched Eni $9 billion, per Bloomberg.Eni won rights to conduct operations in the two-billion barrels of oil prospect in 2015, when Mexico conducted its second crude auction. The sale of the minority oilfield stake reflects the companies’ participation in active farm out agreement in Mexico. The country has put an end to state monopoly in its upstream operations by opening up the business for other players during 2013.Headquartered in Rome, Italy, Eni has rallied 12.8% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s 8% gain.Eni carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1200,CXO,"Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. (CRZO  -  Free Report) has been grappling with low liquidity and high leverage issues. Over the past year, shares of Carrizo have plunged 39%, underperforming the broader industry’s decline of 12.7%.Despite weak financials, the company has plans to incur capital expenditure of around $700-$800 million in 2018, owing to a double-digit rise in the oilfield services cost. Notably, the projected capex is higher than $695.7 million spent in 2017. Further, the production outlook of the company also doesn’t look very promising. Carrizo expects first-quarter 2018 production to lie between 48,600 and 49,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d), lower than the prior-quarter’s output of 62,417 Boe/d.Driven by the concerns, private-equity firm Kimmeridge Energy Management Company has recently boosted its stake in Carrizo to put pressure on the company, for pursuing asset sales and other strategic initiatives to buoy its staggering financials and share price.Activist Investor Kimmeridge increased its stake in Carrizo to 8.1%, reflecting a 65% jump from the previously held 4.9%. Post the development, shares of Carrizo have moved up 11.5% to eventually close at $17.15 on Apr, 5.Carrizo is burdened with a heavy debt pile of around $1.63 billion, which is even higher than the company’s market capitalization. Notably, the company’s debt levels witnessed a year-over-year increase of 22.5% in 2017. Carrizo currently carries a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 81.5% that limits its growth and restricts financial flexibility. The low liquidity of the company, which stands at 0.33, also raises concern over its asset-management practices, considering it as a small-cap company.Kimmeridge wants the company to divest its assets in the Eagle Ford Shale to delever its balance sheet. The private equity company either wants Carrizo to exit entirely from its Eagle Ford Holdings for debt reduction or if not all, then part of its holdings to use the proceeds for share buyback purposes.   Notably, the company closed the divestment of its non-core Eagle Ford assets in February for $245 million. In fact, over the past few quarters, the company has been concentrating to streamline its portfolio, and made various non-core divestitures in Marcellus, Utica, Appalachia and DJ Basin.However, Carrizo still owns around 78,500 acres in the Eagle Ford Play, which the activist investor does not view as a promising region owing to operational issues and estimated production decline from these holdings. As such, it wants the company to divest its remaining Eagle Ford properties to shore up the financials, and in the process, become a Pure-Permian play that offers more lucrative prospects.Importantly, last year Carrizo acquired Delaware Basin assets for $648 million to increase its core position in one of the highest-return plays in North America. The company currently owns 43,600 net acres in the Delaware Basin, which is part of the Permian Basin. Oil production in the Permian region has been witnessing significant growth, with current capacity of churning around 3 million barrels per day (Bpd), which is expected to rise by another 2 million Bpd within 2025. Kimmeridge appreciates the attractive economics of the Permian region, owing to the low cost-high margin operational structure, and hence wants the company to become a Permian pure play that will help it to drive its production.However, of late, with many oil producers entering the Permian and surging production, a lack of pipeline takeaway capacity has pushed crude prices in the region to trade at a discount to the U.S. benchmark.Thus, Kimmeridge believes that merger with some other Permian-focused rival will turn out to be a prudent strategy for Carrizo, owing to its small scale and weak financials. A merger will bolster its scale and position in the Permian, along with enhancing buying power in securing services in the region. The financial, operation and commercial synergies from a strategic acquisition will also position the company better.  While Kimmeridge is putting pressure on Carrizo to make some serious strategic changes for boosting its value, whether the upstream player will give in to the activist investors’ demands or not is a wait and watch story.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCarrizo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked players in the energy space include Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Continental Resources, Inc (CLR  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1202,CXO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a surprise weekly decline even as domestic oil production reached another all-time high. Following the data sets, front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved down 0.2% (or 14 cents) to end at $63.37 per barrel yesterday.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 4.6 million barrels for the week ending Mar 30, following an increase of 1.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some one million barrels.Higher refinery runs and lower imports led to the surprise draw build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production reached a new record.In particular, U.S. output rose by 27,000 barrels per day last week to nearly 10.5 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Meanwhile, stockpiles have shrunk in 37 of the last 52 weeks and are down more than 108 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 425.3 million barrels, current crude supplies are 20.6% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 3.7 million barrels to 34.9 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 26.1 days in the previous week to 25.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 33.5 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their fifth weekly decrease in a row as production slipped. The 1.1 million barrels drawn – below the polled number of 1.9 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 238.5 million barrels. Following last week’s decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains just below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) edged up 537,000 barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 1.3 million barrels decrease in supply level. The small weekly rise could be attributed to higher production and weak demand. At 129.5 million barrels, current supplies are 15% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.7% from the prior week to 93%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Concho Resources Inc.

1203,CXO,"Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) is planning to divest a chunk of its midstream properties in Canada, per Bloomberg. The leading energy infrastructure company will reportedly get $1.6 billion from the assets, engaged in the gathering and processing of natural gas.Previously, Spectra Energy was the owner of the midstream infrastructures, spread over Alberta and British Columbia. In late 2016, Spectra Energy and Enbridge had decided to merge for creating the largest energy infrastructure company in North America.As per Bloomberg data, the acquisition involved debt of around $14.5 billion.

However, neither Enbridge nor Royal Bank of Canada made any comments on the deal.Last November, Enbridge — belonging to the Zacks Oil & Gas Pipeline industry — announced the identification of several non-core properties worth as much as C$10 billion, of which roughly C$3 billion will likely be divested through 2018. Enbridge is anticipated to focus on growth projects and strengthen its balance sheet with the proceeds from the sale.Headquartered in Calgary, Canada, Enbridge’s overall operational results were not impressive last year.

1205,CXO,"Royal Dutch Shell plc ((RDS.A  -  Free Report) is set to offload its 90% stake in the Gaza Marine gas project to Palestine Investment Fund, moving forward with its $30-billion divestment goal. The financial details of the transaction have been kept under wraps.The Anglo-Dutch giant had gained ownership of the Gaza Marine tract, located offshore Palestine, via its BG Group buyout. The field was discovered by the BG Group in 2000 but did not progress to the development stage amid political and commercial concerns. Palestine Investment Fund is seeking a capable international partner to hand over 45% of the project’s stake along with designing a field development plan with the operator. Gaza Marine's development will aid in meeting the demand for gas-fired power plants in Palestine and further help it to become an energy exporter.The move will help Shell proceed with its divestment program. The deal provides the company with a major uplift in its drive to decrease debt following the acquisition of BG Group for $47 billion. The divestment is expected to reduce the company’s cost, and enhance cash flow as well as return to capital. The move will also help the company to upgrade and streamline its portfolio.With Shell already wrapping up divestment deals worth more than $23 billion, it remains focused to meet its target by 2018. Further, the company announced asset disposals amounting to around $2 billion, and talks for prospective transactions of additional $5 billion divestment deals are already in advanced stages.Headquartered in Netherlands, Shell is one of the largest integrated energy companies engaged in the production, refining, distribution and marketing of oil and natural gas.

1206,CXO,"Sunoco LP (SUN  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal with Superior Plus Corporation to acquire its wholesale fuel business and storage assets, in a bid to further bolster its fuel distribution segment.The assets to be sold to Sunoco will include wholesale refined fuels operations across five states in the northeast United States along with three pipeline connected terminals in New York. The wholesale business comprises around hundreds of dealers and commercial contracts, with an annual sale of nearly 200 million gallons of fuel. The three terminals include 17 tanks with a storage capacity of 429,000 barrels.The deal is valued at approximately $40 million. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the deal is set for completion by this month.The announcement of this acquisition deal comes a day after the partnership effectively completed the conversion of its 207 retail sites across West Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico markets to a single commission agent. Per the commission agent model, Sunoco will own and price the fuel at the sites, paying the agent a fixed commission per gallon of fuel sold. Meanwhile, the master limited partnership will receive fees and rental income from the commission agent, who will be responsible for conducting operations in the sites.Prior to this in January 2018, Sunoco had closed its $3.2 billion divestment deal with 7-Eleven Inc., aiming to exit from retail operations and strengthen its focus in the core fuel distribution and logistics segments.   Thus, with the successful completion of its divestment deal with 7-Eleven and conversion of its remaining retail business to a commission agent model, the partnership has made a strategic change in its business model that has helped it in strengthening its financial position. The strategic initiatives have helped the partnership to reduce its debt metrics and become better positioned to tap on attractive acquisition opportunities in the near term.The recent acquisition deal is likely to be immediately accretive to Sunoco’s distributable cash flows, and bring about increased synergies and scale.The partnership remains focused on more such lucrative acquisition opportunities for the growth of its wholesale fuel distribution business, which will enable it to have an edge over other regional wholesalers and distributors.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSunoco carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

1208,CXO,"Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) said last week that it will buy RSP Permian Inc. (RSPP  -  Free Report) for about $9.5 billion in the latest notable transaction involving the lucrative Permian Basin. The region has been gripped by a deal frenzy in the last few years, with a series of acquisitions, mergers and drilling rights involving both ‘Big Oil’ and smaller energy companies. It is worth noting that among last year's energy deals, more than 36% (valued at $24.3 billion) were Permian-focused, reflecting its status as the dominant domestic growth area for onshore oil production.Agreed, the sentiment in the oil market has not been this good in years, with U.S. crude prices hitting a more than three-year high of around $66 recently – a spectacular recovery from below $30 in early 2016.But regardless of the commodity’s price movement though, one oil-producing area that continues to attract investors is the low-cost Permian Basin spread over west Texas and New Mexico. According to some estimates, the region – that has been churning out crude continuously for nearly 100 years – has produced in excess of 30 billion barrels of oil since output began in 1921. Incredibly, despite that impressive output history, analysts maintain that its best days are yet to come. In fact, Permian Basin is touted as the key reason that U.S. crude production has now overtaken industry behemoth Saudi Arabia and is poised to surpass Russia shortly to become the global oil leader.The Permian ‘Super’ Basin   A sedimentary basin lying underneath the western part of Texas and the south-eastern part of New Mexico, the Permian Basin Shale covers roughly 75,000 square miles, almost half the size of California.Experts say that it’s cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin, as compared to most other major fields. Moreover, there are certain parts of the shale play whose well-returns are the best in the U.S. With crude prices still down significantly from their 2014 levels, well returns have become a very important metric to gauge profitability.Per S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – the average wellhead break-even price for oil producers in the Permian shale play has come down to a staggering $33 per barrel. Permian’s attractive economics means that producers can make money and sustain growth there at the current, $60-a-barrel price.The low operating cost stems from the region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labor and supplies, and relatively warm winters that makes year-round work possible. Most other domestic share regions need far higher prices to support new developments and expansions.Unsurprisingly then, the Permian has drawn the lion’s share of energy investment. Of late, more than a third of the total amount spent on all U.S. deals was spent on   Permian land purchases and leases. No other major oil region in the country has come close to this activity.Massive Reserve Potential Attracting ProducersAccording to business information provider IHS Markit, the Permian play is estimated to hold a staggering 60-70 billion barrels of recoverable crude oil -  enough to feed all the domestic refineries for 12 years.It is primarily because of the Permian shale that volume from U.S. oil fields has risen 24% since mid-2016 to more than 10.4 million barrels per day - the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Despite the slight uptick in service costs, a growing number of companies are devoting bulk of their investments into the Permian as they turn their attention to less-expensive projects that can deliver cash quickly in today’s ‘moderate oil’ environment. The recent Concho-RSP deal is likely to spur the “Permania” that has engulfed the U.S. oil industry and herald another consolidation wave in the Permian region.Such is the popularity of this unconventional basin that oil supermajors like ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) have made the region mainstays of their future production. While ExxonMobil doubled its Permian Basin resource to six billion oil-equivalent barrels last year in a series of transactions, Chevron has allocated a massive $3.3 billion as capital expenditure for this lucrative region in 2018.Four Permian Basin Oil Stocks to BuyThough a number of companies have built sizeable acreage positions in the Permian Basin, we have shortlisted four of them that might fetch you outstanding returns. Each of our picks boast of a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), which justifies a company’s strong fundamentals. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Concho Resources, a #1 Ranked stock, is our first pick. The impending RSP Permian acquisition will make the Midland, TX-based company one of the top energy producers in the lucrative play. The deal adds 92,000 acres of complementary holdings to Concho’s Permian portfolio, expanding the total Permian acreage of the company to 640,000 net acres. The combined entity is set to run 27 rigs in the region, marking one of the largest drilling programs in the Permian shale play.Then we have EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report). This Zacks Rank #1 stock has significant interests in the Permian Basin. In 2016, the company scooped up privately held Yates Petroleum Corp for $2.5 billion to expand its holdings in the region. In the most recently reported quarter, EOG Resources’ total volume rose 13.4% year over year to 60.9 million barrels of oil equivalent and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 MMBoe. This was primarily on account of higher production and improved well performance in the Permian Basin where it holds approximately 630,000 net acres.Third on the list is Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report). An independent oil and gas exploration and production company based in Irving, TX, the Rank #2 stock’sgrowth continues to be focused on the Permian operations with more than 20,00 drilling locations across 750,000 gross acres. Its world-class assets in the region is likely to see year-over-year production growth of 19-24% in 2018. In fact, Pioneer Natural Resources plans to operate 20 horizontal rigs in the play this year.Energen Corporation (EGN  -  Free Report) is another company we recommend. This Birmingham, AL-based Permian pure play boasts of acreage in some of the high-quality areas of the Basin in the Delaware and Midland. Carrying a Zacks Rank of 2, Energen’s top-tier inventory of more than 4,000 net locations supports net, undeveloped resource potential of 2.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Coupled with ever improving operating efficiencies, the company expects year-over-year production growth of 25% in 2018.  Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1209,CXO,"It was a week where oil finished lower but natural gas futures turned around to score a gain.On the news front, energy explorer Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) agreed to buy smaller rival RSP Permian Inc. for $9.5 billion to expand its presence in the prolific Permian play, while midstream operator Tallgrass Energy GP, LP  announced plans to consolidate its business through a merger deal with its master limited partnership.Overall, it was another mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost around 1.4% to close at $64.94 per barrel, natural gas prices rose 5.5% to $2.733 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell Quits New Zealand, Statoil to Become Equinor)The U.S. oil benchmark closed in the red last week, falling below the psychologically important $65 per barrel level. The decline was triggered by the EIA crude inventory numbers showing a rise in supplies and production.The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories were up by 1.6 million barrels for the week ending Mar 23. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 1 million barrels. Record high domestic production led to the stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer.In particular, U.S. output rose by 26,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.4 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Surging output from the U.S. shale has been looming over the oil markets, threatening to undermine output curbs by OPEC and its allies.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week despite a smaller-than-expected decrease in supplies. However, the 63 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was more than the five-year average net shrinkage of 46 Bcf for the reported week. Investors were also encouraged by forecasts of colder weather for early April that might lead to the fuel’s strong demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Concho Resources, an upstream player, recently signed a deal to acquire its rival RSP Permian Inc. in a $9.5 billion deal, to expand its presence in the prolific Permian play.The agreement marks the largest takeover in the oil and gas exploration and production industry since 2012 and the biggest pure-Permian deal ever. The acquisition is set to create a humongous Permian Pure-play and likely to make the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Concho one of the top energy producers in the Permian basin. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The complementary asset base has been the key driver of the deal. The buyout will integrate the premier assets of both the companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the region. The deal will enable the companies to pool their expertise in the region and share their best practices, thereby enhancing buying power in securing services in the region.The deal adds 92,000 acres of complementary holdings to Concho’s Permian portfolio, expanding the total Permian acreage of the company to 640,000 net acres. The combined entity is set to run 27 rigs in the region, marking one of the largest drilling programs in the Permian shale play.

(PTR  -  Free Report) announced 2017 earnings of RMB 22,793 million or RMB 0.12 per diluted share compared with RMB 7,900 million or RMB 0.04 per diluted share a year earlier. Moreover, China’s dominant oil and gas producer’s total revenue for the year jumped 24.7% from 2016 to RMB 2,015,890 million.The positive comparisons can be primarily attributable to higher oil prices, which helped its exploration and production unit to report a jump in profitability. Interestingly, the company has decided to pay all of its annual profit of RMB 22,793 million as interim dividend to its stockholders – something it did in the first half as well.Average realized crude oil price during 2017 was $50.64 per barrel, 33.3% higher than the year-ago period. This buoyed the upstream (or exploration & production) segment results, which posted an operating income of RMB 15,475 million compared to a much smaller operating profit of RMB 3,148 million in 2016.Following the robust showing, PetroChina has decided to boost 2018 capital expenditure. The group pegged its 2018 capital budget at RMB 225,800 million, up 4.4% from what it invested in 2017 as it focuses to cash in on the recovery in crude prices.

1211,CXO,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) released updates on its disposition and early life-cycle acreage acquisition activities.During the first quarter of 2018, ConocoPhillips raised proceeds of more than $250 million from the sale of non-core assets. Additionally, the company closed or entered into a definitive agreements relating to numerous small packages in the Permian Basin. The company is expected to close a package of largely unexplored acreage in South Texas during the second quarter. These transactions are not likely to dent the company’s production. The earlier announced disposition program is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2018.In North America, the company has established or expanded positions in two early life-cycle and liquids-rich unconventional plays. In February, ConocoPhillips purchased about 245,000 net acres of early life-cycle unconventional acreage in the Lower 48 for very low entry cost. Recently, the company recognized that a large amount of the acreage is in the Austin Chalk play in central Louisiana. Beginning in 2018, ConocoPhillips projects to drill several exploration wells in the new position. This program will be funded from within the company’s announced exploration budget.Recently, ConocoPhillips obtained about 35,000 net acres in the Montney play in Canada for about $120 million. This new acreage is close to the company’s existing position in the liquids-rich portion of the Montney. With this purchase, the company’s total holding in the liquids-rich Montney play is about 140,000 net acres. The exploration and appraisal work, which is in progress for this acreage, will also be funded from the existing exploration budget.ConocoPhillips is one of the industry’s most active players in managing asset portfolio through a combination of acquisitions and disposals. With a bigger inventory of unconventional resource potential than other domestic independent, ConocoPhillips boasts a leading position among the top unconventional liquids-rich plays, comprising Eagle Ford and Permian Basin shale plays.

1212,CXO,"Encana Corporation (ECA  -  Free Report), a Canadian upstream company, recently inked a deal with a midstream player, Keyera Corporation regarding its Pipestone infrastructure project near Grande Prairie, Alberta in a bid to bolster its growth plans in the Montney region.Deal HighlightsPer the deal, Keyera Partnership — a subsidiary of Keyera — will pay C$39 million to acquire and fund the development of Pipestone Liquids Hub and Pipestone Processing Facility in western Alberta.The Pipestone liquids hub is currently under construction and is expected to become functional from the fourth quarter of 2018. The startup of the Liquids Hub is likely to enhance Encana’s net raw condensate processing capacity by 14,000 barrels per day (bbls/d). This will aid in Encana’s ambitions to double its liquids production in the Montney region from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018. Keyera is expected to fund the remaining cost of the hub which is estimated at $105 million.Additionally, Keyera will also own and fund the planned Pipestone Processing Facility located adjacent to the Liquids Hub. The Processing Facility is expected to become operational by 2021, providing Encana with additional 19,000 bbls/d of net raw condensate processing capacity plus 170 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of net inlet natural gas processing capacity.Under the terms of the midstream agreement, Encana will handle the construction and the initial operatorship of the project. Keyera will become the owner of the project and undertake the responsibility for its commercial development. The company will provide processing services to Encana under a long-term fee-for-service arrangement.Keyera also has the option to assume operatorship five years from the startup of a natural gas processing and liquids stabilization plant.Deal MotiveThe deal is in sync with Keyera’s strategy to strengthen its presence in the Montney region which is a hot area for the producers owing to its attractive economics. With this Pipestone project along with Keyera’s Wapti and Simonette plants, around 50% of the company’s processing margins are focused on Montney and Duvernay regions.Overall the deal supports Encana’s condensate-focused growth plans in Montney leading to additional 33,000 bbls/d of raw condensate processing capacity and 170 MMcf/d of net inlet natural gas processing facility in the region.  Along with boosting the production growth, the deal also reduces Encana’s financial obligations emphasizing its commitment to capital efficiency.Over the years, Encana has increased its focus to streamlining its portfolio by divestiture of its non-core assets including Gordondale, Wheatland properties and DJ Basin holdings. Concurrently, it has successfully repositioned its asset base and shifted focus to four key growth areas namely Montney, Duvernay, Eagle Ford and Permian. The deal is also expected to give a boost to Encana’s five-year targets for strong cash flow generation along with high production growth. The company is targeting a production growth of 60% from its core assets through 2021, while being within its cash flows. Management also expects its cash flow to skyrocket about 300% with its margins doubling over the next five years.Zacks Rank and Key PicksEncana currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Encana Corporation Price Encana Corporation Price | Encana Corporation QuoteSome better-ranked players in the energy space include Concho Resources Inc.

1213,CXO,"After enduring the toughest start to the year in recent times, markets have started the second quarter on a sorry note. U.S. stocks have had their most disappointing start to April since 1929. And now trade war and tech stock related concerns are threatening to cause a deeper correction for the markets.Historically, however, April has been a good month for stock gains. Also, first-quarter earnings are likely to be strong, coming on the back of strong fourth numbers. A flurry of recent reports also suggests that the economy continues to be resilient.And it remains to be seen whether Trump follows up on all the warnings he has issued recently. Taking all these factors into consideration, picking large-cap stocks which promise considerable returns may be a good idea at this point.April Historically Strong for StocksGoing by historical data, April has traditionally been a productive month for U.S. stocks. Data from the Stock Trader’s Almanac for 2018 shows that the Dow has gained 1.9% on average during April since 1950. This means that April is the most profitable month for the Dow, going by average monthly returns.Other major indexes also fair well during April, per the Almanac. For both the small-cap heavy Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, April is the third-best month of the year. Both these indexes have increased 1.5% on the average every April since 1950. April is also the fourth-best month for the Nasdaq. The tech-heavy index has notched up a 1.4% average gain during the month, per historical data.Data from independent broker-dealer LPL Financial shows that gains in April have been particularly notable during the last few years. The S&P 500 has ended April with gains 90% of the time over the past 10 years. The index has notched up an average gain of 2.2% over this period. The success rate of 90% is the highest for any month during this period. Also, average monthly gains are the third highest, after March and July. Strong Economy, Q1 Earnings to Boost StocksThe U.S. economy had finished 2017 on a strong note, growing faster during the fourth quarter than earlier estimated. Business investment expanded during this period even as consumer spending hit a three-year high.The first economic reports for April indicate that the economy continues to be resilient. Though the ISM Manufacturing Index dipped slightly, the economy as a whole expanded for the 107th consecutive month. Construction spending also inched up in February.Meanwhile, the outlook for first-quarter earnings is particularly bright, coming on the back of strong results for the fourth quarter. As of Mar 23, total Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index were expected to be up +15.9% from the same period last year on +7.3% higher revenues. This would follow +13.5% earnings growth on +8.5% revenue growth in the preceding period. (Read: Handicapping the Q1 Earnings Season)Our ChoicesStocks have recently been buffeted by the twin concerns of an impending trade war with China and losses for tech stocks. While losses for tech stocks are likely temporary, it remains to be seen whether Trump follows up on his warnings or opts for a compromise. Meanwhile, April remains a historically good month for stocks. Also, while the economy remains strong, prospects for first-quarter earnings remain encouraging.Given this backdrop, it seems prudent to bet on relatively stable alternatives which hold out the promise of considerable returns. Large-cap stocks are relatively safer bets. At the same time, it is important to consider only those which offer the promise of short-term benefits and the prospect of good long-term performance. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks, each of which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a good VGM Score.

Further, Tesla’s shares plummeted following a credit downgrade and news of officials investigating a fatal crash in California.Investors, in the meantime, digested a U.S. Commerce Department report of the U.S. economy slowing less than previously reported in the fourth quarter. Per the latest report from the Commerce Department, the U.S. GDP advanced at 2.9% annual rate of growth versus the last quarter’s figure of 2.5%.

1217,CXO,"Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report), an upstream player, recently signed a deal to acquire its rival RSP Permian Inc. (RSPP  -  Free Report) in an all-stock deal of $9.5 billion, to expand its presence in the prolific Permian play.The agreement marks the largest takeover in the oil and gas industry since 2012 and the biggest pure-Permian deal ever. The acquisition is set to create a humongous Permian Pure-play and likely to make Concho one of the top energy producers in the Permian basin.Post the announcement of the deal, shares of RSP Permian increased more than 15.6% to close at $45 on Mar 28. On the other hand, shares of Concho declined more than 8.7% to close at $143.25 on Mar 28, being the biggest loser on the S&P 500 index for the day. This reflects investors’ disappointment toward the pricey deal, considering Concho is paying a hefty premium for RSP’s shares. According to some reports, the overall price tag of the deal at $9.5 billion implies Concho paying more than $76,000 per acre, which is much higher than other deals in the Permian region with companies paying around $40,000 per acre, according to certain estimates. However, many analysts still find the premium reasonable owing to the synergies associated with the deal and the long-term opportunities it could provide.Deal DetailsThe deal is valued at $8 billion in equity wherein Concho will exchange 0.32 shares of its common stock for each share of RSP. Concho’s bid represents 29% premium to RSP Permian’s closing share price of $38.92 on Mar 27, thus valuing RSP Permian at $50.24 a share. The deal also assumes RSP Permian’s net debt estimated at $1.5 billion, thus pushing the total value of the transaction to $9.5 billion.Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, along with shareholders’ consent and other regulatory approvals, the deal is set for closure by the third quarter of 2018.Post the culmination of the deal, Concho will own 75% stake in the combined entity, whereas RSP Permian will hold the remaining 25% interest.Deal Motive  Concho’s core operations are focused on the prolific Permian basin, providing this large-cap upstream player with an enviable acreage of low-risk top-tier assets and a multiyear drilling inventory. The company has successfully streamlined its portfolio by divesting its non-core assets like Ward and Reeves among others, thereby sharpening its focus on prolific Permian Basin. The company produced more than 193,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the region last quarter.On the other hand, Dallas-based oil and gas producer, RSP Permian is one of the biggest oil and gas explorers in the region. The company’s production during the fourth quarter stood at 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 80% weighted to oil and 20% to natural gas. RSP Permian’s acreage carries a resource potential of around 2.2 billion of barrels of oil equivalent.  The complementary asset base has been the key driver of the deal. The buyout will integrate the premier assets of both the companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the region. The deal will enable the companies to pool their expertise in the region and share their best practices, thereby enhancing buying power in securing services in the region.Deal BenefitsThe deal adds 92,000 acres of complementary holdings to Concho’s Permian portfolio, expanding the total Permian acreage of the company to 640,000 net acres. The combined entity is set to run 27 rigs in the region, marking one of the largest drilling programs in the Permian shale play.Additionally, the strategic acquisition is expected to lead to significant commercial, financial and operational synergies, due to the integration of asset, systems and staff. The deal is expected to result in operational synergies of more than $2 billion along with annual corporate savings amounting to $60 million. The deal is expected to be immediately accretive to Concho’s earnings, cash flow and net asset value. Further, it will also enhance the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s estimated compounded annual growth rate over the 2017-2020 time frame. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Permian Play: The Hotspot for Oil ExplorersEven during oil slump, the Permian Basin continued to turn out as a moneymaker for many of the oil producers owing to its low cost-high margin operational structure. Experts say that it’s cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin compared to most other major fields. Moreover, there are certain parts of the shale play whose well-returns are the best in the United States. The region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labor and supplies, and relatively warm winters make year-round work possible. Oil production in the region has been witnessing significant growth with current capacity of churning around 3 million barrels per day(Bpd), which is expected to rise by another 2 million Bpd by 2025.Last year, there had been a flurry of oil deals in the region owing to its attractive economics. Supermajor ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) doubled its Permian acreage with a $6.6 billion deal, holding more than 1 million acres in the region last year. Other companies including Noble Energy Inc, Parsley Energy Inc., Marathon Oil Corporation had inked strategic deals in 2017 to expand their Permian foothold. Oasis Petroleum Inc. (OAS  -  Free Report) also dived into Permian with $946 million acreage buyout in December 2017.Further, now with crude prices finally rebounding to trade above $60 per barrel since a couple of months, more and more oil producers are likely to enhance or capitalize their Permian portfolio, increase shareholders return and reduce cost. The latest deal is likely to spur the “Permania” that has engulfed the U.S. oil industry and herald another consolidation wave in the Permian region. Small and mid-cap companies operating in the region including Abraxas Petroleum Corporation, Jagged Peak Energy Inc., Lilis Energy Inc., Resolute Energy corporation among others could become effective targets for consolidation. In fact, the deal has also set some sort of benchmark that the companies might require to pay heed to for clinching an acquisition deal in the Permian region. However, with its relatively low break-even cost, the hectic pace of land grab is set to continue in the Permian basin.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

1218,CXO,"PetroChina Co. Ltd. (PTR  -  Free Report) announced 2017 earnings of RMB 22,793 million or RMB 0.12 per diluted share compared with RMB 7,900 million or RMB 0.04 per diluted share a year earlier. Moreover, China’s dominant oil and gas producer’s total revenue for the year jumped 24.7% from 2016 to RMB 2,015,890 million.The positive comparisons can be primarily attributable to higher oil prices, which helped its exploration and production unit to report a jump in profitability. Interestingly, the company has decided to pay all of its annual profit of RMB 22,793 million as interim dividend to its stockholders – something it did in the first half as well.PetroChina followed another big energy name from the country — Sinopec (SNP  -  Free Report) — in reporting encouraging results. Sinopec also saw its profit surge as the largest petroleum and petrochemical company in Asia managed to generate strong petrochemical margins.Following the robust showing, PetroChina has decided to boost 2018 capital expenditure. The group pegged its 2018 capital budget at RMB 225,800 million, up 4.4% from what it invested in 2017 as it focuses to cash in on the recovery in crude prices.However, the Chinese energy giant’s earnings per ADR came in at $1.90, unable to match the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.82 on higher expenses and losses from gas imports.12-Month Segment PerformanceUpstream: PetroChina, one of the world's largest oil company by market value, posted disappointing upstream output during the twelve months ended Dec 31, 2017. In particular, crude oil output – accounting for 61% of the total – fell 3.7% from the year-ago period to 887 million barrels (MMBbl). This was partly offset by marketable natural gas output, which was up 4.5% to 3,423.4 billion cubic feet (Bcf). As a result, PetroChina’s total production of oil and natural gas declined by a marginal 0.6% year over year to 1,457.8 million barrels of oil equivalent.However, average realized crude oil price during 2017 was $50.64 per barrel, 33.3% higher than the year-ago period. This buoyed the upstream (or exploration & production) segment results, which posted an operating income of RMB 15,475 million compared to a much smaller operating profit of RMB 3,148 million in 2016.Downstream: The Beijing-based company’s ‘Refining & Chemicals’ business generated an operating income of RMB 39,961 million. This marks a slight increase from the year-earlier period earnings of RMB 39,026 million. The improvement in the downstream division was due to cost control initiatives, higher share of high valued-added chemical products and operational flexibility to adjust to market conditions.PetroChina’s refinery division processed 1,016.9 MMBbl of crude oil during the twelve-month period, up 6.7% from 2016. The company produced 9.284 million tons of synthetic resin in the period (a rise of 2.3% year over year), besides manufacturing 5.764 million tons of ethylene (up 3.1%). It also produced 92.715 million tons of gasoline, diesel and kerosene during the period against 86.022 million tons a year earlier.Natural Gas & Pipelines: Revenue rose 19.5% to RMB 295,786 million on higher natural gas sales volumes. Still, PetroChina lost money to the tune of RMB 23,947 million on the sales of imported natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Central Asia and Burma. This pulled down the group’s natural gas business’ income to RMB 15,688 million in 2017, a 12.3% decline from the year-earlier profit of RMB 17,885 million.Marketing: In marketing operations, the state-owned group sold 169.5 million tons of gasoline, diesel and kerosene during Jan–Dec 2017, an increase of 6.5% year over year. Higher volumes were accompanied by improved product prices due to which sales for the division were up 27.6% to RMB 1,660,456 million.However, a number of adverse factors – spiraling operating expenses and fierce competition – meant that the segment reported a profit of RMB 8,279 million – lower than the prior year’s RMB 11,048 million.Liquidity & Capital ExpenditureAt the end of 2017, the stock’s cash balance was RMB 122,777 million, while cash flow from operating activities was RMB 366,655 million. Capital expenditure for the year was RMB 216,227 million, up 25.4% from the year-ago level.Zacks Rank & Stock PicksPetroChina holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Apart from PetroChina, one can also look at energy players like Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report). Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1219,CXO,"On Mar 27, Stone Energy Corporation  was raised to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Why the Upgrade?For first-quarter 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has been revised upward from 38 cents to 39 cents over the last 60 days. The consensus mark for current-year earnings was raised to $1.78 from $1.43.  The company’s free cashflow for 2017 was recorded at $535 million against negative free cashflow of $161 million in 2016. Partial recovery in crude prices primarily supported the massive improvement. Hence, Stone Energy generated sufficient operating cashflow during 2017 for financing its capital budget.Stone Energy has negligible current debt as its long-term debt contracted 33.2% through 2017. Moreover, cash balances surged 48.1% last year, reflecting considerable balance sheet strength. The company’s pricing chart looks impressive. Over the past year, the stock has rallied 68.9%, outperforming the industry’s 10.4% decline. We appreciate the company’s strong foothold in the Gulf of Mexico — which offers abundant crude reserves. With innumerable discoveries of oil fields in the Gulf regions, the company estimated total Gulf reserves of more than 50 billion barrels. The company’s allocation of 36% capital budget for 2018 toward exploration activities in the prospective oil and gas resources is highly positive especially when crude prices recovered from historical lows touched during early 2016. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude recently crossed the $65-per-barrel mark, way higher than historical low-mark of $26.21 per barrel in February 2016.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther prospective players in the energy space include W&T Offshore, Inc.

1220,CXO,"SM Energy Company (SM  -  Free Report) has provided its production and capital spending updates.Permian Production StrongThe upstream energy player expects oil equivalent production for the January-to-March quarter of 2018 to be almost at the top end of the initial projection of 9.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoE) to 10 MMBoE. The optimism is backed by SM Energy’s impressive performance in the Permian Basin during the first two months of 2018.The company anticipates crude proportion in the first quarter to be 40% or more. SM Energy maintains its capital budget expectations for the first quarter at $350 million. The company added that a major portion of the 2018 capital budget of roughly $1.27 billion will likely be allotted for the January-to-June period.SM Energy expects significant well completion activities in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford shale in May and June. In other words, all the competed wells will likely commence operations in the months. Although well completions will be higher during the second quarter as compared to first, the company will likely start witnessing growth in production during the July-to-September quarter.Most importantly, the firm expects production in 2019 to be strong although capital allocation for the year will likely be 15% lower. It is to be noted that the well completion numbers through 2019 will be same as last year. Powder River Acres DivestmentAlong with operational updates, the company announced the conclusion of divestment of almost 112,200 net acres in Powder River Basin. The value of the transaction stands at roughly $500 million, which will likely be utilized by the upstream player for reducing debt loads and normal corporate activities. Price PerformanceHeadquartered in Denver, CO, SM Energy is a leading oil and gas explorer with strong focus on North America’s onshore resources.However, the company’s pricing chart is not impressive. Over the past year, the stock has lost 22.8%, underperforming the industry’s12.6% decline.Zacks Rank & Key PicksSM Energy has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1223,CXO,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 995 in the week (ended Mar 23) — higher than the prior week’s 990. Notably, total count increased seven times in the last nine weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 809.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 979, higher than 973.Three rigs operated in the inland waters last week, down from four for the week ended Mar 16. The tally for offshore rigs was flat at 13.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count rose to 804 from 800 for the week ended Mar 16. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 652. The oil rig count rose eight times in the last nine weeks.  Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 190 was up from 189 for the week ended Mar 16. With this, the tally increased six times in nine weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 155.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.2% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 63 units increased from 57 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by a unit to 932 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 13 units — 12 of which were oil-directed — in line with the tally for the week ended Mar 16.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of seven oil rigs in the Permian basin.  West Texas Intermediate crude has crossed the $65-per-barrel mark, thanks to Middle East tensions and the projection of Khalid al-Falih — energy minister of Saudi Arabia — that the production cut accord could get extended till 2019.  Hence, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to continue ramping up drilling activities.  Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc.

1224,CXO,"Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) led Sakhalin-1 project awaits decision on a hike in oil output. The final decision will be announced by the Russia’s Ministry of Natural Resources by the end of April 2018.ExxonMobil’s Russian subsidiary — ExxonNeftegaz — did not disclose any details regarding the news.Located off Russia’s Pacific coast, the Sakhalin-1 oil project abandoned plans to increase output to 250,000-260,000 barrels per day (bpd) after the authorities ordered it to lower production limits to the previous level of 200,000 bpd. As a result, during January-March, there were lower loadings of Sokol crude oil.Per the global oil deal, the countries were to reduce production by the end of 2018. Hence, a rise in production will jeopardize Russia’s commitment.Per another three trading sources, in mid-March, ExxonMobil lowered its Sokol loading plans from De-Kastri terminal for April-June citing the loading schedule.Initially, Sokol loading plans for April and May were estimated at 12 and 11 cargoes, which were later revised to 10 and 9 cargoes, respectively. In June, Sokol loadings were lowered to 9 cargoes from 12 in the initial loading plan.Sakhalin-1 functions under a Production Sharing Agreement struck in the mid-1990s.The local government is required to approve all plans relating to the project.Price PerformanceExxonMobil’s shares have lost 13.2% in the last three months, compared with the industry’s 5.4% decline.Zacks Rank & Key PicksExxonMobil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Continental Resources, Inc (CLR  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc (CXO  -  Free Report).

1226,CXO,"The energy sector has always been a key driver of the quarterly outperformance of the S&P 500 index. In the fourth quarter, the index recorded year-over-year earnings growth of 13.5%. However, excluding Energy, S&P 500’s earnings growth was 11.2%. Also, for first-quarter 2018, we expect Energy to surpass all other sectors, posting earnings growth of 65.7%.Among all the industries belonging to the Energy sector, Oil & Gas-US Exploration & Production seems lucrative with healthy free cash flow and declining debt load. Partial crude price recovery is also a positive for the industry.Oil & Gas-U.S. Exploration & Production Industry The firms belonging to this industry are involved in exploration and production of oil and natural gas in prospective resources – like the Permian basin, Eagle Ford, Utica and the Appalachian basin – spread all over the United States.Operating in this industry needs huge capital spending. The explorers are vulnerable to volatility in oil and gas prices. But, the industry is rewarding too. Partial recovery in oil prices is highly favorable for this industry. From the historical low-mark of $26.21 per barrel hit in February 2016, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose beyond the $60 psychological level. The extension of the production cut deal, first signed in late 2016, by the OPEC players through the end of 2018, primarily initiated the rally in crude.Per the U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA), average WTI crude prices for the first two months of 2018 have been $63.70 per barrel and $62.23 per barrel, respectively. The average monthly oil price had never traded near the $60 per barrel mark since 2015.The AnalysisThere are few parameters that clearly show that investors willing to invest in the energy space should consider this industry.Industry RankIn terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, the Oil & Gas-US Exploration & Production industry is among the top performing industries.The industry is ranked #96 and lies in the top 38% of all industries. The industry has a good industry rank, as the top 50% of the Zacks Ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Decent Upside PotentialWe have employed a trailing 12-month Enterprise Multiple for determining the value of the industry. This is because oil energy players typically shoulder significant debt for investing in growth projects and EV includes debt for valuing a company or industry.Enterprise Multiple = Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDAWe calculate the current EV/EBITDA value for Oil & Gas-US Exploration & Production industry at 12.99. Although the stock’s current valuation is higher than its five-year median EV/ EBITDA of 6.96, the current value is still lower than its five-year high EV/EBITDA of 16.61, reflecting the industry’s healthy upside potential.Sufficient Free Cash Flow to Fund Capital SpendingAfter subtracting capital spending from operating cash flow, we get free cash flow. This is one of the most important parameters when it comes to exploration activities. Positive free cash flow for an industry or a company means the firm is in a position to fund its core operations with its operating cashflow and hence don’t have to rely on debt market heavily.Last year, the Oil & Gas-US Exploration & Production industry spent $935 million of capital and earned $1.2 billion of operating cashflow. Eventually, the industry’s free cash flow was recorded at $248 million, 2.3% higher than 2016. Most importantly, the industry recorded negative free cash flow of $601 million during 2015, thanks to weak crude prices, from where free cash flow turned positive to $242 million in 2016.Declining Debt LoadFrom mid-2014, the market witnessed free fall in crude prices. Following this, it was difficult for explorers to continue their operations and they had to depend on debt financing. Eventually, the balance sheet of most of the explorers were loaded with huge debt.But, with the partial recovery in crude prices, both the long-term and current debt load of the Oil & Gas-US Exploration & Production industry fell drastically.Focus on Oil ExplorersPicking oil explorers seems to be a smart option at this moment. However, selecting winning stocks may be a daunting task.This is where our proprietary Stock Screener comes in handy.

Together, the firms will be able to generate 31,400 megawatts electricity. Their combined power distribution lines will likely spread across 93,600 miles.As of now, the price performances of SCANA and Dominion Energy are not impressive, although the stocks are poised to gain from the merger.

1230,CXO,"Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. But the question here is why? This is simply because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making. Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings!This metric is also considered the most noteworthy variable in influencing share price. But expectations of earnings also play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PriceWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinion on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.Screening Parameters:In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks Rank Buy and Strong Buy are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (stocks with a strong EPS growth history).% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (companies that saw year-over-year earnings growth of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal).% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week).% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates being revised higher in the last 4 weeks).The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only 14.

1232,CXO,"Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) recently released a statement updating its downstream segment’s outlook, bringing in pleasant news for the investors. Post the announcement, shares of the Anglo-Dutch giant have moved up 2.04% to eventually close at $63.48 on Mar 21. The European supermajor now expects strong growth in its downstream segment over the coming years.The company’s downstream segment — comprising refining, marketing/retail and chemical business — reported adjusted income of around $1.4 billion in the last quarter, reflecting a year-over-year increase of more than 4% on the back of improving refining environment and higher marketing contribution.Adapting to the changing times, Shell is successfully reorienting and re-strategizing its business to de-carbonize the energy system. In a bid to generate double-digit returns and maximize the value of its downstream segment, the company is focused on streamlining its portfolio by divesting various projects including Motiva JV, Showa Shell and SADAF petrochemicals. Meanwhile, it is concentrating on modernizing and upgrading its refineries by using superior technologies to derive high-value light products. As such, it is poised for a competitive downstream portfolio, helping the company ride out commodity price fluctuations.  Shell plans to make a yearly investment of around $7-$9 billion in its downstream segment, forecasting a return on average capital employed (ROACE) of more than 15%. The company now forecasts to generate annual organic free cash flow of about $6-$7 billion for its downstream segment by 2020, in line with its prior guidance. It additionally updated its estimates for 2025, aiming to generate $9-$12 billion in annual free cash flow in its downstream business by 2025.The marketing unit, accounting for almost half of Shell’s total downstream unit, is expected to generate more than $1 and $2.5 billion in annual earnings by 2020 and 2025, respectively, with an average annual growth rate exceeding 7%.Annual earnings in its retail division is also likely to grow to $4 billion by 2025 (versus 2.2 billion in 2017), on geographical expansion by tapping in fast-growing markets, premium fuels and lubricants, increase in convenience stores, along with digital and e-mobility services.Shell also aims to reduce its refining integrated margin and improve operational excellence to create more value in the refining division.  The Chemicals business, which had a record year in 2017, is a strong growth priority and set to be the driving factor for the downstream business of the company. The company estimates to generate more than $3.5-$4 billion annually in its Chemicals division by 2025, on the back of increased global demand for petrochemicals that is expected to grow at least 3% per year.Additionally, the division is also set to get a boost from annual capital investment of around $3-$4 million in world-scale projects including local cracker plants, among others. The company’s $6 billion ethane cracker plant in Potter Township will come online by early next decade, generating substantial revenues for Shell. The Alpha olefins and Pernis solvent deasphalting expansion projects in the Netherlands also bode well for the Chemical unit.Shell has had an impressive run on the bourse over a year and possesses a great potential to continue its momentum forward. Shell’s shares have returned 20.8% in a year, outperforming 13.1% gain of the industry it belongs to. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked players in the energy space include Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Concho Resources topped earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average of 48.89%.Pioneer Natural surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 66.92%.Continental Resources delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 64.93% in the preceding four quarters.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1233,CXO,"Following the release of EIA crude inventory numbers, renewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Fed announcement on interest rates, oil prices jumped above the psychologically important $65 per barrel level on Wednesday. West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery gained $1.63, or 2.6%, to settle at $65.17 a barrel in electronic trading yesterday - the highest since early February.Bullish EIA NewsThe federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 2.6 million barrels for the week ending Mar 16, following an increase of 5 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up.An uptick in refinery demand and lower imports led to the surprise stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as U.S. output edged up 26,000 barrels per day last week to 10.4 million barrels per day, the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Stockpiles have shrunk in 36 of the last 50 weeks and are down more than 105 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 428.3 million barrels, current crude supplies are 19.7% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Middle East Tensions, Venezuela and the FedApart from the bullish government data, oil prices were also supported by growing concerns over tensions between major crude producers Iran and Saudi Arabia. There is widespread speculation that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ongoing state visit to Washington is aimed at ramping up pressure to reimpose sanctions on Iran. As it is, last week’s removal of Rex Tillerson as secretary of state raises questions over the future of the Iran nuclear deal. There are indications that the 'more hawkish' Mike Pompeo might lead America's exit from the Iran pact if the European allies do not agree to toughen the terms by May 12. This has injected uncertainty into the oil market by threatening the flow of the Gulf country’s swelling crude exports.Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has dwindled by almost 50% since 2005. Venezuela currently churns out less than 2 million barrels per day, much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts.Finally, oil prices were also supported by the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates. As widely expected, the U.S. central bank opted to hike the benchmark lending rate a quarter-point to between 1.5% and 1.75%. This led to dollar weakness that made the greenback-priced crude more affordable for investors holding foreign currency.Supportive for StocksThe federal data sparked widespread buying in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – up more than 2.6% Wednesday. The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 1.4% and 2.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were also oil and oil-related stocks.An Opportunity to Build a Position in EnergyA steady drawdown of U.S. supplies, healthy demand and ongoing OPEC-led production cuts have driven oil prices higher. Crude has been inching its way back up after falling sharply from $100 a barrel in 2014, to a low of $30 in 2016. The robust fundamental backdrop, which we expect to further strengthen over the course of this year, has brought life back into the sector.Oil’s recovery to $65, predictably, has had a positive effect on stocks in the sector while positioning certain producers to thrive. During the three-year downturn, oil companies worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques. With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50-$60 oil reality.High Quality E&P Names Leading the WayWhile all crude-focused stocks stand to gain from the oil rally, companies in the exploration and production (E&P) sector are the best placed, as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Moreover, the firms boast conservative balance sheets with enough cash on hand and manageable leverage. This provides them ample flexibility to make acquisitions or grow internally. Moreover, driven by operational efficiencies, these entities have been able to reduce unit costs -- an impressive achievement amid the tight realization scenario.To guide investors to the right picks, we highlight 5 stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1234,CXO,"It is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectation. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high-quality in nature.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find Stocks that Can Beat?Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to eight.Here are five out of the eight stocks:Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report): This is a manufacturer and seller of construction and mining equipment. The stock comes from a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 3%). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2.

The company also focuses on renewable energies in the country. Notably, since 2005, the company has hitherto spent more than $100 billion for all its U.S activities.With Susan Dio’s election, BP is going to hand over the reins of responsibility of its vital US operations to a woman for the first time. During 2017, the company’s businesses in the United States contributed to $88.7 billion, representing nearly 34% of the total sales and other operating revenues.Based in London, BP is among the leading integrated energy players in the world. The company boasts an excellent earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average beat being 30.7%. We are also expecting the company to post year-over-year earnings growth of 45.2% through 2018.Also, BP recorded a free cash flow of ($4.6 billion) in 2016 after West Texas Intermediate (WTI  -  Free Report) crude touched a historical low of $26.21 per barrel earlier in the same year.

1236,CXO,"On Mar 21, Antero Resources Corporation (AR  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?For first-quarter 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has been revised upward from 25 cents to 35 cents over the last 60 days. The consensus mark for current-year earnings was raised to $1.29 from $1.03 over the same time period.Antero Resources’ free cashflow for 2017 was recorded at $1.1 billion, up 337.5% from the comparable period last year, courtesy of the partial recovery in natural gas and oil pricing scenario. This reflects the company’s generated sufficient operating cashflow in the preceding year for funding its capital spending.  Last month, Antero Resources reported an increase in total net proved reserves, which by the company’s estimate, grew 12% through 2017 to 17.3 Tcfe (trillion cubic feet equivalent), having entailed higher future liquid and gas production.  During 2017, the upstream energy player enhanced daily production by 22% to 2.3 Bcfe/D (billion cubic feet equivalent). Moreover, the company projects a rise in its net daily output to 2.7 Bcfe/D through 2018. We also appreciate Antero Resources’ sturdy balance sheet. Its total debt to capitalization ratio stands at 35.1%, lower than the industry’s 46.8%. The company’s increased expected production will likely be supported by its strong grip over the prospective Marcellus and Utica Shale plays. In the Utica Shale, Antero Resources’ footing spreads across 137,000 net acres while the company’s Marcellus footprint covers 486,000 net acres.Moreover, Antero Resources’ pricing chart looks impressive. Year to date, shares of the company have outperformed the industry. The stock has gained 3.6% against the industry’s 9.3% decline. Other Stocks to ConsiderOther Zacks #1 Ranked players in the energy space include W&T Offshore, Inc.

1239,CXO,"Per sources, Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE  -  Free Report) is looking for a partner to finance the costs amounting to C$1.3 billion ($993.1 million) relating to the construction of the supporting infrastructure at the company’s Narrows Lake oil sands project in Alberta.The Canadian energy firm’s balance sheet has been under tremendous pressure after it spent C$17 billion on the purchase of oil sands and natural gas assets from ConocoPhillips (COP) last year. Hence, Cenovus Energy has been trying to raise funds in order to reduce its debt burden.Though the transaction increased the company's size by twofold, shareholders have raised concerns with respect to its strained financial position. As a result, Cenovus Energy had to lay off personnel, lower costs and sell assets. In 2017, it raised about C$4 billion from divestments. This year, the company estimates further sales from its Deep Basin position.To refrain from putting further pressure on its balance sheet, Cenovus Energy expects to secure the funds for the above-mentioned construction project from an external partner. In exchange, Cenovus Energy will enter into a long-term agreement with the partner to utilize the assets.Per Cenovus Energy’s website, production from the first phase of Narrows Lake is anticipated at about 65,000 barrels of oil per day. About C$700 million has already been spent for the project’s advancement and another C$1.6-C$1.9 billion will be required to get the site ready for production.Cenovus Energy did not reveal any detail regarding the development. Per sources, a teaser document highlighting the proposal has been sent to potentially interested parties.The Narrows Lake infrastructure has attracted considerable investor interest in recent years, attracted by the stable cash flows they generate. Cenovus Energy is seeking to raise funds for the project as it also simultaneously prepares to divest a number of assets in the company’s Deep Basin position.Price PerformanceCenovus Energy’s shares have lost 5.4% in the last three months against the industry’s 6% decline.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCenovus Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Continental Resources, Inc (CLR  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc (CXO  -  Free Report).

1240,CXO,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 990 in the week (ended Mar 16) — higher than the prior week’s 984. Notably, the total count increased for the fifth time in the prior seven weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 789.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 973, higher than 967.Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the count for the week ended Mar 9. The tally for offshore rigs was also in line at 13.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 800 was up from 796 for the week ended Mar 9. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than the previous year’s count of 631. The tally for oil rigs increased five times in the last six weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 189 was up from 188 for the week ended Mar 9. With this, the tally increased five times in the last six weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 157.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.2% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 57 units decreased from 61 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by 10 units to 933 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 13 units — 12 of which were oil-directed — in line with the tally for the week ended Mar 9.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring oil and gas in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of four and three onshore rigs in Oklahoma  and North Dakota respectively. Two onshore rigs were also added in Texas.Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil has been trading mostly over the $60-per-barrel mark since January, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to continue ramping up drilling activities.  Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1241,CXO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a massive weekly build as domestic oil production reached another all-time high. However, product inventories (gasoline and distillate) fell sharply, which offset the bearish impact of the crude oil inventory increase.The front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures ended at $61.19 per barrel yesterday.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 5 million barrels for the week ending Mar 9, following an increase of 2.4 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 2.5 million barrels.Record high domestic production led to the massive stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as imports fell and refiner demand strengthened.In particular, U.S. output rose by 12,000 barrels per day last week to nearly 10.4 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.While oil inventories rose for a third successive week, stockpiles have shrunk in 35 of the last 49 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 430.9 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18.4% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 338,000 barrels to 28.5 million barrels. It is the first time in 12 weeks that Cushing inventories have increased after dropping to the lowest level since December 2014.The crude supply cover was up from 26.7 days in the previous week to 26.9 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 34.1 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their second weekly decrease in a row as demand strengthened. The 6.3 million barrels draw – significantly above the polled number of 500,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 244.8 million barrels. Following last week’s hefty decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains just below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were down 4.4 million barrels last week, comfortably exceeding analysts’ expectations for 1.6 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to lower production and imports. At 133.1 million barrels, current supplies are 15.4% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 2% from the prior week to 90%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Concho Resources Inc.

1242,CXO,"Brazil's state-run energy giant Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (PBR  -  Free Report) or Petrobras announced fourth-quarter earnings per ADR of 20 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents. However, the bottom line fell by a penny year over year. The earnings beat was supported by higher oil prices, partially negated by lower production and decreased margin from downstream operations.Petrobras’ free cash flows through 2017 increased almost 12% to $13,850 million, reflecting that the company has sufficient operating cashflow to support investment. However, adjusted EBITDA was down 6% year over year to $24,039 million. During 2017, exports of oil and oil products rose 23%, while imports fell 18%. This helped the company maintain the position of net exporter with a positive balance of 361 thousand barrels per day.Asset Disposal PlanOver the 2017-2018 period, the company intends to rake in proceeds of $21 billion from asset sale. This will help Petrobras strengthen its balance sheet by lowering debt.Revenue, Production and PricesThe troubled national oil company’s net fourth-quarter 2017 operating revenues of $23,567 million improved from the year-earlier sales of $21,403 million on higher crude prices but fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26,321 million.The Rio de Janeiro-headquartered company’s total oil and gas production during the fourth quarter reached 2,737 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d) — 80.4% liquids — down from 2,868 MBOE/d in the same period of 2016. The decline can be attributed to issues related to operations in the Hadrian South gas field.Compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, Brazilian oil and natural gas production — constituting 96% of the overall output — dropped 4% to 2,636 MBOE/d.  In the October-to-December period, the average sales of oil in Brazil jumped 22.1% from the year-earlier period to $55.82 per barrel.Capital Spending & Balance SheetDuring the year ended Dec 31, 2017, Petrobras’ capital investments and expenditures totaled $13,639 million, lower than $14,085 million incurred in the year-ago period.This allowed the world's most indebted oil company to record the lowest debt over the last six years. At the end of December 2017, the company had net debt of $84,871 million, reflecting a decline from $96,381 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Net debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 51%, down from 55% a year ago. Additionally, Petrobras ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $22,519 million.Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksPetrobras carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that it is expected to perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.

1243,CXO,"On Mar 15, EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?For first-quarter 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has been revised higher from 82 cents to 88 cents over the last 30 days. The consensus estimate for 2018 earnings was revised to $4.11 from $3.60 over the same period.Moreover, the leading oil and gas explorer has an impressive earnings surprise history, the average positive earnings surprise being 25.7% for the last four quarters.Along with the announcement of fourth-quarter results last month, EOG Resources reported an increase in total net proved reserves. Through 2017, the company saw an 18% increase in net proved reserves to 2,527 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), which entails higher future oil and gas production.We appreciate the company’s decision to complete higher wells during 2018. This year, EOG Resources plans for the completion of 690 net oil and gas wells versus 536 last year. Importantly, the company believes that a minimum of 90% of the completed wells will be premium. Such wells contribute 30% after tax return even if crude and natural gas traded lower at $40 per barrel and $2.50 per MMBtu respectively, per EOG Resources.EOG Resources has set a capital budget of $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion for 2018. Majority of the budget is expected to be spent for oil-rich resources like Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and the Bakken. The decision seems impressive given that the company has a trailing 12-month return on capital investment of 3.1%, significantly higher than 1.9% of the Zacks Oil & Gas-U.S Exploration industry. Also, the upstream energy firm has gained 2.9% over the past year against the industry’s 12.7% decline. Other Stocks to ConsiderOther Zacks #1 Ranked players in the energy space include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc.

W&T Offshore added that the earlier budget will be adequate to finance the drilling programs of mutiple wells.The program’s total capital expenditure is projected at $419.6 million by the upstream firm. The amount could increase once the company includes more drilling sites in its project portfolio.For bearing almost 80% expenses of the drilling program, 70% of net revenues will be allotted to the investor group. Eventually, W&T Offshore could get the remaining 30% revenues. It is to be noted that W&T Offshore will be entitled to 38.4% of net revenues after the investor group could manage a specific return from the wells.Headquartered in Houston, TX, W&T Offshore is primarily an exploration and production player with focus on prospective resources, located off the coast of Gulf of Mexico.

1246,CXO,"CNX Resources Corporation’s (CNX  -  Free Report) shares have gained 11.6% in a year’s time, against a decline of 10.7% in the Zacks Domestic E&P Oil and Gas industry.. CNX Resources is benefiting on the back of strong production from its Marcellus and Utica Shale holdings, and cost improvement.  CNX Resources planned its 2018 drilling and completion (D&C) expenditures in the range of $515-$580 million. Out of the D&C expenditures for 2018, 65% will be for the Marcellus Shale and 35% for the Utica Shale.Investments in both the resource-rich regions will help the company increase production volumes and meet its 2018 production volumes of 520-550 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), or nearly 31% annual increase based on the midpoint of its guidance. The company expects to drill 75 wells in 2018 and turn-in-line 59, and out of those 59 wells 46 will be in the Marcellus.CNX Resources was able to lower total quarterly natural gas production costs to $2.17 per thousand cubic feet equivalent (Mcfe), compared with the year-earlier quarter of $2.27 per Mcfe, driven primarily by reductions in operating and gathering, and transportation expenses, due to increased volumes. The company aims to lower costs further in 2018.However, exploration & production of natural gas involves loads of operational risks. The cost of drilling, completing and operating its shale gas wells, shallow oil and gas wells, and coalbed methane wells is often uncertain. A number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations, decrease production and/or increase the cost of its natural gas operations at particular sites for varying lengths of time, thereby adversely affecting its operating results.CNX Resources Corporation has a Zacks Rank#3 (Hold).

1249,CXO,"Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) announced a new share repurchase plan after receiving authorization from its board of directors. Through 2018, the explorer will likely buy back shares worth $1 billion.Late 2017, the company declared a $500-million stock buyback plan. The recent announcement reflects the firm’s strong commitment toward returning cash back to stock holders on a regular basis.The business scenario has improved owing to the partial recovery in crude. From the historical low-mark of $26.21 per barrel touched in February 2016, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude crossed the $60 psychological level. A rally in oil price is highly favorable for key upstream energy players like Hess.The company foresees higher oil and gas production which when combined with healthy oil prices will likely boost cashflow. Hess added that with the new buyback program, it will not compromise with its potential to invest in key developments like Guyana and Bakken. Earlier, the company had announced that majority of its 2018 capital budget will likely get allotted toward low-cost resources in Bakken and projects located off the coast of Guyana.Overall, with the robust business outlook, the management might think the company’s shares are undervalued and hence is the right time to boost share buyback.Headquartered in New York, Hess is a leading explorer with a solid balance sheet.

1255,CXO,"There is no mystery behind investors’ hunt for stocks with estimate beating potential ahead of an earnings season. This is because investors always try to place themselves ahead of time and look to play stocks that are rich in quality.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if it has been decelerating.Also, seasonal fluctuations can come into play. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after a whole lot of research and analysis on a company’s financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project its earnings. They also take a company’s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Locate Potential Outperformers? Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is a dream that investors chase but might not always come true. One way of fulfilling it is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a driver in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to exceed estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the followingas our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to eight.Here are five out of the eight stocks:Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report): This is an industrial manufacturing company. The stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 5%). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2.

(CRK  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 loss of 31 cents per share (excluding one-time items), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 94 cents.

Further, Comstock’s quarterly loss also significantly narrowed from the year-ago adjusted loss of $2.58 per share.Quarterly revenues increased to $73.2 million from $48.5 million a year ago, driven by higher natural gas sales. Revenues from natural gas sales jumped 75.4% to $61.2 million in the quarter under review. The top line was also slightly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $72 million.Comstock Resources, Inc.

1257,CXO,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).   DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 981 in the week (ended Mar 2) — higher than the prior week’s 978. Notably, the total count increased for four in the prior six weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated with a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 756.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 963, higher than 959. Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, up from the count of two for the week ended Feb 23.  However, the tally for offshore was 14, down from 17 in the prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 800 was up from 799 for the week ended Feb 23. Further, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 609. It should be noted that since 2015, the count of rigs exploring for oil touched 800 for the first time.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 181 was up from 179 for the week ended Feb 23. With this, the tally increased thrice in the last four weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 146.  Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 59 units decreased from 67 units. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by 11 units to 922 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 14 units — 13 of which were oil-directed — compared with 17 units for the week ended Feb 23.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of two gas rigs in the Marcellus shale play.Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil has been trading mostly over the $60-per-barrel mark since January, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to continue ramping up drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

1262,CXO,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged gains.On the news front, upstream energy biggies Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) and Devon Energy Corp. (DVN  -  Free Report) came up with their respective earnings reports, while natural gas operator EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report) announced plans to separate its midstream business into a new publicly traded company.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 3.3% to close at $63.55 per barrel, while natural gas prices increased 3.9% to $2.657 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Occidental, Williams, Marathon Report Strong Q4)The U.S. oil benchmark scored its second consecutive weekly bump. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a surprise drop.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 35 of the last 46 weeks and are down more than 110 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall – stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiraling exports – has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 420.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18.9% below the year-ago period.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved higher last week following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. The improvement was primarily on account of strength in the commodity’s production amid the upcoming conclusion to the winter heating season.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Concho Resources reported strong fourth-quarter results on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth. The independent energy explorer came out with net earnings per share of 66 cents, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. The bottom line also improved significantly from the prior-year quarter adjusted income of 20 cents per share.Concho Resources' average quarterly volume increased 28% year over year to 211 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (exceeding the high-end of the company’s guidance range), of which 61.6% was liquids. Overall, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company fetched $40.18 per barrel compared with $34.70 a year ago. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Concho Resources has provided a preliminary guidance for 2018. The company expects its total production to grow 16-20%, with crude oil growth about 20%. The upstream player forecasts its output to grow at 20% CAGR over the 2017-2020 timeframe. Capital expenditures for 2018 are estimated to be around $2 billion. (Read more Concho's Q4 Earnings Top on Price, Output Gains)2.    Devon Energy reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 38 cents, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents by 36.7%. The underperformance primarily stemmed from an accounting change and lower-than-expected production volumes, partly offset by higher realized prices.In the fourth quarter of 2017, total production touched 548,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day. The actual production was lower than the expected range of 551,000-571,000 Boe per day. Meanwhile, realized oil prices in the quarter were $42.21 per barrel, up 20.9% from $34.90 per barrel in the year-ago quarter. Realized prices for natural gas were up 11.2% to $2.48 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) from $2.23 per Mcf in the prior-year quarter.Devon estimates total production from its assets in the first quarter of 2018 in the range of 530,000-554,000 Boe per day. Full-year production is expected in the range of 552,000-576,000 Boe per day. Capital expenditure (capex) in the first quarter of 2018 is anticipated within $585-$700 million. 2018 capex is expected in the range of $2.33-$2.61 billion.(Read more Devon's Q4 Earnings Lag Estimates, Expands Reserves)3.    Natural gas producer EQT Corporation’s board of directors has finally succumbed to months of pressure from investors and agreed to separate the company's upstream and midstream businesses. It will form an independent publicly traded company (NewCo), whose operations will focus on the midstream businesses of EQT. The deal is devised to be tax-free for the company's shareholders, who will retain their EQT shares and receive a pro-rata share of the NewCo.The spin-off is expected to enable the company to concentrate on its upstream assets, and exploration and production business. The deal will leave EQT with 680,000 core Marcellus acres and 65,000 Ohio Utica acres.With the shale production to ramp up in the coming quarters, this move can help the company benefit largely through efficient allocation of capital, compared with the previous company set-up that constrained the company's returns in the recent years. Additionally, $2.3-$2.8 billion of free cash flow over the 2019-2023 timeframe is expected to trickle down from the move, which forecasts 10-15% annual production growth. (Read more Will EQT's Spin-Off of Midstream Businesses Prove Beneficial?)4.    U.S. energy firm Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter earnings per share – excluding one-time items – of 33 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. The bottom line also turned around from the year-ago adjusted loss of 6 cents. The outperformance stems from higher oil realizations, and lower cost.The production of oil and natural gas (excluding divested assets and non-controlling interests) averaged 362,251 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d) (68% liquids), essentially flat from last year. The company aims to grow production by 7-13% in the next year. The average realized crude oil price during the fourth quarter was $58.36 per barrel, representing an increase of 23.1% from the year-ago realization of $47.39.Apache’s fourth quarter lease operating expenses totaled $334 million, down 10.9% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, total costs and expenses fell 16.4% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to $1,308 million.

(LNG  -  Free Report) reported strong fourth-quarter results on robust production volumes and strong pricing. The company’s net income per share came in at 54 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents and the comparable 2016 period profit of 48 cents.During the quarter, the company shipped 70 cargoes from Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas terminal in Louisiana. Total volumes lifted in the reported quarter were 252 trillion British thermal units.Overall costs and expenses soared 190% to $1,305 million from the same quarter last year. The increase is mainly attributed to the higher cost of sales which jumped to $980 million compared with $229 million in the prior-year quarter, while operating and maintenance expenses rose 87.7% year-over-year to $137 million.Cheniere Energy raised its EBITDA guidance for full-year 2018 following the better-than-expected profit.

1265,CXO,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 978 in the week ended Feb 23 — higher than the prior week’s 975. Notably, the total count increased for three in the prior five weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 754.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 959, higher than 956. Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, up from the count of one for the week ended Feb 16.  However, the tally for offshore was 17, down from 18 in the prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 799 was up from 798 for the week ended Feb 16. Further, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 602.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 179 was up from 177 for the week ended Feb 16. With this, the tally increased twice in the last three weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 151.  Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 67 units increased from 65. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by one unit to 911.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 17 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — compared with 18 for the week ended Feb 16.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of two oil rigs in each of Permian basin and Cana Woodford resources. Moreover, the Utica and Haynesville basins added one natural gas rig each.Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil has been trading mostly over the $60-per-barrel mark since January, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to continue ramping up drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc.

The tragedy, one of the deadliest oil and gas related accidents in the last few years, occurred at one of Patterson-UTI's APEX 1500 rigs and killed five workers.However, Patterson-UTI’s performance improved from the year-ago loss of 53 cents per share as shale drilling picked up amid rebounding oil prices.Revenues of $787.3 million compared with $246.9 million in the year-ago quarter and were also higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $760 million.Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc.

However, average direct costs per operating day came in at $12,940, down from $13,770 in the year-ago quarter. The segment was also boosted by a jump in both the operating days (from 6,288 to 14,776) and the number of rigs operational (from 68 to 161) on the back of resilience in Patterson-UTI’s operations amid an improving market.Consequently, the segment recorded operating loss of $16.4 million – significantly narrower than the loss of $62.5 million incurred in the year-earlier quarter.Pressure Pumping: Revenues of $406.7 million almost trebled from the year-ago sales of $105.6 million.

However, the rebound in commodity prices notwithstanding, the unit incurred a wider quarterly loss of $7.8 million, as against the loss of $1.1 million recorded in year-ago quarter. The deterioration was mainly on account of steep rise in direct operating costs – from $2.8 million to $20.9 million.Direct Operating CostsThe company – whose larger rival Helmerich & Payne Inc.

The company has 130 of them in its fleet with 98% under contract.While Patterson-UTI sees an average rig count of 169 in the first quarter, it also expects average rig revenue per day to increase $300 sequentially, driven by favorable repricing of short-term contracts. At the same time, average rig operating cost per day is also expected to go up in the first quarter.Patterson-UTI expects an average of 96 rigs to be operational under term contracts during the first quarter and 67 for the entire 2018.In pressure pumping, the company expects first quarter revenues to fall slightly from the fourth quarter due to weather-related disruptions.

1272,CXO,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly draw to reach the lowest level since 2015. But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was partly offset by another build in gasoline supplies. On a further bearish note, domestic oil production maintained its steadily rising trend that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 0.9% (or 53 cents) to end at $58.09 per barrel yesterday. Energy Stocks JumpThe federal data sparked widespread buying in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – up more than 1.4% Wednesday. The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report). Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 6.5 million barrels for the week ending Dec 15, following a decrease of 5.1 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.2 million barrels. An uptick in refinery demand led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as U.S. output edged up 9,000 barrels per day last week to 9.8 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 29 of the last 37 weeks and are down nearly 97 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 436.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 10.1% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year. Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 754,000 barrels to 53 million barrels. The crude supply cover was down from 26.1 days in the previous week to 25.6 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.5 days. Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the sixth straight week on strong production. The 1.2 million barrels addition – more than the polled number of 1.1 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 227.8 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 0.4% below the year-earlier level but is close to the upper limit of the average range. Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) was up 769,000 barrels last week, greater than analysts’ expectations. The weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 128.8 million barrels, current supplies are 16.1% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year. Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.7% from the prior week to 94.1%. About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report The Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad. The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry. Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?

1273,CXO,"The Vienna meeting between 14 OPEC members and crude exporters outside the cartel, headed by Russia, has been quite a breather for energy investors. The crude output cut deal extension beyond the January-to-March quarter of 2018 is expected to drive oil prices outside the bearish territory.The move was taken in order to fight the global crude glut that affected the energy market for more than three years, leaving oil explorers with weak balance sheets. In fact, many upstream players were facing difficulties in continuing operations after oil started hitting multi-year lows post mid-2014.  We believe that this measure taken by OPEC and Russia will benefit U.S. shale players. Drillers in the domestic shale resources will cash in on the favorable crude pricing environment to strengthen their financials. Most importantly, the rebound in exploration activities in the domestic shale segment will boost oil supply and partially nullify the impact of the OPEC agreement.OPEC Extends Deal as ExpectedOn Nov 30, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting.As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Through the end of next year, Saudi Arabia, Russia and their allies pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market.The crude price chart of oilprice.com clearly showed that following the conclusion of the Vienna meeting, on Dec 1, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil traded at $58.72 per barrel on 9:51 am CST, close to $59.05 — the highest since mid-2015.Boon for US Shale DrillersThe extended agreement is driving oil toward bullish territory. This is a blessing for domestic shale companies as favorable crude pricing has made exploration operations lucrative.With more profit, shale drillers will be able to lessen their debt, which has been accumulating since the crude-weakness era after mid-2014. Also, domestic explorers might resume returning cash to stockholders through dividend hikes and share repurchases.Which Oil Stocks to Pick?Oil drillers are flocking to U.S. crude resources, per the latest report by Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report). Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 929 in the week ended Dec 1 — higher than the prior week’s 923. This marked an increase for four consecutive weeks after the tally fell for five weeks in a row.Hence, investing in fundamentally sound shale drillers is likely to be prudent. We have employed our proprietary Stock Screener to shortlist four stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Based in Minnetonka, MN, Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report) has exploration and production operations in the Bakken shale, and contributed significant crude production in the last four decades.The company sports a Zacks Rank #1, and has managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise being 175%.

1276,CXO,"It was a week where the price of oil spiked to its highest mark in more than two years and natural gas futures rose marginally.On the news front, integrated major Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), as well as Permian-focused upstream oil and gas explorers –  EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) – came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, driven by higher commodity prices.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 3.2% to close at $55.64 per barrel, while natural gas prices edged up 0.7% to $2.984 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Exxon, Chevron, TOTAL Report Strong Q3.)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied to its highest settlement since July 2015 on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release, which showed steep declines in domestic gasoline and distillate inventories, apart from a bigger-than-expected fall in domestic crude supplies.Upbeat U.S. economic data sets and signs of recovery in global demand growth was also bullish for oil prices.Meanwhile, natural gas futures logged a small gain following an in-line increase in supplies. Favorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s demand provided further upside.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Europe’s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell reported strong third-quarter results on all round contribution from all its segments.

(APA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter earnings per share – excluding one-time items – of 4 cents, versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 5 cents. The bottom line also turned around from the year-ago adjusted loss of 3 cents. The outperformance stems from higher oil and gas realizations, and lower cost.The average realized crude oil price during the third quarter was $49.34 per barrel, representing an increase of 11.3% from the year-ago realization of $44.35. Moreover, the average realized natural gas price during the September quarter of 2017 was $2.75 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 6.2% from the year-ago period.Apache’s third quarter lease operating expenses totaled $358 million, down 6.3% from the year-ago quarter.

But Apache is now looking to increase its capital investment after achieving cost rationalization. Keeping with the company’s planned shift in strategic objective, Apache’s oil and gas capital investments totaled $843 million during the July-September period, 95.1% higher than the $432 million incurred a year ago.

The positive comparisons can be primarily attributable to higher oil prices and strict cost control, which helped its biggest unit — exploration and production — to swing to profitability.Average realized crude oil price during the first nine months of 2017 was $48.76 per barrel, representing a 36.2% jump from the year-ago period. Further, natural gas price rose 8.6% year-over-year to $5.07 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf).

The better-than-expected results were driven by cost-containment efforts, production growth and higher commodity price realizations. In particular, oil and natural gas prices moved up 10.4% and 7.25%, respectively, compared with the year-ago quarter, which provided an impetus to the finances of the company. Further, Comstock’s quarterly loss significantly narrowed from the year-ago adjusted loss of $3.27 per share.Quarterly revenues increased to $66.8 million from $50.3 million a year ago. The higher realized prices and increased natural gas production resulted in higher revenues. Revenues from the natural gas sales jumped 52.7% to $56.2 million in the quarter under review.

1279,CXO,"The third-quarter earnings season passed the half way mark last week. Total earnings for the 272 S&P members, that have already released results, are up 8.7% year over year on 6.7% higher revenues, with 75.7% beating earnings and 66.2% topping revenue estimates.  This is going to be another busy week with 900 companies expected to release earnings including 134 members of the S&P 500. Combining the results of the 272 S&P 500 members with the index’s 228 members yet to report, we expect total earnings to be up 5.4% year over year on 5.5% higher revenues.Amid this positive backdrop let us focus on Zacks Oil and Energy Sector this earnings season. Earnings from this sector are expected to be up 148.2% from the same period last year on 19.7% higher revenues. Read more details in our weekly Earnings Preview.The primary reason behind the performance is the improvement in oil prices. Oil price at the end of third quarter was $51.67 per barrel, reflecting a sequential improvement of 10.5%. Oil prices also improved on a year-over-year basis.Few oil and gas companies had to cope with the impact of hurricanes that disrupted operation during the quarter. Gradually these companies are going back to pre-hurricane production levels. At the same time, sudden outages of the refineries and production cuts has pushed up the prices due to the fear of supply shortage.Let us focus on the oil companies scheduled to release third-quarter earnings on Oct 31.Devon Energy Corporation (DVN  -  Free Report) reported a positive earnings surprise of 3.03% in the previous quarter. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Devon Energy’s production is driven by contribution from its domestic resource plays. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily production in the quarter from the United States will be 412,000 barrels of oil (boe) per day.However, Hurricane Harvey had an adverse impact on company’s production from Eagle Ford and adjoining areas. Devon expects its net U.S. liquids production to decline 15,000 barrels per day in the quarter due to the hurricane.For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Devon Energy’s revenues is pegged at $3,615 million, indicating 25.2% year-over-year and 3.3% sequential decline. The likely drop in production and estimated fall in realized price are expected to adversely impact financial performance of the company in the quarter.Devon Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Devon Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Devon Energy Corporation QuoteDevon Energy’s Earnings ESP is -0.02%.

The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Anadarko Petroleum reaffirmed production guidance range for the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, DJ and Delaware basin assets.

1281,CXO,"Over the last three years, the energy market has experienced intense price volatility. However, it seems that following an extended period of relative weakness, energy stocks are finally on their way to recovery. With crude now back over $50 and natural gas revolving around the pivot point of $3, the panic that swept over the market are all but gone. The incredible turnaround has stoked high expectations from the energy sector going into the penultimate quarter of 2017.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the third quarter of this year and what makes the Energy sector a material factor this earnings season.Q3 Report Card: Prices End on a Positive NoteOil: The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative.The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. Moreover, energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year. Also, supply from the 14-member OPEC cartel is set to remain constraint for at least the next six months, helping to tighten the market significantly. Adding to the positive momentum, OPEC and Russia claimed to be on the right track in clearing the global oil glut with half the job done.With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil ended the third quarter at $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude futures hovered around the $45 per barrel mark.Natural Gas: Natural gas fared badly, dropping about 3.5% in the July-September period, thanks to the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages.Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices are in a sweet spot compared to the corresponding period of 2016. The commodity futures ended the quarter at $3 per MMBtu, up more than 3% from the Sep 30, 2016 settlement of $2.9 per MMBtu.Energy Companies to Gain from Higher Prices: All oil/gas-related stocks stand to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index. The April-June period turned out to be a rather good one with earnings for the sector recording a massive 252.7% jump from the same period last year – the most among all 16 broad Zacks sectors by a long way – on 16.8% higher revenues.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q3 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas both improved from the year-ago period. In fact, the strongest growth in Q3 is again set to come from the Energy sector. As per our Earnings Preview report, earnings for the sector are expected to be up 122.4% from the third quarter of 2016, while the top-line is likely to show an impressive growth of 17.9%.How to Identify the Outperformers?The encouraging figures suggest that there are a number of companies likely to beat our third quarter earnings estimates.Investing in such companies can fetch handsome returns for investors. This is because a stock generally surges upon earnings beat.But with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver better-than-expected earnings.While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, our proprietary methodology - Earnings ESP - makes it relatively simple. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement.

1283,CXO,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 10.6% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Concho Beats Q2 Earnings, Lifts Production OutlookConcho Resources reported second-quarter adjusted net earnings per share of $0.52, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.43 and double the prior-year quarter adjusted income of $0.26.The outperformance came on the back of higher commodity prices and strong production growth.Concho Resources’ total operating revenues for the second quarter amounted to $567 million, which increased substantially from $396 million a year ago but was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $649 million.The Permian Basin AdvantageExperts say that it’s cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin than most other major fields. Moreover, there are certain parts of the shale play whose well-returns are the best in the U.S. With crude prices still down significantly from their 2014 levels, well returns have become a very important metric to gauge profitability.Permian’s attractive economics means that producers can still make money there at the current, just over-$50-a-barrel price. This is mainly because of the region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labor and supplies, and relatively warm winters that makes year-round work possible. Most other domestic shale regions need prices above $60 to support new developments and expansions.Volume AnalysisConcho Resources' average quarterly volume increased 27% year over year to 184.7 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 61% was liquids. Daily oil output was up 27% to 113.2 thousand barrels, while natural gas production came in at 428.8 million cubic feet (up 28%).Realized PricesThe average realized natural gas price jumped 44% from the year-ago quarter to $2.71 per thousand cubic feet, while average oil price realization increased 7% to $44.75 per barrel. Overall, the company fetched $33.73 per barrel as against $30.00 a year back.Balance Sheet & Capital ExpenditureAs of Jun 30, 2017, Concho Resources had approximately $662 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company had long-term debt of $2,741 million, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 23.9%.GuidanceFollowing second-quarter’s impressive production growth, Concho Resources raised its full-year production growth guidance range to 24%–26%, from the prior 21%–25%.The company has provided third quarter net production guidance of 186–190 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Capital expenditures for 2017 are estimated to be between $1,600 and $1,700 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower.Concho Resources Inc. Price and Consensus  Concho Resources Inc. Price and Consensus | Concho Resources Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F.

1284,CXO,"The blue-chip index registered its 33rd record for 2017 to finish above the 22,000 threshold yet again on a day marked by losses for other benchmarks. Further, the Dow notched its eighth straight daily rise, buoyed by an increase in shares of Pfizer. The S&P 500 ended in the red after the energy sector slumped due to a steep fall in the shares of Concho Resources and Apache Corp. Nasdaq continued its lackluster performance as it ended in the red again and this has primarily been due to the tech overvaluation issue.

"
1287,CXO,"The blue-chip index continued its winning streak on Thursday after crossing the psychological milestone for the second time on the trot. This performance can be attributed to a 1.6% rise in shares of Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report). However, decline in a 1% decline in shares of Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) weighed on the Dow Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) shares fell by an identical amount, following spectacular gains for the iPhone maker in the aftermath of strong third quarter results.

"
1289,CXO,"The S&P 500 ended in the negative territory on Thursday after a slump in the energy sector with the Energy Select SPDR declining 1.3%. Eight of the eleven major industry sectors closed in the red with the energy sector leading the decliners. The tumble in the energy sector was triggered by a steep decline in the shares of Concho Resources (CXO  -  Free Report) and Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) which declined 8.7% and 8.1%, respectively.
"
1290,CXO,"Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $49.03 per barrel, declining 1.1%. This decline occurred after investors decided to refrain from investing in the commodity, preferring to wait until the much anticipated OPEC meeting slated for next week unfolds. Crude prices also took a hit following news that oil trader Andy Hall was closing his energy-centric hedge fund after this prediction that oil prices would climb faster in 2017 went wrong, resulting in a loss of 30%. Further, with Trump and party in a legislative straight jacket, market watchers are increasingly losing faith in him and this has led to broader losses for S&P 500.Economic Data

(CXO  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter adjusted net earnings per share of 52 cents, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents and double the prior-year quarter adjusted income of 26 cents.The outperformance came on the back of higher commodity prices and strong production growth.Concho Resources’ total operating revenues for the second quarter amounted to $567 million, which increased substantially from $396 million a year ago but was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $649 million.Concho Resources Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Concho Resources Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Concho Resources Inc. QuoteThe Permian Basin AdvantageExperts say that it’s cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin than most other major fields. Moreover, there are certain parts of the shale play whose well-returns are the best in the U.S. With crude prices still down significantly from their 2014 levels, well returns have become a very important metric to gauge profitability.Permian’s attractive economics means that producers can still make money there at the current, just over-$50-a-barrel price. This is mainly because of the region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labor and supplies, and relatively warm winters that makes year-round work possible. Most other domestic shale regions need prices above $60 to support new developments and expansions.Apart from Concho Resources, other key players in the Permian Basin are Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report), as well as biggies like ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report).Volume AnalysisConcho Resources' average quarterly volume increased 27% year over year to 184.7 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 61% was liquids. Daily oil output was up 27% to 113.2 thousand barrels, while natural gas production came in at 428.8 million cubic feet (up 28%).Realized PricesThe average realized natural gas price jumped 44% from the year-ago quarter to $2.71 per thousand cubic feet, while average oil price realization increased 7% to $44.75 per barrel. Overall, the company fetched $33.73 per barrel as against $30.00 a year back.Balance Sheet & Capital ExpenditureAs of Jun 30, 2017, Concho Resources had approximately $662 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company had long-term debt of $2,741 million, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 23.9%.GuidanceFollowing second-quarter’s impressive production growth, Concho Resources – a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock – raised its full-year production growth guidance range to 24%–26%, from the prior 21%–25%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company has provided third quarter net production guidance of 186–190 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Capital expenditures for 2017 are estimated to be between $1,600 and $1,700 million.Share PerformanceShares of Concho Resources have lost 5.3% during the second quarter versus the 16.9% decline of the industry.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017                 From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

1298,CXO,"Markets are a little more than halfway through the Q2 earnings season, with 57.2% S&P 500 members having reported results as of Friday, Apr 28.Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q2 results from 286 S&P 500 members that combined account for 68.8% of the index’s total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 11.3 from the same period last year on 6.1% higher revenues, with 74.5% positive earnings surprises and 69.2% beating revenue estimates.Energy Earnings SoarThe ‘Energy’ sector has been off to a spectacular start. For the 48.5% sector components on the S&P 500 index that have reported Q2 results, total earnings surged 226.2% on 15.5% higher revenues. While 50% of the companies have been successful in beating earnings estimates, 81.3% outperformed the top line.Energy: First Half RecapLast year, 'Energy' was the strongest S&P sector performer, with a market-thumping 24% return. In particular, November's historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement, and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better.The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017 with the oil industry finally hoping that 'this would be the year.' True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest level in 19 months.However, the situation is drastically different now, with the commodity floundering in recent weeks. By Jun 21, crude had cratered more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory. In fact, prices ended down 14.3% for the first half of the year – the worst performance since 1998.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year.Strong Q2 Earnings Growth PredictionA look back at the Q1 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index.The Jan-Mar 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with both oil and natural gas prices benefiting from easier comparison figures from the year-ago period. While crude slumped to some 12-year low in the first quarter of 2016, natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years.As a result, the sector – whose year-earlier comparison was to an aggregate loss – came out swinging. For the sector components on the S&P 500 index, total Q1 earnings saw robust year-over-year dollar growth on 33.8% higher revenues. While 69.7% of the companies were successful in beating earnings estimates, 63.6% outperformed the top line.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q2 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 249.0% – the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors – the top line is likely to show an improvement of 16.5% from the second-quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Aug 2Let’s see what’s in store for four energy companies expected to come up with June quarter numbers on Wednesday, Aug 2, after market close.First, we have energy infrastructure provider The Williams Companies Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report). In the previous quarter, this Tulsa, OK-headquartered transporter of oil and gas missed estimates, weighed down by rising costs and expenses.Regarding earnings surprises, The Williams Companies has a decent record, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports. And our model indicates that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around too.This is because, as per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the quarter to be reported, The Williams Companies has an Earnings ESP of +50.00% and a Zacks Rank #3, wh the right combination of two key ingredients. (Read more: Is Williams Companies Poised for a Beat in Q2 Earnings?)Simultaneously, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Williams Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteHeadquartered in Houston, TX, Occidental petroleum Corp. (OXY  -  Free Report) is another energy player set to report second-quarter 2017 results. The company – with significant exploration and production exposure, together with chemical and midstream operations – has a mixed track of having outperformed estimates in two of the last four quarters.However, Occidental Petroleum is not expected to add to its positive surprises in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the company has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. (Read more: Is Disappointment Likely for Occidental in Q2 Earnings?)Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Occidental Petroleum Corporation QuoteThen there is Houston, TX-based leading upstream energy firm Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) coming up with April-June operational results.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, Marathon Oil – whose business is organized into North America and International segments – has an excellent history, having gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four reports. However, with an Earnings ESP of -7.14% and a Zacks Rank #4, our proven model shows that an earnings beat is unlikely for Marathon Oil in the upcoming quarterly release. (Read more: Will Marathon Oil Disappoint Investors in Q2 Earnings?)Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation QuoteLastly, we have Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) reporting second-quarter 2017 results. Coming to the earnings surprise history, this Midland, TX-headquartered energy explorer – with producing properties mainly in the Permian Basin of southeast New Mexico and west Texas – has been on a bull run: it went past estimates in all the last four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 247.57%.Powered with the right combination of two key ingredients – an Earnings ESP of +2.33% and Zacks Rank #3 – our proven model shows that an earnings beat is likely for Concho Resources in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Concho Resources Inc.

1299,CXO,"Domestic energy explorer Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Aug 3.Founded in 1954, Houston, TX-based Apache – which counts Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) as its peers – is one of the world's leading independent energy companies engaged in the exploration, development, and production of natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids.In the preceding three-month period, the company reported adjusted loss of 8 cents per share, which compared unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 16 cents. The underperformance stems from a dip in output due to a conservative capital budget over the last two years.  Apache’s earnings surprise history is disappointing. The company missed estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average negative surprise of 46.40%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Apache Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Apache Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayAs compared to the year-ago quarter, the pricing scenario for both crude and natural gas has improved considerably. This bodes well for Apache as it has been able to sell its output at favorable prices.  However, for second-quarter 2017, Apache expects production in the range of 376–386 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d), lower than 460.8 Mboe/d in the year-ago quarter. Hence, lower projected output due to planned maintenance and reduced spending may negatively impact Apache’s earnings. The company’s high leverage is also a concern. As it is, shares of Apache witnessed a decline of around 7% during the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Apache will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +66.67%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 5 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Apache has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong sell). Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

1300,CXO,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Concho Resources is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CXO in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 44 cents per share for CXO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CXO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 2.33% heading into earnings season.Concho Resources Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Concho Resources Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Concho Resources Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that CXO has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

1301,CXO,"Independent oil and gas explorer Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) is set to release its second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Wednesday, Aug 2.In the preceding three-month period, the Midland, TX-based Permian pure play reported better-than-expected earnings on the back of on the back of higher commodity prices and strong production growth.Coming to earnings surprise history, Concho Resources has an excellent record: it's beaten estimates in each of the last four quarters.Concho Resources Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Concho Resources Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Concho Resources Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider This QuarterOil prices fared badly in the second quarter, erasing all the gains associated with the OPEC-led output cut. The continued rise in domestic production thanks to soaring shale output have dragged down the commodity well below the psychologically-critical $50 threshold. This will hamper Concho Resources’ earnings and cash flows.However, efficiencies on the production front might be able to mitigate some of the damage. The company expects to maintain a its robust production profile in the upcoming few quarters.Moreover, Concho Resources has been able to reduce costs that will provide some buffer amid the tumbling commodity prices. Driven by its operational efficiencies, Concho Resources have been able to significantly reduce its cash cost structure. While lease operating expenses on a per barrel basis decreased 22% annually in 2016, cash G&A fell by 6%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Concho Resources will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -2.33%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 42 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher, at 43 cents.Zacks Rank: Concho Resources has a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Share PerformanceConcho Resources has lost 5.3% of its value during the second quarter versus the 16.9% decline of its industry.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Concho Resources, here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:Summit Midstream Partners L.P. (SMLP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +208.33% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to release earnings results on Aug 3.
