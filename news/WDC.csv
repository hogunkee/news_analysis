4,WDC,"The U.S.-China trade war started with the Trump administration accusing China of unfair practices related to the forced transfer of American technology and intellectual property. But U.S. tech companies are seeing little impact so far from the trade dispute as the U.S. on Friday imposed the first round of tariffs on Chinese goods.The U.S. is imposing an additional duty of 25% on about $34 billion worth of Chinese imports covering 818 products. The list does not include products commonly purchased by U.S. consumers such as mobile phones or televisions. It targets mostly products that are part of the ""Made in China 2025"" industrial policy. That policy includes industries such as aerospace, robotics, industrial machinery, new materials, and automobiles.The list of Chinese products impacted includes engines, motors, generators, furnaces, pumps, compressors, machine tools, and manufacturing, construction and agricultural equipment. It also includes aircraft and aircraft parts, cars, trucks, oil and gas drilling gear, television cameras and broadcast gear.China retaliated on Friday with 25% tariffs on imports of U.S. products, mostly agricultural goods. The impacted U.S. goods include grains, corn, soybeans, meat, fish, dairy, nuts, fruits and vegetables, alcohol and tobacco. China's levies also cover U.S.-made autos.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe U.S. is planning a second wave of tariffs covering 284 Chinese goods worth about $16 billion, but does not have an implementation date yet.""While tariffs on both sides should have limited direct head wind to IT (information technology) hardware and semiconductor companies, there are a few ways for U.S.-China trade wars to impact companies,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a report Friday.For instance, companies that procure components and materials from China could see an uptick in their costs, he said.U.S. technology companies also could be subject to retaliatory actions by the Chinese government, Daryanani said. Memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) losing a patent infringement case in a Chinese court this week could be a result of the trade disputes, he said. Micron stock was up fractionally 53.23 at the close.Also, China has held up chipmaker Qualcomm's (QCOM) acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). That deal has been ""in limbo 17 months and counting,"" Daryanani said. Shares of both were up fractionally in afternoon trades Friday.While the first wave of Chinese products subject to U.S. import tariffs includes computer hard disk drives, U.S. data storage systems vendors Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC) should see minimal impact, he said.The impact will be ""manageable and transitory"" given that Seagate and Western Digital also have factories outside of China, he said. Seagate stock was off 2 cents to 58.59 while Western added 0.6% to end the regular trading session at 77.93.If the trade conflict lingers, though, it could impact the U.S. tech industry in other ways. President Donald Trump has threatened to block Chinese investment in U.S. companies.That could cut off investment capital being used to fund such things as electric and self-driving vehicles. U.S. firms like Tesla (TSLA) could be impacted.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were less than 0.1% below fair value.Friday is T-Day — T for tariff — in the brewing trade war between the US. and China.

That means its tariffs targeting $34 billion in U.S.-made goods could take effect anytime after the U.S. decision.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

18,WDC,"Chipmakers are closing out the seventh week of a rally begun in the first week of May, and they've helped power the Nasdaq to its new highs. The gains have been broad, although some were left behind (Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Tower Semiconductors (TSEM)). Others, like Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), remain deep in long-term corrections.Qorvo (QRVO) broke out on Thursday, but remained below long-term resistance near 86. Switzerland-based STMicroelectronics (STM) cleared a buy point in what was maybe not quite a breakout, but significant because it snapped resistance that had capped STM's progress since November.Multiple attempts to break that resistance made STM's base a bit of a puzzle. Possible buy points occurred at 25.40, 25.22 and, finally, a cup-with-handle buy point at 24.62.STM cleared the 24.62 entry June 5, right after it announced its chips were being used in the Alcatel 3V smartphone, just introduced on the European market by China's TCL Communication.STM is a broad-range chipmaker that counts Apple (AAPL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), China's Huawei and Western Digital (WDC) among its more than 1,000 customers.The stock's 4.4% gain on June 4 rode volume that was 51% above its 50-day average, well above the 40% minimum needed to qualify as a breakout.But investors may have been hesitant. The breakout move left shares far below the stock's commanding resistance. And STM had posted gap-up moves past buy points on Jan. 18 and March 21. Both rose only briefly above 25.On June 6, STM took out the 25.22 buy point. Volume was only 27% above average. But the stock had pressed to a new high. After a four-day consolidation, shares broke decisively above both the buy point and the 25 resistance level. Shares on Friday remained well within the chipmaker's buy range, which runs through 26.48.For those who bought at the 24.62 level, the stock is now technically extended.In either case, the base pattern begun in January undercut a prior, two-month base. STM briefly broke out above that base's 24.90 buy point in January. Then it pulled back more than 8% and triggered the automatic sell rule. In fact, it pulled back a total of 19% from its breakout high. That was enough to undercut the two-month base — a move which resets the stock's base count.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSTM had run up 334% in the 16 months before starting its prior base. So although it was not late stage, a reset gives some assurance that shares are not due for immediate pressure from profit taking.RELATED:As Tesla, GM Rally On EV, Self-Driving Hopes These Stocks May Be NextChip Stocks On The Rise: ASML, STMicro, OthersThese 3 Top Stocks Had Strong Moves Into Buy Zones TodayPain For All?

27,WDC,"When the stock market indicates a new uptrend is underway, many individual investors who want to trade growth stocks and make money ironically remain skeptical.A bullish follow-through signal comes after a mostly negative period in the market, so the negative reaction is natural.The reaction may be natural but, to be blunt, it's not too smart. The investor is heeding the recent past while ignoring a signal that says present conditions have changed.What is a follow-through day? It's a bottoming signal that occurs when a major index surges in higher volume than the previous day, and at least four days from an index low.The prudent investor will make an effort to buy something on a follow-through day. The stock should be highly rated and breaking out in strong volume.What if there aren't any stocks breaking out on the follow-through?

30,WDC,"Western Digital (WDC) raised its financial outlook late Tuesday after settling a lengthy legal battle with Japanese conglomerate Toshiba that removed a major overhang regarding access to advanced memory chips.X Western Digital and Toshiba announced they had settled all outstanding litigation and arbitration proceedings of their joint venture, ending a lengthy battle over the ownership and expansion of a flash-memory-chip business.Western Digital will allow Toshiba Memory to sell its stake in the joint venture to a consortium led by Bain Capital. Western Digital will be allowed to participate in the development of new factory expansions and certain rights to the output of an advanced form of flash memory chips based on a technology called Nand. The chips are used in a wide variety of consumer electronics and in chip-based data-storage systems.Western Digital gained its 50-50 stake in the venture with Toshiba Memory as a result of its $15.8 billion acquisition of SanDisk. Western Digital is also the world's largest provider of disk drives.Toshiba was under heavy pressure to sell the chip unit in order to cover massive losses from its nuclear division and avoid having its stock delisted from Japan's stock exchanges. But conflicts with Western Digital arose when Toshiba said it reached a deal to sell its interest in the joint venture to Bain Capital, in a consortium that included South Korean chipmaker S.K. Hynix.Western Digital initially opposed the agreement with Bain on concerns that its intellectual property associated with the joint venture would be shared with competitors, among other reasons.

For fiscal 2018, it expects revenue of about $20.6 billion and adjusted earnings above $13 per share.

Shares are still about 8% away from a new high.Chip-gear maker KLA-Tencor (KLAC) turned nearly 2% higher, reversing from early losses after reporting strong results late Thursday.

The industrial giant also raised its full-year adjusted EPS and sales forecast.Lockheed Martin (LMT) topped first-quarter estimates and the defense contractor raised EPS and revenue targets. But the F-35 maker didn't raise its cash-flow expectation. Northrop Grumman (NOC) also reported Q1 earnings above estimates, but Northrop said it didn't submit a bid for the Air Force's GPS III contract, leaving Lockheed as the likely lone bidder. Raytheon (RTN) raised its full-year earnings forecast above consensus as its Q1 earnings and revenue topped estimates. General Dynamics (GD) beat on earnings and met revenue views. Shares of all four defense contractors sold off sharply for the week.The software kingpin earned 95 cents a share, up 36% year over year, on sales of $26.8 billion, up 16%, in its fiscal third quarter. Analysts expected 85 cents and $25.71 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) has been shifting its business from desktop PC software to cloud-computing infrastructure and applications, such as Office 365 and Azure. Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue rose 58% in fiscal Q3. The software giant initially reclaimed a recent buy point on Friday, but pared gains.Intel (INTC) earnings rose 32% as sales grew 9% to $16.1 billion, both well above analyst views. The chip giant guided higher for current quarter sales, indicating a third-straight quarter of top-line growth. Shares initially jumped to a 17-year high Friday but reversed to close slightly lower. Texas Instruments (TXN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) got boosts from upbeat earnings reports. But chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled after warning of weak demand for equipment to test mobile devices. Western Digital (WDC), which makes disk drives and memory chips, tumbled Friday despite beating fiscal Q3 views. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fought for support at its 200-day moving average.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped views but a sharp rise in capital spending, margin pressure and higher traffic acquisition costs sparked a sell-off in the internet search giant. Capex jumped to $7.3 billion from $2.5 billion in the year-ago period, including $2.4 billion for a real estate purchase in Manhattan. Traffic costs — or what Google pays partner websites to generate advertising revenue — jumped 36% to $6.288 billion. Google has hiked spending on YouTube and video content, cloud computing, smart home consumer appliances and artificial intelligence projects.PayPal (PYPL) topped earnings and revenue expectations as total payment volume rose 27% to $132 billion year over year, vs. estimates of $128 billion.

Ford will not invest in traditional sedans for North America going forward, and will almost phase out passenger cars by 2020, as consumers migrate to SUVs and light trucks. GM still sees small cars as an opportunity at home and abroad, even as it too shifts focus to larger and more profitable vehicles.Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped first-quarter results estimates, helped by strong demand in global gaming hub Macau and in Singapore. Macau also helped Q1 results for Wynn Resorts (WYNN), but its overall and Macau sales disappointed some analysts. Wynn Resorts also approved a dividend increase. The earnings report from Wynn was the first since Steve Wynn resigned as CEO and sold his stake following allegations of sexual misconduct. MGM Resorts (MGM) narrowly beat, but the stock tumbled on declining traffic at its U.S. locations. MGM is more U.S.-focused than Sands or Wynn.Amgen (AMGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) broadly topped Q1 views, though Amgen's sales and adjusted profit outlook for 2018 were a bit soft at the midpoints.

Homebuilder stocks were generally muted due to rising interest rates. But D.R. Horton (DHI), the biggest U.S. builder, on Thursday bested views with a 52% EPS surge as revenue swelled 17% to $3.795 billion. Homebuilder stocks rallied for solid gains, helped by cooling Treasury yields. New-home sales rose in March to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high. Meanwhile existing-home prices rose 6.8% in February vs. a year earlier.China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU) reported a Q1 profit that blew past estimates, lifting shares. Baidu still owns a majority of iQiyi (IQ), which held its IPO in March. Video streaming website iQiyi accounts for roughly 20% of the parent's revenue. Shares in iQiyi fell after it released earnings in tandem with Baidu.Visa (V) reported a 29% EPS gain on a 13% revenue rise, both beating fiscal Q2 views.

The small cap Russell 2000 was flat.Volume in the stock market today was running behind the previous session's pace.President Trump's chief economic advisor Gary Cohn, an opponent of tariffs, announced late Tuesday that he would depart in the coming weeks. Cohn's exit could give more influence to Peter Navarro, an economist in the Trump administration who is outside the professional consensus in economics. Navarro says trade deficits are bad, and he favors tariffs.Meanwhile, the New York Times reported that European Union officials said they had a list of American-made goods that would face tariffs if Trump follows through on his plan to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum.The U.S. could soon launch sweeping tariffs and other curbs vs. China for alleged intellectual property theft, Bloomberg reported.

Start NowThe stock market has reacted to each turn in the tariff story, falling whenever the likelihood of a trade war increases.Dow Jones industrial average components Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) fell nearly 2% and almost 3%, respectively. The two companies could be hurt by steel-price hikes. Both companies also have heavy international exposure and could be hurt if other countries respond to Trump's tariffs with anti-U.S. measures of their own.Part of the reason for the market's reaction is uncertainty. Identifying which stocks will be either helped or hurt in a trade war isn't easy.For example, United States Steel (X) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) advanced 3.3% and 0.9%, respectively, in heavy volume Wednesday. But analysts disagree on whether tariffs will help U.S. steel companies or create a backlash from other countries, thereby ultimately hurting companies such as United States Steel. More than 20% of U.S. Steel's revenue is from Europe.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, construction equipment stocks and retail took the day's hardest hits. On the upside, steel producers and personal care companies rose.In the Cosmetics/Personal Care space, seven stocks rose 2% or more.

37,WDC,"The Nasdaq composite rallied solidly Tuesday while the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average rose slightly in large part because chip-related stocks were big winners. Applied Materials (AMAT) and Cree (CREE) cleared buy points, Intel (INTC) and Micron Technology (MU) hit new highs, and Lam Research (LRCX) announced big shareholder returns. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL), a big buyer of semiconductors, carved a new buy point.X These chip plays, along with several others that are in buy range or setting up, are outperforming the S&P 500 index, as shown by their relative strength lines. The RS line for the iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) ETF matched a record high.Some of these breakouts are late-stage bases, such as with Applied Materials. Other stocks are extended, like Micron, while Dow component Intel didn't complete a proper base. But several chip stocks are worth watching.Investors also should watch semiconductors because a healthy chip sector is a positive sign for a market rally. First, chips are a big part of market weightings, especially the Nasdaq. Chips also make up the guts of so many tech products, from the Apple iPhone to PCs to servers and many more. If chip stocks are doing well, that's a good sign for tech stocks and tech demand overall.Apple fell 0.1% to 176.67 in Tuesday's stock market trading. Apple has now completed a high handle, with the top of the handle slightly above the left side of a short, V-shaped cup base. That means that Apple's buy point has actually risen, from 180.20 to 180.71.Apple's RS line, which was lagging badly for several months, rose significantly in February. It's edged lower in the last few sessions, but is still above the high of the left side of the consolidation.Apple fell 0.9% to 175.03 in Wednesday trades.Applied Materials, a chip equipment giant, shot up 4.1% to a record close of 59.99 on Tuesday, clearing a 58.83 double-bottom buy point after trying to break out briefly last week. (You could also view 59.10 as alternative entry from a newly formed handle.)Volume was 36% above normal, but you'd like to see trading that's at least 40% to 50% higher than average on a breakout to confirm strong institutional buying.Applied Materials' RS line is not quite at its late-November peak, but is definitely above where it was at the middle of the ""W"" in the double-bottom base.Applied Materials fell 1% to close at 59.42 Wednesday.Applied Materials is in a fifth-stage base. Fifth-stage bases are more likely to fail and less likely to deliver big gains than early-stage bases.Cree, which makes chips for LED lighting, vaulted 9.7% to 41.76 Tuesday, blasting above a 40.34 buy point in volume that was 372% above normal. The RS line is hitting a new high. Cree cleared a second-stage base.Cree rose 2.7% Wednesday to 42.89.Intel stock rose 1.9% to 50.71 on Tuesday in average volume, reaching a record 51.33 intraday. But the Dow Jones component had not yet consolidated for six weeks, the minimum for a cup base. Intel's stock chart has had a string of bad luck. But the RS line is hitting new highs.Intel rose 1.2% to 51.32 Wednesday.Micron stock jumped 3.3% to 53.74 on Tuesday, its best reading since late 2000. It was the third straight robust gain in above-average volume.Micron cleared a 47.08 double-bottom buy point on Feb. 26 and topped a 49.99 alternative entry on Monday. Shares are now extended from either entry.Micron rose 0.4% to close at 53.97 Wednesday.Lam Research popped 4.65% to 207.94 on Tuesday, making good progress toward a 218.58 double-bottom buy point. Lam's RS line is well off the consolidation's high, but is already at the peak of the ""W"" buy-point zone. Lam's base is fourth stage, however.Lam gained 1.8% to 211.74 Wednesday.The chip equipment maker raised its quarterly dividend by 120% to $1.10 a share on Tuesday. It also added $2 billion to its buyback plan, bringing the total authorization to about $4 billion.Western Digital (WDC), which makes flash memory via its SanDisk acquisition as well as hard drives, rose 4.3% to 93.80 on Tuesday, clearing a 93.41 double-bottom buy point in volume that was 54% above normal. The RS line is lagging though. Western Digital is in a second-stage base.Western Digital gained 1.6% to 95.27 Wednesday.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), an Apple iPhone supplier, edged up 0.3% to 111.85 on Tuesday, just below a 112.38 cup-with-handle buy point. The RS line is well of its highs, but is at its best levels since late November and above the handle's peak. Skyworks is in a first-stage base.Skyworks lost 0.3% to 111.54.

64,WDC,"Japanese conglomerate Toshiba fired back at Western Digital (WDC) Thursday for statements made about their battle over the future of a memory chip unit, valued at more than $18 billion.XToshiba, on Tuesday, announced it had a memorandum of understanding with a group led by Bain Capital and Korea-based chip company SK Hynix, affirming the intent of both parties to reach an agreement regarding the sale of Toshiba Memory Corp. by the end of this month. Reports say the Bain group has bid $19 billion for the chip company.Western Digital had led another group to buy the chip business, with an offer reportedly at $18.2 billion, and spent months in a legal battle over the sale. Western Digital acquired a stake in the business, resulting from its $15.8 billion SanDisk acquisition, giving it certain contractual rights. It's those rights that are in dispute.""Toshiba regrets that Western Digital persistently overstates its limited consent rights in public statements,"" Toshiba said in a statement issued Thursday. ""As Toshiba has previously stated, the confidential agreements between SanDisk and Toshiba provide no reasonable basis for Western Digital's assertions that it is entitled to prevent a sale of TMC.""Western Digital, through its SanDisk unit, opposes the chip sale and on Wednesday implied it might continue legal action. Shares of the Western Digital inched up 5 cents to 85.79 on the stock market today.""It is surprising that Toshiba would continue to pursue a transaction with a consortium led by Korea-based SK Hynix and Bain Capital Japan without SanDisk's consent,"" Western Digital said in a prepared statement Tuesday. ""The language in the relevant joint venture agreements is unambiguous, and multiple courts have ruled in favor of protecting SanDisk's contractual rights. We remain confident in our ability to protect our joint venture interests and consent rights.""Toshiba replied that the ""confidential agreements between SanDisk and Toshiba provide no reasonable basis for Western Digital's assertions that it is entitled to prevent a sale of TMC.""IBD'S TAKE: Western Digital holds a strong IBD Composite Rating of 92 out of a possible 99. There are plenty of places on Investors.com to research and find top stocks, but when you're looking to get a broader idea on top tech stocks, IBD's Tech Leaders feature is worth reviewing.Toshiba said it was disappointed ""by Western Digital's misleading statements regarding the outcome of ongoing litigation between the two companies. Toshiba said the parties ""have merely agreed, before a single court, to provide notice when an agreement for the sale of TMC is signed — and prior to a related closing — for a limited period of time, until arbitration between the companies is underway.""Toshiba said it expects to complete a sale of TMC by March 2018, and looks forward to a favorable resolution of SanDisk and Western Digital's exaggerated claims in arbitration.The Toshiba unit makes a popular computer memory chip known as Nand flash, which is used in a wide variety of consumer electronics and in chip-based data storage systems. Toshiba is under heavy pressure to sell the chip unit, in order to cover massive losses from its nuclear division and avoid having its stock delisted from Japan's stock exchanges.Western Digital, in addition to its strong presence in the memory chip market, is also the largest provider of disk drives.RELATED:Toshiba Agrees To Talk With Western Digital Over Disputed Chip DealWestern Digital Seeks To Block Toshiba Chip Sale Via Arbitration

65,WDC,"A lengthy and contentious battle may soon come to a close, as a second Japanese newspaper has reported that a group led by Western Digital (WDC) won the bidding for a Toshiba memory-chip unit, for about $18.2 billion.A win by Western Digital would fortify its strong and growing presence in the memory-chip market — chips that are used broadly in smartphones, memory cards, USB drives, solid-state drives, digital cameras and other devices. In addition to being a competitive force in chips, Western Digital is also the world's largest manufacturer of disk drives, competing against Seagate Technology (STX).Toshiba denied the report on Tuesday by Japan media group Nikkan Kogyo that said Western Digital won the bidding process. Reuters is reporting that Toshiba now favors a group led by SK Hynix and Bain Capital Japan to buy its prized semiconductor business, after failing to bridge key gaps with Western Digital.Western Digital shares were up 1.6% to 88.78 in the stock market today.Toshiba is under heavy pressure to sell the chip unit, in order to cover massive losses from its nuclear division and avoid having its stock delisted from Japan's stock exchanges. Toshiba also denied an earlier report from Asahi Shimbun, a widely respected newspaper in Japan, that also said Western Digital had won the bidding process. Western Digital has not commented on the reports.Western Digital gained a stake in the Toshiba unit as a result of its $15.8 billion SanDisk acquisition. Western Digital has fought legal battles against Toshiba to prevent any deal that did not have its consent, in order to preserve intellectual property, among other reasons.IBD'S TAKE: Western Digital holds a strong IBD Composite Rating of 94 out of a possible 99, and recently moved above its 50-day moving average, which can be a positive sign. There are plenty of places on Investors.com to research and find top stocks, but when you're looking to get a broader idea on top tech stocks, IBD's Tech Leaders feature is worth reviewing.The Western Digital group includes private equity firm KKR, a public/private Japanese group called Innovation Network, and the Development Bank of Japan.Apple (AAPL) is said to be involved with the SK Hynix and Bain Capital  group.The other group bidding for the unit is a consortium led by manufacturing giant Foxconn that includes Apple.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani in a report to clients late Monday said he thinks Western Digital will end up with a minority stake in the unit, with its Japanese partners holding a minority position.""We think the outcome is a positive for Western Digital,"" Daryanani wrote.The Toshiba unit would boost Western Digital's access to a large and growing category of memory chips called NAND flash and also prevent a ""significantly worse scenario"" of the unit going to competitors, Daryanani wrote. NAND flash consumption has exploded over the last 5 years.Daryanani has an outperform rating on Western Digital and a price target of 115.RELATED:Toshiba Agrees To Talk With Western Digital Over Disputed Chip DealWestern Digital Seeks To Block Toshiba Chip Sale Via Arbitration

Two Japanese newspapers had previously reported that Western Digital won the bidding.The Toshiba unit makes a popular computer memory chip known as Nand flash, which is used in a wide variety of consumer electronics and in chip-based data storage systems. Western Digital acquired a stake in the business, resulting from its $15.8 billion SanDisk acquisition.Toshiba is under heavy pressure to sell the chip unit, in order to cover massive losses from its nuclear division and avoid having its stock delisted from Japan's stock exchanges.Western Digital has worked to acquire the Toshiba unit to fortify its strong and growing presence in the memory-chip market — chips that are used broadly in smartphones, memory cards, USB drives, solid-state drives, digital cameras and other devices. In addition to being a competitive force in chips, Western Digital is also the world's largest manufacturer of disk drives, competing against Seagate Technology (STX)Western Digital has fought legal battles against Toshiba to prevent any deal that did not have its consent, in order to preserve intellectual property and prevent the chip unit from falling into the hands of competitors. That includes Broadcom (AVGO), which reportedly bid on the unit. Broadcom is a leading manufacturer of chips used in wireless and broadband communication.IBD'S TAKE: Western Digital holds a strong IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of a possible 99. There are plenty of places on Investors.com to research and find top stocks, but when you're looking to get a broader idea on top tech stocks, IBD's Tech Leaders feature is worth reviewing.The Bain Capital/SK Hynix group had previously been selected by Toshiba as the winning bidder.

""The language in the relevant joint venture agreements is unambiguous, and multiple courts have ruled in favor of protecting SanDisk's contractual rights.

Western Digital also has a large business in chip-based storage technology. Western Digital shares were up 0.4%, near 87.38.The Seagate downgrade follows comments from disk-drive component suppliers that include Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technologies (MRVL), suggesting tough times ahead in disk drives.In its Aug. 24 quarterly earnings call, Broadcom said strong growth in its disk drive business for enterprise customers currently is not sustainable and expects a sharp decline in demand, ""driven by the start of an anticipated correction in the disk drive market,"" Seyrafi wrote in a note to clients. Enterprise business customers accounted for 37% of Seagate sales and a high percentage of its profits in the last quarter.Marvell also made comments on its quarterly earnings conference call on Aug. 24 that presented a ""cautious view of disk drive demand in the near-term,"" wrote Seyrafi. Marvell said that there were some inventory issues and factory transitions with a few major customers. Disk drive inventories are also above average, which raises concerns about pricing, said Seyrafi.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly-traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Seyrafi also said industry trends favor Micron Technology (MU), a leading provider of DRAM chips uses in chip-based storage systems.""We believe that current consensus estimates for Seagate are too high and need to be lowered,"" Seyrafi wrote. ""We believe that investors should consider moving out of Seagate and into Micron."" He said Micron is benefiting from healthy demand for the rise in chip-based storage systems, ""which are increasingly displacing disk drives.""On Monday, Seyrafi initiated coverage of Micron with an outperform rating and price target of 45.He said Micron ""is a prime beneficiary of the tremendous amount of consolidation in the DRAM space over the past 10 years,"" as the top-three DRAM suppliers — Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix, have grown their combined DRAM revenue share to 95% from less than 60% in 2007.Micron shares jumped 3.3% to close at 33.44.Western Digital reported strong quarterly results in late July that beat on the bottom line, while Seagate reported quarterly results that missed expectations, causing shares to tumble.RELATED:Western Digital Close To Acquiring Toshiba Chip Unit After Tough Fight

There are plenty of places on Investors.com to research and find top stocks, but when you're looking to get a broader idea on top tech stocks, IBD's Tech Leaders feature is worth reviewing.A previous bid by the Bain group was favored by Toshiba but thwarted after Western Digital fought a legal battle against Toshiba to prevent any deal that did not have its consent, in order to preserve intellectual property, among other reasons. Investors in the Bain group were reluctant to close a deal in the face of the legal risks posed by Western Digital's demands, Reuters said.Bain's new offer is designed to get around that problem by inviting state-backed investors to invest in the business only after any arbitration with Western Digital is settled, the Reuters source said.Toshiba needs to sell the chip unit to cover massive losses from its U.S. nuclear division.Other bids for the chip unit included one from Broadcom (AVGO) and one from Taiwan-based Foxconn, in conjunction with Apple and Dell (DVMT).Apple stock was up 0.3% to close at 163.35 on the stock market today, setting a record high.

103,WDC,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) hiked its stake in Apple (AAPL) by more than 125% to 129.4 million shares in the first quarter, and made modest changes to its airlines holdings while avoiding Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP), which went public in March.Meanwhile, Soros Fund Management bought 1.7 million shares of Snap, joining David Tepper's Appaloosa Management and Dan Loeb's Third Point. Soros also dissolved his firm's positions in Amazon.com (AMZN) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and added to its stake in Facebook (FB), according to filings late Monday.David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital trimmed its Apple holdings to 4.2 million shares from 6.1 million in Q4, while more than quadrupling its stake in General Motors (GM) to 55 million shares from 13 million.In Q1, Berkshire grew its American Airlines (AAL) stake to 49.3 million shares, up 8.4% vs. the previous quarter, and its investment in Southwest Airlines (LUV) to 47.7 million, up 10.4%. It trimmed its position in Delta to 55 million shares, down 8.3%, while keeping its holdings in United Airlines (UAL) steady at 28.9 million.The regulatory filing confirmed news from early May that Berkshire's Buffett busily dumped tech giant IBM (IBM) in Q1. It had 64.6 million shares left at quarter-end, down 20%. (Even IBM Retirement Fund's unloaded 70,000 shares of IBM, leaving it with 12,451 IBM shares in Q1, according to the fund's 13F filing on May 10.)Meanwhile, the conglomerate's massive long-term stakes in Coca-Cola (KO), American Express (AXP) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) were left basically unchanged.Buffett had already said Berkshire more than doubled its Apple holdings in Q1, giving it a 2.5% stake in the iPhone maker's outstanding shares. Berkshire initiated a position in Apple, worth $1.1 billion, in Q1 2016 and doubled down on Apple as the year progressed.By contrast, Appaloosa Management slashed its stake in 2017's best-performing Dow component Apple by a third, to 300,000 shares, and trimmed Facebook by 12.6%, to 1.9 million shares in Q1, according to filings from Friday. The company also scooped up 100,000 shares of Snap, which tanked 17.5% last week on a dismal debut earnings reports following its March IPO.Similarly, Third Point exited its 1.85 million-share stake in Apple during Q1, while buying 2.25 million shares of Snap.Shares of Berkshire closed up 0.3% at 163.76 on the stock market today. Apple dipped 0.3%, down from Friday's fresh record high, and Snap rallied 8.4%, after last week's plunge. Facebook eased 0.1%, and IBM added 0.7%.Among Appaloosa's other notable moves, the fund entirely liquidated its massive stakes in two troubled stocks: chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) and retailer J.C. Penney (JCP).Appaloosa added a 1.6 million-share stake in Symantec (SYMC), which was leading a cybersecurity stock rally Monday on the heels of a global ransomware attack. Appaloosa also raised its Western Digital (WDC) stake by 16.1% to 1.3 million shares.But the hedge fund's biggest bet seems to be on an American industrial renaissance. It opened positions of roughly half a million shares each in AK Steel (AKS) and Nucor (NUE), while upping ArcelorMittal (MT) by more than 410%, to nearly 5 million shares.Other hefty new positions included Bank of America (BAC) and CBS (CBS) (8.8 million and 1.0 million shares, respectively).Third Point's other moves include adding to positions in T-Mobile (TMUS), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).The fund closed a small stake in Goldman Sachs (GS), and reduced holdings in Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Late Friday, Trian Fund Management also disclosed bigger positions in General Electric (GE) and Procter & Gamble (PG) and a smaller stake in DuPont (DD).RELATED:What Will Berkshire Filing Show As Loeb Cuts Facebook, Apple Stakes?Why Buffett Still Isn't Sure If He'd Buy Amazon, Alphabet Stock Now

104,WDC,"Americans want smarter devices, homes, factories and cities, so STMicroelectronics (STM) has remade itself to deliver the smarts.One of Europe's largest semiconductor companies, STMicro is growing with red-hot demand for the chips needed for intelligent devices. Some on Wall Street seem convinced the outlook is promising for the venerable, 30-year-old Swiss firm whose stock struggled for more than a decade and a half following the dot-com boom and bust.""The outlook for 2018 is pretty much a historical high,"" Tristan Gerra, a semiconductor analyst for R.W. Baird, told Investor's Business Daily.""(STMicro) has methodically shut down businesses losing money or just breaking even, such as memory chips and cellphone chips,"" Gerra said. ""Now the result is you have a company that is much leaner that only has products that are profitable.""STMicro has benefited from relentless smartphone innovations, connected home devices and wearable tech gadgets, as well as emerging opportunities in the automotive and industrial sectors.A massive shift toward greener, safer and self-driving cars is one powerful engine of growth. The industrial Internet of Things — which connects machines to one another and the cloud, while harnessing the power of Big Data analytics to make factories more efficient — is another.STMicro stock has vaulted 125% in the past year. That is more than three times the return of the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index — dominated by U.S. giants Nvidia (NVDA), Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM) — over the same period.Gerra believes STMicro stock has room to run despite the monster moves it already has made, rising to levels not seen in a decade. He has a price target of 20, which represents an upside of roughly 14%. Shares climbed into buy territory Thursday and have kept climbing since then. Shares ended the regular trading session Tuesday up 1.7% to 17.77.STMicro's surging profits and margins come as the firm has raised its capital expenditures to $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion, citing new products and higher demand, while alluding to design wins. Many investors and analysts understand the latter to mean the eagerly awaited 10th anniversary iPhone from Apple (AAPL).STMicro's 3D sensors are expected to power the upcoming iPhone's standout new feature: advanced facial-recognition technologies that may allow users to unlock devices and authenticate payments in a more seamless way, experts say.Improving fundamentals and a robust product portfolio make the stock ""well-positioned for a continued recovery with significantly less cyclicality going forward,"" Gerra said in a recent note, while highlighting the potential for further revenue momentum.Analyst views call for STMicro earnings to more than quadruple to 83 cents a share for fiscal 2017 from 19 cents for 2016, according to Zacks Investment Research. For 2018, that's projected to reach $1.10 a share, then rise to $1.16 in 2019, Zacks says.STMicro holds one of the broadest product portfolios in the chipmaking industry, according to investment research firm Morningstar Inc. And the firm is seeing strong growth in bookings across all its product lines and global regions.""We are firing on all cylinders,"" STMicro Executive Vice President Bob Krysiak told IBD. ""We have great pipelines in smartphones, automotives and across the mass-market space.""Besides Apple, major customers include Cisco (CSCO), Seagate (STX) and Western Digital (WDC), as well as Asian smartphone makers Huawei and Samsung. Its products end up in everything from cars and smartphones to drones, welding equipment, solar kits, thermostats and consumer electronics.Its micro-mirror MEMS chips in the Amazon (AMZN) Echo Look and near field communication (NFC) chips in the Samsung Galaxy S8 show how the company is innovating and pursuing new lines of growth, according to Gerra. NFC chips allow smart devices to talk to one another when brought physically together, such as pay card readers.The smartphone remains king for the company, notwithstanding slowing sales across the industry.""It's a big market that continues to innovate every year,"" Krysiak said. ""Smartphone makers depend on us suppliers to provide the innovation.""STMicro has been making strategic moves in this segment. Abandoning its dated Nokia and Blackberry businesses years ago, it switched its focus to phone sensors, power management, security, NFC and other wireless technologies.Its FlightSense technology opens the door to the next generation of proximity sensors. For instance, it helps smartphone cameras focus automatically with much greater accuracy.The biggest opportunities may still be ahead. Smartphones have assumed a role as a central device in the larger Internet of Things, becoming as indispensable to industrial end markets as to the average consumer, Krysiak says.IBD'S TAKE: As IBD Stock Checkup notes, STMicro's stellar ratings for Earnings Per Share growth and Relative Price Strength help it earn a spot among the top five stocks in its industry group.Other massive opportunities are seen in autos and factories. The company has gone well beyond its traditional supplies to the automotive industry.Its positioning and car-to-car communication technologies are making self-driving cars possible. It has partnered with Israeli vision-tech pioneer Mobileye (MBLY) on groundbreaking active safety systems. And with vehicles becoming ""almost an internet device,"" in Krysiak's words, and electrified powertrains on the rise, the silicon content of cars has ballooned.STMicro calls these emerging automotive trends ""smart driving"" and now averages 36 parts per vehicle produced in the world, up from 24 just a few years ago.""Smart driving is just starting,"" said Krysiak, who believes the opportunity lies not just in intelligent vehicles themselves, but the entire infrastructure — of power charging systems, parking structures and the like — needed to leverage all that processing power.STMicro also is infusing technology into a sector sometimes viewed as boring — industrials.STMicro chips have made data centers more energy efficient, helped robots become more situation-aware and precise, and brought augmented reality and touchless interfaces to industrial assets.""The last bastion of change in the digitization of everything will be the factory floor,"" Krysiak said. ""We are bringing our vision systems and processing systems there, all leveraging cloud-computing technologies.""STMicro posted net revenue of $6.97 billion in 2016. It spent roughly 19% of that on R&D investments, amid cutthroat industry competition to keep rolling out what the firm describes as ""significantly cheaper, smaller, faster, more reliable and embedded"" products.For fiscal 2017, STMicro is targeting $8 billion in revenue and is now guiding to the high end of its previous forecast range of 12.5%-15.5% growth.While many analysts regard STMicro as a well-diversified company with some unique products, they see challenges too. Baird's Gerra notes that it remains a somewhat cyclical company, since it has a manufacturing component.Slowing car sales in the U.S. and China — two of the biggest automotive markets — are a potential challenge in the future too.Morningstar analyst Brian Colello also sees risks tied to STMicro's in-house manufacturing, with the need for further research reinvestments and ongoing capital expenditures potentially weighing on profits.He raises yellow flags about other aspects of its operations.There are concerns about STMicro's ""ownership by the French and Italian governments, which raises doubts as to whether it is truly focused on operating efficiency,"" he wrote in a recent report.Finally, STMicro hasn't developed a massive scale advantage given its size, with gross margins and operating profits ""below those of other successful pure-play analog chipmakers,"" Colello said.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksThe New AmericaChip Stocks & Semiconductor Industry News And Analysis

106,WDC,"The major market indexes sold off in morning trade Wednesday, after a momentary uptick at the starting bell sputtered. All three major indexes — the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average — declined 0.3%.X Among the Dow industrials, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) was one of the top performers in the stock market today. The discount chain advanced 0.5% after inking a deal with Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) to link Wal-Mart store accounts to the Google Express shopping service.On the downside, Home Depot (HD) fell 1.5% in sympathy with home improvement competitor Lowe's (LOW), which missed Q2 forecasts early Wednesday.

Rival Western Digital (WDC) advanced over 2% as it attempts to reclaim its 50-day line where it has been trading since July 28.Among companies reporting earnings, Salesforce.com (CRM) reversed from losses to rise 1.7% after the enterprise software provider missed its current-quarter billings guidance. The stock remains in the 5% buy zone from its 92.09 flat-base entry.Meanwhile, American Eagle (AEO) trimmed its gains to 5% early Wednesday after the company reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings results.

107,WDC,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite rose Thursday morning ahead of key U.S. economic data and amid a report showing Chinese manufacturing contracting. Four recent tech breakouts — Apple (AAPL) iPhone supplier Analog Devices (ADI), Micron Technology (MU), Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Paylocity (PCTY) — remain in buy range.X During Wednesday's session, the major averages reversed lower as oil prices fell and bank stocks tumbled. But while financials remained weak, the S&P 500 and other key index closed with slim losses, capping a solid tech-led month of May.Dow industrials futures rose fractionally vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures were up 0.1% while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed climbed 0.3%.Futures briefly pared most of their gains following the private-sector Caixin survey that showed Chinese manufacturing activity contracting for the first time in nearly a year. That follows slow-but-steady growth from official government data, out earlier in the week, that focuses more on state-owned enterprises.China's Shanghai composite slid 0.5% Thursday. Japan's Nikkei advanced 1.1%, ending a recent slide.In the U.S., investors will get the ISM manufacturing index, the ADP employment report and domestic auto sales for May, ahead of Friday's key jobs report.IBD'S TAKE: Chinese regulators, worried about soaring credit growth, are starting to crack down, having an impact on the world's No. 2 economy in short order. That's the focus of our latest cover story: ""Here's Why China's Latest Growth Scare Should Worry You.""Analog shares rose 2.4% to 84.80 on Tuesday, just moving beyond an 84.34 buy point. On Wednesday, the Apple iPhone supplier shares shot up as high as 90.49, but closed at 85.76, just a 1.1% gain and near session lows. That's not great action, and investors should be cautious. However, shares are well within the 5% chase zone from the entry point.What sparked Wednesday's big move? Analog Devices reported strong earnings and bullish guidance before the market open, though revenue was essentially in line.Analog Devices has been touted as a likely big winner from the upcoming Apple iPhone 8, due out later this year.As for Apple itself, shares dipped 0.6% on Wednesday, continuing to trade tightly over the last few weeks, close to record highs. Apple does not have a potential buy point current after a long run.Analog Devices has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which means it outperforms 99% of all stocks based on a variety of IBD proprietary fundamental and technical data. Big-time winners tend to have Composite Ratings of 95 or more near the start of their runs.Paylocity, the lone non-chipmaker highlighted here, is a cloud-based human resources software firm.Paylocity cleared a 45.71 buy point from a cup-with-handle pattern on May 25, and shares have remained above the entry since then. Shares fell intraday Wednesday but closed up 0.2% to 46.85.Other cloud-based HR software peers include Paycom (PAYC) and Workday (WDAY). Paycom has been hovering around a three-weeks-tight follow-on buy point, while Workday is modestly extended from a breakout. Workday, which competes against Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP), is expected to report a 220% EPS gain late Thursday.Paylocity has a 97 Composite Rating.The memory chipmaker cleared a 29.97 flat base buy point on Tuesday, then edged up 0.2% to 30.77 on Wednesday, still well within buy range. Industry demand and pricing is strong, boosting profits of other memory chip players such as Samsung Electronics and Western Digital (WDC).Micron's CR Rating is an 89, reflecting a poor run of earnings until recently. Memory chip makers' fortunes tend to be highly cyclical, so stocks often start to move on indications of improving industry fundamentals before big earnings come in. Micron is reporting strong results now.Marvell cleared a 16.82 buy point on May 25, then reported strong earnings after the closing bell that session. The next day, shares popped to just out of buying range, but shares have come back modestly this week to 17.24 on Wednesday.Marvell has a 92 Composite Rating.RELATED:The Big Picture: Techs Hot, But 2 Broad Sectors Are StrugglingHere's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key SupportThis Top Software Firm Has Flipped From Losses: 220% EPS Gain Seen ThursdayChip Stocks And Semiconductor Industry News3 Tech Leaders Near Highs As Earnings Loom: Investing Action Plan

117,WDC,"There's no shortage of star power in First Trust Nasdaq-100-Technology Sector ETF (QTEC), with Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) among its holdings.Indeed, the exchange traded fund is a way to gain exposure to the biggest brands in technology, and those stocks are performing well. Because it's culled from the Nasdaq 100 (the largest nonfinancial stocks in the composite), the ETF is predominantly a big-cap fund, with a median market cap of $32 billion.More than 40% of the fund is in chip stocks. About one-fourth is in software, 17% in internet companies and the rest in hardware, services and telecom stocks. The fund's hardware stocks have been shining.Western Digital (WDC) has surged more than 130% from a low in May 2016. The data storage stock broke out of a base March 30 and remains near a 81.77 buy point. Rival Seagate Technology (STX) has risen more than 160% from its May low. Apple may be flagging the past couple of weeks, but shares have rallied about 20% from a breakout past a 118.12 entry in January.The internet components haven't exactly impressed. Alphabet — the parent company of Google — Yahoo (YHOO), Baidu (BIDU), Akamai (AKAM) and NetEase (NTES) have printed mediocre charts for months. Facebook, though, is still trending moderately upward.Despite relative strength in the sector, the ETF's semiconductor stocks have been mixed.What about the sector's outlook? Much depends on consumer reception to new products, such as the next iPhone model, and corporate spending on information technology. Earlier this month, Nomura analysts saw strength in that area.""Our early-April survey of 50 global CIOs offered a significantly improved view of 2017 IT spending vs. our October survey,"" the firm noted. ""This suggests the economic and financial upticks since October may prove resilient. The top spending drivers, security and cloud, remain key themes.""The tech sector is turning in the third-highest earnings growth rate of 11 S&P sectors at 13.0%, according to FactSet.The 35 companies in the ETF are about evenly distributed in terms of weighting, each accounting for 1.5% to 3.2% of the portfolio. That leaves the fund less exposed to risk from a single holding.The ETF has made an impressive run since it broke out of a long consolidation and started making new highs last July. Today, shares are finding support at the 50-day moving average. That leaves investors with an opportunity to buy shares, although it needs to be treated as a secondary entry, not as favorable as a base breakout. The most recent of those was in November, when First Trust Nasdaq-100-Tech Sector was trading at 51.65.RELATED:Robotics ETF Taps Growth In Manufacturing, Drones, Other AreasThis Cloud-Computing ETF Is Loaded With FANG Stocks

Other companies circling the business include Western Digital (WDC), which operates a chip factory with Toshiba in Japan; and memory chip makers Micron Technology (MU) and SK Hynix.Toshiba is looking to raise at least 1 trillion yen from the sale of part or all of the business to cover write downs at its Westinghouse nuclear unit, Reuters said.

""But if it were to, we believe the key positives for Broadcom could include: 1) successful track record integrating acquisitions, 2) delivers on (earnings per share) accretion targets, and 3) big expansion of their total addressable market.""But Broadcom would face several challenges in purchasing the unit, including limited experience managing a Nand business, which is capital intensive. It also could be buying a Nand business near the peak of the chip cycle, Chin said.Chin reiterated his buy rating on Broadcom stock with a 12-month price target of 245.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99 and is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. For more information on Broadcom, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the possible Broadcom-Silver Lake bid is at the high end of the expected range of $13 billion to $18 billion for Toshiba's chip unit.""We think it's unlikely that Broadcom intends to acquire a majority stake in Nand assets and start running fabs,"" Daryanani said in a report. ""The likely scenario we think is: Broadcom is the minority bidder with Silver Lake to a) acquire small non-memory assets within the division (controllers, etc.) and/or b) Broadcom is doing a passive investment with Silver Lake being the primary bidder.""Toshiba's Nand business would dilute Broadcom's profit margins, Daryanani said.He maintains his top pick rating on Broadcom stock with a price target of 240.RELATED:Samsung Galaxy S8 Should Help These Notable Tech Firms

139,WDC,"Computer hardware giant Dell Technologies (DVMT) on Thursday reported strong fiscal fourth-quarter results that have positive implications for peers like HP Inc. (HPQ) and NetApp (NTAP) as well as other tech firms.Round Rock, Texas-based Dell said its sales in the quarter ended Feb. 3 were $20.1 billion, up 53% from the year-earlier period, which was before Dell purchased data storage tech firm EMC.

That included $3.6 billion from servers and networking and $4.8 billion from storage. VMware revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion, Dell reported.""Dell's server and networking performance should also have positive implications for the server/data center segments of Intel, Western Digital, Seagate and CDW,"" Daryanani said. NetApp should benefit from the same trends helping Dell's storage business, he said.

142,WDC,"Supercomputer maker Cray (CRAY), after a strong start to 2016, soon lagged and in November hit its lowest price since May 2013.But that was last year, says Needham analyst Richard Kugele, who is making the high-end computer system vendor his top pick for 2017, after it was the second-worst performer in his coverage universe last year.In the 15 companies covered in a sector that Kugele calls enterprise infrastructure, only Hortonworks (HDP) underperformed Cray in 2016. Cray fell 36% last year, hurt by such factors as Intel's (INTC) delay in releasing its high end Knights Bridge chip, which Cray is using in some of its products, and by what the company called an ""electrical smoke event"" at one of its two Chippewa Falls, Wis., plants.IBD'S TAKE: Cray shouldn't yet be on many watchlists, but stocks that bear watching can be found on the IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks over the past 12 months, with an emphasis on the most recent six months.In its Q2 earnings report Aug. 2, Cray said one factor with its lowered guidance included ""a very recent electrical smoke event caused by a failed manufacturing facility power component that will delay the company's ability to deliver on some customer contracts in 2016, including an impact on anticipated third quarter revenue.""Cray's stock tanked 30% the following day, after shares in March had touched a 13-year high near 44.While ""2016 saw multiple headwinds for Cray ... we believe the worst is over,"" Kugele wrote in his research note Tuesday. He rates Cray stock a buy, with a 25 price target.Cray stock, though, fell 3.4% to 20 in the stock market today. It's trading at its 50-day line, but with a Relative Strength Rating of just 6 it's among the worst-performing stocks.Kugele's top pick in the enterprise infrastructure group last year was Western Digital (WDC), which rose 13% in 2016, ranking just No. 10 of the 15 stocks. But Kugele remains bullish on the hard-drive and flash-drive maker, and says it's on track for earnings per shares of $10-$11 within a couple years, which he says could boost the stock over 100.Western Digital stock rose 2.2% Tuesday to 69.43. RELATED:Western Digital Tackling 'Third Platform' Of Storage

It's well-worth noting that all of those losses occurred in light trade.Micron Technology (MU) and Under Armour (UA) pegged the S&P 500's best gains.Micron spiked 7% as earnings rose to 90 cents a share, up from a penny in the year-ago quarter. Revenue soared 58%. But the industry took particular heart in Micron's Q3 outlook, which placed the midpoint of earnings guidance 61% above consensus views. Micron shares ended the week up 11% and at a new high, extended from a February rebound from 10-week support.Under Armour popped 4% following an upgrade to buy, from hold, by Jefferies. The stock suffered a 63% sell-off over the past 11 months, but the Jefferies note diagnosed the correction as having formed a bottom and, given market circumstances, ""an inflection has formed and the buying (opportunity) is now."" CAN SLIM investors can minimize risk by waiting for a proper base to form.The Nasdaq composite held its loss Friday to less than 0.1%, ending off 1.2% in its sharpest weekly slip since December. Micron topped the Nasdaq 100, with Western Digital (WDC), Tesla (TSLA), Cerner (CERN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) all advancing 2% or more.Tesla chairman Elon Musk teased investors with tweets revealing new details regarding the company's upcoming Model 3, and more distant Model Y and Roadster vehicles. Tesla shares are five weeks into a consolidation — holding nice support at the stock's 10-week moving average, but it's slightly too deep to qualify as a flat base.Among IBD 50 stocks, China's TAL Education Group (TAL) jumped 3% Friday in its eighth straight daily advance. Shares are taking out new highs and are well-extended above a three-weeks-tight buy point of 83.97.BioTelemetry (BEAT) also gained 2%, narrowing its loss for the week to less than 3%. The stock bounced off its 10-week moving average on Thursday, but week volume nullified the move as a buying opportunity.RELATED:ObamaCare Repeal Vote Failure Threatens Tax Cuts — And Stock RallyChip Gear Makers Rise On Upbeat Micron OutlookStock Market Today: Do These 6 Chip Names Have A Shot At Big Gains In 2017?

153,WDC,"Some of Silicon Valley's biggest companies are trying to smooth over frictions with President-elect Donald Trump, but the soon-to-be tweeter-in-chief's possible protectionist trade measures and strained relations with China could spell trouble for the tech industry.Trump met with 14 tech leaders on Wednesday, and the tech summit's main topic included China. Those attending included the CEOs of Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA) and Intel (INTC). Facebook's (FB) No. 2 exec also attended. But few details about the closed meeting were revealed.Trump, who took shots at Apple, Amazon and tech in general during the campaign, looked to forge some common ground with the tech leaders. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, in the only public comment by a tech attendee, called the meeting ""very productive."" At the meeting's start, which was open to the press, Trump complimented the industry and said he wanted to help it do well.But Trump is off to a rocky start with China's government, starting with a breach of long-held protocol by accepting a phone call from Taiwan's president. China claims Taiwan as part of China, and the U.S. has officially recognized ""One China"" diplomatic relations since 1979. The Trump camp has suggested the One China policy could be used as a bargaining chip to win future trade concessions.During the campaign, Trump promised to brand China a currency manipulator. He warned of slapping a 45% import tariff on all Chinese goods.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix is a current member of the exclusive IBD Leaderboard, where only the very best stocks at or near buy points reside. Netflix has a conventional buy point of 129.39, but investors willing to be more aggressive should check out Leaderboard for some more information.If Trump follows through and elevates the international status of Taiwan and enacts protectionist trade measures, China's government would retaliate, observers say. China did protest Trump's phone conversation with Taiwan's president.U.S. tech, and other, companies should be ""plenty worried"" about Trump's statements, says Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. But if Trump's words don't turn into action, it could blow over. China will hold Trump more accountable once he's sworn in as president on Jan. 20, Lardy says.""He's not president yet,"" Lardy said. ""There are a lot of things China could do, but I don't think they will do any of them until there's something that goes beyond rhetoric.""Talking about how he's going to be a hard deal maker, all these things are not going to set the Chinese off on a path of retaliation immediately. But if it becomes more concrete than just rhetoric, at that point you could see retaliation in the commercial sphere. There are lots of screws they can turn on U.S. companies.""China's possible retaliatory actions include case-by-case enforcement of anti-monopoly laws and business regulations, slapping tariffs on U.S. goods and favoring European multinationals in purchases. China also could put an economic embargo on Taiwanese products.One worry for Silicon Valley is that Trump's transition team and early Cabinet appointments have few ties to the tech industry. Trump has focused on manufacturing jobs, not the digital economy. Wilbur Ross Jr., selected to head the Commerce Department, is well-known for deals in the steel and coal industry.Trump has named Gov. Terry Branstad, R-Iowa, as his ambassador to China. Branstad calls President Xi Jinping of China an ""old friend."" Lardy, though, says it's not clear how much of a ""moderating effect"" Branstad will have on Trump's dealings with China.Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA) has warned Trump about raising trade barriers. And a Chinese state-run newspaper warned in November that companies such as Apple and Boeing (BA) would be among the first to be punished if a trade war erupts.For its fiscal Q4 ended Sept. 24, Apple garnered 19% of its revenue from the Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong. Amid tougher competition from local smartphone makers, Apple's revenue from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan fell 30% year over year in the quarter to $8.8 billion. The was by far its worst-performing region, but Apple has high hopes for its business in the world's biggest nation.Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) gets some 38% of revenue from China, says a JPMorgan report. Qualcomm in 2015 agreed to pay a $975 million fine as part of a settlement with Chinese antitrust authorities that probed its licensing deals.IBM (IBM), Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) head a long list of computer companies that could be impacted by a U.S.-China trade battle, as well as chipmakers Intel and Micron Technology (MU) and data storage product makers such as Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX).Some companies have already been harmed from revelations by Edward Snowden that U.S. tech firms' products have been used by the National Security Agency for spying. China's government responded by telling state-owned companies to buy more local equipment.One wild card is whether Trump can be more helpful to U.S. companies aiming to crack China's market than the Obama administration.Video streamer Netflix (NFLX) recently shelved its expansion in China, saying ""the regulatory environment for foreign digital content services in China has become challenging.""IBM, Intel and Microsoft have complained of Beijing pressure to hand over the keys to intellectual property to win more business.China's censorship and monitoring of social networks has stymied U.S. internet firms. Google pulled out of mainland China in 2010. Facebook, anxious to break into China, has developed censorship tools designed to let the nation's regulators suppress content, according to reports from the New York Times and others.Cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA), which acquired movie studio DreamWorks in April, is ""very, very bullish"" on its China business, Steve Burke, CEO of Comcast's NBCUniversal, said on the company's earnings conference call in July.""I'm talking movies, television, consumer products and theme parks,"" Burke said.Comcast is on track to open a new theme park in Beijing, with local partners, in 2020. Meanwhile, China is poised to become the world's No. 1 film market.Then there are companies like Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) that have a stake in trade relations. China last year said it would open up its fast-growing electronic payments market, including bank card transactions, to foreign companies. China has been under World Trade Organization pressure to open up its payments card business since 2001.One risk for U.S. companies is that joint ventures on the mainland could be put on ice if trade frictions rise. Wang Jianlin, China's richest man and chairman of real estate and entertainment giant Dalian Wanda Group, has warned Trump of trouble if Chinese acquisitions of U.S. assets are blocked.Since China joined the World Trade Organization 15 years ago, U.S. exports to China have risen by more than 600%, while U.S. exports to the rest of the world rose by 80%, Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia, told IBD in an email.The U.S. ran up a $366 billion trade deficit with China last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It has been declining, but Trump aims to lower further.""Many American jobs and corporate profits would be lost if China would retaliate against new tariffs, including in the Republican-leaning Farm Belt, as China is the second-largest market for American agricultural exports, led by soybeans,"" Rothman said. ""Prices for goods sold at places such as Wal-Mart (WMT) might rise by 10% or more.  That would hurt the spending power of Trump's working-class political base.""RELATED:Apple, Palantir Among Loose Ends At Trump Tech SummitApple Hits Great Wall Of iPhone Competition In ChinaAlibaba Singles Day Breaks Record, But Growth SlowsChina GDP Rises 6.7% In Q3, Same As Q2, Q1

155,WDC,"Stocks were mildly lower in late-afternoon trading Friday ahead of a shortened week of trading next week due to the Thanksgiving holiday.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite showed losses of around 0.2% as of 3 p.m. in New York. Small caps bucked the trend as the Russell 2000 added 0.3%. After soaring 10% last week, the popular small-cap index is up another 2% this week.Volume on the Nasdaq was tracking about 15% lower than Thursday's level. NYSE volume was on pace to be slightly higher in the stock market today.Chevron (CVX) outperformed in the Dow, rising 1.3%. Merck (MRK) and Procter & Gamble (PG) lagged with losses of 1% and 1.4%, respectively.In addition to Chevron, other oil and gas producers outperformed. Devon Energy (DVN) jumped 3% to 44.20. Its current consolidation shows a 45.72 buy point. Ross Stores (ROST) led the Nasdaq 100, rising nearly 4%. Late Thursday, the company reported its second straight quarter of accelerating earnings and sales growth. It's still in buy range from a 66.38 buy point. Nasdaq 100 component Western Digital (WDC) wasn't far behind, rising 3%. It's been showing supporting action at its 10-week moving average after a recent breakout over a 54.66 buy point.After a soft start, Applied Materials (AMAT) was up 0.5% to 30.89 in late trading on strong earnings. The chip-equipment maker was poised for its sixth straight gain but is still in buy range from a 31.17 buy point.Chip designer Cirrus Logic (CRUS) gained 2% to 57.71. It's near the top of a second-stage flat base with a 58.18 buy point. The prior base that formed from the spring of 2015 until June this year was long enough to reset the base count. However, the stock has also gained a lot of ground since rising past an initial breakout past 24.20 in January 2015.Sucampo Pharmaceuticals (SCMP) outperformed in the IBD 50, rising 2%.

156,WDC,"Major indexes struggled to advance despite Wednesday's strong February report on private sector job creation, but the Nasdaq composite and the tech-leaning Nasdaq 100 are both up nearly 0.3%.Snap (SNAP), meanwhile, enjoyed a more than 6% lift to 22.88, and volume is heavy at 36 million shares as of 3 p.m. ET. However, total session turnover is unlikely to surpass the 71.9 million shares that exchanged hands during Tuesday's big sell-off. One would prefer to see a high-growth stock rise in higher volume vs. the prior session, and not in lower turnover, as it would indicate serious demand for shares among the professional crowd. However, it's also perfectly natural to see Snap's daily turnover cool down after last week's highly anticipated market debut.After 50 days of trading have passed, investors can then track Snap's level of turnover by comparing it with the 50-day moving average, found on all IBD charts as well as on Marketsmith, IBD's premium-quality charting and stock screening service.The major averages, including the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Russell 2000, were down slightly but off intraday lows. Volume is running sharply higher on the NYSE vs. the same time on Tuesday, while Nasdaq turnover was virtually flat.Despite the losses, the S&P 500 still stands tall in 2017, up 5.6% since Jan. 1. As seen on a daily chart, the 500, Dow Jones industrial average, and Nasdaq all are leading their respective 50-day moving averages, which in turn are all rising.That's healthy action for a market that has been in a nearly nine-month uptrend since the rare Day 3 follow-through that took place on June 30 last year.Among leading stocks, Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX) deserve close watch as they appear to join the likes of Apple (AAPL) in making nice gains since pulling themselves out of big declines, forming bottoming base patterns that show clear institutional buying, and coasting to 52-week highs. Western Digital on Feb. 24 bounced nicely off its 50-day moving average near 73.46, presenting a follow-on buy entry. Seagate barreled past a 41.55 first-stage base entry on Jan. 25 in huge volume after reporting a 68% leap in fiscal Q2 profit and its smallest year-over-year revenue drop in seven quarters.Viewed from a weekly chart, Seagate's quiet action in recent days may become a narrow handle on a much larger, deeper consolidation. France's digital ad firm Criteo (CRTO) is also on the move up, rising 2.1% to 50. The software firm is now extended more than 8% past a 46.09 buy point within a first-stage cup with handle.Criteo went public in late 2013 at 31 a share. Earnings per share have grown 64%, 34%, 106%, 182% and 17% vs. year-ago levels in the past five quarters. Due in part to a tough comparison, Q1 profit is seen up just 2% to 44 cents a share.Momo (MOMO), a video platform and play on the Chinese digital ad industry, rocketed 13% to 33.97, good for another all-time high, following robust Q4 results (EPS up 633%, revenue up 524%) issued Tuesday morning. The gain from a 23.96 cup-with-handle buy point has stretched to more than 41%.Returning to Snap, given the wild price action over the past four sessions, it is still way too early to determine a proper buy point. Some IPO bases can be as narrow as seven to 10 days in length, but are extremely rare.For now, Snap has plenty of work ahead of itself after already falling as much as 30% below its all-time high of 29.44. The company also has yet to turn a profit.Most excellent cup and double-bottom bases see a decline of between 20% and 33% from head to toe. Snap's drop is already too deep for a flat base pattern.RELATED:IBD Industry Themes: Why These 4 Data Storage Firms Are ExcellingHow To Invest: The Case For A Trump-Era Secular Bull RunWhen To Buy A Turnaround: Spotting The Bottoming Base

157,WDC,"Stocks opened higher Friday, as investors monitored an increasingly tense health care bill standoff in Washington.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1%, the S&P 500 added 0.2% and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5%.GOP lawmakers delayed a scheduled Thursday night vote on their American Health Care Act, intended to revoke and replace ObamaCare. Lack of support for the bill led President Trump to urge the vote be pushed to Friday, and White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney informed congressional leaders that the president had finished negotiating. He said if Congress was unable to pass the bill Friday, the White House would move on to other issues.How markets will react remains uncertain. The Dow industrial average ended Thursday down 1.2% for the week and tacking toward the index's worst performance since the week just prior to the Nov. 8 presidential election. The S&P 500 was down 1.4%, also looking at its worst weekly showing since the week before the election. The Nasdaq was down 1.4% — it suffered harder hits during two separate weeks in December.All three indexes are near their 50-day moving averages, which suggests a positive session could bring support at that technical level. A tumble below that moving average, particularly in heavy trade, would suggest a loss of support.Intel (INTC), DuPont (DD) and Untied Technologies (UTX)were modestly higher on the Dow industrials.Key tech names: Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) all traded 0.3% to 0.4% higher at the open.Micron Technology (MU) fired off an 11% gain after a huge jump in fiscal second-quarter earnings beat analyst forecasts, and revenue rose 58% to meet views. Management's third-quarter guidance was far above the consensus target. Micron shares are extended after an early March rebound from support at their 10-week moving average.Under Armour (UA) gained 3% at the open, boosted by an upgrade to buy from hold from Jefferies. Shares have been in a steep sell-off for 11 months.Western Digital (WDC) climbed 6%. The diversifying computer storage play climbed back above the 50-day moving average and is working on a flat base.Retailers GameStop (GME) and Finish Line (FINL) posted two of the deepest early losses after reporting fourth-quarter results late Thursday.Video game chain GameStop tanked by 11% as a flat earnings report met expectations and revenue fell 14%, further than expected. Finish Line tumbled 16% on a wide earnings miss. Both stocks are in deep corrections.New orders for durable goods rose 1.7% in February, the Commerce Department estimated, down from January's 1.8% increase, but above consensus views for a 1.5% gain.

159,WDC,"The harsh sell-off of semiconductor stocks on Thursday created a buying opportunity for investors wanting a stake in top chip companies, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a report.Semiconductor stocks fell hard Thursday as investors rotated out of the tech sector and also reacted to reports that Apple (AAPL) is cutting production of its iPhone 7 handsets, Rakesh said.""The substantial pullback despite much stronger fundamentals, in our view, creates a buying opportunity,"" he said in a report. ""Semiconductor valuations are back to Feb.-April of 2016.""Rakesh recommended buying Broadcom (AVGO), Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Intel (INTC), Micron Technology (MU), Microsemi (MSCC), ON Semiconductor (ON), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Western Digital (WDC).""All have, in our view, significant growth and strong fundamentals ahead,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top growth stocks includes six chip companies, such as Microsemi and Nvidia. The IBD 50 is one of many proprietary stock analysis tools for investors to consult on Investors.com.Semiconductor stocks are attractive ""given the strong earnings growth, cost synergies, strong industrial, automotive, defense/aerospace, and continued synergistic M&A driven also by a better regulatory environment,"" Rakesh said.Rakesh's eight stock picks all dropped Thursday, but they all gained some ground on the stock market today.In his report, Rakesh also listed graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) as a buy, but said its steep valuation could give investors pause. Nvidia also edged higher Friday.Meanwhile, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill reiterated his buy rating on audio chipmaker Cirrus Logic (CRUS) with a price target of 65. He said Cirrus was pushed down on ""noise"" about iPhone 7 sales.""We remain bullish on CRUS as we see several vectors of growth, including further penetration of digital and ultimately ANC (active noise cancellation) headsets (beginning in Q1 2017) in the Android and accessory markets, a better iPhone 8 unit cycle, and expansion in the audio amplifier market,"" Gill said.Cirrus Logic rose 1.6% to 50.10 on Friday, but fell nearly 13% for the week.RELATED:Demand 'Sedate' For Apple iPhone 7, 'Robust' For iPhone 7 PlusGoPro Chip Supplier Ambarella Down On Weak Q4 Guidance

160,WDC,"Disk drive maker Western Digital (WDC) is expected to show its strongest revenue growth in more than two years when it reports earnings after the close Wednesday, but profits keep falling.The consensus estimate is for revenue of $4.52 billion, up 35% year over year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings per share minus items of $1.01, down 33% and the seventh quarter in a row of year-over-year declines.Western Digital, along with main competitor Seagate Technology (STX), is facing slowing demand for disk drives as consumers shift from desktop PCs to smartphones and tablets.Western Digital and Seagate this month both received price-target increases from RBC Capital Markets, as conditions in the data storage market stabilize. Western Digital saw its price target raised to 65 from 60, with an outperform rating. Last week both companies received a price-target increase from Mizuho, which raised estimates on disk drive shipments.IBD'S Take: Both stocks are in IBD's data storage industry group, which has surged to No. 7 out of 197 groups from No. 81 two months ago. Seagate has an IBD Composite Rating of 75, meaning it is outperforming 75% of stocks in the past year in key metrics. Western Digital has a weaker CR of 40. For more information about trading stocks, check out IBD University.Western Digital stock rose 0.85%, to 53.52, in the stock market today. Shares broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a 54.51 buy point on Sept. 16, so remain within the buy range. Seagate stock rose a fraction to 34.52.Western Digital, which closed its acquisition of flash-chip storage provider SanDisk in May, is seeing ""sustained tailwinds"" across its disk-drive and chip-storage business lines, the RBC report said. It also said earnings estimates for Western Digital are positioned to keep edging up through the end of 2016.With SanDisk, Western Digital became a major competitor in both hard-disk drives and flash chip storage. SanDisk is among the largest providers of flash-chip storage, a market led by Samsung Electronics.Seagate traded down last week after posting quarterly earnings that beat the Wall Street consensus estimates, following preliminary results that Seagate posted the previous week. Seagate said it shipped a record amount of disk drive capacity, which it attributed to strong demand from cloud storage providers.Mizuho has raised its 2016 estimates for hard-disk drive shipments to 412 million from 393 million.  That would still be a 12% decline, but Mizuho earlier had estimated a 16% drop. Mizuho raised its estimate for 2017 to 385 million from 367 million.RELATED: Disk Drive Stocks Slammed Despite Seagate's Strong Guidance

Below is a look at stocks like T-Mobile (TMUS), Charter Communications (CMTR) and Chinese internet stock Weibo (WB) that expect 50% or higher EPS growth and are in or near a potential buy zone.To make the list, each stock must also trade over 200,000 shares per day and have a 90 or higher Composite Rating, meaning it's in the top 10% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.When this story was first published on Apr. 5, Alibaba (BABA) was on the list, with analysts calling for 51% earnings growth when it reports May 3. But the Chinese internet giant has now climbed above a proper buy zone.Tesla (TSLA) was also on the original list with a 52% EPS growth estimate, but closed Thursday just beyond the buy zone that extended to 301.87.Investment firm Apollo Global Management (APO), which held the No. 2 spot on the list with expected earnings growth of 395%, has also now moved beyond a proper buying range.Louisiana Pacific (LPX), Mastec (MTZ) and Western Digital[ticker symb=WDC] also closed Thursday trading just within their respective buy zones.Boosted by two quarters of triple-digit earnings growth, Cirrus Logic (CRUS) has been testing a 64.26 buy point in a first-stage cup, with its relative strength line floating near new high territory.TTM Technologies (TTMI), a contract manufacturer of printed circuit boards, rose nearly 9% on Apr. 4 in heavy volume after getting an upgrade from neutral to overweight from JPMorgan Chase (JPM).TTM has since pulled back and is trying to recapture its 50-day moving average as it works on a second-stage consolidation.The Costa Mesa, Calif.-based company has posted 71% average EPS growth over the last three quarters.The ""trick"" to making money during earnings season is to be prepared with an up-to-date watch list and action plan. When a company delivers an earnings surprise and breaks out, you want to be there, ready to pounce.But keep in mind that disappointing numbers can trigger a sudden and sharp decline, which makes it risky to buy stocks just before they report.So use screens like the one below, as well as any custom screens you create during MarketSmith open access week, as idea generators that identify stocks to watch as we head into the Q1 earnings season.Also be sure to run all your stocks through a buying checklist before you invest, use sound buy and sell rules and check overall market conditions.Stocks Nears A Buy Point And Expecting 50% Or Higher Q1 Earnings Growth

191,WDC,"When Western Digital (WDC) closed its $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk in May, the leading provider of disk drives greatly expanded in the business of flash-based chip-storage products widely used in mobile devices.Western Digital made the acquisition to address the dramatic growth in data creation and the evolution of data storage.SanDisk has long been among the leaders in flash-based chip storage, the kind used in smartphones and tablet computers. With SanDisk, Western Digital sees its total addressable market at $72 billion.Already the No. 1 provider of disk drives, just ahead of archrival Seagate Technology (STX), Western Digital now is also a formidable player in chip-based flash storage. Western Digital and Seagate for several years have been dealing with lower demand for disk drives as consumers shift from desktop PCs to smartphones and tablets.The move helped Western Digital's stock, which is up 17% in 2016 and trading well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, key support lines. Western Digital stock fell a fraction to 70.17 in the stock market today.The data storage market is evolving to meet the growing demands of cloud computing, mobile computing, the Internet of Things and other forms of computing, Mike Cordano, Western Digital's president and chief operating officer, recently told IBD in a Q&A about the road ahead in 2017.IBD: With the SanDisk acquisition done, what kind of 2017 do you expect from Western Digital?Cordano: For one, we hope to reach our full stride as an integrated company — the new Western Digital, combining all the SanDisk assets. We're through the first big wave of this integration. We're in a position to deploy an integrated product roadmap across various markets that are changing dramatically.IBD'S TAKE: There are plenty of places on Investors.com to research and find top stocks, but when you're looking to get a broader idea on top tech stocks, IBD's Tech Leaders feature is worth reviewing. You can, for example, find out about four tech earnings leaders.What we see happening is an acceleration of new computing architectures. Some people call it a third platform. It's the advent of cloud mobility and other things like artificial intelligence and machine learning. For us it's really about continuing to provide the technology and storage-product building blocks. We've got a very clear focus on that across the breadth of the company. Having SanDisk and its nonvolatile memory, or flash, platform within our portfolio really allows us to play across the entire storage landscape.IBD: What do you mean by a third platform?Cordano: The third platform has various elements. One central theme is the buildout of cloud computing, both public and private. Another is mobility, which is becoming sort of a leading driver of the edge, or client. And then there are a number of other threads within that, like the Internet of Things, which is creating machine-generated data.Once you've created these big data repositories in the cloud, new methodologies allow you to derive value and insights from that data. Those are all attributes of this third platform. The previous architectural construct, the second platform, was really client-server technology. We're in the transition from second to third now.IBD: What opportunities does the third platform provide Western Digital?Cordano: Some examples are in the area of mobility and the Internet of Things. Prior to acquiring SanDisk, we had limited exposure to the storage elements of smartphones, or edge sensors in the case of IoT. And now we have exposure to all of those types of products.We're also well-aligned with the people innovating in those areas. So we have a very good view of what's happening, what the storage needs are and what the next-generation products are. We're now participating in those market segments that we were not in prior to the SanDisk acquisition.And if you look at the basic construct in the cloud data center, two storage building blocks are primarily contemplated. One is the enterprise hard drive — an optimized disk drive that is built for the data center, where you get a cost-per-gigabyte advantage. The other major building block is flash, or flash-based storage. So the coupling of those two are really the new building blocks of the cloud data center.One is optimized for cost per gigabyte, which is disk. The other is optimized for cost per I/O, which is a performance measurement — cost per input/output. Depending on the way that application is written, you're going to blend those two technologies in an optimal way to provide capability and performance.IBD: What's the future of disk drives now that chip storage is becoming more pervasive?Cordano: We recognized there was going to be a changing role for disk drives and that, given this transition to the third platform, the fundamental technology was going to change. The role of the hard drive will continue, but it's a changed role.In the data center we see the emergence of this capacity enterprise product line, which is where the growth is, relative to exabytes deployed. We really see the growth in 2020 and beyond to be largely in high-capacity enterprise drives.Historically, Western Digital was primarily in a PC-driven market. That segment of the market is changing as attributes of mobility are more important. The role of nonvolatile memory is playing a more significant role in the PC market. In the markets we serve we see a shifting, changing landscape, where flash is becoming more important in some categories. Disk drives are shrinking in those markets but, as far out as we are planning, we see a role for hard-drive technology, in particular in the data center.IBD: What has the rise of cloud computing meant for Western Digital?Cordano: Its provided multiple levels of opportunity. We've been working directly with large hyper-scale providers for years. That has given us insight into how the tech transitions were going to occur. That was very useful in making plans for products and forming our own strategy. It's been a growth driver. It's also creating a lot of interesting dynamics in the broad IT ecosystem, where things that were more traditionally on premise are moving to the cloud.IBD: How much data can we expect to see crammed into future flash chips?Cordano: What you see is quite interesting. If you look at the capacity growth-rate metrics, solid state is growing roughly at the same rate as disk. If you look at the rate of what we would call areal density, we see that growing in the neighborhood of 25% annualized. That will enable the right balance of cost and performance to support this burgeoning data growth that everyone wants to get access so. Certainly on both technology types the cost per gigabyte is dropping at roughly the same rate.RELATED:Western Digital Draws Praise At First Full-Scale Analyst Meeting In 4 YearsBox CEO Interviewed: Aiming To Change How Businesses Work

203,WDC,"Western Digital (WDC) shareholders approved a $16 billion deal to acquire SanDisk (SNDK), creating a formidable competitor in both disk drives and flash-chip storage.“We like the merger,” Monika Garg, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, wrote in a research note. “The deal makes strategic sense for both companies. For Western Digital, it removes an overhang from the flash-chip impact on hard disk drives. Western Digital would then own the best flash assets and supply for its solid-state drive business.""SanDisk is a leading provider of chips used for data storage in a wide variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets and PCs. The deal will help SanDisk, which has a strong retail business, to move up the ladder into the enterprise market, where Western Digital is strongest. Western Digital gets the ability to offer chip-based storage in areas where its disk drive technology is losing ground.Western Digital and SanDisk combined had revenue of about $20 billion in 2015. Western Digital is the largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX), though the market has struggled as PC sales decline. Western Digital and Seagate have pursued the flash chip market.""This combination brings together two tremendous companies and cultures ideally positioned to capture the growth opportunities in our rapidly evolving industry,” said Steve Milligan, Western Digital CEO, in a statement announcing the deal.China regulators are the last remaining obstacle. China has a say in the transaction, based on Western Digital investments in that country. RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research note that he expects China to approve the deal.More than 90% of votes cast were in favor of approving the issuance of Western Digital stock in connection with the acquisition, Western Digital said. SanDisk said 98% of its shareholders approved the deal.“The combination of SanDisk with Western Digital will enable the combined company to offer the broadest portfolio of industry-leading, innovative storage solutions to customers across a wide range of markets and applications,” said SanDisk CEO Sanjay Mehrotra in a statement.SanDisk shareholders will receive $67.50 in cash and 0.2387 Western Digital share for each share of SanDisk stock. That amounts to about $79 per share, based on Monday's closing price of $48.19 for Western Digital. The deal was valued at $86.50 a share, or about $19 billion, when it was first announced on Oct. 21. That changed when China’s Unisplendour pulled its plan to make a $3.8 billion investment for a 15% stake in Western Digital on Feb. 23, amid a U.S. government inquiry. By terminating the investment, Unisplendour triggered the alternative deal.Western Digital anticipates seeing $500 million in total cost synergies, not including tax savings, from the acquisition. Institutional Shareholder Services, a leading independent proxy advisory firm, issued a report on Feb. 29 recommending Western Digital shareholders approve the deal and said the transaction could attain $1.1 billion in cost synergies within 12 months of closing.Shares of Western Digital and Seagate were down 1.5% each in midday trading in the stock market today, near 45 and 76, respectively.Needham analyst Richard Kugele said in a research note that the focus will now quickly shift to Western Digital being able to “streamline two organizations and extract synergy savings while maintaining the strong cash flow of the traditional core to finance the debt.”Kugele has a strong buy on Western Digital stock, with a price target of 90. He said flash-based storage systems are proving critical for the front end of data centers, and increasingly serve as primary storage.

212,WDC,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 news is seen as positive for Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Intel (INTC), but negative for Qualcomm (QCOM), according to Wall Street analysts.The iPhone 7 supports 25 radio-frequency bands vs. 23 bands in the iPhone 6S series.""Overall the increased RF content should remain a tailwind for RF suppliers as other handset (manufacturers) emulate the iPhone road map,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a research report. The increased bands in the iPhone 7 will be especially positive for Broadcom, he said.The increased bands should benefit all RF suppliers, but Broadcom and Qorvo (QRVO) will benefit more than Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said.IBD'S TAKE: Among Apple chip suppliers seen benefiting from the iPhone 7 launch, only Broadcom is on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.Audio chipmaker Cirrus Logic will profit from Apple's decision to remove the analog audio jack from the iPhone 7 and include digital earbuds and an adapter with the new handset, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said in a report.Cirrus Logic also will benefit from Apple adding a second speaker to the iPhone 7 to give it stereo sound, he said.""We anticipate an incremental $2.50 in content associated with the Lightning earpods, Lightning adapter and second stereo speaker,"" Vinh said. ""Despite the significant content increase, we believe much of this has already been built into guidance and stock expectations.""For that reason, he is sector weight, or neutral, on Cirrus Logic stock.It is unclear whether Cirrus Logic has content in Apple's new wireless earbuds called AirPods, Vinh noted. AirPods will go on sale in late October for $159 a pair.His ""favorite Apple-exposed suppliers"" are Analog Devices (ADI), Broadcom, InvenSense (INVN) and Skyworks.Suppliers getting content boosts from the iPhone 7 likely include ADI and Broadcom, RBC Capital Markets said in a report.ADI could get about 30% more content in the iPhone 7 vs. the iPhone 6S series after winning a processor for the camera module, RBC said. Analog Devices gets about 13% of its revenue from Apple.Broadcom also could see a 30% boost in content in the iPhone 7, RBC said. Broadcom gets about 15% to 18% of its revenue from Apple.The iPhone 7 is a negative for Qualcomm, because it could lose 20% to 25% of its baseband chip share in the new smartphone to Intel, BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said in a report.Qualcomm is supplying CDMA versions of the iPhone 7 and Intel is supplying non-CDMA versions, which is based on the wireless technologies carriers use.Apple's iPhone 7 is seen as positive for memory suppliers Micron Technology (MU) and Western Digital (WDC) because the new handsets feature twice as much Nand flash data storage as last year's models.The iPhone 7 series has data storage from 32 gigabytes to 256 GB vs. the prior 16 GB to 128 GB.""Doubling Nand storage could further tighten Nand supply and set a trend toward 256-GB handset densities,"" Mizuho's Rakesh said. ""The increased Nand storage should drive further pricing and margin stability in an already tight Nand supply chain, which is a clear positive for MU and WDC.""Apple shares finished 2.6% lower on stock market today at 105.52, as its announcement carried few surprises. Broadcom dipped 0.3%, Qualcomm rose 0.4%, Intel was essentially flat, Cirrus Logic eased 0.15%, while Micron gained 1.7%.RELATED:Apple iPhone 7 Launch Not 'Insanely Great,' But 'Good Enough'

213,WDC,"Disk drive maker Seagate Technology (STX) beat Wall Street consensus estimates with its quarterly earnings report Tuesday morning, but EPS and revenue continued to decline amid the PC slump.Seagate reported revenue of $2.65 billion, down 9% year over year but slightly above the consensus estimate of $2.64 billion, for its fiscal fourth quarter ended July 1. It was the sixth quarter in a row of year-over-year revenue declines.Earnings per share minus items fell 10% to 69 cents, but it still topped the consensus of 60 cents. It also was the sixth quarter in a row of declines for EPS.Seagate stock fell 5.5% to close at 30.65 in the stock market today. Seagate enjoyed its best gain in more than four years on July 12, rising 22%, after it hiked its earnings guidance and announced a big cut to its workforce.IBD'S TAKE: Seagate is up 74% after hitting a five year low of 18.42 on May 13. But Seagate has an IBD Composite Rating of 39, meaning it is being outperformed by 60% of stocks. Look for winning stocks with strong fundamentals at IBD Stock Checkup.For fiscal 2016, Seagate generated $1.7 billion in operating cash flow and paid cash dividends of $727 million. It ended its fiscal year with $1.1 billion in cash and equivalents, down from $2.5 billion a year earlier.Seagate rival Western Digital (WDC) reported quarterly earnings last week that topped the consensus estimate. Western Digital revenue rose 10% to $3.5 billion, but it includes partial results from its acquisition of flash-chip storage company SanDisk. Earnings per share minus items fell 48% to 79 cents.Seagate and Western Digital are dealing with lower disk drive demand as consumers shift to smartphones and portables from desktop PCs.""I am confident of the company's long-term sustainability and prosperity in a world of significant data creation and high-capacity storage demand driven by emerging technologies, and cloud infrastructure deployments,"" Seagate CEO Steve Luczo said in the company's earnings release.Western Digital fell 2.2%.

214,WDC,"Expectations that Western Digital (WDC) shareholders will agree to the acquisition of SanDisk (SNDK) increased Thursday, with Summit Research issuing an upbeat report.“We think that shareholder approval is most likely a done deal,” wrote Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan.The vote among Western Digital shareholders is set for March 15. A definitive agreement between the two companies was reached on Oct. 21.The Summit report follows another from RBC analyst Amit Daryanani, who said an analysis of the top 20 Western Digital shareholders and discussions with a large number of investors indicate “the probability is higher the deal gets approved vs. not.” He said 15 of the top 20 Western Digital shareholders also own SanDisk stock, making the potential approval likely.Western Digital and SanDisk combined had revenue of about $20 billion in 2015. Western Digital is largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX,), though the market has struggled as PC sales decline. SanDisk is a leading provider of flash-memory chips used in smartphones, tablets, hybrid disk drives and other devices.Western Digital says the combination with SanDisk will continue to transform it into a storage solutions company with extensive product and technology assets and deep expertise in chip-based storage.The deal currently consists of Western Digital paying $67.50 a share in cash plus 0.2387 shares of Western Digital stock, making it worth about $16 billion.The deal was valued at $86.50 a share, or about $19 billion, when it was first announced on Oct. 21. That changed when China’s Unisplendour pulled its plan to make a $3.8 billion investment for a 15% stake in Western Digital on Feb. 23, amid a U.S. government inquiry. By terminating the investment, Unisplendour triggered the alternative deal.According to Sundararajan, the deal is now worth $78.82 a share, based on the current price of Western Digital shares. Western Digital stock was flat, near 47, in afternoon trading in the stock market today. SanDisk stock was near 76, up a fraction.Western Digital anticipates seeing $500 million in total cost synergies, not including tax savings, from the acquisition. Institutional Shareholder Services, a leading independent proxy advisory firm, issued a report on Feb. 29 recommending that Western Digital shareholders approve the deal. ISS said the deal could attain $1.1 billion in cost synergies within 12 months of closing.China regulators, which have a say in the transaction based on Western Digital investments in China, have yet to issue a ruling. Sundararajan expects China to approve.

215,WDC,"Yahoo (YHOO) and Alibaba (BABA) both got new price targets Thursday, while Akamai Technlogies (AKAM) also saw new calls from analysts.Goldman Sachs raised its price target on Yahoo to 37 from 33. The action comes as activist investor Starboard seeks to gain control of Yahoo's board by nominating nine members.Yahoo's shares closed up 0.2% in the stock market today.Deutsche Bank  lowered its price target on Alibaba to 91 from 102. Alibaba announced earlier this week gross merchandise volume transacted on its e-commerce websites has surpassed 3 trillion yuan ($463 billion), up from 1 trillion yuan in 2012,.Alibaba's shares fell 0.9%.RBC Capital Markets initiated coverage on Akamai with a sector perform rating and a price target of 62.

216,WDC,"Regulators' decision to investigate Tsinghua Holdings' now-defunct $3.8 billion investment in Western Digital (WDC) could signal ""a heightened sense of scrutiny on all Chinese investments in U.S. technology,"" a Macquarie analyst wrote Tuesday.That's sure to frustrate Micron Technologies (MU) which, analysts say, could be examining a joint venture with a Chinese partner. Last year, Micron reportedly rebuffed a $23 billion bid from Tsinghua Holdings' chip-arm, Tsinghua Unigroup.MKM analyst Ian Ing says Micron could seek to become a ""local supplier"" for the Chinese memory market by entering a JV. A JV stands a better chance of getting approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.But the CFIUS is increasingly wary of Chinese investments in U.S. technology, Macquarie analyst Deepon Nag wrote in a research report. Tsinghua Unigroup plans to invest $47 billion to oust Apple (AAPL)-supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) from its No. 3 chipmaking slot.""We see increased risk that Chinese investment in U.S. semiconductor assets won't be allowed to take place, which we believe is an incremental negative for Micron,"" Nag wrote.Early Tuesday, Tsinghua Holdings subsidiary Unisplendour pulled its $3.8 billion funding in Western Digital after CFIUS regulators decided to investigate the investment. Nag sees little chance of IP theft in such a ""passive investment,"" but other analysts have suggested that Unisplendour was making a play for SanDisk's (SNDK) coveted Nand technology.Western Digital announced its plan to acquire SanDisk a month before Unisplendour was to invest the $3.8 billion for a 15% stake in Western Digital.""Tsinghua put $3.8 billion in Western Digital so they would have SanDisk technology,"" Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan told IBD in December. On Wednesday, Sundararajan said the Western Digital-SanDisk deal would proceed without Unisplendour.It's a marriage of ""necessity and convenience,"" he wrote in a report. Western Digital investor Alken Asset Management opposes the transaction, claiming the price is too high and SanDisk faces an uphill Nand battle, but the objection ""comes a bit late.""Toshiba and SanDisk have made rapid progress in 3D Nand, Sundararajan says. And SanDisk has ""gobs of Nand IP"" plus licensing sales to justify the price. Western Digital cut the price Tuesday after Unisplendour's exit to about $78.50 per share. Shareholders are set to vote on the transaction March 15. If it fails, Western Digital will have to pay a $184 million fee.""We find that net-net most of the objections expressed by Alken, while legitimate, ignore the strategic importance to Western Digital of having a captive Nand source as well as in-house Nand IP and a well-trained group of Nand experts,"" Sundararajan wrote.But Nag says the Unisplendour exit gives Western Digital the opportunity to reduce or completely drop the SanDisk deal. Out of 280 tech M&A deals in the past 30 years, nearly 10% were ultimately revised downward, he wrote.And considering Western Digital's slough in stock price -- down 43.5% since the deal was announced -- the acquisition will likely be dilutive, Nag wrote. On Tuesday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani estimated that the transaction would be 34% dilutive without the Unisplendour investment.""As a result, we believe that Western Digital will be highly motivated to renegotiate the price of SanDisk lower,"" Nag wrote.On the stock market today, SanDisk stock rebounded 4.9% to close at 69.90, after closing down 1.6% on Tuesday. Western Digital stock rose 2.7% vs. a 7.2% decline Tuesday.

220,WDC,"China's Tsinghua Holdings pulled its $3.8 billion investment in Western Digital (WDC) early Tuesday amid a U.S. government inquiry, prompting the disk drive maker to slash its already threatened bid for flash memory maker SanDisk (SNDK).The SanDisk acquisition, announced Oct. 21, will have to hurdle a Western Digital shareholder vote, which would not have been required with the investment by Tsinghua subsidiary Unisplendour.Western Digital stock sank 7.2% to 42.77 on the stock market today, while SanDisk stock lost 1.6% to 66.61.On Monday, Western Digital investor Alken Asset Management wrote an open letter claiming the $19 billion offer for SanDisk was ""simply too high."" SanDisk, an Apple (AAPL) supplier, faces competitive headwinds in 2016.Alken owns about 2% of Western Digital stock. The vote is slated for March 15. The Unisplendour investment would have given it a 15% stake in Western Digital.Unisplendour terminated its Western Digital investment after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. said it would investigate. Neither Western Digital nor Unisplendour will pay a termination fee.In December, Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan told IBD that Tsinghua Holdings was trying to get its hands on SanDisk technology. Chip-arm Tsinghua Unigroup plans to invest $47 billion in semiconductor technology to become the world's No. 3 chipmaker, leapfrogging Qualcomm (QCOM).It wouldn't be the first time a Tsinghua Holdings bid for U.S. technology was shuttered on regulatory concerns. A rumored $23 billion bid for Micron Technologies (MU) by Tsinghua Unigroup seemingly fell flat last year on worries that CFIUS would stop the deal. Micron shares fell 5.1% to 10.49.By terminating its Western Digital investment, Unisplendour triggered an alternative deal between Western Digital and SanDisk. Western Digital will now pay $67.50 per share in cash and 0.2387 in stock for SanDisk, for a value near $78.50 per share at Western Digital's Monday closing price. The original deal valued SanDisk at 86.50 a share.Despite the failed Unisplendour bid, the demand for data storage is rising, Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan said Tuesday in a statement. By acquiring SanDisk, Western Digital would get easy access to Nand (flash memory).""We believe the strategic rationale of this acquisition is even more compelling today than when we first announced it in October last year, given industry trends and strong execution by both companies,"" Milligan said in the statement.The SanDisk deal has been expected to close in Q2. Western Digital said it continues to see $500 million in synergies within 19 months of the closure and $1.1 billion by 2020. If the deal fails, Western Digital must pay SanDisk $184 million.RBC analyst Amit Daryanani sees the Western Digital-SanDisk deal being 34% dilutive without the Unisplendour investment. The ongoing shift to 3D Nand has pressured average sales prices for SanDisk's bread-and-butter Nand business, he wrote in a research report.""While we think the long-term rationale of owning HDD (hard disk drive) and Nand under one umbrella is logical, the near-term implications of this could be negative,"" he wrote.Needham analyst Richard Kugele notes the $17 billion debt that Western Digital will incur if it acquires SanDisk. But a partnership with Toshiba via SanDisk could buoy Western Digital. Toshiba manufactures SanDisk's Nand.""Nothing will change the aggressive nature of the Nand industry, but partially owning a fab through the Toshiba partnership should help Western Digital over time navigate those waters,"" Kugele wrote in a research report.Daryanani rates Western Digital stock outperform and has a 68 price target. Kugele rates Western Digital stock a strong buy and has a 90 price target.

221,WDC,"Stocks dug deeper into moderate losses early Tuesday after some disappointing February consumer sentiment data.The Nasdaq swayed 0.9% lower, feeling drag from Western Digital (WDC), which dropped 6% after its $19 billion merger deal with Sandisk (SNDK) took a sudden turn, with a China-based investor withdrawing support for the plan. The S&P 500 dropped 0.8%, and the Dow industrials showed a 0.7% decline.Trading volume on today's stock market opened on mixed footing: up 3% on the NYSE but 4% lower on the Nasdaq.In oil futures, West Texas Intermediate surged out of early losses to a 7% gain, then eased to trade up 4%, near $33 a barrel. Saudi Arabia Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi speaks to U.S. oil executives in Houston this morning.Consumers' outlook dropped sharply in February, sending the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index to 92.2, vs. a downwardly revised 97.8 in January. The tally was far below economists' consensus forecast for 97.8 and was the gauge's weakest reading in at least six months.Existing-home sales edged up to an annualized pace of 5.47 million in January, the National Association of Realtors reported. That was above December's 5.45 million pace, and above estimates of 5.32 million.Home Depot (HD) came off its opening high but still comfortably led the Dow with a gain of nearly 3% following a positive Q4 report that included strong revenue guidance.

The stock is leaning back toward its 50-day moving average after clearing that level in strong trade Friday.
"
222,WDC,"Western Digital (WDC) stock fell hard Friday, though the company late Thursday beat estimates with its latest earnings as well as its outlook.The No. 1 maker of disk drives reported revenue of $3.5 billion, topping the consensus of $3.4 billion. That's up 10% from the year-earlier quarter, after six straight quarters of declines, but it includes partial results from its acquisition of flash-chip storage company SanDisk. That $16 billion acquisition closed on May 12.Western Digital reported earnings per share minus items of 79 cents, down 48% but topping the consensus of 71 cents, for its fiscal fourth quarter ended July 1.""Fiscal 2016 was a transformative year for our company,"" Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan said in the earnings conference call. ""We took significant steps to continue our evolution into the leading storage solutions company and to return to growth with global scale and extensive product and technology assets.""Western Digital expects revenue this quarter of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion, outpacing consensus expectations at $4.34 billion.On July 7, Western Digital raised guidance to include its recent acquisition of SanDisk. With SanDisk, Western Digital becomes a major competitor in both hard disk drives and flash chip storage. SanDisk is among the largest flash chip storage providers, a market led by Samsung Electronics.Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman, in a research note, said he sees just ""a modestly improving demand backdrop"" for Western Digital, but of the Q4 report he said, ""we see more to like here than not.""Ackerman, in fact, hiked his price target on Western Digital stock to 55 from 50, while maintaining an outperform rating.Western Digital stock, however, closed down 11.5% at 47.51 in the stock market today, falling just below its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Western Digital stock has been in decline since hitting an all-time high of 114.69 in December. The stock has a weak IBD Composite Rating of 25, meaning it's underperforming 74% of all stocks. You can look for winning stocks at IBD Stock Checkup.Declining PC shipments have hurt makers of disk drives, key components in those products. Western Digital said it has reduced its overall facilities footprint by almost 20% and its headcount by almost 25% over the past two years.Western Digital's main disk drive rival, Seagate (STX), last month enjoyed its best stock gain in more than four years after it hiked earnings guidance and announced a big cut to its workforce. Seagate is scheduled to report its fiscal Q4 earnings before the market open Tuesday.

224,WDC,"An ownership agreement filed Friday by Micron Technology (MU) opens the door for China or No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) to either invest in or buy America's biggest DRAM chipmaker, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer said Monday.The rights agreement prevents an ""ownership change"" if a shareholder gains a 5% or more stake in Micron, thereby preserving Micron's ability to use $4 billion in net operating losses, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.Micron stock rocketed to a six-month high on the stock market today, and closed up 6% at 13.92. Shares are down less than 2% so far this year., as IBD's 39-company Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group has risen 5%.IBD'S TAKE: SoftBank beat Intel to the punch on Apple supplier ARM Holdings, an analyst said last week. Intel has an IBD Composite Rating of 75, meaning it performs in the top 25% of all stocks in terms of key metrics. But Micron trails with a low CR of 29.Pitzer reiterated an outperform rating and 20 price target on Micron stock.""The rights agreement both helps to facilitate a strategic investment but also acts as a quasi-poison pill given (that it allows) board discretion,"" he said. ""The new agreement increases that possibility of strategic investment or acquisition in the near term.""Recent media reports have suggested Micron is in talks to establish a joint venture with China for flash-memory manufacturing and Intel has slowed its Dalian, China, expansion, meaning Micron could be a nice fit for both, Pitzer wrote in a research report.A strategic investment would likely value Micron at $17 to $22 per share. But any such investment by China would likely be capped at 10% and be subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.China's interest in U.S. semiconductor technology is well-known. Micron reportedly rebuffed a $23 billion unsolicited bid from Chinese Tsinghua Unigroup this year. Tsinghua later tried to invest $3.8 billion at a 15% stake in Western Digital (WDC), a deal hitched on CFIUS review.Micron could also make sense for Intel, which is already a partner on 3D X-Point technology.""It could be cheaper for Intel to buy Nand (flash) capacity from Micron than to invest in expanding new capacity at Dalian,"" Pitzer wrote.
"
225,WDC,"Western Digital (WDC) investor Alken Asset Management is pushing the disk drive maker to send Apple (AAPL) supplier SanDisk (SNDK) back to the sales block, and Western Digital and SanDisk shares split the difference today on Wall Street.Western Digital stock bounded 4.5% on the stock market today, while SanDisk stock slumped 1.7%. The companies' shares have plunged 34% and 10%, respectively, since the $19 billion deal was announced Oct. 21.At the time, the transaction was at a 70% premium to SanDisk's stock price, Alken analyst Vincent Rech wrote in an open letter to Western Digital shareholders.""The price being paid for SanDisk is excessive in light of the changing landscape for SanDisk's products and capital markets considerations,"" he wrote, noting that Western Digital would be forced to take on $14 billion in debt to fulfill the deal.""SanDisk, specifically, has suffered significant business challenges recently, causing us to worry as well about paying top dollar for a melting franchise,"" he added.Since the deal was announced, competition in the Nand (flash memory) field has expanded, squeezing demand, he wrote. Now, a key element of SanDisk's sales is under attack.Hours before Western Digital and SanDisk announced their merger, Intel (INTC) unveiled its $5.5 billion plan to convert its Dalian, China, facility to ramp non-volatile memory. Intel and Micron Technologies (MU) jointly developed 3D Nand and 3D XPoint in 2015.And Tsinghua Unigroup's entrance into the chip industry will only stoke more competitive fires, Rech wrote. The Chinese conglomerate plans to invest $47 billion to become the world's No. 3 chipmaker. To that end, Tsinghua invested $3.8 billion in Western Digital in the month following the SanDisk acquisition plan.Further, SanDisk is dependent on Toshiba for Nand manufacturing. Earlier this month, Toshiba reported its biggest annual loss. And earnings forecasts for SanDisk -- as well as its Nand-rivals Micron, Toshiba, Samsung and SK Hynix -- have dropped 30% since the deal was announced.""The market now expects the Nand market to be more competitive -- and profit more elusive -- than the time the transaction was originally negotiated,"" he wrote.In 2015, SanDisk reported $616 million in operating income -- the lowest level since 2009 -- and well below the $1.5 billion in four of five years that ended Dec. 31, 2014, Rech wrote. Last year, SanDisk suffered from major revenue losses from top customer Apple.Acquiring SanDisk gives Western Digital quick access to the Nand chips needed for its solid-state-drive business, Rech wrote. But that only comprised 7% of Western Digital's total sales in 2015.Alken plans to vote on March 15 against the merger. Should the deal fail, Western Digital would be required to pay SanDisk $185 million.
"
226,WDC,"Micron Technologies (MU) rebuffed Tsinghua Unigroup's $23 billion bid, but that doesn't mean the memory chipmaker has scrapped plans for Chinese partnership, MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote Tuesday in a research report.That partnership could come in the form of a joint venture, Ing wrote in a research report after Micron's analyst day on Friday. Ing reiterated a buy rating and 19 price target on Micron stock, which was up 7.3% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 10.80.""We think Micron would require control of both IP and production decisions in the structure of any JV,"" he wrote. ""The biggest benefit to Micron is the ability to produce output as a 'local supplier' and national champion for China's domestic market.""China plans to invest $55 billion in local chipmaking businesses by 2020 in an effort to curb reliance on foreign semiconductors. But state-sponsored Tsinghua Unigroup's bid for Micron was doomed from the start, analysts say, as U.S. regulators would have shut it down.A joint venture, however, wouldn't necessarily spike regulators' concerns. Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer said he ""would not be surprised by an equity investment in Micron from one of the Chinese private equity companies.""After its failed Micron bid last year, Tsinghua Unigroup invested $3.8 billion in Western Digital (WDC), days before Western Digital announced its plan to acquire flash memory chip maker SanDisk (SNDK).""(Micron) has a presence in all major memory markets, which makes it particularly interesting from M&A or an equity investment target for China Inc.,"" Pitzer wrote in a report. ""While (the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) could be an issue for outright sale, the company could still attract equity investment in China.""Pitzer reiterated his outperform rating and 20 price target on Micron stock. Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan rates Micron stock a buy, with a 21 price target.""The backdrop of any buy thesis on Micron over the medium term should be that Samsung is not doing well,"" Sundararajan wrote in a research report.Apple (AAPL) and Chinese LCD manufacturers are scooping share, and Samsung has yet to squeeze much profit out of its nascent 3D Nand flash chips, he wrote. DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) profitability could be Samsung's ""salvation,"" but its capital expenditures cut has yet to bear fruit. DRAMs are the most common memory chips in computers.Meanwhile, Micron is slimming costs, Sundararajan wrote. In 20-nanometer DRAM, Micron is targeting a cost reduction CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 15%-25% through fiscal 2017, Pitzer wrote. Micron also sees 25% cost reduction CAGR in 3D Nand.""Any progress in closing the cost 'gap' will drive stock performance,"" Pitzer wrote. A rebound could pull Micron stock out of its trough, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote in a report as he upgraded Micron stock to buy from neutral.Sundararajan also expects Micron to let Intel (INTC) work out the kinks in the jointly-owned 3D X-Point chip and then ""exploit it advantageously"" from 2018.""Good times will come should Micron execute,"" he wrote. ""Micron has dashed hopes and portfolios in 2015, hence it is important to ignore those getting out of Micron stock and take a fresh look.""Even with Tuesday's gain, Micron stock is roughly 70% off a nearly 16-year high touched in January 2015.

242,WDC,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) will breeze through the PC doldrums thanks to Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7, but rival Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) three quarters of better-than-expected sales will likely ""crack,"" forcing shares to tumble from four-year highs, analysts said Friday.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Intel shares ended the day up 2.4% to 34, while Advanced Micro Devices stock was up 1.6%, to 5.10. The companies are set to report Q2 earnings on July 20 and July 21, respectively.Intel stock broke out a flat base at a 32.79 buy point on June 23, so it remains within buy range.RBC analyst Amit Daryanani upped his price target on Intel stock to 34 from 33, noting that slightly stronger PC demand and tailwind from Apple's iPhone 7 ramp should provide upside to Intel's fiscal Q2 client computing group (CCG) sales.Intel reportedly will supply a third of Apple's iPhone 7 modems, partially replacing incumbent Qualcomm (QCOM). That could add $300 million to $500 million in incremental sales in the second half of 2016, Daryanani wrote.That will partially offset an expected 7% decline in PC sales in 2016. Intel is the longtime leader in sales of computer microprocessors. It's had a hard time cracking the mobile market, however, so the iPhone 7 win could be big for the company.Daryanani models $30.2 billion in 2016 CCG sales, declining 6.3% but topping a 7.6% fall in 2015. He said Intel's view for accelerating data center sales is likely ""aggressive.""Still, there's near-term strength in PCs. On Thursday, Western Digital (WDC) upped its fiscal Q4 guidance following its acquisition of SanDisk.Notebook shipments climbed 28% month over month to 9.2 million units in May, according to device makers, Daryanani wrote.Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon is less bullish on Intel stock, but boosted his price target to 33 from 26 and upgraded shares to market perform from underperform. He downgraded AMD stock to underperform from market perform and kept his 3 price target.Like Daryanani, Rasgon sees Apple-centric sales boosting Intel's near-term revenue. For Q2, he models $13.6 billion in total sales vs. Wall Street consensus views for $13.5 billion. His Q3 model for $14.6 billion in total sales is largely in line with broader expectations.AMD, on the other hand, is ""more controversial,"" he wrote in a research report. After AMD's Q1 upside surprise, shares rocketed on hopes that share gains vs. Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA) can hold, that new products might sustain upside and that IP deals may follow.Those hopes are unfounded, Rasgon says. AMD's Q1 upside was likely on channel fill and its semi-custom win was on a console. Also, AMD's Zen product likely won't ramp materially in servers for a year, he says.He wrote that ""we suspect downside over the next few quarters is likely, and when it cracks it tends to do it rapidly.""

Micron stock is down 60% for the year.For its fiscal Q1 ended early this month, Micron is expected to report 23 cents earnings per share ex items on $3.46 billion in sales, down 75% and 24%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Three months ago, Micron guided to $3.35 billion to $3.6 billion in sales and 20-26 cents EPS minus items.Micron stock fell 2.7% on Monday, after the chipmaker announced the $3.2 billion deal to acquire Taiwan chipmaker Inotera Memories. But Micron rose 2% for the week, including rising a fraction on Friday.And at least six analysts reiterated buy ratings on Micron stock this week following the Inotera announcement.Per the agreement, Micron will pay 30 New Taiwan dollars, or 92 cents, per Inotera share. Micron already owns 33% of Inotera and the two companies have been memory chip partners for seven years.The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Micron's EPS, free cash flow, gross margins and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). The companies have 60 days to terminate the agreement.M&As Breach $100 Bil MarkMicron's $3.2 billion Inotera acquisition is just a drop in the $100 billion-plus chip industry M&A bucket for 2015. Big deals included Apple (AAPL) supplier Avago's (AVGO) $37 billion offer for Broadcom and the $19 billion marriage between SanDisk (SNDK) and Western Digital (WDC).Analysts expect the M&A fever to continue into 2016 as the semiconductor industry faces slowing organic growth, rising costs and a limp global economy. Complicating the matter: China wants in on the action and Tsinghua Unigroup has pledged $47 billion to leapfrog Qualcomm (QCOM) to become the No. 3 chipmaker.The Tsinghua push is part of a larger effort by the Chinese government to ease reliance on foreign chips, in part to reduce cybersnooping concerns. Groups in Shanghai and Beijing are making similar efforts, pulling from a $100 billion, government-sponsored pool.This year, Tsinghua Unigroup reportedly made an unsolicited $23 billion bid for Micron. U.S. regulations likely would have stopped the theoretical merger and the offer seems to have fallen off the map.As M&A activity hits new fever pitches in 2016, analysts see smaller chip companies Xilinx (XLNX), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Cavium (CAVM) as possible takeover candidates.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

246,WDC,"Needham on Wednesday reiterated a strong buy rating on disk drive leader Western Digital (WDC), after Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan acquired company stock valued at $1 million.An SEC filing late Tuesday said Milligan purchased 22,500 shares at a price of $45.53. Insider buying is generally seen as a positive sign.“We believe investors should view this step as a strong vote of confidence in the new trajectory of the company, post the SanDisk acquisition,” wrote Needham analyst Richard Kugele in a research note. “In our view, the purchase also signals that management views the stock to be trading at a depressed valuation.”Western Digital completed its $16 billion acquisition of chip-storage provider SanDisk on May 12.Western Digital stock closed up 2.3% at 47.63 in the stock market today. Shares, though, are down more than 40% since the acquisition agreement was announced in October. Shares hit a four-year low of 34.99 on May 16 but are up 37% since then. Needham's Kugele has a price target of 67 on Western Digital stock.On Friday, Western Digital gave what analysts called a thorough earnings guidance update that appeared to quell concerns about volatility, with the company's light earnings outlook blamed on interest expense on debt. The guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter ending July 1 -- the first to include SanDisk -- beat on the top line but fell well short on the bottom line.With SanDisk, Western Digital becomes a major competitor in both disk drives and flash-chip storage. Western Digital is the largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX). SanDisk is among the largest flash-chip storage providers, a market led by Samsung.

247,WDC,"Disk drive leader Western Digital (WDC) gave what analysts called a thorough earnings guidance update late Thursday that appeared to quell concerns about volatility, with its light earnings outlook explained as an interest expense on debt.The new guidance for the first time included SanDisk, which Western digital acquired for $16 billion as of May 12. The guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter ending July 1 beat on the top line but fell well short on the bottom line.With SanDisk, Western Digital becomes a major competitor in both disk drives and flash-chip storage. Western Digital is the largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX). SanDisk is among a top-tier group of flash-chip storage providers, a market led by Samsung.Western Digital stock finished Friday trading up 1.4% to 44.99 in the stock market today. Shares, though, are down about 45% since the acquisition agreement was announced in October. Shares hit a four-year low of 34.99 on May 16 but are up more than 30% since then.Seagate stock was up 0.5% to 21.66 at the close. The stock is down 21% since the company reported its fiscal Q3 earnings on April 29.Western Digital guided revenue in the range of $3.35-$3.45 billion, slightly above consensus expectations at $3.35 billion. It expects SanDisk to contribute about $750 million for the seven weeks of sales in fiscal Q4. It expects EPS to come in at 65 cents to 70 cents, significantly below the consensus estimate of 90 cents, but the company said that is due to interest costs for its newly issued debt used to finance the SanDisk acquisition.Western Digital held on to previous views for its hard-disk drive business, with revenue of $2.6 billion to 2.7 billion, down about 6% from the prior quarter. Western Digital and Seagate have struggled through the decline in disk drive sales, due largely by the drop in PC sales.“We believe the acquisition of SanDisk is good because Western Digital as a stand-alone disk-drive company is unable to reverse the current earnings headwinds in a declining market,” wrote Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kinngai Chan in a research note.The combination of Western Digital and SanDisk offers a good risk-reward for investors, Chan wrote, as it's better positioned to address the changing industry landscape for storage. That will allow Western Digital to better plan for its shrinking disk drive business, prioritize research and development, and optimize the product roadmap and manufacturing mix, he says.“However, we continue to remain negative on Seagate for the near to medium term as it does not have a good strategy in addressing the declining disk drive market,” Chan wrote.Needham analyst Richard Kugele maintained a strong buy rating on Western Digital stock, but he lowered his price target to 67 from 69.“We believe today begins the resetting of expectations based on the combined company, and should set a base from which to execute and outperform,” Kugele wrote in a research note.RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani, in a research note, said Q4 guidance was a step in the right direction and conservative enough to drive upside. He maintained an outperform rating and a price target of 56.While Western Digital didn’t provide any long-term targets for the combined entity, it did take away investor fears of a sharp drop in EPS, Daryanani wrote.“There are still plenty of moving parts that will create a wide dispersion of estimates,” he said.

"
253,WDC,"Flipping The Paradigm
"
254,WDC,"China plans to flip a longstanding paradigm. The country consumes roughly half the world's $350 billion in chips, but only accounts for 2.5% of the sector's revenue, according to Nanochip Fab Solutions . Chips, in fact, are China's biggest import, says Nanochip.
"
255,WDC,"In June 2014, the government pledged to curb China's reliance on foreign semiconductors.
"
256,WDC,"By 2020, China aims to generate 350 billion yuan ($55 billion) in domestic chip revenue, seeking a compound annual growth rate of 20%. No more than 10 years later, the country wants a top-tier semiconductor company. Thus, the National Semiconductor Industry Investment Fund was born.
"
257,WDC,"Tsinghua is one of 16 shareholders of the fund — a $100 billion pot of which 60% will be directed toward manufacturing acquisitions, according to Semi.org. Groups in Shanghai and Beijing, too, have planned hefty chip investments.
"
258,WDC,"But Tsinghua has been particularly vocal about its goal. Last month, Chairman Zhao Weiguo told Reuters the group will invest $47 billion over five years to become the world's No. 3 chipmaker, behind No. 1 Intel (INTC) and Samsung.
"
259,WDC,"""If you can't be the top-three giant, it will be very hard to develop your business in the chip industry,"" he told Reuters. ""The next five years is key. ... there is an enormous market there.""
"
260,WDC,"Intel and Samsung Electronics have market valued near $164 billion and $160 billion, respectively. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) follows in value at $118 billion, but it's a manufacturer that doesn't design its own chips, so it's in a little bit of a different market, with thinner profit margins. Qualcomm is No. 4 in chip company market value, near $73 billion.
"
261,WDC,"""Qualcomm is most at risk because they are already seeing their dominant position in cellphones being challenged, with Samsung and Apple and in the Chinese smartphone market,"" Lidow said. ""They are most vulnerable, for sure.""
"
262,WDC,"Tangling With U.S. Government
"
263,WDC,"Tsinghua already has invested billions in chip acquisitions, buying China chipmakers Spreadtrum Communications for $1.8 billion and RDA Microelectronics for $900 million in 2013 and 2014. But getting its hands on a U.S. company is much more difficult, since the U.S. aims to protect its chip industry trade secrets and intellectual property.
"
264,WDC,"In August, Tsinghua made an unsolicited $23 billion bid for Boise, Idaho-based Micron, showing its serious interest in flash memory technology. Wall Street scoffed, saying the U.S. Department of Defense would block that transaction. And the informal bid seemingly has gone nowhere.
"
265,WDC,"""That's one of the reasons Chinese fabs aren't up to par with U.S. fabs, because they're somewhat restricted as to the technology they have access to,"" Semiconductor Advisors analyst Robert Maire told IBD.

"
267,WDC,"But it's possible Tsinghua found a loophole.
"
268,WDC,"Last month, Tsinghua invested $3.8 billion in Irvine, Calif.-based Western Digital (WDC), a month after Western Digital agreed to buy Milpitas, Calif.-based flash chip maker SanDisk (SNDK) for $19 billion.
"
269,WDC,"By investing in Western Digital, Tsinghua got itself that much closer to U.S. chip patents, Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan told IBD.
"
270,WDC,"""Tsinghua put in $3.8 billion into Western Digital so they would have SanDisk technology,"" he said.
"
271,WDC,"China could also make a play for Milpitas, Calif.-based GlobalFoundries, the manufacturing spinoff of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) with fabs in Singapore, Germany and the U.S. Oil-rich Abu Dhabi owns the company and might be looking for a buyer.
"
272,WDC,"To compete with the mature U.S. semiconductor market, Tsinghua ""needs to bulk up,"" Maire said. Fabs such as GlobalFoundries and Taiwan Semiconductor carry significant heft.
"
273,WDC,"""With Micron, U.S. legislators would never let that go through,"" he said. ""But (Tsinghua) could get around (U.S. regulations) and get around the technological hurdles by cutting a deal with GlobalFoundries.

"
282,WDC,"""It will be an interesting test as this is the first Chinese acquisition of a U.S. semiconductor company,"" Maire wrote. But ""this is not a very bold start, buying the worst equipment company as compared to the very bold bid by the Chinese to buy Micron.""

Shares closed down 1.5% in regular-session trading ahead of the No. 1 chip gear-maker's scheduled quarterly earnings report.For its fiscal Q4 ended Oct. 25, Applied Materials reported 29 cents earnings per share ex items on $2.37 billion in sales, both measures up 7% vs. the year-earlier quarter.Sales topped the consensus of 21 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, which saw $2.4 billion. Applied Materials' 29-cent EPS met the consensus and was the company's second-highest earning quarter behind Q3.Three months ago, Applied Materials guided to a 7%-to-flat decline in sales vs. Q3 sales of $2.5 billion. The company also saw 27-31 cents EPS minus items.Fiscal 2015 sales of $9.7 billion, up 6% year over year, and $1.19 EPS ex items, up 11% vs. the year-ago quarter, also narrowly beat the consensus — which saw $9.6 billion and $1.18.For the current quarter, Applied Materials sees revenue falling 2-9% sequentially and 23-27 cents EPS. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported 23 cents EPS on $2.2 billion in sales.Applied Materials is in IBD's 36-member Electronic-Semiconductor Equipment industry group. The company has a middling Composite Rating of 49 out of a best-possible 99. Lam Research (LRCX) tops the group with a CR of 91.Lam might also swipe Applied Materials' No. 1 slot in the chip gear-making sector with the recently announced acquisition of KLA-Tencor (KLAC) (CR of 85), Semiconductor Advisors analyst Robert Maire theorized in a recent research report.Or, Applied Materials could make a play for KLA by topping Lam's $10.6 billion bid.""We have to admit that our first reaction to the announcement of the Applied Materials/Tokyo Electron deal was shock that Applied Materials didn't make a play for KLA first,"" Maire wrote.The Tokyo Electron deal floundered for nearly two years before it died in the water.Lam and KLA announced their merger as Western Digital (WDC) confirmed rumors by making a $19 billion play for SanDisk (SNDK), beating out potential interest from Micron Technology (MU) and Seagate Technology (STX) amid mass chip sector consolidation.KLA's process control operations are superior to Applied Materials' operations, Maire wrote.""It's more synergistic and, perhaps more importantly, blocks Lam or ASML Holding (ASML) from getting their hands on this crown jewel in the industry,"" he wrote.

316,WDC,"Following up on its $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk, Western Digital (WDC) issued new quarterly guidance after the market close Thursday that beat on the top line but fell well short on the bottom line.Western Digital announced the completion of its SanDisk acquisition two weeks ago, creating a big competitor in both disk drives and flash-chip storage.Reflecting the ownership of SanDisk as of May 12, Western Digital now expects revenue of $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion for its fiscal Q4 ended July 1, compared with its earlier forecast of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. The midpoint is above the consensus estimate among analysts of $3.35 billion, as polled by Thomson Reuters. Western Digital reported revenue of $3.19 billion in the year-earlier quarter. That would be up 6.6% at the midpoint, where Western Digital revenue has declined the past six quarters year over year.It expects earnings per share minus items of 65 cents to 70 cents, compared with its earlier guidance of $1 to $1.10 a share. Analysts, though, had modeled EPS ex items of 90 cents.Western Digital stock was down more than 1% in after-hours trading, after rising a fraction in Thursday's regular session, to 44.38. Through Thursday's close, shares are down 45% since the acquisition agreement was announced in October. Shares hit a four-year low of 34.99 on May 16 but are up about 25% since then.Western Digital is the largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX).Seagate stock closed at 21.55, up a fraction. The stock is down 21% since the company reported its fiscal Q3 earnings on April 29.Western Digital and SanDisk had combined revenue of about $20 billion in 2015.SanDisk is a leading provider of chips used for data storage in a wide variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets and PCs. The deal will help SanDisk, which has a strong retail business, move up the ladder to make bigger sales to businesses and other enterprise customers -- the market where Western Digital is strongest. Western Digital gets the ability to offer chip-based storage in areas where its disk-drive technology is losing ground.

317,WDC,"Western Digital (WDC) will provide revenue and earnings guidance for the first time since completing its $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk.Western Digital announced the completion of its SanDisk acquisition on Thursday, creating a formidable competitor in both disk drives and flash-chip storage.The company says it will update its guidance on May 26, after the market close, for its fiscal fourth quarter ending July 1. The guidance will reflect the partial period of ownership of SanDisk in Q4.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani, in a research note, said he expects Western Digital to imply Q4 revenue guidance of $3.4 billion. That’s above the consensus estimate of $3.34 billion from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.The Wall Street consensus on earnings per share minus items is 86 cents. Daryanani expects 93 cents. He has an outperform rating on Western Digital stock and a price target of 56.Western Digital was trading near 39, up 5%, in afternoon trading in the stock market today. But shares are down more than 20% since the company's posted fiscal Q3 earnings on April 28.Western Digital and SanDisk had combined revenue of about $20 billion in 2015.

318,WDC,"Western Digital (WDC) on Tuesday received a price-target hike to 50 from 45 and an upgrade to outperform from market perform by Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman.The moves comes two days before Western Digital is slated to give new guidance that will include its $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk. Western Digital announced the completion of its SanDisk acquisition last week, creating a big competitor in both disk drives and flash-chip storage. The company has said it would update its guidance after the market close Thursday for its fiscal fourth quarter ending July 1.Ackerman says while he expects the SanDisk acquisition to dilute earnings through 2017, “We think the stock should start to work higher from here, as Western Digital’s updated guidance should act as a positive catalyst and help eliminate uncertainty.""Western Digital stock finished trading up 4.5% to 42.28 in the stock market today. However, the stock is down 47% since the acquisition was announced in October. Shares hit a four-year low of 34.99 on May 16 but are up 20% since then.Western Digital and SanDisk had combined revenue of about $20 billion in 2015, with $14.5 billion from Western Digital. It’s the largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX).SanDisk is a leading provider of chips used for data storage in a wide variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets and PCs. The deal will help SanDisk, which has a strong retail business, move up the ladder to make bigger sales to businesses and other enterprise customers -- the market where Western Digital is strongest. Western Digital gets the ability to offer chip-based storage in areas where its disk drive technology is losing ground.Western Digital's year-over-year revenue has fallen for six straight quarters. That’s largely due to lower disk drive sales in the slumping PC market and the migration of disk storage to chip-based storage in many products. Seagate's revenue has fallen for five straight quarters.“Now that SanDisk is subsumed into Western Digital’s operations, Western Digital now morphs from an enterprise highly exposed to the cannibalization of next-generation storage into a media agnostic, vertically integrated data storage provider capable of generating mid-single-digit revenue growth and low-double-digit EPS growth,” Ackerman wrote.He said the top 10 customers shared between Western Digital and SanDisk include Best Buy (BBY), Apple (AAPL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and HP Inc. (HPQ)“With SanDisk, Western Digital can now more effectively service both enterprise and hyper-scale customers and capitalize on the explosion of data creation that should double every two to three years by 2020,"" Ackerman wrote.

RBC Capital's figures, though, include spending on retail stores as well, since Apple does not separate the two areas.Apple, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) account for 75% of spending in RBC's cloud capital spending survey. Facebook (FB), eBay (EBAY) and China's Alibaba, Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent account for an additional 15% of the spending, says RBC analyst Amit Daryanani in the report.He says cloud capital spending by six Chinese companies tracked in the survey rose 71% in the September quarter to $1.1. billion. Alibaba and other Chinese e-commerce firms reported record numbers for their Singles Day shopping event on 11/11.Based on consensus estimates, cloud capital spending overall in 2015 will rise just 6.7% to $43.8 billion, says Daryanani, slowing from 2014's 29% growth rate. Based on current estimates, Wall Street is modeling for a rebound in 2016 to 13% growth, says the RBC analyst.He notes, however, that U.S. Internet companies have not provided 2016 guidance.The RBC Capital analyst follows companies that sell products for cloud infrastructure, including Intel (INTC), Avago (AVGO) and Western Digital (WDC).

Ing retired his 71 price target and buy rating on Qorvo stock.""With the iPhone 'elephant in the room,' we felt investor concerns regarding a smartphone unit slowdown remained only partially addressed and not in Qorvo's control,"" Ing wrote.Slower growth rates are still likely out of China, he added.But Qorvo's overall outlook was positive, Ing wrote. The company revised its long-term target model to 32%-35% vs. an earlier 30% target and outlined plans to recapture Samsung and MediaTek smartphone share in China.A recent $1 billion debt issuance could signal that Qorvo's Industrial and Defense Products segment is becoming acquisitive, Ing wrote. Strategic M&A could help Qorvo's IDP business grow at twice the industry's 7% growth rate.Qorvo would merely be the latest in a series of recently acquisitive chip companies. Last month, Lam Research (LRCX) agreed to acquire KLA-Tencor (KLAC), a combination that might overtake Applied Materials' (AMAT) market share, and Western Digital (WDC) made a bid for SanDisk (SNDK).Earlier this year, Intel (INTC) agreed to buy Altera (ALTR), and Avago Technologies (AVGO) announced its plan to acquire Broadcom (BRCM).Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

Western Digital did say that it would provide guidance in the ""near term.""Twigg said Western Digital should remain well positioned in its core hard disk drive business, though disk drive revenue will decline over the next five years as non-volatile memory and software-optimized storage products gain.“Western Digital's acquisition of SanDisk should help position it for these shifts,” Twigg wrote.Western Digital and SanDisk had combined revenue of about $20 billion in 2015. Western Digital is the largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX).""This transformational combination creates a media-agnostic leader in storage technology with a robust portfolio of products and solutions that will address a wide range of applications in almost all of the world’s computing and mobile devices,” Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan said in Friday's press release announcing the acquisition had closed.Sanjay Mehrotra, co-founder and CEO of SanDisk, will serve as a member of the Western Digital board of directors.Western Digital stock was down 2.5%, near 35, in late-afternoon trading in the stock market today, at a more than three-year low.

He rates Broadcom stock his top semiconductor pick, with a 180 price target.Over the next two years, Broadcom stock could reach 200, Daryanani says.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Broadcom stock was up nearly 1% to 148.10.

Daryanani expects Broadcom to miss consensus expectations for $3.55 billion in sales on petering Apple iPhone sales, despite stronger-than-expected Samsung Galaxy S7 sales.Apple comprises 15% of Broadcom's sales, Daryanani estimates, with Samsung in the high single digits. Apple's June-quarter guidance implies 40 million iPhones shipped vs. consensus views for 44 million. Near term, Apple will pose a headwind until the iPhone 7, expected to be released in September, ramps up.""To that end, Broadcom's FBAR (film bulk acoustic resonator) business could see double-digit year-over-year growth driven by content gains,"" Daryanani wrote. Wi-Fi combo chips could also see modest average sales prices tailwinds.Earlier, Broadcom saw wireless account for 23% of sales. Daryanani expects that segment to grow 37% quarter over quarter as the company's recent merger is factored. The former Avago Technologies bought Broadcom for $37 million in February, but kept the Broadcom name.Storage sales will likely become ""incrementally worse,"" Daryanani wrote. Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technologies' (STX) recent earnings suggest a $100 million hard-disk drive total addressable market in March and a $95 million TAM in June, down 20% and 15% vs. last year.Enterprise storage is expected to account for 17% of Broadcom's Q2 sales. Daryanani sees the segment declining 14% vs. Q1, vs. 6% sequential growth in the prior quarter.

339,WDC,"Chinese, Japanese and South Korean regulators could gum up Lam Research's (LRCX) attempt to buy KLA-Tencor (KLAC) by following in the footsteps of the U.S. Department of Justice, which is asking for more information on the proposed merger, an analyst said Monday.Late Friday, the companies said the DOJ had sent a ""second request,"" digging deeper into Lam Research's $10.6 billion plan to acquire KLA-Tencor. Only 2%-4% of merger proposals get a second request, Semiconductor Advisors president Robert Maire says. Of those, he says about a third go through as planned but the other two-thirds either get challenged by the DOJ or get a consent decree, which is approval with conditions.In the Lam-KLA deal, the likely concerns revolve around antitrust. Together, the companies would be close to matching the market cap of Applied Materials (AMAT), which is No. 2 among makers of chip manufacturing equipment, behind ASML (ASML).Also, together they could pressure etch pricing for major players like Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), the latter an Apple (AAPL) supplier. Tokyo Electron and Hitachi (HTHIY), which compete against Lam in etch, might oppose having KLA continuing to inspect their tools and processes.""While not good news, a second request is certainly not a death sentence for the merger, but at the very least (it) means more time and money and scrutiny to get approval,"" Maire wrote in a research note. The 30-day clock for DOJ approval has now been reset.In midday trading on the stock market today, Lam Research and KLA-Tencor stocks were down nearly 2% and 1.4%, respectively, both near three-month lows. IBD's 34-company Electronic Semiconductor-Equipment industry group was down a small fraction midday Monday.Maire says the DOJ could ""ask for the kitchen sink of information.""""The (second request) is not just a simple test of overlapping product lines,"" he wrote. ""It looks at things like market concentration and anti-competitive issues. (Lam-KLA) would certainly have a large concentration of the overall market.""The chip industry is most concerned about KLA's standing as an ""impartial arbiter"" of others' tools, he says.""Will Lam dep and etch tools get an unfair advantage? An early look at results? A more complete look?"" Maire asked. ""(It's) kind of a lot like insider trading.""Lam and KLA already have the go-ahead from Germany, Ireland, Israel and Taiwan, but they still needs a slew of other foreign approvals. This DOJ action can ""snowball into a problem"" if it becomes too costly, Maire says. Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron called off their merger in the face of strong regulator scrutiny.The request further delays the merger's close, Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok noted in a research report, saying he expects the deal to close in Q4, as opposed to the companies' target for Q3. Western Digital (WDC) closed its $19 billion SanDisk acquisition last week, a merger that was announced within hours of the Lam-KLA match-up.Neither Mok nor Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri worry about the Lam-KLA deal getting approval, however. In his report, Arcuri called the second request ""more procedural in nature.""""There is no overlap here, and certain big customers have been pushing these companies together for several years, especially around the issue of yield ramp in 3D,"" he wrote. ""We continue to see the deal closing in (the) August time frame.""Arcuri cut his price target on Lam stock to 85 from 93. Lam and rival ASML recently indicated minor timing delays for DRAM (dynamic random-access memory)-related shipments, he wrote. Lam has guided shipments up for the second half of the year, but Arcuri isn't that confident.""Weakness for Lam seems focused on the memory side, with some signs of a less aggressive 3D Nand (flash) shipment cadence to Toshiba, seemingly due more to capital constraints at this customer rather than any fundamental change in the 3D Nand ramp itself,"" he wrote.But Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron (MU) and Intel Dalian haven't experienced any mirrored slowdown, he wrote.

385,WDC,"Seagate Technology (STX) stock plunged Thursday after the company released preliminary earnings late the previous day that were below its earlier guidance due to weak demand for its disk drives in servers and personal computers.Seagate stock crashed 20.1% to 27.11 in the stock market today, the lowest since late January. The news also hit Western Digital (WDC), which fell 6.65% to 41.82. Seagate and Western Digital are the two largest providers of disk drives.IBD's Take: How healthy are shares of Seagate and Western Digital, and how do they stack up vs. rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupSeagate expects to report revenue of about $2.6 billion, below previous guidance of $2.7 billion, for its fiscal third quarter. That would be a 21% decline year over year and the fifth straight quarterly decline. Seagate expects to report a non-GAAP gross profit margin of 23% vs. its previous guidance of 25.6%.Seagate attributed the shortfall to lower demand for disk drives in the business sector, as well as weaker demand for disk drives among China-based PC makers and the company’s decision not to aggressively participate in the low-capacity notebook market, among other reasons.Seagate will report its full earnings before the market open April 29. The company expects to report disk drive unit shipments of about 39 million, representing approximately 40% market share.Western Digital is scheduled to report its fiscal-third-quarter earnings April 28 after the market close.
"
386,WDC,"The sharp drop in PC sales that is the main reason Intel (INTC) will slash 12,000 jobs is also why the disk drive industry continues to get slammed.The two largest disk drive makers, Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), for several years have tried to deftly maneuver through the dramatic drop in PC sales.Global PC shipments fell 9.6% in the first quarter, year over year, to 64.8 million units, according to research firm Gartner. It was the sixth consecutive quarter of declines and the first time since 2007 that quarterly shipments fell below 65 million units.Chips and disk drives have been two central elements in every PC since personal computers emerged about 35 years ago. Intel has moved to lessen its reliance on PCs by getting more chips placed in mobile devices, data centers and elsewhere.“We are evolving from a PC company to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected and computing devices,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, when the company reported fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday.Besides the PC drop, Seagate and Western Digital have been hit hard by the emergence of tablets and smartphones, which don't contain disk drives at all. Seagate's year-over-year revenue has decelerated for 10 of the last 12 quarters. The trend is similar at Western Digital. That is expected to continue when both companies report quarterly earnings next week.Weston Twigg, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, expects disk drive revenue to decline about 8% annually through 2020, he wrote in a research report Tuesday.Both companies have sought to battle through the onslaught by diversifying into other areas, mainly by investing in solid-state memory chips and the development of all-chip storage systems, called solid state drives.Twigg expects solid-state drives will represent about half of data storage drives by 2020.Western Digital is making a huge play in the solid-state storage market with its $19 billion acquisition of SanDisk (SNKD), a leading provider of flash-memory chips used in smartphones and tablets. The deal positions Western Digital as having one of the most complete lines of storage among all providers.The deal, though, is a big risk for two reasons -- Western Digital is taking on lots of debt, and the flash-memory market is highly competitive with the potential for substantial overcapacity, Twigg writes. This includes competition from Intel, Micron (MU), Samsung and Toshiba.The good news is that Western Digital will be well-positioned if data-intensive applications like artificial intelligence, robotics, and the Internet of Things drive substantially higher demand for data storage, with hard-disk drives creating the backbone of these systems, he said.These same trends could bolster Seagate, though the company has been far more cautious about entering the chip-storage arena than Western Digital.
"
387,WDC,"Apple (AAPL) could stir the M&A froth within the chip sector by edging out Micron Technology (MU) and Western Digital (WDC) to make a play for SanDisk (SNDK), B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis theorizes.
"
388,WDC,"SanDisk, a leading maker of flash memory chips for smartphones and other mobile devices, recently made headlines with rumors that the company might put itself on the sales block. Bloomberg reported Micron and Western Digital as the most likely potential suitors.

390,WDC,"Just ahead of SanDisk's scheduled Q3 earnings report, analyst Ellis suggests that Apple and Seagate Technology (STX) also might bid for SanDisk.
"
391,WDC,"""For Apple, it's a drop in the $115 billion in (its) net-cash-and-investments bucket,"" Ellis wrote in a research report. It ""would pay out surprisingly quickly, given lower-cost Nand (flash) supply and pricing leverage with other memory markers.""
"
392,WDC,"Ellis rated SanDisk stock a buy and gave it a price target of 75. SanDisk stock closed Friday at 69.97 after touching a four-month high near 71 on Thursday.
"
393,WDC,"SanDisk Projected For Q3 Fall
"
394,WDC,"SanDisk is slated to post Q3 earnings after the close Wednesday, and the consensus of 35 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters calls for big declines on both the top and bottom lines.
"
395,WDC,"Wall Street models 80 cents EPS on $1.4 billion in revenue, down 45% and 19%, respectively, from Q3 2014. Three months ago, SanDisk guided to $1.35 billion-$1.45 billion in revenue for the quarter.
"
396,WDC,"Despite soft revenue and sales — SanDisk is believed to have lost Apple as a customer for its solid-state drives (SSDs) — the company remains ""uniquely compelling"" as an acquisition target, Ellis wrote.

403,WDC,"Extracting SanDisk from Toshiba — the companies operate a plant together — would be a challenge, ""and the buyout provision appears largely one-way in favor of Toshiba,"" Arcuri wrote.
"
404,WDC,"SanDisk 3D Nand Lags
"
405,WDC,"Arcuri rates SanDisk stock market perform, with a 58 price target.
"
406,WDC,"""We see SanDisk's decision to delay 3D Nand production as representing longer-term technology risk, as 3D Nand will likely be in a superior cost position by the time SanDisk starts to ramp production,"" he wrote.
"
407,WDC,"FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi agrees that SanDisk is lagging Samsung and Micron in 3D Nand. Micron and Intel (INTC) are preparing to release their 3D XPoint products in 2016.
"
408,WDC,"Seyrafi also sees Western Digital as the most likely buyer of SanDisk. Western Digital, a maker of hard disk drives, could use SanDisk to buffer against threats, he wrote.
"

410,WDC,"Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.Apple (AAPL) could stir the M&A froth within the chip sector by edging out Micron Technology (MU) and Western Digital (WDC) to make a play for SanDisk (SNDK), B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis theorizes.SanDisk, a leading maker of flash memory chips for smartphones and other mobile devices, recently made headlines with rumors that the company might put itself on the sales block. Bloomberg reported Micron and Western Digital as the most likely potential suitors.Milpitas, Calif.-based SanDisk is far from the only chipmaker reportedly up for potential sale. Analog Devices (ADI) is reportedly courting Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), and Fairchild Semiconductor (FCS) stock popped nearly 16% Wednesday on news that ON Semiconductor (ON) and Infineon Technologies might be interested in buying the company.Just ahead of SanDisk's scheduled Q3 earnings report, analyst Ellis suggests that Apple and Seagate Technology (STX) also might bid for SanDisk.""For Apple, it's a drop in the $115 billion in (its) net-cash-and-investments bucket,"" Ellis wrote in a research report. It ""would pay out surprisingly quickly, given lower-cost Nand (flash) supply and pricing leverage with other memory markers.""Ellis rated SanDisk stock a buy and gave it a price target of 75. SanDisk stock closed Friday at 69.97 after touching a four-month high near 71 on Thursday.SanDisk Projected For Q3 FallSanDisk is slated to post Q3 earnings after the close Wednesday, and the consensus of 35 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters calls for big declines on both the top and bottom lines.Wall Street models 80 cents EPS on $1.4 billion in revenue, down 45% and 19%, respectively, from Q3 2014. Three months ago, SanDisk guided to $1.35 billion-$1.45 billion in revenue for the quarter.Despite soft revenue and sales — SanDisk is believed to have lost Apple as a customer for its solid-state drives (SSDs) — the company remains ""uniquely compelling"" as an acquisition target, Ellis wrote.SanDisk has a globally recognized brand, its flash offerings are mature, and it has strong enterprise and client SSD market share, Ellis says. Vertical integration would generate ""industry-high product gross margins,"" he wrote.Merger Faces Toshiba ChallengeCowen and Co. analyst Timothy Arcuri is more hesitant to put his stamp on the M&A rumors.Many analysts theorized that Western Digital would be best suited to buy SanDisk, since Western Digital recently received a $3.8 billion infusion from China's Tsinghua Group.Still, there are questions around SanDisk, Arcuri wrote in a research report.""SanDisk's competitive position around the 3D transition and the royalty revenue are major unknowns that any buyer would struggle to capitalize,"" he wrote.Extracting SanDisk from Toshiba — the companies operate a plant together — would be a challenge, ""and the buyout provision appears largely one-way in favor of Toshiba,"" Arcuri wrote.SanDisk 3D Nand LagsArcuri rates SanDisk stock market perform, with a 58 price target.""We see SanDisk's decision to delay 3D Nand production as representing longer-term technology risk, as 3D Nand will likely be in a superior cost position by the time SanDisk starts to ramp production,"" he wrote.FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi agrees that SanDisk is lagging Samsung and Micron in 3D Nand. Micron and Intel (INTC) are preparing to release their 3D XPoint products in 2016.Seyrafi also sees Western Digital as the most likely buyer of SanDisk. Western Digital, a maker of hard disk drives, could use SanDisk to buffer against threats, he wrote.He rates SanDisk stock outperform, with a price target of 90.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

"
412,WDC,"SanDisk (SNDK) stock skyrocketed Wednesday on rumors the Milpitas, Calif.-based chipmaker might be acquired by Micron Technology (MU) or Western Digital (WDC).Bloomberg reported late Tuesday that SanDisk had contacted bankers to explore a possible sale.Besides Micron and Western Digital, Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan says Seagate (STX) and SK Hynix also are potential suitors.SanDisk didn't immediately return a call requesting comment.SanDisk might need to bulk up in order to do more business with Apple (AAPL), Sundararajan wrote in a research report Wednesday. SanDisk, maker of flash memory chips used in smartphone and other mobile devices, sees the transition to 3D Nand coming and knows Micron and Intel's (INTC) 3D XPoint might soon take some share, the analyst says.""It is better to bulk up so you have some heft to negotiate with Apple, the biggest consumer of Nand,"" he wrote.SanDisk lost Apple as a customer in the iPhone 6S. SanDisk's year-over-year sales have fallen the past two quarters, and EPS ex items has fallen the past four quarters.Sundararajan says SanDisk is ""amenable"" to a sale. He forecasts a $17 billion offer. SanDisk has a market valuation of about $14.2 billion.Micron or Western Digital might have to go into debt to make it work, the analyst says, ""unless Tsinghua opens up its wallets more.""Chinese Tsinghua Holdings recently invested $3.8 billion into Western Digital. Rumors continue to circulate that the Chinese chipmaker might be preparing a $23 billion offer for Micron.Micron would likely need Tsinghua's help to purchase SanDisk, Sundararajan says.""Our speculation has been that Micron will receive a cash injection from Tsinghua, given that a full sale probably won't be allowed by (the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States),"" he wrote.SanDisk operates a plant with Toshiba, which would probably have to bless any sale, Sundararajan wrote.In afternoon trading in the stock market today, SanDisk stock was up 12%, above 69, and touched a more than four-month high.It's been a bid year for chip industry M&As. In June, Intel announced the $16.7 billion deal to acquire Altera (ALTR).And Avago Technologies' (AVGO) $37 billion agreement to buy Broadcom (BRCM) was the biggest pure-tech acquisition ever announced, until Dell this week announced an agreement to acquire EMC (EMC) for $67 billion.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

433,WDC,"Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI) could grapple for Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), which is rumored to be on the sales block amid heavy chip industry M&A action.Maxim stock was up 7% Wednesday afternoon on a report that Texas Instruments was looking to acquire the company. Reports last week had Analog Devices doing the same. Texas Instruments stock was down nearly 1% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, while Analog Devices stock was up a fraction.Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Texas Instruments is in talks to acquire Maxim. Maxim, which has an $11 billion market value, might not sell unless the company's receives a high premium, sources told Bloomberg.An $11 billion offer would actually be on the low end in terms of big chip industry deals this year. Broadcom (BRCM) is being acquired by Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Avago (AVGO) for a whopping $37 billion.That deal, announced in May, was the biggest pure-tech merger — until this month's announced $67 billion merger of Dell and EMC (EMC).In June, Intel (INTC) agreed to buy Altera (ALTR) for $16.7 billion.This month, Lam Research (LRCX) announced it plans to buy KLA-Tencor (KLAC) for $10.6 billion. That same day Western Digital (WDC) said it agreed to acquire SanDisk (SNDK) for $19 billion.Also this month, Microsemi (MSCC) leaped over the bid by Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) in a battle to acquire PMC-Sierra (PMCS), making a $2.4 billion offer.Chip M&A action has ramped amid an industry downturn with slowing growth, increasing costs and competition, and macroeconomic concerns, particularly in China, analysts say.Maxim makes sense for Analog Devices and Texas Instruments, analysts say, and both figure in on the M&A speculation.Texas Instruments CEO Kevin March, however, seemed doubtful of joining the M&A move, in comments during the company's recent Q2 earnings conference call with analysts.""We already have what we believe is a significant scale advantage and we believe we're focused on the two best opportunities that are out there today, being analog and embedded processing,"" March told analysts. ""So those two reasons aren't motivating us to think differently about M&A.""MKM Partners analyst Ian Ing suggested in a research report that Texas Instruments might want to change its M&A tune.""Assuming robust M&A activity, we think the potential exists for the creation of an analog competitor with comparable scale and cost leadership,"" he wrote. ""Texas Instruments may need to respond pre-emptively and become acquisitive.""Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter and on Facebook.

562,WDC,"Flash storage chipmaker SanDisk on Monday announced a deal to buy Fusion-io on the cheap for $1.1 billion.
"
563,WDC,"Fusion-io (FIO), a developer of flash-based hardware and software for enterprise data centers, will provide SanDisk (SNDK) with a blue-chip customer base, enterprise vertical integration and a road map to higher gross profit margins, Sterne Agee analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a research note.
"
564,WDC,"SanDisk agreed to pay $11.25 a share in cash for Fusion-io, a 21% premium to Fusion-io's closing price on Friday. Fusion-io stock rose 22% to 11.36 on the news, reflecting investor hopes for a possible competing bid. Fusion-io went public in June 2011 at 19 and reached as high as 41.74, in 2011.
"
565,WDC,"SanDisk rose 3.6% to 102 on the belief that it got Fusion-io for a song. It hit an all-time high intraday of 102.20. SanDisk stock is up 34% since April, when it reported Q1 earnings that beat views.
"
566,WDC,"""Fusion-io will accelerate our efforts to enable the flash-transformed data center, helping companies better manage increasingly heavy data workloads at a lower total cost of ownership,"" SanDisk CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement. ""Customers will benefit from the addition of Fusion-io's leading PCIe solutions to SanDisk's vertically integrated business model.""
"
567,WDC,"Milpitas, Calif.-based SanDisk expects the deal to close in the third quarter and to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings in the second half of 2015.
"
568,WDC,"""I think SanDisk got a steal with this deal,"" Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan told IBD. Fusion-io is selling for a big discount relative to its peers, he said.
"
569,WDC,"SanDisk is buying Fusion-io for about 2.5 times estimated forward-looking sales. Rival Nimble Storage (NMBL) is trading at seven to nine times forward-looking sales. Nimble rose 4% to 27.56 on Monday.
"
570,WDC,"""What they are paying for FIO appears to be a bargain,"" Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini told IBD.
"
571,WDC,"Salt Lake City-based Fusion-io has had a rough 18 months. It's posted five consecutive quarters of losses, and sales have declined on a year-over-year basis for four of the last five quarters.
"
572,WDC,"Fusion-io's key customers last year were Facebook (FB), which accounted for 29% of revenue; followed by Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) at 17% and Apple (AAPL) at 15%, Hosseini said. Those three customers accounted for 61% of Fusion-io's 2013 sales.
"
573,WDC,"Fusion-io Products Expensive
"
574,WDC,"Fusion-io has struggled because its PCIe solution is considered expensive, Sundararajan said. It now buys Nand flash memory chips for its hardware from Samsung. SanDisk should be able to cut prices for Fusion-io offerings because it makes its own Nand chips, he said.
"
575,WDC,"PCIe is short for Peripheral Component Interconnect Express. It's a high-speed data transfer appliance used in computer systems.
"
576,WDC,"SanDisk is much larger and should be able to scale the production of PCIe systems. ""There is some impetus toward having the same company produce both the Nand as well as the PCIe solution,"" Sundararajan said. ""That's why this purchase makes sense.""
"
577,WDC,"Fusion-io investors should not hold their breath waiting for a better offer.
"
578,WDC,"""If somebody was really serious, they would have done it by now,"" Hosseini said. Of the other Nand chip producers, Micron Technology (MU) and Hynix couldn't afford Fusion-io because of their current balance sheets; Toshiba has made investments in other fabless solid-state drive producers; and Samsung isn't known for making big acquisitions, he said.
"
579,WDC,"Other recent acquisitions in the flash sector include Western Digital (WDC) acquiring PCIe competitor Virident for $685 million in cash and Seagate Technology (STX) buying LSI's flash business from Avago Technologies (AVGO), UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said in a research note.

611,WDC,"In this version of the Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) roundup, I’m discussing its settlement with Samsung, its all-new Maps application, rumors around Face ID for iPad, the new feature targeting 2018 election news and some analyst attention. So here goes-Samsung SettlementApple and Samsung have settled a long-running dispute with each other, according to a court filing by Judge Lucy Koh. They cannot change their minds later and file another complaint on the same matter based on their “litigation with prejudice” submission. The iPhone maker accused Samsung of copying certain very basic design and utility patents and a jury found in 2012 that 11 Samsung models did, in fact, infringe Apple patents.After that it was a question of determining the amount of damages due. Samsung took the matter to the Supreme Court, which ruled that a company was not required to part with all profits from a device when only parts comprised infringed technology.The jury had last awarded $539 million to Samsung, which said at the time that it would appeal the decision. Since $399 million was already paid, only $140 million remained due under the verdict. But since the matter was settled out of court, what if anything it finally paid remains unknown.The patents are almost irrelevant today since both Samsung and Apple have churned out many more and better models and according to some reports, Apple has done its own share of infringing. So it’s a good thing the two have finally decided to call it quits after paying for years of litigation.Doubling Down on MapsTechCrunch reported that Apple is overhauling its much criticized Maps application to build something from the ground up and using its own data the way that Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) does. So it’s using a combination of street cars, satellites and data from users who have explicitly agreed to share. This will allow it to get in a lot more detail like ground cover, foliage, pools, pedestrian pathways, parking lots, among other things, so it’s useful for both pedestrians as well as those using vehicles.Apple recognizes that strong maps are the basis for many other apps that rely on the location data, so it has spent the last four years building that data pool. It’s available to U.S. users today, before a more gradual global rollout.Relying on its own data, Apple will also be able to push out updates quickly, and even in real time where required.This is doable today because there are a billion Apple devices out there, so even if a portion of those share data, Apple may still be able to offer services like real time traffic updates.This, of course, is a big negative for TomTom, which has been providing Apple with mapping data ever since Apple terminated its agreement with Google. Apple said it will continue to use TomTom inputs for now, but the partnership’s days appear to be numbered.Face IDFace ID is Apple’s new system of unlocking devices like its iPhone and soon, according to rumors, also its iPad. Actually, it isn’t just a rumor, but more of an educated guess by one Troughton-Smith. He found some code in the beta version that seems to indicate that AvatarKit will be in the iPad. And since this is used for Apple’s Animoji, which in turn uses its TrueDepth camera, which is behind FaceID, it follows that FaceID is coming to the iPad. Or, that the iPad will be FaceID capable.Moreover, with iOS 12, iPhone X users will be able to record “alternate appearances” that make the identification more accurate. For example, if you save more of your appearances, such as when you’re wearing makeup or specs, it will recognize you better. If it’s indeed coming to the iPad, the feature could also let you save the images of your family members, so they too can unlock the device.The hype aside, the technology already has detractors who claim it’s less secure. Researchers in Vietnam for example have unlocked an iPhone using a look-alike mask. Same would be the problem with identical twins.Note that Samsung was recently granted a patent for technology that uses a NIR (near infrared) light source to detect the user’s iris. So Samsung’s soon-to-be-announced S10 will likely be equipped with a 3D sensing camera enabling facial recognition much like Apple’s Face ID.Smart Move on NewsWith the 2018 mid-term elections around the corner, technology companies are bending over backwards to prove their neutrality and ensure that every bit of news out there is authentic. Apple, which doesn’t have a network and doesn’t depend on advertising, can naturally do this much better than companies like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Google.So for the elections, the Cupertino, CA-based company has created a special section in Apple News that will be devoted to the mid-term elections and bear the Midterm Elections 2018 banner. Stories that appear here will comprise both controversial content and otherwise, but Apple News editors will ensure that they are trustworthy, well-sourced, uninflammatory, relevant, and devoid of rumor and propaganda. Apple is getting professionals to curate/scrutinize the section.While the editors have been empowered to take a call on issues based on some broad principles, they still have considerable latitude. This can be both good and bad: good because it can minimize the chances of fake news circulating and bad because what they pick can be biased. Still, David Chavern, CEO of a nonprofit trade group called News Media Alliance representing 2,000 news organizations in the U.S., is happy with the way Apple is going about things. So let’s see how it pans out.Loop Capital Analyst Weighs In on AppleAnalyst Ananda Barua wrote, “Specifically, we believe the combination of ongoing Services momentum (which we believe to be structural) and the introduction of a lower-ASP [average-selling-price] LCD-based iPhone X (upon the September launch of iPhone X Version 2, or Xv2) can provide tailwind to both revenue and iPhone X units that wasn't present for the iPhone Xv1 launch."" He also expects to see a favorable mix of higher end phones that he expects will be positive for margins and profits. RecommendationApple shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) unlike Facebook, Western Digital Corp.

612,WDC,"Shares of Zillow Group (ZG  -  Free Report), a provider of real estate and home-related brands on the Web and mobile, have been performing well of late.If you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, its time you hold the stock in your portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 5%.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryZillow Group outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, recording an encouraging positive average earnings surprise of 9.5%.Ahead of the IndustryZillow Group stock has gained 34.5% year over year, outperforming 6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Upbeat Q1Zillow Group delivered non-GAAP earnings of 7 cents per share in the first-quarter of 2018, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Total revenues increased 22% year over year to $299.9 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $298.96 million.Strong growth of the company’s Premier Agent Business primarily drove year-over-year revenue growth. New construction marketplaces also aided growth. The company is striving to increase audience size and improve consumer engagement via advertising and other related marketing initiatives.Strong GuidanceManagement expects second-quarter 2018 revenues in the range of $322-$327 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $325.1 million.Management raised guidance for 2018 due to an anticipated increase in Premier Agent revenues and additional revenue pertaining to adoption of ASC 606. Revenues are now anticipated to be in the range of $1.433-$1.578 billion compared with the earlier range of $1.302-$1.317 billion.Notes Offering & Strong Balance SheetZillow Group recently announced the pricing of its concurrent underwritten public offerings of approximately 5.702 million shares of Class C capital stock at $57 per share. The company also priced its $325 million in aggregate principal amount of its convertible senior notes due in 2023. The notes carry an interest rate of 1.5%, payable semi-annually.The company exhibited an impressive cash position in recently reported first-quarter of fiscal 2018. Cash and short-term investments were $822.9 million as of Mar 31, 2018, up from $762.5 million reported in the previous quarter. Moreover, the company generated $258.2 million of cash flow from operational activities in for fiscal 2017. The increasing liquidity and cash flow trend reflects that the company is making investments in the right direction.We believe that the company has a strong balance sheet, which will help it to capitalize on investment opportunities and pursue strategic acquisitions, further improving growth prospects. Moreover, we believe that the senior notes offering will bring down the company’s cost of capital, consequently strengthening its balance sheet and supporting growth.Bottom LineThe company is working toward growth of emerging marketplaces. Expanding footprint in new cities and cities where the company has a significant market presence, including the likes of Phoenix, Denver, Irvine, Cincinnati, Lincoln Nebraska, will positively impact the top-line, going forward.The company’s application that allows agents to create 3-D home tours, aiding buyers narrow down their searches before a personal visit, is another positive.Nevertheless, stiff competition, increasing mortgage interest rates and higher advertising spend are major headwinds. Further, spending in product enhancements is likely to limit margin growth at least in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked technology stocks include Micron Technology, Inc.

613,WDC,"Investors always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless you are blessed with Midas touch.When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. So, the chance of outperformance is high when the market moves higher.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we would recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial Health Questions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.What’s the Optimum Strategy?However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book, price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should give you even better results as they eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are four of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening:ArcBest Corporation (ARCB  -  Free Report) has an expected EPS growth rate of 35.7% for 3-5 years and delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 138.7% in the trailing four quarters.

617,WDC,"Of late, shares of Blackbaud, Inc. (BLKB  -  Free Report) have been gaining solid momentum. This rally can be attributed to the company’s expanding product portfolio as well as frequent product launches. Further, strong fundamentals and encouraging fiscal 2018 outlook drove its shares higher.The company is focused on providing cloud software solutions and data-driven decisions, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), cognitive technology, predictive analytics and other advanced technologies. The launch of SKY AI and SKY Analytics provide scalable and high-quality services along with rapidly reducing the time required to introduce a semiconductor product in the market. We believe that increasing investments on emerging trends like Internet-of-things (IoT), digital marketing and cloud-based platforms presents significant growth opportunity for the company in the long haul.Blackbaud also remains very active on the acquisition front and chooses companies that can be easily integrated within its existing or new product lines. From time to time, Blackbaud also acquires organizations with competing technologies with the intention of killing rival products. Over the last three years, the company has aggressively pursued acquisitions likely to bolster its presence in the cloud computing and database markets. These buyouts have also expanded the company’s total TAM. We believe that Blackbaud will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to improve market share and top-line, going forward.Blackbaud is a leading cloud software company working for non-profit organisations and social good. Its cloud-based suite of applications demonstrates strong growth momentum driven by its transition from the traditional revenue-base model to the cloud-based subscription-based model. The company’s returning cash to investors in form of dividends and share repurchase are other key catalysts.Positive OutlookThe company reiterated fiscal 2018 guidance. Management continues to expect fiscal 2018 revenues in the range of $870-$890 million.

Per Marc Benioff, the Chairman and CEO of Salesforce, UK is the company’s largest market in Europe and the company is putting its best foot forward to tap the growth opportunities in the market.The company already has some noteworthy UK-based companies on its clients list. These include the likes of Aston Martin and British Airways among others. Notably, in May 2018, Salesforce opened its Salesforce Innovation Centre in Salesforce Tower London aimed at developing innovative solutions in accordance with its customers. The new-age solutions will cover areas such as cloud, artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) among others.The company is also planning to unveil a second data center in UK in 2019.

621,WDC,"Symantec Corp.

The service provides protection against cyber threats while browsing. The enhancement has also managed to eliminate the need for an agent to manage traffic flow, with web traffic being redirected to WSS for enforcement of network security policies.Additionally, SD-Cloud Connector will enable users to connect with branch office locations via its cloud security service, given the combination of Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) technology and Symantec’s WSS.Notably, as the corporate world is increasingly adopting cloud technology, the need for ensuring security across the network is rising as well. In such a scenario, Symantec’s comprehensive solutions suite is expected to witness steady adoption and benefit its financials.How is Symantec Performing?The company reported strong fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results with the top and the bottom lines surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues of $1.222 billion on a GAAP basis jumped 10% year over year and exceeded the guidance of $1.164-$1.194 billion (mid-point $1.179 billion).However, a weaker-than-expected outlook for the first quarter as well as fiscal 2019 made investors skeptical about the company’s near-term prospects. Additionally, the ongoing investigation by the board’s audit committee related to concerns voiced by an ex-employee does not bode well for investors’ confidence.The stock has declined 26.2% since the release of the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results whereas the industry rallied 2.7% during the same time frame.Furthermore, margins are anticipated to remain under pressure due to continued shift of the company’s business model to ratable revenues, and increased investment in sales and marketing capacity, which makes us cautious about its near-term performance.Currently, Symantec has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked technology stocks include NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc.

622,WDC,"Millennials —  population with birth years ranging from 1980-2000 — are slowly turning out to be the backbone of the U.S. economy, outpacing baby boomers in 2015 and reflecting over one quarter of the nation’s population. By 2019, millennials will be America’s largest population cohort, as projected by the United States Census Bureau.This makes it important to track their life goals, shopping patterns and investment preferences for investment purposes. This is a pretty diverse generation with ages ranging from 22 to 37, thus capturing various stages of lives from “post-college to starting a family.”While there are pure-play millennial ETFs like Global X Millennials Thematic ETF (MILN  -  Free Report) and Principal Millennials Index ETF (GENY  -  Free Report) to tap this emerging trend, investors can also play the below-mentioned equity strategies that revolve around millennials and their lifestyles. The following stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Go OnlineMillennials indulge in social media. As per a report by Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, 44% of millennials are into text messaging, 38% into both social media and instant messaging and 16% into blogging. The percentages are higher than any other generation. Most of the millennials are occupied and that’s why shop online. They reportedly spend less time in grocery stores than baby boomers and Gen X shoppers. For obvious reasons, such preference patterns put the provider of online direct marketing and media services company QuinStreet Inc. (QNST  -  Free Report), e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Internet-based social expression and personal publishing service company Shutterfly Inc. (SFLY  -  Free Report) in focus.Bet on Broader Technology On a broader level, millennials are tech savvy. As much as 50% of millennials play video games compared with 27% Gen X and 16% Boomers.

A Google study showed that 60% of millennials hold a smartphone while cooking. Around 85% of the generation prefers artificial intelligence to manage their finances. As a result, semiconductor company Texas Instruments Inc TXN, wireless solution provider for the mobile communications BlackBerry Limited (B  -  Free Report)B), mobile gaming company Glu Mobile Inc. GLUU and computer storage device company Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) will catch investors’ attention.Organic & Healthy Food Habits Millennials are currently the driving factor behind organic produce sales. They are health conscious and aware of the importance in food standards and production methods. Such habits bode well for the wholesale distributor to the natural, organic and specialty industry United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) and the provider of science-based weight management products and nutritional supplements Herbalife LTD. (HLF  -  Free Report).Experiences Important Than Goods Millennials are viewed as a class that prefers experiences to things. About 78% likes to shell out on experiences than on possessions, per a 2017 survey conducted by the Harris Group. They shell out on dining out a lot, shows a Bankrate.com study. So, online travel company Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report), airline company SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and restaurant company Brinker International Inc. EAT should go well with this fondness.Look for ValueMillennials are deemed to be value conscious. They are interested in good deals. This should benefit discount retailers like Dollar General Corp (DG  -  Free Report).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Additionally, participating in the Zillow Instant Offers marketplace is aimed at capitalizing the business opportunities in the Home segment.The company’s application that allows agents to create 3-D home tours,aiding buyers narrow down their searches before a personal visit, is another positive.Zillow is working toward growth of emerging marketplaces. With the combination of machine learning and personalization, the company anticipates to align consumer interest with the listed properties. Expanding footprint in new cities and cities where the company has a significant market presence, including the likes of Phoenix, Denver, Irvine, Cincinnati, Lincoln Nebraska, will positively impact the top-line, going forward.Nevertheless, stiff competition, increasing mortgage interest rates and higher advertising spend are major headwinds. Moreover, spending in product enhancements is likely to limit margin growth at least in the near-term.Zacks Rank and Key PicksZillow has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector worth considering are Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

626,WDC,"By now, the year 2018 can easily be credited to trade tensions. In the first half, the two countries targeted $50 billion of each other’s goods for tit-for tat tariffs. But now, the situation has deteriorated with President Trump’s latest threat of 10% tariffs on further $200 billion in products imported from China.Trump has even gone on to say that if Beijing continues to retaliate, the United States will impose a total tariff on $550 billion in Chinese goods – an amount that was not even the total U.S. import from China last year.Now, if any broader investing spectrum falls prey to such political tensions, then that will be the large caps. Though the large-cap index S&P 500 started 2018 on a better footing than the Russell 2000, the game started changing from mid-March. President Trump’s protectionist agenda and the resultant trade war fears started weighing on large-cap stocks.Trade War Fear Seems Oversold, Time to Look at Better Data Points?Investors should note that after a nagging four-month trade war talks, investors seem to be ignoring the reality in July. U.S. stock futures are trading at a five-month high currently. This is especially true given that Chinese and U.S. officials have lately hinted at the prospect of recommencing talks over trade between the two countries.Three big ETFs including SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report), SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) and Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ  -  Free Report) have added about 0.9%, 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively, in the past five days (as of Jul 12, 2018).Investors also shifted focus to upbeat U.S. economic data points from the trade war. U.S. employers added 213,000 new jobs in June, after an upwardly revised 244,000 in May. The number breezed past market expectations of 195,000. The momentum in the manufacturing sector is equally upbeat with the sector logging the strongest expansion in four months in June.If this was not enough, U.S. retail sales rose the maximum in six months in May. Sales increased 0.8% sequentially in the month, after an upwardly revised 0.4% growth in April, handily beating market expectations of a 0.4% rise.Earnings Growth Momentum SolidEarnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 19.1% in Q2 on 8.2% higher revenues, per the Earnings Trends issued on Jul 11.  Investors should note that the present earnings cycle for the S&P 500 started from 2009, when the U.S. economy came out of its last recession.By now, the growth momentum should have slowed and reached the historical normalized pace of the mid-single-digits’ level. But an expected double-digit growth rate for Q2 earnings is the result of the tax reform, per the Earnings Trends.The Atlanta Fed estimates real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2018 to be 3.8%, much higher than the 2.0% rate recorded in Q1. The combination of these factors should continue to boost growth stocks.Why Large Caps?Having said this, while all sorts of growth ETFs may scale higher, large-caps are likely to enjoy some special benefits. This is because, large-caps have been subdued this year on trade concerns, resulting in cheaper valuation.Secondly, large-cap stocks perform better in a falling dollar environment as these have wide foreign exposure. Along with many analysts, we too believe that “tariffs, rising debt and deficits” may put a downward pressure on the greenback. This could bode well for large-cap stocks.Given this, we have highlighted a few top-ranked, large-cap growth stocks for investors. These large-cap stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Growth score of A.NetApp Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report)It is the data authority for hybrid cloud and hails from a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 20%).ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report)It is a major global exploration and production (E&P) company with operations all over the world.

627,WDC,"Reportedly, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) is working on an automated checkout technology that is likely to make cashiers and long winding checkout queues a thing of the past. With this technology, the software giant can challenge Amazon.com's (AMZN  -  Free Report) automated grocery shop, Amazon Go. As revealed by Reuters, a potential collaboration with Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) is likely in the offing. However, the companies refrained from making any comment.Similar technology was introduced to the public in January this year by Amazon Go store at Seattle. This was a first-of-a-kind retail outlet without cashiers and check-out counters. It enabled the customers to shop in a hassle-free environment by using the app.Shares of Microsoft have returned 47.1% in the past year, substantially outperforming industry’s rally of 38.9%.New Technology to Aid MicrosoftMicrosoft is reportedly working on systems that track what shoppers add to their carts. The company has demonstrated the sample technology to select retailers. Microsoft's check-out free technology can aid retailers to retain pace with Amazon Go.The technology, if deployed in the market, holds promise. Touted to drive innovation in customer friendly shopping, it will be embraced whole-heartedly by Amazon’s competitors who are striving to retain their foothold in the retail space. This can bode well for Microsoft.Putting the Tech Know-How in PlaceMicrosoft already develops retail technologies that support its clientele. Furthermore, the company exhibits the fundamentals for automated checkout at its Redmond-based Retail Experience Center.The company’s cloud services only trail Amazon Web Services, per a Synergy Research article.Additionally, the company has around six retail partners, including Redmond-based AVA Retail. Notably, the partners are developing their own checkout-free or other related services leveraging Microsoft's cloud. Sales of partners' services generate cloud revenues for the company. As a result, the company gains insights into the market which aids it in developing new retail technologies.Market Opportunities for MicrosoftPer a Transparency market research report, the global market for self-checkout systems was valued at $2.28 billion in 2016 and is envisioned to grow at a CAGR of 10.80% from 2017 to 2025. It is anticipated to reach $5.85 billion by the end of 2025.The above research report reinforces our view on the alluring prospects of the new technology.To ConcludeMicrosoft is well poised to benefit from developing this emerging technology, where Amazon enjoys a first-mover advantage. This will eventually aid the company improve its competitive position against cloud computing players. Moreover, the retailers leveraging the technology will also gain an edge over Amazon Go stores, which are set to open in San Francisco and Chicago.However, the software giant faces a challenge as the automated checkout technology should be priced keeping in mind the low margins grocers’ obtain.Zacks Rank & Key PickMicrosoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) is a better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

629,WDC,"Investors interested in Computer- Storage Devices stocks are likely familiar with Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) and Pure Storage (PSTG  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, Western Digital has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Pure Storage has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that WDC is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.WDC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.78, while PSTG has a forward P/E of 167.63. We also note that WDC has a PEG ratio of 0.30. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. PSTG currently has a PEG ratio of 11.18.Another notable valuation metric for WDC is its P/B ratio of 2.23. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PSTG has a P/B of 10.48.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to WDC's Value grade of A and PSTG's Value grade of F.WDC stands above PSTG thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that WDC is the superior value option right now.

631,WDC,"Have you been paying attention to shares of NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 5.4% over the past month. NTAP hit a new 52-week high of $70.15 in the previous session. NetApp has gained 25.9% since the start of the year compared to the 3.9% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 14.7% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 14, 2018, NetApp reported EPS of $0.99 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.9 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.29%.For the current fiscal year, NetApp is expected to post earnings of $3.97 per share on $5.86 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.61 per share on $6.18 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 15.8% and 5.39%, respectively.Valuation MetricsNetApp may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for NTAP? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.NetApp has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 17.5X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 23.1X versus its peer group's average of 16.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.7. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus  NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus | NetApp, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, NetApp currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if NetApp passes the test. Thus, it seems as though NTAP shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does NetApp Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of NetApp have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI  -  Free Report), Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report), and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 3% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for NTAP, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

633,WDC,"On Jun 20, we issued an updated research report on CACI International Inc. (CACI  -  Free Report).The company provides IT applications and infrastructure to improve communications and secure the integrity of information systems and network. It is a leader in IT outsourcing for the U.S. federal government.CACI International recently provided impressive guidance for fiscal 2019 on the back of improving budget environment and expanding total addressable market.For fiscal 2019, revenues are expected in the range of $4.55-$4.75 billion. Net income is expected in the range of $230-$240 million. Earnings per share are expected in the range of $8.98- $9.38.CACI International, Inc. Revenue (TTM) CACI International, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | CACI International, Inc. QuoteFactors Influencing the StockA healthy relationship with the Department of Defense (DoD) and exposure to expanding DoD and Department of Homeland Security budgets are key growth catalysts for CACI International.The company has a large pipeline of new projects and continues to win deals at regular intervals. These back-to-back contract wins are the key catalysts driving the company’s success. Furthermore, having the government as a major client lends stability to the business and moderates fluctuations in revenues.CACI International remains focused on the federal government marketplace and eyes more market share. The company intends to drive operational excellence by intensively focusing on its organic and inorganic growth strategy and strengthening its existing customer relationships while building newer ones. In addition, the company anticipates to significantly benefit from its cost reduction program.However, CACI International, either a prime contractor or a subcontractor, derives a significant portion of total revenues from the U.S. federal government. Evolving rules and regulations remain a significant impediment to margin growth.Additionally, it faces competition from major players in the industry like CGI Group, Inc., SYNNEX Corporation, ManTech International Corporation and Sapient Corporation.Hence, the company has to continuously invest in value drivers that act as a hedge against competition. These increase its operating costs and reduce the profitability of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) and Micron (MU  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Earnings were also much higher than the year-ago quarter’s figure of $1.62 per share.The stellar results were primarily attributable to strong demand across all business and product segments. This, along with proper execution by management, backed the solid performance.Revenue DetailsMicron’s revenues in the reported quarter climbed around 40.1% on a year-over-year basis to $7.797 billion. Reported revenues were up 6.1% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The strong demand environment from data centers and cloud computing led to growth in the sales of DRAM and NAND solutions.Quarterly revenues also came ahead of the company’s guided range of $7.2-$7.6 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.697 billion.Sales from DRAM products, which accounted for 71% of total revenues during the quarter, were up a 56%, on a year-over-year basis, and 6% on a sequential basis. The company recorded mid to upper single-digit percentage rise in average selling price (ASP), driven by a higher mix of server and graphics DRAM demand.Sales from NAND products, which accounted for 25% of total revenues, marked 14% year-over-year and 8% sequential growth. The company witnessed increase in ASP in mid to upper single-digit percentage, driven by higher value solutions in the portfolio.Business unit wise, revenues of the computing and networking business (CMBU) unit surged 67% from the year-ago quarter and reached $4 billion. Sequentially, it marked 8% growth. The company’s cloud server and graphics memory product sales more than doubled year over year.Revenues from the Mobile Business Unit (MBU) reached a record level of $1.8 billion, registering year-over-year jump of 55%. A surge in demand for the company’s low power DRAM products as well as its managed NAND products backed the commendable year-over-year improvement.Revenues for the Storage Business Unit (SBU), which comprises SSD NAND components and 3D XPoint, sales came in at $1.1 billion. Notably, the company has joined forces with Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) for the development of 3D XPoint technology. However, the ongoing shift in NAND supply and lower 3D XPoint sales resulted in a 9% sequential decline in the segment.The Embedded business unit reported revenues of $897 million, up 28% from the year-ago quarter and 8% from the previous quarter. The growth was backed by industrial and consumer applications including the likes of industrial drones and factor automation among others.Income and MarginsMicron’s non-GAAP gross profit registered 77.8% increase from the prior-year period and came in at $4.75 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin advanced from 48% to 60.9%.Micron’s non-GAAP operating income came in at $4.017 billion compared with just $2.071 billion reported in the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin improved to 51.5% from 37.2% reported in third-quarter fiscal 2017.The impressive year-over-year improvement in gross margin was chiefly driven by better mix of high-value products and efficient cost management.On a non-GAAP basis, the company reported net income of $3.898 billion compared with $1.896 billion witnessed in the comparable quarter last fiscal.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowThe company exited the fiscal third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $7.07 billion compared with $8.04 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter.

639,WDC,"The top stories for Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) stock are related to recent analyst downgrades, updates on its CEO search, a strengthening relationship with Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report) and the possibility of an iPhone loss.Analysts Downgrade IntelThe CEO departure saw a number of analysts weighing in on Intel.Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon downgraded the stock to underperform while lowering the price target from $54 to $42. He said he regretted his earlier upgrade because the structural issues he pointed out earlier were becoming all the more obvious and the CEO departure just increased uncertainty. Add to that the difficult comps coming up in 2019 and the stock didn’t look at all attractive.On the positive side, Bernstein analyst Mike Burton believes that Intel has an advantage with respect to data center architectures given its investments in NAND/XPoint and the Atera acquisition. He did mention some tough competition though from NVIDIA and others.Benchmark analysts initiated with a Hold rating, calling out Intel’s CEO resignation and competitive threats while expressing optimism about its “compelling story.”Romit Shah of Nomura Instinet downgraded Intel from Buy to Hold and lowered his price target from $60 to $55. He said that it was very difficult for him to believe that the board would let the CEO go on something that happened 10 years ago and there were plenty other factors that warranted his resignation.Krzanich may have done some good as far as revenue and margins were concerned, but it was in his regime that Intel lost its manufacturing lead, gave up some data center processing advantages and admitted that it would lose an unspecified amount of market share to AMD. It also fell back in AI and machine learning. However, the lack of leadership at the company was a concern and it didn’t appear likely that it would gain investor confidence if it didn’t look outside to fill the position.New CEO SpeculationDiane Bryant, former COO at Google Cloud, has resigned after just seven months in her new position. Google has confirmed her departure, so this part isn’t speculation. But since information about her future plans isn’t readily available, there’s a ton of speculation that she’s headed for the top job at Intel. And there’s good reason for this-Bryant is an Intel veteran having served at the company for around 20 years, most recently, as its head of data center operations. She reportedly played an important role in making Intel a data-first company and was one of the front-runners for the position five years ago. But Krzanich was chosen instead and she became one of high-profile executives to depart.Today, the ""data-centric” businesses (IoT, data center and programmable chip units) account for about half of Intel’s annual revenue.If all of the above reasons aren’t good enough to get her back, there’s also the consideration that she being a woman, will also be good for Intel’s diversity numbers.Wins Baidu in AV, Expands AI RelationshipChinese search leader Baidu and Intel made some important announcements at Baidu Create, the company’s inaugural artificial intelligence conference.The first was in relation to Baidu’s incorporation of Mobileye’s Responsibility Sensitive Safety (RSS) software in its Apollo self-driving platform and deployment in its commercial Apollo Drive program. Project Apollo is an open source system that auto players can adopt to quickly get into the self-driving space. It has attracted 116 global partners since its launch a year ago. Baidu’s vetting is important because of its close ties with Chinese automakers as this can also help Intel gain their confidence.The thinking goes that including Intel’s deterministic software (RSS) as a layer above the artificial intelligence powered system will increase the safety of self-driving vehicles. What this means is that while the AI-powered system has to follow a logical reasoning pathway, some things that we already know to be true can be added to the system as a bit of already-processed information (or a given), thus increasing accuracy and speeding up decision-making. So for instance, the system incorporates safety protocols like maintaining a certain distance behind cars and giving rather than taking the right-of-way.Baidu is also endorsing its visual perception solution called Surround Computer Vision Kit, a system of 12 cameras that feed data into Mobileye’s computer vision hardware and software platform. Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Waymo uses a platform that combines camera and LiDAR systems while Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) published research indicates another camera-only solution.In the words of Baidu executive Weihao Gu: “Project Apollo will integrate RSS to successfully enable safe driving today, and drive further autonomous research on China’s roadways.”The second announcement was that Baidu has also incorporated Intel’s Movidius Myriad 2 vision processing unit (VPU) in its artificial intelligence-powered Xeye camera for retailers. So Intel VPUs will work along with Baidu ML algorithms to detect people, objects and movements/gestures and interpret them using AI.  The end result will be an improved shopping experience.Third, Intel field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) will now be offered on a workload-acceleration-as-a-service basis on the Baidu Cloud. Moreover, Baidu’s deep learning platform PaddlePaddle has been optimized for Intel Xeon Scalable processors.Apple Dropping Intel ChipsThere are fresh rumors unconfirmed by Apple about its moving away from Intel 5G chips in its MacBook lineup. The chips in question are codenamed Sunny Peak and they were intended for Apple devices coming to market in 2020. The rumors say that Intel has shut down this program and transferred employees elsewhere since Apple was supposed to be the main buyer. Somewhat contrarily, they also say that Intel is doubling down on the next product family targeting Apple’s 2022 devices.   If true, it wouldn’t be unexpected since Apple has greatly increased its chip expertise in recent years and currently makes many of its chips in-house.  Since last year, the company has also started making its own graphics chips.Vertical integration has always been a focus area for Apple, helping it decide its own product cycles and squeeze out costs, while making its offerings faster, sleeker and more efficient. In this case, it would finally enable Apple to have apps that run across its family of devices. Thus far, there has been more app development on iOS than MacOS, so bringing iOS to Macs could be a good idea.But it won’t happen without challenges, not the least of which will be product transition issues, especially given Mac’s largely enterprise clientele. Even if it is able to market the advantages of the transition, it will be technically difficult to achieve Intel-like power right off the bat.   For Intel, Apple is not a major customer, contributing less than 5% of its revenue. So there isn’t any major threat to the company. So Intel’s statement, which reads, “Intel’s 5G customer engagements and roadmap have not changed for 2018 through 2020. We remain committed to our 5G plans and projects,” makes sense. RecommendationIntel shares carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Other tech companies with a buy rank are Western Digital Corp.

641,WDC,"On Monday, the Nasdaq hit a fresh record high for the first time in almost three months. A rally in tech and consumer discretionary stocks ensued, indicating that investors are choosing to ignore trade tensions and geopolitical conflicts. Instead, markets are focusing on strong economic fundamentals following last Friday’s strong jobs report.The major catalyst to the day’s gains was a surge in shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), which hit an all-time high. Analysts believe that this is further evidence of upbeat sentiment about the economy. With investors choosing to show confidence in a sector which has had a turbulent ride this year, this seems to be the best time to invest in tech stocks that are part of the Nasdaq.   Apple, Amazon, Microsoft Power Broader GainsThe Nasdaq gained 0.7% on Monday, finishing at a record level for the first time since Mar 12. One of the major drivers of the day’s gains was a surge in shares of Apple. The iPhone maker’s stocks gained 0.8% to hit an all-time high. Gains were primarily attributable to the enthusiastic response to the company’s WWDC 2018 keynote. Shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) also contributed to the day’s gains, increasing 1.5% to hit a record high. Microsoft Corporation’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) shares also gained 0.9% to hit a new record. These gains came after the software giant revealed that it was buying software developer GitHub for $7.5 billion. As a result, the Nasdaq failed to hit an intraday high by only around 0.5%.Investors Focusing on Economic FundamentalsStocks had surged last Friday following encouraging data from the Department of Labor. The economy added 223,000 jobs in May even as unemployment plummeted to an 18-year low. Additionally, wage gains remained limited, curbing fears about surging inflation which had caused losses in February.Investors continued to focus on the positive sentiment that this report spurred on Monday. Analysts are of the opinion that the surge in shares of Apple was an expression of confidence in the state of the U.S. economy.In choosing to focus on strong fundamentals, investors ignored a spate of headwinds that dampened sentiments recently.

644,WDC,"Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have earnings. Earnings growth draws the attention of almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t survive the test of time.This metric is also considered a key variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have witnessed historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank equal to 1 (Only Zacks' 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.) You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (Stocks that possess strong EPS growth history.)% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (Companies that witnessed year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal.)% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks.)% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week.)% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks.)The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,886 stocks to only 15. Here are the top five stocks:The New York Times Company (NYT  -  Free Report) provides news and information for readers and viewers across various platforms.

645,WDC,"Warren Buffett once said, “It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.”  The strategy is very simple – find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth.Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. So, chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward.There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential. Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company’s business. One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking, if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis – the lower the number, the better.Why Price to Cash Flow?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, one of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. On the other hand, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), which develops, manufactures, and sells data storage devices and solutions, delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.2% in the trailing four quarters.

This Zacks Rank #2 company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 5.4% in the trailing four quarters and has an expected EPS growth rate of 21.1% for 3-5 years.AerCap Holdings N.V.

647,WDC,"When evaluating a company’s value, investors mostly look at a stock’s Price-to-earnings (P/E) or Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio. While P/E is the ratio of annual earnings to stock price, P/S reflects the amount investors pay for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.Though price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects. P/B is the ratio of stock price to book valueIt is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityWhat is Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. The higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:Tutor Perini Corporation (TPC  -  Free Report), a construction company, currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

648,WDC,"Have you been paying attention to shares of NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 14.9% over the past month. NTAP hit a new 52-week high of $79.75 in the previous session. NetApp has gained 42% since the start of the year compared to the 5.6% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 19% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 23, 2018, NetApp reported EPS of $1.05 versus consensus estimate of $1.01 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.86%.For the current fiscal year, NetApp is expected to post earnings of $3.54 per share on $6.19 billion in revenues. This represents a 16.71% change in EPS on a 4.77% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.03 per share on $6.51 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 16.15% and 5.13%, respectively.Valuation MetricsNetApp may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for NTAP? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.NetApp has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 22.2X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 20.6X versus its peer group's average of 13.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.6. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus  NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus | NetApp, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, NetApp currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if NetApp passes the test. Thus, it seems as though NTAP shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does NetApp Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of NetApp have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI  -  Free Report), Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report), and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 7% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for NTAP, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

653,WDC,"Last Friday’s headlines in the South China Morning Post offered up a sorry Mainland China equity market summary.A bear market in China is almost here.Now what happens?According to this Hong Kong newspaper of record, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index is now down -19% from its January high, on the cusp of a -20% decline generally seen by technical analysts as the threshold where stocks enter a bear market. The gauge rebounded +0.5% to 2,889.76 at the close on Friday.If the decline resumes, sending stocks below the bear market threshold, it will be the first time since a major rout in 2015.China’s stocks erased about US$514 billion in market value last week, or the equivalent of Sweden’s economy, after the Trump administration threatened additional tariffs worth US$200 billion following Beijing’s retaliatory duties.For this Global Week Ahead, I reproduced the five big Reuters world market themes. These are likely to dominate the thinking of both investors and traders.What’s the leading theme? It is the U.S.-China Trade War turning into reality.‘Nuff said.(1) U.S. China Trade War Rhetoric Turns to ActionAs the trade war rhetoric starts to turn to action, China’s markets are on the defensive.The yuan has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar since early 2018, stocks just had their biggest weekly decline in five months, and cash rates are rising — with the 14-day repo rate hitting a two-month high as firms locked in funding to cover the end of the quarter.The question is: What might authorities do? At present they are trying to keep markets flush to make sure the economic wheels keep turning; the central bank injected a net 340 billion yuan ($52.3 billion) in the past week, including 200 billion yuan via its one-year medium-term lending facility.Banks’ reserve ratios are also likely to be cut further.These policy-easing expectations are partly driving the yuan’s slide, but investors are wondering now how far the weakness could go.A weak yuan might help offset the trade impact. Yet a rapid currency fall, aside from provoking more ire in Washington, could feed on itself by fueling further outflows of money from China, as happened after the August 2015 devaluation. It would also be bad news for other emerging markets such a Taiwan, Mexico and South Korea that compete with China in export markets.(2) Keep an Eye on U.S. Consumer Confidence TuesdayIncreasingly hostile trade war rhetoric, mixing in with tit-for-tat tariffs, increases risks for investors and consumers concerned about their portfolios and the prices they pay for imported goods.U.S. consumer confidence, however, is expected to remain at a lofty level in June as corporate profits remain healthy. The report, due on June 26th, is forecast by a Reuters poll of economists to hold steady at 128, just off an 18-year high hit in May.Economists point out the amount of tariffs being threatened is overall quite small in the context of a $20 trillion U.S. economy. In the case of China-U.S. trade, Beijing exports more than it imports, meaning it will run out of products it can tax well before Washington does. But try explaining that to people buying a TV to watch the World Cup.(3) European Summit of Leaders Late This WeekThe migration debate is overshadowing the official agenda for the June 28-29 EU Summit, which means chances are slim of market-moving reforms being finalized.Nonetheless, up for discussion will be blueprints for strengthening the ESM bailout fund, a common Eurozone budget and the banking union project to boost trust in the bloc’s financial sector. The summit may also debate plans to further ease debt restructurings in Europe.As for country-specific issues, Italy and Britain will be in focus — the summit will mark the first EU airing for Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. For Britain, meanwhile hopes are ebbing the event will break a deadlock on how to exit the EU as Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to find a proposal on post-Brexit customs arrangements to take into the negotiations.The weekend marks the second anniversary of the Brexit referendum and the clock is ticking down to the scheduled exit date of March 29, 2019. Sterling, down 8 percent since mid-April, is enjoying a brief reprieve thanks to an unexpectedly hawkish Bank of England meeting last Thursday, but remains on course for its worst quarter since the Brexit vote.(4) Eurozone Consumer Price Inflation Numbers Hit the TapeFlash Eurozone inflation figures are expected to show exactly why the ECB’s retreat from crisis-era stimulus measures will be glacial.Economists anticipate a 1.3 percent annual rise in consumer prices in June, short of the ECB’s target of “below, but close to, 2 pct over the medium term.”The ECB will end its 2.4 trillion euro bond-buying program in December, but signaled that negative interest rates are here to stay for some time. That means Mario Draghi’s 8-year term as ECB president could end in October 2019 without his ever having presided over a rate rise.Since the ECB policy decision and Draghi’s press conference on June 14th, the euro has fallen as much as -2.6% and came close to breaking below $1.15 for the first time in almost a year. Morgan Stanley and others have lowered their euro forecasts, and weak inflation data could see another test of $1.15.(5) Greek Debt Relief Is HappeningHaving received three bailouts since 2010, Greece has taken a big step forward — the Eurozone has agreed to extend bond maturities and defer interest on a major part of its loans to Athens, along with a big cash injection.This makes Greece’s debt load more sustainable, smoothing its path for the time after it exits the bailout in August.Markets have reacted accordingly, with five- and 10-year bond yields falling 23 and 16 bps respectively, the latter at a four-week low GR5YT=RR GR10YT=RR.This is good news for a Eurozone facing the risk of another crisis, this time in Italy. For Greece, the question now is when it can start borrowing on markets again. It sold bonds last year for the first time in three years and wants to raise another 4.5 billion euros in 2018, including its first 10-year issue in a decade.The prospect of a new Greek issue is also tantalizing fund managers and investment bankers. But Greece has no immediate need for cash and the selloff in Italian debt has made issuance harder for southern European borrowers. Still, syndicate bankers reckon Athens should be able to grab a window of opportunity sometime before the August lull.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A  -  Free Report): This $290B large cap stock has Zacks A’s in Value, Growth, and Momentum.But did the OPEC agreement to raise production last week reverse the positive sentiment on major oil stocks?Micron (MU  -  Free Report): This stock had a solid earnings beat last week, with positives on the outlook for the rest of the year. We have an A in Value and a B in Growth.But now we have a U.S. China Trade War in hand. What happens to darling stocks in tech like this? Watch this stock closely, for the sentiment on chips overall will play out here.Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report): This top-notch computer storage stock stays at a #1 Zacks Rank and has Zacks As in Value and Growth.But the stock price is stuck.I can imagine this stock’s price taking off, when the sentiment on financial risk comes back on. That is being held back by the U.S.-China Trade War rhetoric — bleeding into reality.Key Global Macro—By Friday, the U.S. Treasury Dept. is expected to announce what U.S. industries are subject to investment restrictions applied against Chinese investors.Four Fed Presidents speak during the week.The data reports don’t look to hold any big catalysts.Mexico’s Presidential election happens on Sunday July 1st.On Monday, the important German IFO indexes came out. Business Climate went from 102.3 to 101.8. Current Conditions went from 106.1 to 105.1. Expectations went from 98.6 to 98.6. I see a slight wilt to strong numbers.Japan’s leading indicator index went up, from 105.6 to 106.2.On Tuesday, the 7-day repo rate in Argentina, that nation’s monetary policy rate, will stay constant at 40%. That’s not a typo. Welcome to the emerging market FX crisis of 2018.Argentina’s economic activity index is forecast to climb to +1.8% y/y from +1.4% y/y. Think of this as a proxy for the direction of real GDP growth.The Case-Shiller Home Price Index (HPI) comes out for the USA. The prior has been hot, at +6.79% y/y.Mexico’s unemployment rate should go from 3.4% to 3.6%. That’s still very low, but it is headed in the wrong direction. This is likely a peso effect in play.On Wednesday, New Zealand’s cash target rate, their monetary policy rate, is re-set. The current rate of 1.75% is not expected to change. Australia and New Zealand pay attention to one another, and they both follow the USA and UK.Japan’s latest retail sales data comes out. The +1.5% y/y rate that held prior is OK for this slow growing economy.On Thursday, Spain’s flash HICP (a consumer inflation rate) comes out. It has been +2.1% y/y, which is basically at the European Central Bank’s target.Germany’s HICP is at +2.2% y/y. The German unemployment rate is 5.2%.U.S. initial claims are quite low at 218K.On Friday, the Eurozone Core HICP comes out. It has been +1.1% y/y. +2.0% is the target, so there is plenty of policy slack here.Brazil’s national unemployment rate comes out. It could fall from 12.9% to 12.8%. Obviously, double-digit unemployment rates are not good.The U.S. Chicago manufacturing PMI comes out. It has been hot at 62.7.

654,WDC,"Investors looking for stocks in the Computer- Storage Devices sector might want to consider either Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) or NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Both Western Digital and NetApp have a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.WDC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.95, while NTAP has a forward P/E of 21.72. We also note that WDC has a PEG ratio of 0.31. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. NTAP currently has a PEG ratio of 1.81.Another notable valuation metric for WDC is its P/B ratio of 2.10. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NTAP has a P/B of 9.81.Based on these metrics and many more, WDC holds a Value grade of A, while NTAP has a Value grade of C.Both WDC and NTAP are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that WDC is the superior value option right now.

Product sales increased marginally (0.6%).Quarter DetailsGaming Segment (54.6% of total revenues) revenues increased 0.7% year over year to $443 million.

658,WDC,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Western Digital has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.0. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Western Digital’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 11.8. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Western Digital has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 6.0, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Western Digital stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Western Digital has a P/S ratio of about 1.3. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.As we can see, the stock is trading at its median value for the time period from a P/S metric. This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Western Digital currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Western Digital a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Western Digital is just 0.3, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1.3. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 5.4, which is far better than the industry average of 16.3. Clearly, WDC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Western Digital might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of D. This gives WDC a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging. The current fiscal quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to only one lower, while the fiscal full year estimate has seen eight upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has risen by 10% in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has increased 4.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Western Digital Corporation Price and Consensus  Western Digital Corporation Price and Consensus | Western Digital Corporation QuoteThis bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineWestern Digital is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Boasting a good industry rank (among the top 3%) and a top Zacks Rank, the company deserves attention right now. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

659,WDC,"Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report) delivered impressive fiscal third-quarter 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $1.46 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36 per share, surging 32.7% on a year-over-year basis. However, the figure declined 1.4% sequentially.Revenues of $2.80 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76 billion and also grew 4.8% from the year-ago quarter but declined 3.6% sequentially.Both the top and bottom lines witnessed year-over-year improvement, owing to robust adoption driven by strong demand of Seagate’s storage drives. Moreover, increasing traction for mass storage solutions across company’s edge and enterprise markets remained a tailwind.Seagate’s stock has surged 33.1% in the past year, substantially outperforming industry’s rally of 21.8%.Performance in DetailDuring the reported quarter, Seagate shipped 87.4 exabytes of hard disk drive (HDD) storage, with an average capacity of record 2.4 terabytes per drive.The company shipped 43.8 exabytes for the enterprise HDD market, each with an average capacity of 4.8 terabytes.Total HDD revenues went up 6.7% year over year to $2.59 billion during the quarter primarily due to advancement and accelerated growth of cloud storage technologies. Management believes that the HDD product suite is ready to cater to the demands of the market.In the nearline market, the company shipped 41.3 exabytes of HDD, nearline products’ average capacity per drive reached 6.5 terabytes. Management noted that the company’s 10-terabyte helium nearline product was one of the top revenue generators in the quarter. Growth in the 12-terabyte helium nearline product line was also encouraging. Given the impressive customer feedback, Seagate anticipates capitalizing on the market adoption of these products.Within the edge and customer verticals, the company witnessed year-over-year exabyte growth in all end markets, including PC compute, consumer, surveillance, gaming, and NAS markets.Non-HDD segment (cloud systems and silicon group) revenues declined 13.2% year over year but gained 1.9% sequentially to $217 million. Per management, year-over-year decrease was “primarily due to the planned end of life of some legacy OEM cloud systems products and the divestiture of high-performance computing assets.”Margin DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin which came in at 30.8% declined 60 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis but expanded 40 bps sequentially.Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 13% on a year-over-year basis to $385 million. This decrease in expenses can be attributed to certain cost improvement initiatives undertaken since past two years.Seagate Technology PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Seagate Technology PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteBalance Sheet and Cash FlowSeagate ended the March quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.93 billion up from $2.56 billion in the quarter ending December. At the end of the quarter, the company had a long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $4.34 billion compared with $5.02 billion in the previous quarter.The company’s board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of 63 cents for the March quarter to be paid on Jul 5, 2018. Further, in the quarter, Seagate redeemed senior notes due November 2018 for $57 million.Cash flow from operations was $558 million for the third quarter and was $1.65 billion for the first three quarters of fiscal 2018. Free cash flow for the quarter and first nine months of the fiscal came at $489 million and $1.4 billion, respectively.GuidanceManagement anticipates fourth-quarter revenues to grow approximately 17% on a year-over-year basis due to strong cloud demand and seasonality in other markets. However, the company projects revenues to remain flat sequentially. The company notifies that Exabyte demand is increasing on a year-over-year basis across most of the markets it caters.Seagate projects gross margins to be flat on a sequentially basis and come within the company’s long-term range of 29–33%. It projects to generate an operating cash flow of at least $500 million in the fourth quarter.Seagate anticipates additional variable compensation for its employees in the fourth quarter. However, management believes that its ongoing cost management initiatives operational efficiency will enable the company to reduce non-GAAP operating expenses by 1-2% from the prior quarter.For fiscal 2018 revenues are expected to grow 4% and the company envisions generating an operating cash flow greater than $2 billion.For second half of 2018, the company expects solid capacity demand, robust exabyte growth in its edge markets along with seasonal strength in other markets to boost the top line.ConclusionWith the huge transformations in the storage industry, mobile cloud is taking the center stage. This in turn has bolstered the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products which is beneficial for Seagate.In January this year, Seagate entered into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba. The agreement will help the company in its innovation of HDD, solid state drives (SSD) and hybrid solutions, consequently expanding its product portfolio.The company is trying to focus less on the mission-critical 15K and sub-1-terabyte client consumer markets. Management anticipates these markets to eventually converge with either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where it is already expanding footprint. Notably, as a percentage of total revenues, the products accounted for lesser than 8%.Favorable macroeconomic environment and rising global investments in cloud will continue to work as key catalysts. Further, hints of PC market stabilization as reflected in the latest reports from Gartner and IDC are a positive.The company’s efforts in the improvement of areal density with the ramping up of its heat assisted magnetic recording (“HAMR”) technology, which is expected be shipped in 2019, is yet another positive. This move will not only reinforce company’s leadership in areal density but also boost nearline drive capacity points by at least 24 terabytes per drive.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Seagate sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector worth considering are Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.

660,WDC,"Snap Inc. (SNAP  -  Free Report) reported loss per share of 17 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and narrower than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 20 cents.The company reported revenues of $230.7 million, which grew 54.1% year over year but missed the consensus mark of $246.1 million.Though revenues increased, the growth rate has come down significantly when compared with the past quarters. The redesign of the Snapchat app, which garnered significant negative response, had an adverse impact on the company’s ad business, which remains the primary contributor.Management expects growth to decelerate further in the second quarter owing to the pricing of both Snap Ads and Creative Tools. Moreover, increase in infrastructure costs due to tests and rollout of app updates will remain an overhang.Quarter in DetailAd revenues of $281 million in the quarter grew 62% year over year but declined 19% sequentially. Revenues from other sources contributed the rest.Strength in Snap Ad backed year-over-year improvement while the company’s Sponsored Creative Tools business was down.

Of the total Snap Ads, 95% were bought programmatically during the quarter.Moreover, Lens and Filter products were hurt by “negative market narrative.” Snap’s transition to a “programmatic, audience-based buy model” had a negative impact on average order value (AOV) for the products. Although the number of Lenses sold increased 16% year over year, its AOV declined 37%.Snap’s international revenues (26% of total revenue) increased 14% year over year and 23% sequentially.The company’s daily active users (DAU) and average revenue per user (ARPU) witnessed year-over-year improvement. DAU increased 15% year over year to 191 million, while ARPU improved 34% to $1.21.Notably, on a sequential basis, DAU increased 2%. Weak performance in the Android market is a big headwind. The company expects to launch a redesigned Android application in the third quarter, by taking all technical glitches into consideration, in order to boost its popularity among Android users.Snap’s costs per user (CoRPU) increased 5% year over year to $1.03. The company’s main cost, hosting costs per DAU, was 73 cents, 3 cents higher than the previous quarter.Snap’s cost of revenues increased 20.4% to $196.8 million on a year-over-year basis driven by higher cost for Olympic content, redesign related infrastructural cost and hosting cost.Per the company, operating expense (excluding exclude cost of revenue, stock-based compensation, and move to Santa Monica) declined 1% sequentially to $257 million.Snap Inc.

661,WDC,"Microsoft Corp (MSFT  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 26.The company’s cloud computing service — Azure — has been the key catalyst in recent times. In the last quarter, Azure revenues soared 98% at constant currency on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, Azure premium revenues grew triple digits for the 14th consecutive quarter.Adoption remains strong as evident from growing customer base. Azure has been selected by the likes of United Technologies and Columbia Sportswear. Data center expansion also continues with Azure now in 42 regions globally, more than any other cloud provider.Further, the acquisitions of PlayFab and Avere Systems are likely to strengthen Azure’s enterprise-strength capabilities.

The company anticipates another quarter of double-digit revenue growth across server products and cloud services. Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Microsoft Corporation Quote Hence, a strong customer commitment to Azure is expected to drive cloud revenues further, keeping Microsoft unbeatable in this high return segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Intelligent Cloud segment is currently pegged at $7.70 billion, higher than $6.76 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.Robust Office 365 Adoption, LinkedIn Growth Other DriversOffice 365 is a subscription plan to access Office applications and other productivity services utilized in cloud services.

662,WDC,"In value analysis, though price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) are most preferred by investors, the underrated price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. The ratio is used to compare a stock’s market value/price to its book value.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per shareP/B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share. So, if the share price is $10 and book value of equity is $5, investors are ready to pay two times the book value.What is Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:PCM, Inc.

665,WDC,"Tech stocks have been feeling the heat for quite a while now with all major players taking a beating. The latest prediction by Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) that iPhone sales will soften in the June quarter has further taken its toll on tech stocks. Last week, chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM  -  Free Report) came up with a weak financial outlook, which also had a domino effect on the entire technology sector, especially on semiconductor stocks.Moreover, fears of a trade war with China, which undoubtedly will affect the tech companies the most, saw tech stocks plummeting. Tech stocks have been suffering since the beginning of March with Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) leading the rout after it was accused of a data breach. Worries further escalated after President Donald Trump took to Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) to bash Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) about its business policies.However, tech stocks literally drove the markets in 2017 and also this year till February. Also, there’s high optimism around an exceptional earnings season from tech stocks. Moreover, the fundamentals which powered the ascent of tech stocks remain firmly in place. This is why it makes good sense to buy sector plays on the dip ahead of their next rebound.Low iPhone Sales Prediction, TSM’s Weak Outlook Add to WorriesTech stocks have been bleeding for quite some time now. Shares of all major tech companies have taken a hit over the last one-and-a-half month. And if this wasn’t enough Morgan Stanley last week predicted that iPhone sales will soften in the June quarter. This saw not only shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) trending down but other tech giants suffering too. Apple’s shares have declines 7.4% in the last five days.The week sales projection of iPhone follows a bleak financial outlook provided by Taiwan Semiconductor, the world’s largest contract chipmaker. The company stated that its second-quarter 2018 revenues are likely to fall in the range of $7.8-$7.9 billion, lagging the consensus estimate of $8.5 billion. Consequently, shares of Taiwan Semiconductor declined 5.6%.The weak outlook took a toll on the entire tech sector, especially on the semiconductor stocks such as Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report). Given that Taiwan Semiconductor is the largest chipset supplier to both Apple and NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), shares of these too companies plummeted.Facebook, Amazon, Trade Fears Hit Tech StocksDespite having a brilliant run in 2017 and early this year, tech stocks started feeling the heat since the beginning of March. The initial fears were sparked after Trump announced tariffs on a wide range of products imported from China. This spread panic among investors which further escalated once China imposed retaliatory tariffs, igniting fears of a trade war. The tech sector will be one of the worst victims if a trade war happens. This dented the confidence of investors with shares of most tech companies sliding.Moreover, Facebook, which got embroiled in a data misuse scandal that affected the personal data of more than 80 million users, did its share of damage to the tech stocks. Facebook, which was one of the best performing tech stocks last year saw it market capitalization erase by $100 billion in just a week. Facebook’s data misuse scandal made the entire sector suffer on fears of a regulatory clampdown.And to add to the woes followed Trump’s series of tweets bashing Amazon for its tax treatment. Trump has time and again lashed out at Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos saying that the United States Postal Service (USPS) is losing billions of dollars every year by charging the likes of Amazon and others a pittance to deliver their packages. This once again saw the company’s shares suffering a blow.Our ChoicesGiven the bad phase for the tech stocks, investor concerns are only natural. However, this sector has been driving the markets this year and was one of the significant beneficiaries of a roaring rally last year.Moreover, trade war fears too somewhat seem to have eased for the time being. Also, the earning season is off to a strong start and there is huge optimism around tech stocks putting up a stellar show this time around like the last many.Given this scenario, it will not be too ambitious to expect a rebound in the near term. It does make sense now to buy value stocks from the technology space that could prove to be lucrative finds, going forward.

The latest offering called Shopify Ping will be of extremely convenient to customers as the demand for mobile internet continues to rise.The launch of Shopify Ping has made it easier for merchants to process payments, ship products along with securing financing through messaging for their working capital needs. The idea is to combine and collect messages, emails and other useful data used to interact with users via social media and bring them together in one single interface.

We also believe that the company’s strong partner referral system will boost merchant base, eventually driving top-line growth in 2018.Merchant Solutions revenues soared 75% to $114.1 million in the last reported quarter, driven primarily by growth in Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”) which surged 64% from the year-ago quarter to $8.0 billion.

Per market research firm comScore, during 2017 holiday season (Nov-Dec), mobile commerce grew 44% from the year-ago period, with $17.1 billion spent through smartphones and tablets. Per eMarketer, M-commerce sales are projected to grow 32.7% in 2018.

Also, China’s ability to act against U.S. tech companies may be limited by its efforts to build its own tech industry.Investors also remain hopeful that negotiations can reduce the impact of tariffs.  Germany’s decision to do away with car tariffs is an example of how trade disputes can be settled amicably. With the economy in fine fettle and no signs of a bubble in sight, investing in tech stocks still looks like a profitable option. Tech Stocks Surge Higher, Germany Dials Down TensionsThe Nasdaq gained 0.7% on Jun 20 to hit a new all-time high, boosted primarily by Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) which also hit record levels. Shares of Facebook and Netflix gained 2.3% and 2.9%, respectively.Netflix’s surge was attributable to Disney’s revised offer for Fox’s entertainment business. Subsequently, other media majors like Netflix and Viacom, Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) gained with investors speculating that more such deals are around the corner.Meanwhile, heads of BMW (BAMXF  -  Free Report), Volkswagen (VLKAY  -  Free Report) and Daimler (DDAIF  -  Free Report) met the U.S. ambassador to Germany, according to The Wall Street Journal. During the meeting, they floated the idea of abolishing car tariffs between the United States and the EU. This development has dialed down trade tensions and indicates that negotiations could reduce the impact of tariffs.Can Tech Stocks Withstand Tariff Shocks?Investors increasingly feel that tech stocks are not as susceptible to tariffs as say home appliance markets or industrial companies. According to Sameer Samana, a strategist at Wells Fargo’s (WFC  -  Free Report) Investment Institute, losses suffered by U.S. markets due to trade tensions are largely temporary. Ultimately, investors choose to focus on the strong performance of the domestic and global economies.Samana stresses that tech companies have been the leading gainers during market recoveries from losses attributable to trade-related issues. This is primarily because of their strong earnings performances. Further, China’ ability to impose tariffs on U.S. tech companies may be limited even as its attempts to build up its own tech industry.Our ChoicesTech stocks have chalked up strong gains despite the persistence of trade tensions. Investors feel that technology may be not be as vulnerable to tariffs as other sectors, such as industrials. Further, China may not be able to raise tariffs on tech companies beyond a point as its attempts to develop its own tech sector.Investing in tech stocks, which make up the Nasdaq, looks like a smart option at this time.

670,WDC,"If you are still holding on to shares of Cirrus Logic, Inc. (CRUS  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it is time you dump those as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak.Similar to wise buying decisions, offloading certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Cirrus Logic has witnessed a significant price decline in the past year, and negative earnings estimate revisions for the current fiscal. Further, the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) reflects its innate weakness.Notably, the stock has lost 37.9% of its value in the past year, substantially underperforming the 15.8% rally of its industry it belongs to.Soft Smartphone Demand: A Major HeadwindSluggish demand in the overall smartphone market has been hurting the company since quite some time. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s revenues decreased 7.5% on a year-over-year basis to $303.2 million.Portable audio product revenues (86.7% of the total revenues) declined 9.6% from the year-ago period.Management is a bit conservative about visibility as the markets to which Cirrus Logic caters to are maturing, thereby recording decelerating growth.Overdependence on Apple DetrimentalReportedly, the company generates approximately 82% of its revenues by selling audio chips that are used in Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone devices. This is a major negative for Cirrus Logic.Apple’s iPhone X demand has not been as expected, per various reports. Consequently, according to Nikkei, which was quoted by The Inquirer, Apple slashed its production target from what was projected at the time of iPhone X release. This cut in production target remains an overhang on Cirrus Logic’s financials.Additionally, Apple’s recent announcement of being self-reliant and forming a closed ecosystem of semiconductor solutions with in-house production is a further threat for Cirrus Logic.To ConcludeDampened smartphone demand and increased reliance on Apple do not bode well for the near-term performance of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock.This is proven by the top-line guidance provided by the company for first-quarter fiscal 2019. The company expects revenues in the range of $210–$250 million (mid-point $230 million), down around 28% on a year-over-year basis.Hence, it will be a wise decision on investors’ part to remove this stock from their portfolio for now.Key PicksSome top-ranked technology stocks include NVIDIA Corp.

672,WDC,"In a matter of just a few years, “the Cloud” has evolved from a budding new tech feature to one of the main factors driving growth in the technology sector. Cloud computing is now an essential focus for software-related companies, and cloud stocks have piqued the interest of many tech-focused investors.New technologies and changing consumer behavior have changed the shape of the technology landscape, and an industry that was once centered on the personal computer has adapted to survive in the world of mobile computing and the Cloud. The markets have been paying attention, and some of the best tech stocks have been those that are either primarily cloud-based companies, or those that have shown growth in their cloud operations.With this in mind, we’ve highlighted three stocks that are not only showing strong cloud-related activity, but also strong fundamental metrics. Check out these three cloud stocks to buy right now:1. Workday, Inc. (WDAY  -  Free Report)Workday designs enterprise cloud applications for human resources and finance. It provides its customers—which fall in the tech, financial services, business services, healthcare, retail, and other industries—with the tools to manage critical business functions using industry-leading cloud solutions.WDAY is holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is certainly an explosive growth pick. Based on current analyst estimates, we expect Workday to report EPS growth of 23% and revenue growth of 26% this fiscal year. Its valuation is stretched, but the stock also looks interesting from an earnings momentum perspective, having added 37% to its full-year EPS estimates within the past quarter. This means analyst sentiment has remained positive recently. 2. Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report)Adobe Systems is a provider of graphic design, publishing, and imaging software for Web and print production. The company’s main offering is its “Creative Cloud,” which is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) product that allows users to access all of Adobe’s tools at one monthly price. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Buy).ADBE has been on an absolute tear lately, surging more than 70% in the past year. Interestingly enough, however, the stock sold off a bit after its latest earnings beat, giving investors a unique opportunity to buy as it continues to rebound.Shares are now trading at their lowest forward earnings multiple in a year. Plus, the company has plenty of expansion opportunity left. Earnings growth is expected to reach 53.6% in the current fiscal year, and Adobe is projected to see a long-term annualized EPS growth rate of more than 16% in the coming years. 3. Progress Software Corporation (PRGS  -  Free Report)Progress develops software and cloud-based products that assist clients with application deployment, application management, data connectivity, web content management, and predictive analytics. The company has shifted its focus to cloud computing and is looking to expand its cloud subscription offerings. Currently, PRGS is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In its recently-reported quarter, the firm surpassed earnings estimates for the seventh-consecutive period, inspiring some positive estimate revisions for upcoming quarters. This is a stock to love based on its earnings growth, with consensus estimates calling for EPS expansion of 21% this quarter and 31% for the full fiscal year. But shares are also trading at an attractive 15.3x forward 12-month earnings. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

674,WDC,"Value investing offers an opportunity to enter the market and grab stocks that have otherwise been overlooked by the majority of investors and are thus trading at cheap multiples.Though price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying bargain stocks with high-growth prospects.  The P/B ratio compares the market and book value of the company.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityWhat is Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. The higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median:A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median:The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1:PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are six of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:PCM, Inc.

However, for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the company expects to witness solid momentum in room-night growth in all key regions.

HomeAway room nights stayed rose 30% from the prior-year quarter. HomeAway conversion rates are strong and have been increasing year over year.

686,WDC,"Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) recently launched five new 5G products. The enhanced 5G infrastructure solutions portfolio now comprises two new integrated front end modules (FEMs) — QPB9329 & QPB9319 — and a wideband driver amplifier — QPA9120. The other two new 2-stage power amplifiers are QPA4501 & QPA3506.The small-sized, highly integrated and efficient new FEMs support frequency bands ranging from 3GHz (gigahertz) to 39GHz. The FEMs can function on both pre-5G and 5G architecture. Qorvo’s gallium nitride (GaN) technology has enabled it to support the emerging 5G infrastructure.The company is demonstrating its advanced RF portfolio at IMS from Jun 12-15.Per an EJL research report, shipments for massive MIMO driving radio transceivers are envisioned to reach 500 million units by 2022. Per Qorvo estimates, the market for massive MIMO base station is projected to yield $1 billion by 2022 in RF solutions. The company’s expanding RF product portfolio pertaining to 5G and massive MIMO base stations bodes well in the long haul.Prior to this launch, Qorvo had announced two other amplifiers, namely QPF4005 and QPF4006, which it claims to be industry’s first GaN FEMs for 39GHz. In the previous quarter, the company had launched the industry's first 28 GHz GaN on silicon carbide (SiC) FEM for base stations. Notably, the 28GHz product supported the demonstration of Samsung 5G MIMO at the 2018 Winter Olympics.The company has participated in dozens of 5G field trials and demonstrations. We believe an expanding portfolio enabling 5G deployment augurs well for the company.Shares of Qorvo have returned 21.3% year to date outperforming the industry’s rally of 6.4%.New GaN FEMs for Defense ApplicationsIn a separate press release, Qorvo announced that it has launched two new X-band FEMs that find ample application in active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. The two GaN FEMs, namely QPM2637 and QPM1002 are very compact and EAR99 export-compliant. The products address the requirement for high RF power survivability crucial for mission-critical defense operations.The GaN FEMs comprise power amplifier, low noise amplifier, an RF switch and limiter in a single package. It can endure up to 4W of input power on the receive side. The products are under sampling to eligible customers.Per Strategy Analytics data, as revealed in the press release, the demand for RF front end components pertaining to radar applications is projected to surpass $1 billion by 2022, implying a CAGR of 9% over the next five years. The RF GaN devices market for defense applications is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24% over the next five years due to the impressive adoption rate of GaN which is likely to outpace other technology variants.Moreover, according to a MarketsandMarkets report, the GaN power device market is projected to grow at CAGR of 29.1% to reach $1.89 billion by 2023. The base year 2017 valuation was $0.408 billion and the time period under consideration is 2017-2023.Introduction of the new products strengthens Qorvo’s GaN portfolio and provides it a competitive edge, in the relevant market. The company is capitalizing on the lucrative prospects in defense by rendering effective GaN solutions.To ConcludeExpanding portfolio bodes well for Qorvo. The company’s 5G and GaN solutions hold promise. The company is well poised to seize growth opportunities that the corresponding markets offer.However, customer concentration, particularly from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Huawei remains a significant headwind for Qorvo.Zacks Rank & Key PicksQorvo has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc.

687,WDC,"NETGEAR (NTGR  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25. The company beat the Zack Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 10.18%.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 59 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents but declined 22.4% year over year. Revenues of $397 million missed the consensus mark of $401 million but rose almost 7.9% from the year-ago quarter.For first-quarter 2018, NETGEAR projects revenues between $330 million and $345 million. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected in the range of 6.5-7.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNETGEAR’s strong product portfolio is a key growth driver. The company’s Arlo home security products and Orbi WiFI systems continue to boost its top line.In the fourth quarter, the company rolled out new services across all three business segments, which are expected to drive results this quarter.NETGEAR expanded its Nighthawk offerings by introducing Nighthawk Pro Gaming Router and Nighthawk Pro Gaming Switch in order to cater to the high-end gaming market. This is expected to boost its Connected Home segment.  Moreover, the company partnered with Circle Media to bring Circle with Disney parental controls across the Nighthawk and Orbi WiFi routers and systems.It remains to be seen whether the company’s newly launched subscription offerings, Insight Basic for $4.99 per month and Insight Premium for $9.99 per month, can benefit its SMB segment.NETGEAR’s strengthening foothold in the North American market and improving penetration in the EMEA region is a positive.However, the service provider business continues to pose challenges with the company streamlining the segment.Also, expenses are on the rise due to the increase in headcount owing to the proposed separation of NETGEAR and its Arlo business, which remain an overhang on the bottom line.Further, declining revenues in the APAC region is also a concern.NETGEAR, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise NETGEAR, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | NETGEAR, Inc. QuoteWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

688,WDC,"Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 26. The company has witnessed a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous four reports. In fact, in each of the trailing four quarters, Western Digital surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%.Due to expansion in digital data, modest growth of TAM and higher demand for storage, Western Digital’s prospects look bright. Additionally, the company’s expanding product portfolio, secular growth of digital data, growing exposure to the SMB space and positive synergies derived from the SanDisk acquisition are likely to act as catalysts for Q3 results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Western Digital is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Western Digital flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1 and has an Earnings ESP of 2.30%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third-quarter earnings is pegged at $3.27, indicating an increase of 36.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up by a penny over the past seven days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $4.93 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter. Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Western Digital Corporation Quote What’s Behind This Overwhelming Expectation?Western Digital has been expanding in the SSD storage market, bothered by the declining sales in the PC market. The emergence of thinner laptops, tablets and demand for fast processing storage devices over the past few years has created an ideal market for SSDs.Over the last few months, the company rolled out the world’s smallest 1 TB USB flash drive, voice activated media streaming via home devices, and a new series of high performance SSDs. With the rising need to capture and share rich content, lens technology and video streaming are becoming more immersive.For photographers and drone enthusiasts, the company also released My Passport Wireless SSD and SanDisk Extreme portable SSD. These devices feature a one-touch card copy that enables quick editing, as well as third-party app integration.Western Digital also unveiled the My Cloud Home device that displays new voice-activated media streaming features through smart-home devices.These product additions will enhance the company’s existing product portfolio and aid Western Digital in gaining a strong foothold in the global SSD market, which, per the latest data by TechNavio, is expected to witness CAGR of 17% during 2016-2020.Anticipating a potential acceleration in cloud deployments, Western Digital is also investing heavily to deliver high-capacity storage devices which will support expansion of cloud infrastructure and cloud applications.The company has expanded its My Cloud solutions with My Cloud EX4, a broader portfolio of network attached storage (NAS) hard drives. My Cloud EX4 will help the company meet growing business needs, with improved flexibility and security, consequently boosting its top line.The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is another tailwind. Further, the company’s expanding footprint in the automotive, as well as the connected home and industrial categories are likely to act as another key catalyst.Furthermore, Western Digital’s acquisition of SanDisk has aided the company’s growth and helped it gain traction in SSD.  Additionally, it has enabled the company to step into the NAND products market which, owing to its strong demand, will drive revenues.Moreover, the company’s acquisitions of Amplidata, sTec, Inc., Velobit, Inc. Arkeia Software Solutions and Virident Systems Inc. have not only strengthened its small-to-medium sized business solutions but also expanded its SSD product portfolio as well.Some Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Xilinx, Inc.

689,WDC,"Xilinx Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 25. Notably, the stock has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 9% in the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, the company came up with a positive earnings surprise of 20.6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 68 cents per share, indicating a 19.3% increase on a year-over-year basis. Revenues are estimated to be around $649.54 million, indicating a 6.6% increase from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderThe increasing demand for Xilinx’s high-performance, high-density programmable logic devices will prove to be beneficial for the company’s top line. We believe that Xilinx is well positioned to tap the opportunities arising from an increase in adoption of AI technologies, 5G connectivity, autonomous vehicles and IoTs.Notably, Xilinx’s ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping the company gain market share. Its expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is assisting it to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).During the soon-to-be-reported quarter, Xilinx unveiled “automotive qualified Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC family”, aimed at assisting the development of safe advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving systems.The company also partnered with Barefoot Networks in the fourth quarter for the development of solutions that will monitor the performance of an end-to-end network, targeting 5G networks.Notably, the fourth-quarter results will be the first after a change in leadership, with Moshe Gavrielov announcing his retirement and Victor Peng taking over as the CEO of the company.Xilinx, Inc.

690,WDC,"Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25. The question lingering on investors’ minds is whether this provider of information technology (IT) security solutions can deliver a positive surprise.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.6%. Notably, Check Point Software has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 3.6%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Drive ResultsCheck Point continues to gain from strong demand for its cyber security solutions. Rapid adoption of Check Point’s data-center appliances and continued enhancement in data-center product lines are anticipated to provide adequate support to revenue growth.Notably, during the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the company unveiled three new types of “Smart-1 security management appliances” meant for Gen V (5th generation) cyber protection. Check Point also announced the “CloudGuard product family” targeting Gen V cyber threats.Additionally, the company collaborated with Orange Cyberdefense. Per the agreement, Check Point Sandblast Mobile technology will be used for the development of Orange Mobile Threat Protection.However, ongoing issues related to the changes it made in its U.S. sales force makes us skeptical about the company’s near-term performance. Per management, its fourth-quarter revenues were hurt by significant changes made in U.S. sales force that has not yet reached full potential. This might continue to affect financials for some time now.Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.

691,WDC,"U.S. stock markets have remained highly volatile so far in April. After a fabulous run throughout 2017, market fluctuations commenced in February and have only intensified as the year has progressed. A series of political issues, escalated by protectionist policies of President Trump, have taken a toll on the stock markets.However, a closer look of the major indexes’ performances provides a silver lining. All the major indexes – Dow 30, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite – provided positive returns of 4%, 3.2% and 2.2%, respectively in the last one month. Both Dow 30 and S&P 500 are trading in the green with a return of 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively, so far in April. Only Nasdaq is in negative territory with a loss of a marginal 0.1%.  The abovementioned data is clear indication of the transitory nature of volatility plaguing the stock market. In fact, tech-heavy Nasdaq is likely to return to the positive once the tech behemoths start releasing their first-quarter earnings results. At this stage, investors will be better-off picking great value stocks to stabilize their portfolio returns.Strong Economic FundamentalsU.S. economy is on a strong footing as evidenced from several recently released macro-data. In the first quarter of 2018, the labor market added 202,000 jobs on an average per month, better than the comparable period of previous two years. The ISM index for national factory activity was recorded at 59.3 in March. Notably, a reading of more than 50 indicates that the sector is expanding. This reflects that the U.S. heavy industrial sector is forging ahead with a strong momentum.  On Apr 16, the U.S. Commerce Department reported retail sales growth of 0.6% for the month of March reversing the trend of decline in last three consecutive months. On Apr 17, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s measure for industrial production rose 0.5% in March. Moreover, capacity utilization rose 0.3% in March to reach 78.0. Notably, this March reading is the highest level in three years.Robust Earnings MomentumFirst-quarter earnings results have been exhibiting strong momentum so far. In fact, investors have pinned high hopes on first-quarter 2018 earnings. Total earnings of the S&P 500 index is expected to be up 18.3% from the same period last year backed by 7.7% year-over-year growth in revenues. (Read More: Positive Revenue Surprises Lag Previous Quarter Levels)A big driver of these positive revisions is obviously the direct impact of the tax cuts. The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35% to 21%. Moreover, repatriation of income will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%.Three Factors May Create Immediate TurmoilDespite above mentioned positives, market volatility is likely to escalate due to three persisting factors.First, any escalation of tariff related issues between the United States and China or any other country will reignite the fear of global trade war. The U.S. government recently banned the country’s semiconductor giants to sell chipset to Chinese state-owned telecom majors, paving the way for a likely Chinese retaliation.Second, the 10-year Treasury Note yield reached 2.956% on Apr 20, its highest since January 2014. This fueled investor’s fear that inflationary pressure will be more than market expectation compelling the Fed to raise interest rate.The U.S. unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low of 4.1% in March, while workers’ hourly wages rose 8 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.82. Moreover, Trump’s tariffs will raise general price levels. Both wage pressure and price pressure may bring back the fear of inflationary situation.Third, investors have pinned high hopes on first-quarter 2018 earnings. These massive expectations may result into short-term market volatility. High investors’ expectation may result in lofty valuations of the U.S. stock market, which, if they fail to fructify may backfire.Our Top PicksThe U.S. markets remain volatile so far in 2018. Trade related concerns, lower-than-expected earnings results and return of inflationary pressure will certainly cause more fluctuations at least in the short-term.At this juncture, it will be a prudent decision to buy value stocks on the dip that could prove to be valuable finds once the rally resumes.

In fact, the segment recorded a new all-time high with revenues of more than $5 billion for the first time in a quarter.Total revenues from wearables increased almost 70% year over year. Notably, it was the second largest contributor to Apple’s revenue growth after the iPhone.Per NPD’s latest Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker report, Apple was the leading player in the wearables market in 2017, courtesy of Apple Watch.Moreover, the growing popularity of Apple Watch among teenagers is evident from the recently released Piper Jaffray’s Taking Stock with Teens survey.Per the survey, Apple Watch is currently the most preferred smartwatch among teens. Reportedly, out of 20% respondents who own a smartwatch, 15% own the device, up from 12% in the fall 2017 survey. Samsung Gear stands second with merely 2% respondents.Apple Inc.

QuoteServices in Top Gear    Apple’s Services segment — comprising revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services — registered 18% improvement year over year in the last reported quarter.Apple Music is a key driver with 48 million subscribers. In February, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple Music's growth rate in the United States is more than double of arch rival, Spotify.

693,WDC,"On Apr 28, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released the first advanced estimate of the first-quarter 2018 U.S. GDP growth rate. While the U.S. economy fared better than the first-quarter consensus, the growth rate was significantly lower than the last nine months of 2017. Lackluster consumer spending, which constitutes nearly 70% of the U.S, GDP, was the primary reason for slowdown in first-quarter 2018 GDP.Considering recent history, U.S. GDP growth rate remains weakest in the first quarter of any year. Despite weak GDP growth, personal disposable income and private domestic investment have increased significantly in the first quarter. Moreover, full effect of massive reduction on both personal and corporate tax rate are yet to be derived as people received those benefits only in January.The above mentioned positives are likely to push the U.S. economy on a strong growth trajectory in the second quarter and there on. At this stage, investing in good value stocks with favorable Zacks Ranks is a lucrative option.First-Quarter GDP DeclinesPer the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. GDP expanded at 2.3% in first-quarter 2018, better-than the consensus estimate of 2%. However, this rate of growth is significantly lower than the average GDP growth rate of 2.9% in the last three quarters of 2017 and well below President Trump’s targeted GDP growth rate of 3%.Personal consumer spending grew at 1.1% in first-quarter 2018. This was the slowest pace of growth experienced in nearly five years and significantly below the fourth-quarter 2017 pace of 4%.Moreover, business spending on equipment slowed to 4.7% following double-digit growth in the second half of 2017. Further, investments in homebuilding have declined in the first quarter after rebounding in the fourth quarter of 2017. Government spending has also dipped after witnessing growth in the last two straight quarters.Economy Likely to Bounce Back in Q2The first quarter GDP estimate generally remains weak due to seasonality. First-quarter U.S. GDP tends to be soft because of a seasonal quirk. Consequently, the BEA’s tepid first-quarter growth outlook may not be a true reflection of the U.S. economy.The full benefit of massive personal and corporate tax cut is yet to be realized. The $1.5 trillion tax cut measures is yet to be reflected as it has implemented only in January 2018.Moreover, U.S. private-sector workers experienced their highest increase in income in 11 years during the first three months of 2018. The latest Labor Department data revealed that employment cost index for wages and salaries in the private sector rose 1% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. Notably, this was the biggest gain since the first quarter of 2007.Meanwhile, disposable personal income has increased 6.2% in the first quarter compared with 3.8% in the previous quarter. More wealth, in the hands of consumers will likely bolster personal spending going forward.Our Top Picks The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong despite a slowdown in the GDP growth rate. A healthy labor market, strong hike in wages and salaries, increase in personal disposable income and proposed fiscal stimulus by the government will bolster consumer’s income and spending in the rest of the year.At this juncture, it will be a prudent decision to buy value stocks on the dip that could prove to be valuable finds once the rally resumes.

694,WDC,"Viacom Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 31, 2018), wherein both earnings per share and revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company’s adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 92 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. Moreover, the bottom line expanded approximately 16.5% year-over-year.Total revenues of $3.15 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 billion. However, revenues decreased 3% from the year-ago quarter owing to lower revenues from Filmed Entertainment due to “fewer theatrical releases and the performance of Paramount's legacy slate.” This dampened growth of the Media Networks segment.Quarterly adjusted operating income increased 4.7% year over year to $641 million. Viacom exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $417 million, compared with $394 million at the end of the previous quarter.Moreover, Viacom’s debt (non-current) at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $10.1 billion, at the same level as the prior quarter.Viacom Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Viacom Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Viacom Inc. QuoteSegmental PerformanceMedia NetworksQuarterly revenues for the company’s Media networks segment were $2.43 billion, up 1% year over year. The decline in domestic revenues was offset by strong growth internationally.While domestic revenues were down 3% to $1.86 billion, international revenues surged 18% to $566 million. Foreign currency movements aided segmental results to the tune of 9%.The segment generates revenues principally from three sources: (i) affiliate revenues (ii) advertising revenues; and (iii) ancillary revenues.Total affiliate revenues remained flat at $1.16 billion. On the domestic front, the metric was down 4% to $934 million. Nevertheless, international affiliate revenues increased 23% to $222 million.Total advertising revenues were $1.11 billion, flat year over year. The 11% surge in international advertising revenues to $264 million was offset by 3% decrease in domestic advertising revenues to $841 million.Ancillary revenues increased 30% to $168 million in the quarter on the back of “consumer product, recreation and live event revenues.”Quarterly operating income (on an adjusted basis) declined 5% to $706 million in the reported quarter, owing to higher expenses.Filmed EntertainmentQuarterly revenues declined 17% year over year to $741 million due to weaknesses in three sub-groups.Notably, licensing revenues increased 37% year over year to $477 million backed by the release of “The Cloverfield Paradox” and Paramount Television product, including “The Alienist.”However, theatrical revenues were down 79%. Ancillary and home entertainment revenues declined 54% and 18%, respectively, in the reported quarter.This segment’s adjusted operating income was $9 million in the quarter against loss of $66 million in the year-ago quarter. Decline in distribution expenses owing to lower number of theatrical releases helped the company in posting the encouraging number.ConclusionManagement is optimistic about double-digit revenue growth internationally with “new channel launches and innovative mobile distribution deals” across Europe and Asia. The increase in audience for the flagship brands is another positive.The operational efficiency of the company is reflected in its cost savings, which is anticipated to be around $100 million in fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019 and beyond, management expects “over $300 million in run-rate savings.”Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderViacom carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

695,WDC,"The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is by far the most widely used metric in value investing given its apparent simplicity. The idea of hunting stocks with a low P/E is ingrained in the minds of many investors. However, even this ubiquitously used equity valuation multiple is not devoid of limitations.What Makes EV/EBITDA a Better Choice?While P/E enjoys great popularity, a less-used and more-complicated metric called EV/EBITDA gains an upper hand as it offers a clearer picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential. EV/EBITDA, also known as the enterprise multiple, has a more complete approach to valuation as it determines a firm’s total value. P/E, on the other hand, considers only its equity portion.EV/EBITDA is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. Simply put, it is the total value of a firm.EBITDA, the other constituent, gives the true picture of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Generally, the lower the EV/EBITDA ratio, the more attractive it is. A low EV/EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued.   However, unlike P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet. For this reason, EV/EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets. Stocks with a low EV/EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates.Moreover, P/E can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A firm’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV/EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are EBITDA-positive.EV/EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of companies that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, the ratio allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels.Then again, EV/EBITDA has its flaws too. It varies across industries (a high-growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa) and is typically not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.As such, a strategy solely based on EV/EBITDA might not fetch the desired outcome. But you can combine it with the other key ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen value stocks. Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks:EV/EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV/EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 12 stocks that passed the screen:United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) is a leading wholesale distributor to the natural, organic and specialty industry in the United States and Canada.

696,WDC,"Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) recently introduced new Purple drive tailor made for futuristic surveillance cameras. The drives are available in 10 GB and 12 GB variants for $399 and $479, respectively.Robust adoption of dynamic and complex data-centric applications, including surveillance cameras, require a 24/7 video capture resulting in a demand of data storage architecture that supports the immense workload. The next generation cameras leverage Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) which assists surveillance by reducing false alerts, identifying true threats and enabling better detection.Notably, modern analytics is increasingly leveraging video recordings to help businesses unlock effective and meaningful insights. These insights in turn will aid the businesses in realizing their goals. One such instance of utilization is retailers analyzing shopping behavior via video facial recognition.Western Digital’s new drive meets this demand effectively by supporting an“AllFrame” AI technology.Notably, shares of Western Digital have declined 9.7% of its value in the past year, against the industry’s rally of 29.2%.FeaturesThe high capacity drives support digital video recorder (“DVR”) and network video recorder (“NVR”) systems with AI-driven capabilities, ensuring a smooth and modern surveillance-class recording.The AllFrame AI technology enables the new drives to support 16 AI channels per 32 AI streams. Western Digital claims that it is the only product in the market to support these many channels.The new drive enables smooth capture of videos for the next-generation AI enabled cameras. The aforementioned features ensure real-time data capture and storage in next generation formats of video surveillance.With the innovative features of the new Purple drive launch, we expect the company to reinforce its market position against the likes of Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report).Analyzing the Prospects of the New DrivesThe drive is an effective addition to company’s surveillance portfolio. The company’s Purple micro-SD card, Purple Surveillance HDD, and the Ultrastar HDD series are already aiding surveillance.Per IDC data, exabytes produced by surveillance solutions are projected to grow by 25% through 2021. Additionally, per a MarketsandMarkets report, “Video Surveillance Storage Market” is projected to grow at a CAGR of 22.41% from 2015 to 2020 to reach $18.28 billion.Furthermore, per an Orbis Research report, as revealed by Reuters, the global video surveillance market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18.3% from 2017 to 2022 to reach $63.2 billion. The market valuation in 2015 was $19.51 billion.Per an IHS Markit report, all newly installed video surveillance cameras in 2015 generated 566 petabytes data globally, in one day. The corresponding data is projected to grow over 2,500 petabytes by 2019, on a daily basis.The aforementioned reports strengthen the prospects of investment opportunities in the new drive designed for advance video surveillance.To ConcludeWestern Digital is making continuous efforts to ensure its products deliver high quality storage solutions across all emerging data-driven technologies. We believe this ongoing expansion of the company’s product portfolio bodes well for the top line.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderWestern Digital sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A couple of other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), both currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1.

697,WDC,"In the Global Week Ahead, it is peak U.S. earnings season.Watch the latest quarterly FAANG tech earning reports (and chipmaker Intel) the closest. However, bond rates will remain central to stock markets this week. A break above 3.0% in the risk-free U.S. 10-year Treasury interest rate could be more significant to major stock indexes than the coming raft of company reports. One would think (superficially) that this Q1 earnings season would get us over the worry about rates— EPS growth stands at +18.3% this quarter, the highest since Q1-2011. Three S&P 500 sectors have reported their highest net profit margins since tracking began in Q3-2008. That would be Financials (17.7%), Health Care (10.7%) and Materials (11.3%). Revenue growth at +7.6% is excellent. But it has been the opposite. Positive Q1 company earnings and revenue fundamentals cause the long-term U.S rate to move higher. What’s the compelling trading idea? The Fed will have to move sooner and more aggressively, to stem the U.S. economy’s overheating. Here is my rank-order of the five key events for traders -- (1) Earnings reports from 178 S&P 500 firms arrive, with a noted arrival of key large-cap Tech quarterly reports. Names include Alphabet, Whirlpool, Xerox, Coca-Cola, 3M, Caterpillar, Lockheed Martin, Visa, AT&T, Facebook, eBay, Ford, Pepsi, Time Warner, UPS, GM, Intel, Amazon, Microsoft and Starbucks. Investor interest is running high on the FAANG stocks. Facebook reports on Wednesday. Alphabet (Google) and Amazon post their results on Monday and Thursday, respectively. (2) The Energy sector is top-of-mind for equity traders right now. European oil majors Shell, Total, Statoil and Eni, and U.S. oil producers Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhilips, report this week. Crude’s surge to 2014 highs is a boon to these oil companies’ bottom line. This is supporting the oil major’s share prices. But it could also be approaching the point where it starts amplifying inflation. (3) On Thursday, the latest European Central Bank (ECB) meeting ends. Reuter’s reported economists anticipate ECB steps towards winding down QE will come only in June or later. But ECB President Mario Draghi will be pressed on what he thinks about the European economic softness, a possible U.S. China trade war, and the strong euro. In trade-weighted terms, the euro remains less than one percent below a 3-1/2 year high hit on March 8, the last time the ECB met. (4) Japan’s central bank (the BoJ) also meets on Thursday and Friday. Its governor, Haruhiko Kuroda -- the man behind the monetary stimulus -- was reappointed this year. He would survive an Abe exit, as the prime minister is struggling in the polls at the moment. No policy change is expected. The BOJ’s forecasts on inflation will be crucial; sources say it will maintain its view on hitting the target in 2019. If Kuroda reassures markets the BOJ is nowhere near an exit from ultra-loose monetary policies, investors should stay unruffled by the doubts about Abe’s political future. (5) According to Scotia Bank in Canada, there is unlikely to be a major NAFTA development over the coming week.If anything arises, pay particular attention to progress — or lack thereof — on auto content negotiations. NAFTA guidance — from a named Mexican and from anonymous U.S. officials — points towards momentum for a handshake deal sometime during the first half of May. The timeframe is tightening, given a requirement for the current U.S. Congress to have 6½ months to review the agreement. On Sunday, the first Presidential candidates’ debate in Mexico occurs. The coming Mexican election is Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s to lose. This left-leaning candidate is polling about half of voter support. Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks— Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report): Yes, this is a top Zacks stock right now. The market cap is an incredible $740B but the Value score is F. Zacks price and consensus chart here says this should be a $1,200 stock, not a $1,500 stock. CNOOC (CEO  -  Free Report): This is a big China oil stock, and the only company permitted to conduct exploration and production activities in offshore China areas. The market cap is $74B. The Value score is A. Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report): Yes, this storage stock is still on our top list. The shares hold $27B in market cap. It’s been on our top list for a while, as computer data storage needs continue to get more compelling for the Tech industry. The Value score is A too. Not sure why traders aren’t pushing this stock much higher… Key Global Macro— The big event is the ECB policy meeting on Thursday and the Bank of Japan meeting wrapping on Friday. No policy changes are expected. Guidance on a September policy exit may not materialize… yet. On Friday, we get a first look at U.S. GDP growth. Look for preliminary U.S. Q1 GDP growth of +2.2%. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow call for +2.0% on April 17th comes in lower than the NY Fed’s Nowcast of +2.9% on April 20th and to the St. Louis Fed’s real GDP Nowcast of +3.5%. On Monday, the Eurozone composite PMI index met expectations at 55.2. That’s a solid +2% GDP growth number. 60 is the number that’s needed for +3%. The Eurozone manufacturing PMI came in at expectations at 56.0, ditto the services PMI at 55.0. In comparison, the U.S. manufacturing PMI is looking for 55.6, about the same as Europe. On Tuesday, the German IFO indexes come out. Business Climate should go from 103.2 to 112.0, Current Conditions from 106.5 to 125.0 and Expectations from 100.1 to 104. Not sure on the source of the ebullience, but it might be seasonal. Mexico’s bi-weekly CPI is forecast to fall to 4.74% y/y fro 4.9% y/y. The U.S. Case-Shiller home price index comes out. The prior was 6.4% y/y. On Wednesday, South Korea’s GDP growth rate comes out. Look for +3.1% y/y to go to +2.7%. On Thursday, a European Central Bank (ECB) meeting wraps. The ECB deposit rate should remain at -0.4% and the main refinancing rate at 0.0%. U.S. durable goods orders ex-transportation are forecast to rise +0.2% from a +1.0% lift last month. U.S. weekly initial claims look great at 232K. We get an update. The Japanese unemployment rate is 2.5% and industrial production there should be up +2.0% y/y (that’s strong there), and retail sales up +1.5% y/y.On Friday, Japan’s overnight rate gets a revisit. No re-set here. It stays at -0.1%.France’s GDP growth rate should get to +2.5% y/y.Spain’s GDP growth rate should be +3.1% y/y.The U.K.’s GDP growth should be +1.4% y/y.Germany’s unemployment rate is 5.3%. We get a new number.

698,WDC,"Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26.Notably, the company has a record of positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 14.81%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 25.58%.Last quarter, revenues totaled $17.05 billion, reflecting an increase of 4.1% year over year and 5.6% sequentially. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.31 billion. Notably, the company has beaten the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters.Intel guided first-quarter 2018 revenues of around $15 billion (+/-$500 million), up 5% year over year excluding McAfee. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $15.05 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 1.7%.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 earnings is pegged at 71 cents per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 7.6%. Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Intel Corporation Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIntel’s focus on data center, cloud, self-driving car and Internet of Things (IoT) are key growth drivers for the first quarter. Management expects data-centric part of the business to grow in the mid-teens range, while PC centric to decline in low-single digits.Apart from strong on-going demand for public clouds, the company is also expected to benefit from strength in on-premise and hybrid cloud build-outs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Data Center Group (“DCG”) currently stands at $4.82 billion higher than $4.23 billion in the year-ago quarter.Intel’s data center business and cloud have been registering strong growth in the last few quarters. The company has made significant advancement in this area as well and it is now offering more integrated solutions that are likely to be competitive on a cost per watt basis.The company’s investments in field programmable gate array (FPGA) for acceleration (dramatically increases performances at very low power) and memory to reduce latency and increase speeds are helping it develop custom solutions for big players.Moreover, Intel’s acquisition of MobilEye now enables it to offer almost anything related to self-driving vehicles — cameras, in-car networking, sensor-chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management. The buyout enables the company rapidly penetrate the autonomous car technology market, currently dominated by the likes of NVIDIA.Intel has also been a long-time supplier to Alphabet’s Waymo division. Further, its partnerships with BMW, Nissan, Volkswagen AG, and Ferrari will boost sales of processing chips, sensor-chips, cloud software and many more, are expected to drive top-line growth in the soon-to-be reported quarter.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates.

699,WDC,"Tech stocks have been on a tear this year and Wednesday’s session was no exception with the Nasdaq closing 0.5% higher. Overall, tech stocks have been largely responsible for the long-running market rally. But bubble fears are making a comeback courtesy of a bunch of leading analysts and market watchers.They feel that monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve and the ECB could lead to a sudden selloff. However, others feel that sector fundamentals are firmly in place and valuations are far from worrying. The ability to innovate and generate strong profits make tech stocks must haves for your portfolio.Rate Hikes Raise Bear Market FearsMichael Hartnett, a strategist at Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) Merrill Lynch recently warned that tech stocks have strong downside risks. Hartnett thinks that the strong performance of tech stocks, especially the FAANG group, has led to disconnect between U.S. equity markets and events occurring in other parts of the world. Hartnett thinks that this ""conscious decoupling"" is likely to evaporate in the months ahead as major central banks undertake monetary tightening. The Fed is widely slated to raise rates this week. And record-low employment levels could lead to further rate hikes even at the cost of roiling the equity markets.Meanwhile, the ECB is also likely to begin cutting down on its bond purchases in the next few months. Emerging markets are following suit, with 33 rate hikes in the last nine months. Global monetary tightening would mean an end to easy money for the bourses, raising the risk of “quick, deep tech sell-off,” thinks Hartnett.Strong Fundamentals Still in PlaceIn contrast, analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) have taken a distinctly optimistic view of tech stocks. In a recent paper titled ""Why Technology Is Not a Bubble,"" the investment bank says that the recent success of tech stocks is attributable to strong fundamentals. This is in sharp contrast to the dot-com bubble which built up in the 1990s.Essentially, tech companies are raking in profits and creating industry-wide disruptions in the process. But valuations are not a cause for worry, according to the investment bank’s Peter Oppenheimer.Oppenheimer agrees that the collective market capitalization of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) is greater than the annual GDP of all the 54 African countries taken together.However, such phenomenal valuations are justifiable through strong fundamental growth. Further, valuations as a share of the S&P 500 are below the levels witnessed during earlier market bubbles.Our ChoicesWall Street seems to be having a tough time making up its mind about a tech bubble. A section of analysts believe that a bubble has indeed built up. This is why looming rate hikes could soon roil the markets party, leading to a deep selloff for tech stocks.Others think that such fears are overblown. This is because recent gains are attributable to strong fundamentals. Also, valuations are not worrying and remain below historical bubble-era levels. This is why picking tech stocks still looks like a smart option at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks, each of which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of A.

700,WDC,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) delivered stellar fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings of 99 cents per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. Moreover, revenues of $11.260 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.195 billion.Earnings increased 11.2% from the year-ago quarter. This can primarily be attributed to 2.9% growth in revenues which was toward the higher range of management’s guidance of 1-3%.Structural ChangesThe company has adopted anew Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 606 using full retrospective method.The company had recently launched a bring-your-own-license (BYOL) program which allows customers to move their existing on-premise licenses to the Oracle Cloud. In doing so, Oracle claims that licenses covered by the BYOL program can neither be defined as on-premise nor as cloud.Consequently, the company now reports its new software licenses under its new Cloud license and on-premise license segment. Further, the company merged its Cloud SaaS, Cloud PaaS and IaaS along with its software license updates and product support into Cloud services and license support.Share Price MovementShares of the company went down more than 3% in after-hours trading.  In the past year, the company’s shares have gained just 0.4%, underperforming the industry’s growth of 34.5%.The share price decrease can possibly be attributed to the new accounting standard adopted by the company and the structural changes which it has undergone in the quarter. Oracle no longer intends to break out its cloud revenues and does not provide any guidance on SaaS, Cloud PaaS and IaaS. This move is likely to enhance investor concern about the company's outlook.The share price movement was also impacted by tepid second-quarter earnings guidance, adding to the woes.Cloud Drove Solid Top LineOracle’s top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud services and license support revenues (60% of total revenues) for the quarter advanced 7% (5% in constant currency) to $6.77 billion. We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.Under the previous reporting structure in last quarter, which was called total Cloud revenues were $1.7 billion.However, total cloud license and on-premise license decreased 5.4 to $2.48 billion year over year.Management stated that Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM came in at $2.2 billion in full year 2018. Fusion Apps advanced 62% for the full year, whereas, Fusion ERP was up 68% for the full year. Fusion HCM surged 65%.Further, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is now fully available and is a key catalyst for the company. Management believes that the new database will improve Oracle’s competitive position in the cloud against Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).The company’s tech ecosystem is more than $21 billion and increased 5% for fiscal 2018. Database ecosystems were up 6%. During the quarter, database new license revenues increased 9%.The company also stated that its next-generation PaaS grew 45% for the full year and came in at $1.1 billion.Total hardware revenues were almost flat year over year and came in at $$1.11 billion. Services revenues decreased 1.2% to $883 million.Operating DetailsNon-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, decreased 130 basis points (bps) to 52.9%.As a result, non-GAAP operating income during the quarter came in at $5.3 billion, up 4% from last year non-GAAP operating margin expanded 100 bps from the year-ago quarter to 47%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of May 31, 2018, Oracle had cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities of $67.3 billion, down from $70.45 billion sequentially. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $15.4 billion, while free cash flow was $13.7 billion.Share Repurchases & Dividends ContinueOracle repurchased around 106 million shares worth $5 billion during the quarter. Over the last 12 months, the company repurchased shares worth $11.5 billion and paid dividends of approximately $3.1 billion. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 19 cents per share, payable on Jul 31, 2018.GuidanceFor the first quarter fiscal 2019, total revenues are anticipated to grow in the range of 1-3% in constant currency.Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be between 67 cents and 69 cents for the quarter, while in constant currency non-GAAP earnings is expected to be in the range of 68-70 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 72 cents per share.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Oracle carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the technology sector are NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term earnings estimates for NVIDIA, Western Digital and Seagate are currently pegged at 10.25%, 19% and 18.9%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

701,WDC,"In case you are still holding on to shares of Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it’s high time to get rid of the stock. The odds in favor of an upside in the near term are slim. The company has been witnessing downward revisions and has weak fundamentals. Customer concentration from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is another major concern.Downward Estimate RevisionsAnalysts have become increasingly bearish on the stock in the past couple of months with all estimates moving south and no movement in the opposite direction for the ongoing quarter.Moreover, the company’s first quarter of fiscal 2019 earnings estimates moved down from 80 cents to 76 cents in the past 30 days. Further, in the same time period, the company’s fiscal 2019 earnings estimates moved down from $5.97 to $5.92.Low ReturnGiven the other unattractive attributes like low return on equity (ROE), low return on capital (ROC) and low return on assets (ROA), makes the stock look very unappealing. Qorvo currently trades at a ROE of 13.8%, much lower than the industry’s average of 22.8%. Notably, the company has an ROC and ROA of 10.3% and 10.4% compared with the industry’s average of 20.8% and 18.5%, respectively.ValuationWe note that the Qorvo currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 18.53. This level compares unfavorably with what the industry has witnessed over the last year. The ratio is higher than the average level of 17.86 and is toward its higher end of the valuation range over this period. Consequently, valuation looks slightly stretched from a P/E perspective.Dependence on iPhone SalesQorvo depends on a handful of customers including Apple and Huawei to keep its revenues churning. To add to the woes, Apple’s self reliance strategy is a looming threat. Moreover, the company operates in a competitive landscape that is becoming more complex with low barriers to entry. The increased competition is exerting pricing pressure, which remains a matter of concern for the company.Qorvo’s top-line growth is significantly dependent on iPhone’s growth trajectory. We also note that Qorvo’s share price movement depends heavily on Apple’s results, which doesn’t bode well for the investors.Near-Term Apprehensions Likely to ContinueIn order to sustain its market position, Qorvo has to constantly come up with new products. Consequently, higher spending on product development is likely to keep margins under pressure at least in the near term. Hence, we recommend investors to be wary of Qorvo shares until its Zacks Rank and estimates improve.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderQorvo carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) and Mellanox (MLNX  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The projected long-term earnings growth rate for Western Digital and Mellanox are 19% and 15%, respectively.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

702,WDC,"Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) strengthened its partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) in server storage. The companies will collaborate to demonstrate U.3 reference platform, SFF-TA-1001 at HPE Discover. The U.3 universal drive cage will feature Toshiba U.3 facilitated SAS, SATA and NVMe drives.U.3 technology enables SSDs (SATA, SAS and NVMe) and HDDs (SATA and SAS) to function in a single bay. It renders the practice of wiring multiple protocols redundant, consequently simplifying the processes.Broadcom remains committed in providing the customers with robust application uptime and data protection. The customers are likely to gain significantly from the new Broadcom enabled HPE server storage solutions. Lower costs, simplifying complexity, enhanced drive as well as storage flexibility and improved performance are the key benefits.Notably, Broadcom’s 24-port RAID controller was also added to the HPE ProLiant Gen10 server family. HPE’s Smart Array P824i-p MR SAS controller furnishes an ideal solution for storage servers. The controller provides flexible, expander-less storage suitable for high drive count as in HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10.We believe Broadcom’s strengthening collaboration with HPE makes it well positioned to expand its data center server storage capabilities. We believe an expanding RAID portfolio bodes well for Broadcom in the long run.Additionally, per a Technavio report, global RAID controller card market revenues are projected to reach $2.9 billion by 2021. This report reinforces our belief regarding the potential of the company’s RAID solutions.Shares of Broadcom have returned 11.1% in the past year underperforming the industry’s rally of 14.4%.Another Notable DevelopmentBroadcom announced in another press release that it has developed the approved SFF-TA-1005 Universal Backplane Management (“UBM”) specification. The company developed the platform co-sponsored by HPE, Dell EMC and 19 other members. The platform will enhance simplicity and provide clarity to the management of SATA, SAS and NVMe drives.Per the press release, “The SFF-TA-1005 UBM specification will help to unify and standardize backplane management in the data center.”To ConcludeBroadcom is benefiting from robust demand of its wireless solutions and expanding product portfolio. It makes the company well-positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like IoT and 5G.However, investors are cautious regarding the customer concentration woes and intensifying competition witnessed in most of the markets in which the company operates.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBroadcom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

703,WDC,"Some of the biggest tech names are slated to report earnings this week. These results come at a time when the technology sector is grappling with several crises which have sprung up at short intervals. Of the companies, slated to report earnings this week, Facebook, Inc. (FB) has had to battle the fallout of a data leak scandal. Meanwhile, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has been the target of several attacks from President Trump.Given this backdrop, investors would be wondering whether upcoming results can help override recent concerns. Fortunately, earnings and revenues from the sector are likely to improve in the first quarter, which makes it a good idea to pick up select tech stocks which are also likely to outperform their earnings estimates.Can Strong Results Outweigh Recent Concerns?The variety of concerns plaguing technology, a sector which largely powered an unprecedented Bull Run, has had the strongest proponents of the sector scurrying for cover. Only recently, poor guidance from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM) pulled down other tech majors like Apple Inc. (AAPL).But not all the worries the sector faces at the moment could snowball into threats of significant proportions. For instance, most market watchers believe that a divided Congress is unlikely to regulate data gathering of the kind practiced by Facebook or Google. Online advertising spends, therefore, are likely to remain largely unchanged.However, higher user engagement will still be topmost on the list of investor priorities. Ultimately, earnings would not only have to be good overall. They would have to be strong enough to outweigh recent sector concerns.Earnings Prospects Remain PromisingUnlike the Finance sector whose earnings performance notably improved this earnings season compared to other recent periods, the Tech sector’s earnings performance has been strong over the last many quarters. This strength is expected to continue in the Q1 earnings season as well.Total Q1 earnings for the Tech sector are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 11.5% higher revenues. This would follow 24.2% earnings growth for the sector on 11.1% revenue growth in the preceding quarter. (Read: Can Tech Earnings Live Up to Expectations?)That’s head and shoulders above the autos and conglomerate sectors, earnings for which are expected to decline by 9.6% and 1.1%, respectively during the first quarter. Overall, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up 18% from the same period last year on 5.3% higher revenues.Our ChoicesTech stocks have been battered on several fronts this year, the latest being poor guidance from Taiwan Semiconductor. However, several of the concerns surrounding the sector are unlikely to build up into something larger.For instance, U.S. lawmakers are unlikely to impose stringent regulation on tech majors in the near term. Meanwhile, in keeping with stellar fourth-quarter results, first-quarter numbers are likely to be impressive.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement.

709,WDC,"Have you been paying attention to shares of NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4.6% over the past month. NTAP hit a new 52-week high of $72.93 in the previous session. NetApp has gained 31.7% since the start of the year compared to the 9.1% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 21.6% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 23, 2018, NetApp reported EPS of $1.05 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.86%.For the current fiscal year, NetApp is expected to post earnings of $4.05 per share on $6.19 billion in revenues. This represents a 16.71% change in EPS on a 4.74% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.72 per share on $6.5 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 16.61% and 5.06%, respectively.Valuation MetricsNetApp may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for NTAP? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.NetApp has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are An and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 18X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.1X versus its peer group's average of 14.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.5. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus  NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus | NetApp, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, NetApp currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if NetApp meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though NTAP shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does NetApp Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of NetApp have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI  -  Free Report), Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report), and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 3% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for NTAP, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

711,WDC,"Corning Inc (GLW  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr24. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 6.39%.In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings of 49 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Core revenues increased 7% year over year to $2.74 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.63 billion.For the first quarter 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share and revenues are projected to be 30 cents and $2.51 billion, respectively.We believe strength in the company’s Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials business lines to drive top-line growth.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderCorning’s results are likely to benefit from its optical communications segment, primarily owing to strong demand for fiber products. The company’s initiative to strengthen the segment is evident from the announced acquisition of 3M’s communication (MMM  -  Free Report) market division which will not only expand worldwide market access but also enhance its product portfolio.Management remains positive about TV screen size growth and ramping production of BOEs Gen 10.5 in Hefei.Moreover, robust adoption of Gorilla Glass 5 bodes well for its specialty materialssegment. The trending glass backs on devices and smart watches leveraging Gorilla Glass for its cover material is a tailwind.Additionally, the company’s focus on expanding its footprint in the automotive market driven by gas particulate filters (“GPFs”) and a Gorilla-sized automotive glass business is a positive.Furthermore, Corning collaborated with AU Optronics Corporation (“AUO”) to launch a solar panel project in Taiwan to provide sufficient electricity to address the power needs of roughly 300 U.S. households a year. The rooftop solar power equipment installed at Corning’s two manufacturing facilities will help the company reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by more than 2,375 metric tons per year.However, weakness in the Display segment remains a headwind. Management anticipates LCD glass market to grow low-single digits on account of seasonality.What Does Our Model SayAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

715,WDC,"Exceptional bonhomie was on display when President Trump and North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un met in Singapore on Tuesday. This was the first meeting between a sitting U.S. President and a North Korean chairman.The meeting seemed to go off unexpectedly well, considering it was preceded by threats from both sides. Ultimately, Trump and Kim signed a document which calls for the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.Several analysts have criticized the agreement, saying that it is short of specifics. But markets are likely to be impressed that an agreement has been reached at after all. A lasting détente could take a long-standing concern off investors’ plates. Investing in consumer discretionary and technology stocks, the two best performing sectors of the year looks like a smart option at this point.  Complete Denuclearization on the AnvilAt the end of the maiden meeting between a North Korean leader and a U.S. President, an agreement was signed committing to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Additionally, the two countries promised to make efforts to create a lasting “peace regime” across Korea.On being asked about when said denuclearization would take place, Trump quipped:  ""We're starting that process very quickly — very, very quickly."" The U.S. President also claimed that the Korean conflict “will end soon.” In return the United States has promised to address concerns that it wished to affect a regime change in North Korea.War Games to End, Follow-Up Negotiations PlannedThe “comprehensive” document also entails that the two sides will continue to meet for follow-up negotiations and will seek to improve bilateral relations. Specifically, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo and senior officials from the North Korean side will conduct further negotiations.Trump also stated that the United States will cease to conduct “very provocative” war games near North Korea. This will help the United States save “a tremendous amount of money.”However, the United States would not be removing any troops from the Korean Peninsula at this point. Sanctions would also remain firmly in place.  Our ChoicesCritics of the freshly concluded agreement point out that it is low on specifics. However, it is certainly a milestone, considering that even a meeting between the United States and North Korea seemed unlikely a few months ago. The development is likely to gladden investors since it addresses a lingering and prominent concern.Consumer discretionary and technology stocks, the best performing sectors of the year, are likely to receive a major boost from to the positive sentiment generated by these developments.

716,WDC,"Infosys Limited (INFY  -  Free Report) has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 3.1%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.2% and a market cap of $40.7 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors’ should retain their portfolio for now.Let’s take a look at the factors aiding the company’s performance.Lucrative client wins and impressive performance of new high growth services and software business bode well for the company. A strong multi-industrial pipeline is also a positive.Infosys’ investments in new services, particularly in Cloud Ecosystem, Big Data and Analytics, API and Micro services, Data and Mainframe Modernization, Cyber Security and IoT Engineering Services have been showing promising results.The company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings and revenues came in better than expected and also increased year over year.Infosys Limited Revenue (TTM) Infosys Limited Revenue (TTM) | Infosys Limited Quote Notably, the company announced compensation revision of around 85% of its workforce effective Apr 1, with a higher variable pay and incentives. This initiative has dragged down quarterly margins a bit.Additionally, increasing anti-outsourcing sentiment in certain countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, is likely to lead to the enactment of restrictive legislations. This might in turn impact the company’s financials as companies in these parts of the world could stop outsourcing work to Infosys.Moreover, given the changing political climate in the United States, Infosys’ focus on on-shore business model, with increased local hiring, is likely to hurt the company’s profitability.Nevertheless, Infosys is benefiting from renewal of traditional services and rollout of services in areas such as Cloud Ecosystem, Big Data and Analytics. This paves the way for future growth of this Zacks #3 (Hold) stock and justifies its retention in investors’ portfolio.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked technology stocks include NVIDIA Corp.

717,WDC,"It’s not easy to find value stocks. Being aware of a company's key financial numbers like earnings per share and sales growth can help investors identify stocks that are trading for less than their worth. However, a proper analysis of the fundamentals with the help of a number of metrics is required to determine whether a stock is a good bargain or not. Though price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityWhat is Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are six of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening:KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), a leading homebuilder, has a projected 3-5 year EPS growth rate of 16.0%.

718,WDC,"Time Warner Inc.  is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26.The media and entertainment company’s planned takeover by AT&T in a deal worth $85.4 billion hit roadblock after Department of Justice (DOJ) raised antitrust concerns over the proposed merger.Notably, Time Warner has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters by an average of 13.3%. In the preceding quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.1%.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Time Warner outpaces earnings estimate even this time. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings and revenues are currently pegged at $1.76 and $7.95 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6% and 2.8%, respectively.Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors likely to impact results this quarter. Time Warner Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Time Warner Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Time Warner Inc. Quote Factors to ConsiderTime Warner has been restructuring aggressively. The company is now focusing on original programming, containing costs and increasing investments in key areas to enhance profitability. Additionally, the company has been expanding digital presence to enable consumers to access content from several platforms and devices.The company’s investments in video content and technology are expected to boost top-line growth. The company has witnessed robust subscription revenue growth at Home Box Office (HBO) and Turner.In the last quarter, HBO’s subscription revenues increased 16% driven by a rise in domestic rates and subscribers, and international growth. Moreover, Turner’s subscription revenues increased 14% due to rise in domestic rates and growth at Turner’s international networks.However, projections for HBO and Turner are not positive for the first quarter.Management expects HBO’s subscription revenues in the first quarter to improve at a rate similar to the expectation for the full year (more than 6% year over year). The sequential decline can primarily be attributed to timing for recognizing certain revenues under new revenue recognition accounting guidance adopted in 2018.Moreover, Time Warner expects HBO operating income to decline in the to-be-reported quarter.For Turner, management expects advertising revenues to increase in the high-single to low-double digits rate in first-quarter 2018. This is expected to be driven by positive impact from airing the Final Four college basketball games of the NCAA Tournament.However, operating income is anticipated to decline in the first quarter due to rise in expenses on account of the airing of the NCAA Tournament Final Four games and the timing of original series.Further, Warner Bros. operating income is expected to decline by a double-digit percentage in the going-to-be-reported quarter.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Time Warner has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of -2.84%, which indicates an unlikely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are few stocks you may consider as our proven model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.30% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Paycom Software (PAYC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #1.Seagate (STX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.69% and a Zacks Rank #2. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think. See This Ticker Free >>

Price and EPS Surprise  Amazon.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote Prime: Key CatalystAmazon keeps its retail business very hard to beat on price, choice and convenience, on the back of a solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy. Higher spending on its platform along with focus on building video content, primarily for Prime subscribers, are key catalysts.Prime, which has more than 100 million paid subscribers, is now widely available and generates increased sales for Amazon. Prime Now, the company’s super-fast delivery service, is expanding rapidly in the United States.Amazon’s strong delivery arm has been its strength and is providing stiff competition to brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart. In February, the company started offering two-hour delivery from Whole Foods stores to Prime members in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach. Los Angeles is the latest addition to the list.Amazon also offers 5% cash back benefit to Prime members who use Amazon Prime Rewards Visa card while shopping at any Whole Foods store. Further, Prime members in the United States have started receiving unlimited free two-day shipping on over 100 million different items.Additionally, the company is transforming its Prime Pantry to a subscription-based model that will boost the Prime Pantry subscriber base.The e-commerce giant’s international push is also commendable. Last year, Prime was launched in the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Further, the company enabled the customers in Belgium to join Prime and shop in the Netherlands. The company also introduced Prime in Singapore.During the quarter, Amazon launched Prime Music service in India by partnering with eight national and over 300 regional record labels. Per Reuters, India is the fastest growing market for Amazon Prime Video Service driven by popularity of its original content offerings in Hindi and five local languages.Recently, Amazon partnered with a French retailer, Monoprix, which will aid the company in strengthening its footprint in European grocery market, especially in France. Its growing interest in the area was apparent from its launch of Amazon Fresh and the acquisition of Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. Moreover, the company’s interest in France was obvious from the recent settlement with French tax authorities and its promise to create 2K jobs in the country.We believe Amazon’s continuous efforts in making Prime more customer friendly will continue to drive subscription base of the service, which will improve the top line further.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Retail Subscription Services currently stands at $2.85 billion.Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Drive ProfitsAWS is still the cash cow for Amazon. This business generates much higher margins compared with the traditional retail business, which is positive for the company’s profits as it continues to grow in the mix. Moreover, expanding customer base is likely to drive the top line.Amazon’s persistent efforts to open more data centers globally and lower prices lend it a competitive edge against the likes of Microsoft. Notably, AWS held 62% of market share last quarter.AWS’ customer base continues to expand with GoDaddy being its latest client. During the quarter, Amdocs (DOX  -  Free Report) formed a strategic collaboration with AWS, which will enable the former to develop solutions that would help the service providers to adapt better to the digital world in a cost-effective way.AWS launched a new region in France and a second AWS Region in China during the quarter. Amazon also launched GameOn, a new competitive video gaming service built on AWS, allowing developers and gamers to integrate and create competitions natively across mobile devices, PCs, and gaming consoles.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Retail Subscription Services currently stands at $5.24 billion.Growing Footprint in Home AutomationAlexa powered Echo devices are going great guns and help the company sell more products and services. Alexa has already been integrated into a host of everyday devices for the digital home with agreements for more. Per Cowen & Co. consumer tracking survey, 84% of the Echo users in the United States use it for listening to music.The IoT focus has helped Amazon maintain supremacy in the home automation market. The company has expanded connected home lineup with Cloud Cam, a security camera that allows Amazon’s delivery workers enter homes to drop off packages when homeowners are away.During the quarter, Amazon acquired Ring, a well-known developer of internet connected video doorbell and camera devices. The deal helps Amazon expand in the home security market and improvise its in-house delivery services.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Amazon has a Zacks Rank #1 and an Earnings ESP of +12.08%, which indicates a likely positive surprise.

723,WDC,"On Jun 7, we issued an updated research report on Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS  -  Free Report).Notably, Stratasys has been struggling with sluggish demand from government and other key vertical customers like aerospace and automotive, which had an adverse impact on its first-quarter 2018 results.The company posted disappointing results in the last reported quarter, with both the top and the bottom lines falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Though earnings of 8 cents per share were flat year over year, revenues declined 5.7%.Additionally, the sudden announcement of the resignation of the company’s CEO, Ilan Levin dampened investors’ confidence.Notably, Stratasys’ stock has plunged 30.5% over the past year underperforming the industry’s decline of 16.2%.Factors Influencing the StockA decline in sales of high-end products in North America is hurting Stratasys’ top-line performance. Lower demand from government, aerospace and automotive industries is the major cause of the decline per management.Although the company is trying to address the underperformance of this particular section by working closely with channel partners, we believe the issue will take time to be resolved.Additionally, the company witnessed expansion of 160 basis points (bps) in gross margin in the first-quarter of 2018 after four consecutive quarters of decline. Overall, the company’s non-GAAP gross margin contracted 240 basis points on a year-over-year basis in 2017.Notably, per analysts, the 3D printing industry is experiencing a shift in mix from higher price and higher margin products to higher volume and lower price ones, which is a headwind. Though the company is trying to keep a check on its cost structure, this industry trend is anticipated to be a drag on its margins.Additionally, the unexpected departure of the company’s CEO has been a blow to investors. Elchanan (Elan) Jaglom, currently the chairman, will serve as interim CEO.All these factors make us increasingly cautious about the near-term performance of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked technology stocks include NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc.

724,WDC,"Even in times of global uncertainty and market volatility, an increasing number of investors flock the equity markets to invest their hard-earned money. There are a number of investment styles to suit the predilection of hundreds of investors looking for the best value stocks.Among them, price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is an easy-to-use tool for identifying low-priced stocks which have high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.What is Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:US Foods Holding Corp. (USFD  -  Free Report), a foodservice distributor, has a projected 3-5 year EPS growth rate of 17.0%. Currently, the stock has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2.

725,WDC,"IPG Photonics Corporation (IPGP  -  Free Report) delivered first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.93 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents. The figure was better than the guided range of $1.62-$1.87.The strong year-over-year growth was driven by a 26% surge in sales from the year-ago quarter to $359.9 million. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $347 and also outperformed managements guided range of $330-$355 million.Materials processing jumped 28% year over year and accounted for approximately 94% of total sales driven by strength in 3D printing and cutting applications.IPG Photonics is benefiting from strong adoption of fiber lasers over conventional lasers as well as non-laser cutting and welding equipment. According to management, secular transition to high powered products and increased electric vehicle battery production were the primary drivers behind the increased adoption of the high powered lasers.The year-over-year sales growth was driven by robust performance in China, Europe and Japan with strong demand across a variety of applications and industries. Apart from strong order flow, robust integration of the company’s business model with vertically-integrated manufacturing operation, production & operations management, customer credit management and global administration aided growth.IPG Photonics’ stock has returned 5.7% in the past year, underperforming industry’s rally of 5.7%.Geographic Revenue DetailsChina reported year-over-year sales growth of 28.5% and represented 41.7% of total sales. The robust performance was driven by strong sales of high-power CW lasers for cutting and welding applications.However, welding sales were down year over year due to the anticipated reduction in demand pertaining to the smart-phone investment cycle. Electric vehicle battery welding, which are project driven, were also down in the region.Sales in Japan surged 39% from the year-ago quarter. In spite of the ongoing softness in sales in the region, growth was achieved on the back of increasing adoption of its cutting, engraving, and marking and welding applications.Further, Japan lags other regions regarding adoption of fiber laser technology. To address the issue, IPG Photonics is making investments in new sales personnel to enhance capabilities in the region.Sales in Europe increased 35% from the year-ago quarter. Europe benefited from strength in medium-power lasers for 3D printing applications, and high power lasers for cutting and welding applications. Moreover, pulsed laser sales for marking, solar cell manufacturing and engraving continued to drive growth in the region.Sales in the United States and other North America grew 3.4% year over year. Sales in America benefited from strength in welding and cutting applications which offset the softness in communications. Further, ILT acquisition contributed meaningfully to domestic sales.Product DetailsSales of high-power CW lasers (64.1% of total revenues) surged 37.3% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, management also noted that demand for 6 kilowatt ultra-high power CW lasers gained momentum.Medium-power CW laser sales (6.0% of total revenues) increased 8.8% as increased demand for fine welding and 3D printing mitigated softness in cutting. Management noted that within the lower-end cutting applications, many OEMs are moving away from medium-power to high-power lasers at 1 kilowatt and 1.5 kilowatt.Sales of low-power CW lasers (1.1% of total revenues) climbed 15.76% from the year-ago quarter.Pulsed lasers sales (10.6% of total revenues) grew 17.9% year over year. Sales of new green and high-power pulsed lasers across broad-based applications drove results. Sales of low-power pulsed lasers for marking and engraving applications also contributed significantly.An expected reduction in demand pertaining to the smart-phone investment cycle led to a 24.2% decline in the sales of QCW lasers (4.5% of total revenues) on a year-over-year basis. However, management anticipates IPG Photonics’s rich laser technology portfolio to enable it to capture market share, given the increasing complexity of new smart-phones, from non-laser processing.Other products revenues (13.7% of total revenues) advanced 20.8% year over year due to solid sales growth witnessed across systems and beam delivery accessories.Operational DetailsIPG Photonics reported gross margin of 56.5%, which expanded 150 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis and came ahead of management’s guided range of 50-55%. This can be attributed to improved cost reductions, manufacturing efficiency and favorable product mix that offset lower average selling price (ASP).As a percentage of revenue, sales & marketing expenses, R&D expenses remained flat year over year. However, G&A expenses increased 80 bps. Consequently, operating margin expanded 371 bps from the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowIPG Photonics ended the first quarter with $1.18 in cash & cash equivalents and short-term investments up from $1.12 billion reported in the previous quarter. Total debt outstanding was $48 million down from $49 million in the previous quarter.However, the company generated $100 million in cash from operations down from the previous quarter’s figure of $108 million. Further, it incurred $39 million to finance capital expenditure up from $27 million in the previous quarter.During the first quarter, IPG Photonics bought back 83K shares for $20 million. Notably, since the buyback program began in July 2016, the company has repurchased 461K shares for $69 million.IPG Photonics Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise IPG Photonics Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | IPG Photonics Corporation QuoteOutlookIPG Photonics expects sales in the range of $400-$430 million for the second quarter of 2018, reflecting 8-15% growth from the year-ago quarter.Earnings are projected in the range of $2.05-$2.35 per share, which reflects an increase of 7-23% from the year-ago quarter.For 2018, management reiterated the outlook.

726,WDC,"Welcome to Episode #91 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.Do you have investing luck?Value investing and lucky investing are similar in several ways. Value investors buy stocks that are often ignored by Wall Street as do many lucky investors.What Are the Criteria for Lucky Investing?1.       You must be an investor. This may seem basic, but many people “dream” of investing in the next Amazon or Facebook but never actually buy any stocks or ETFs.2.       Diversify. Very few people get anything right the first time. You know the old saying of throwing all the ideas against the wall and seeing what sticks. The same is true for lucky investing. That means you have to own more than one stock, ETF or mutual fund.Lucky investing, or value investing, isn’t about finding only that one magical stock. You’re going to have misses.It’s about staying in the game long enough for something to stick.Screening for Value and Growth StocksWith earnings season in full swing, why shouldn’t value investors reach for those companies that have already reported earnings and that have great growth stories?The screen included companies with earnings growth and the Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), which should mean rising earnings estimates.For value, the screen included those with P/Es under 15.The screen returned 43 stocks.3 Top Value Stocks to Consider Now1.       Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) had been soaring so it was out of value contention. But the recent pullback in the shares, combined with rising earnings estimates, gives it a forward P/E of 13.9. Earnings are expected to rise 51% in 2018 and another 13% in 2019. After a great earnings report, all of the analyst estimates are on the rise for the full year.2.       Celanese Corporation (CE  -  Free Report) is an industrial chemicals maker. Even though shares have recently rebounded, it still has a forward P/E of 11.8. Earnings are expected to rise 23% in 2018. Sales are also expected to be bullish, up 14.4% for the year.3.       Patrick Industries (PATK  -  Free Report) is in the hated RV industry. It makes component products for RVs, which made up 69% of first quarter revenue, as well as marine and industrial markets. RV revenue was up 53% as wholesale unit shipments were up 13% year-over-year in the first quarter. Shares have sunk over 17% year-to-date on fears that the good times in the RV industry wouldn’t last. It trades with a forward P/E of just 12.6.Additionally, there are other value stocks that continue to get cheaper, on a P/E basis.Micron (MU  -  Free Report) now trades with a forward P/E of just 4.1.Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) is also dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of 5.5.Estimates continue to track higher for fiscal 2019 for both companies.

In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings of 59 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Gross revenues of $2.6 billion were up 9% on a year-over-year basis (up 7% on an Fx-neutral basis) and within the guided range of $2.58-$2.62 billion.The growth was primarily driven by robust performance from the Marketplace platform, which we expect to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. eBay Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  eBay Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | eBay Inc. Quote Marketplace Re-Platforming to Drive Growthebay is making every effort to improve its Marketplace business. The company is currently re-platforming itself by building product catalogs on structured data, enhancing mobile platform, rolling out new browse-inspired shopping journeys and strengthening its brand.Moreover, eBay’s accelerated Artificial Intelligence (AI) efforts through personalization, image search technology, and customer support is expected to strengthen the Marketplace platform.Of late, eBay has been giving more data to its marketplace sellers including price guidance, restocking guidance and more insight into inventory such as demand signals for the right products, price and timing.Additionally, eBay continues to increase user engagement and satisfaction by driving traffic to its top-rated sellers. As a result, same-store sales at these retailers continue to grow at a healthy rate. The company expanded the use of social channels, which is significantly increasing traffic growth.The partnership with Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) is noticeable in this regard. The company is offering daily deals on Facebook’s Mobile Marketplace and also getting access to the latter’s huge user base.Stock Up on Positive Growth TrendseBay shares have returned 11.5% compared with the industry’s year-to-date rally of 7.7%.

728,WDC,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is planning to use organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels in all three new iPhone models planned for next year, reports South Korea's Electronic Times.We note that for 2018, two out of the three iPhone models — a 5.8-inch second-generation iPhone X and a larger 6.5-inch iPhone X Plus — are expected to offer OLED displays. The low-cost third one is likely to be a 6.1 inch LCD (liquid crystal display) variant.While Apple’s transition to OLED is a positive for major OLED screen providers, it is a serious concern for its LCD screen suppliers like Japan Display and Sharp that lag in OLED production.Shares of Japan Display and Sharp fell as much as 21% and 4.3%, respectively, in intraday trading on May 29, while shares of OLED supplier LG Display rallied 5.9% post the news.Shares of Apple have gained 11.5% year to date, slightly outperforming the industry’s 11.2% rally.  Is the Move Worth it?Analysts are apprehensive regarding this move by Apple. Bloomberg quoted Jeff Pu, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Investment Consulting saying, “It is unlikely that Apple will be releasing three OLED models next year.”Apple, in order to expand its supply chain, reportedly invested more than $2 billion in LG Display last year. The company is the sole supplier of OLED screen of Apple Watch and is rumored to be the supplier for the upcoming iPhone X Plus.However, owing to some manufacturing problems, LG Display had difficulties to move into mass production of OLED screen and is also unlikely to boost production for Apple in 2019, Bloomberg adds.On the other hand, Japan Display, which is moving to OLED technology, will be starting mass production of the same only in 2019. We note that Apple had to delay the launch of iPhone X due to the lack of adequate supply of OLED screens from suppliers like Samsung.As far as Samsung is concerned, the company has long been one of Apple’s biggest suppliers for iPhone components. Samsung makes the products not only for Apple but also for its own smartphones.Notably, Apple’s overdependence on Samsung for producing display panels for the first OLED phone, iPhone X, has strengthened the latter’s pricing power. Per KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo’s estimates, Apple pays Samsung in the range of $120-$130 per unit. This is significantly higher than iPhone 7 Plus’5.5-inch LCD, which cost $45 to $55 per unit.Apple’s improving iPhone display is seen as the differentiator when compared with other rival products in the market. However, the higher cost of technology is translated into higher price of products, which is eventually passed on to consumers.The expensive price tag might prove an impediment in generating sufficient demand. We note that Apple had to cut down on its iPhone X production following lower-than-expected demand for the product.In March, Apple was rumored producing its own MicroLED screen, which created concerns for OLED suppliers. We believe bringing display manufacturing in house makes sense for Apple as it will no longer have to depend on others for supply of display screens.Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc.

Shopify Plus accounted for $7 million representing 22% of MRR compared with 17% in the quarter ended Mar 31, 2017.Merchant Solutions revenues soared 75% to $114.1 million, driven primarily by growth in Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”), which soared 64% from the year-ago quarter to $8.0 billion.

Marrine, new shops of PepsiCo and Nestle were also added.Management was particularly positive about the company’s partner ecosystem that helps it to identify and reach out to merchants otherwise inaccessible. Around 16,000 partners referred merchants to Shopify in the past 12 months.Operating DetailsNon-GAAP gross profit soared 71.4% to $124.3 million. Non-GAAP gross margin consequently expanded by 110 basis points (bps), primarily driven by revenue growth in partner referral fee. Robust performance of Shipping and Capital favored margins.Moreover, the risk posed by strained Subscription Solutions margins due to transition to cloud was offset by margin growth.Adjusted operating loss was $0.2 million compared with loss of $4.3 million in the year-ago quarter.Shopify Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Shopify Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Shopify Inc. QuoteBalance SheetShopify ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $1.58 billion up from $938 million in the previous quarter, primarily owing to proceeds from company’s offering of 4.8 million (Class A subordinate voting) shares in February.GuidanceFor second-quarter 2018, Shopify projects revenues in the range of $230-$235 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $227.3 million.Adjusted operating loss is expected to be in the range of $5-$7 million.For full-year 2018, Shopify raised outlook.

737,WDC,"Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we would suggest Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio as one of the key metrics.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that make P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), which develops, manufactures, and sells data storage devices and solutions, delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.2% in the trailing four quarters. The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 19% for 3-5 years and carries a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Daqo New Energy Corp.

It will be available in 32 GB and 64 GB variants for $18.99 and $31.99, respectively, this month.Robust adoption of dynamic and complex data-centric applications, including surveillance cameras requires a 24/7 video capture which implies a demand of data storage architecture that supports the immense workload.Notably, modern analytics is increasingly leveraging on video recordings to help businesses unlock effective and meaningful insights which aid them in realizing their goals. One such instance of utilization is retailers analyzing shopping behavior via video facial recognition.Western Digital’s SD card meets this demand effectively. Furthermore, to facilitate surveillance, the SD card will be available in convenient 25-packs to integrators and installers.FeaturesThe new card enables smooth capture of emerging 4K Ultra HD videos for next-generation AI enabled cameras. Its humidity-resistant and rugged design features ensure that it functions uninterrupted even in challenging environmental conditions.Notably, the card provides “surveillance-class” endurance by supporting up to 1,000 Program-Erase (“PE”) Cycles to enhance continuous recording.Further, the 32 GB and 64 GB variants deliver sequential read and write speed of up to 80MB/s and 50MB/s, respectively and can support UHS Speed Class 11 and Speed Class 10.The aforementioned features ensure smooth real-time data capture, storage in next generation formats of 4K Ultra HD, and access of video surveillance.Analyzing the Prospects of the New CardThe card is an effective addition to company’s surveillance portfolio. The high-capacity Western Digital Purple Surveillance HDD and the Ultrastar HDD series are already aiding surveillance analytics. With this new Purple card launch, we expect the company to strengthen its market position against the likes of Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report).Per a MarketsandMarkets report, “Video Surveillance Storage Market” is projected to grow at a CAGR of 22.41% from 2015 to 2020 to reach $18.28 billion.Furthermore, per an Orbis Research report, as revealed by Reuters, the global video surveillance market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18.3% from 2017 to 2022 to reach $63.2 billion. The market valuation in 2015 was $19.51 billion.Per an IHS Markit report, all newly installed video surveillance cameras in 2015 generated 566 petabytes data globally, in one day. The corresponding data is projected to grow over 2,500 petabytes by 2019, on a daily basis.The aforementioned reports strengthen the prospects of investment opportunities in the new SD card designed for video surveillance.Western Digital is making continuous efforts to ensure its products deliver high quality storage solutions across all emerging data-driven technologies. Recently, the company had launched NVMe SSD to enhance gaming experience. We believe this ongoing expansion of the company’s product portfolio will bode well for the company’s top-line.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderWestern Digital sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A couple of other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), both currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1.

739,WDC,"Technology sector has been the cynosure of all eyes, both for bad and good reasons, in the first quarter of 2018.The sector received a lot of flak over a number of issues including Facebook’s data fiasco, Apple’s iPhone-battery slowdown and President Trump’s tariff imposition on Chinese imports. The hallowed FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet) were the worst sufferers.However, increasing demand for cutting-edge technology such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware continues to boost the growth potential of the technology sector.Facebook Data Fiasco: Biggest ControversyFacebook’s data misuse scandal captured the attention of government regulators instantaneously, worldwide. The incident negatively impacted not only the social media stocks but also the overall technology sector.The social media giant was already facing backlash over the Russian meddling into the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. The Cambridge Analytica incident has now put the company’s data practices under severe scrutiny.Apple, Expedia, Uber, NVIDIA: All SufferedApple also received lot of criticism after it revealed that software updates slowed down iPhones with older batteries.Moreover, incidents such as the Russian hacking of computers at the 2018 Olympics as well as security breach at Expedia division Orbitz highlighted the security loopholes currently faced by technology providers.Further, ride-hailing service provider Uber stopped all test drives, after a driverless car crashed in Arizona, killing a pedestrian. The incident also compelled GPU provider NVIDIA to suspend all tests.Moreover, Trump’s criticism about the company’s business practices severely hurt Amazon during the last few days of the quarter.Additionally, European Commission’s (EC) decision to impose “digital tax” on tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet has been the cause of major concern among investors.The U.S.-based technology companies, particularly social-media companies, are already facing an uphill task to comply with the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the region.Tech Stocks Still Shine on Growth PotentialNotably, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (“XLK”) returned 2.8% in the year-to-date period compared with the S&P 500’s decline of 1.3%.The outperformance can be attributed to solid top-line growth driven by strong demand for power-efficient and high-performance chips, DRAM and NAND products, sensors and RFID solutions.Moreover, rapidly expanding IoT market is driving growth for chip components to power applications, particularly ADAS, medical/healthcare and smart devices. Further, rapid development of 5G platform and technology has evolved as another catalyst for technology providers, particularly semiconductor companies.The growing demand for cybersecurity solutions also presents significant growth potential. Furthermore, improving IT spending is a positive. Market research firm, Gartner, projects global IT spending for 2018 to rise 4.5%, up from 3.8% in 2017.According to the latest Earnings Trend, technology sector’s first-quarter earnings are expected to improve 21% from the same period last year on 11.4% higher revenues.How to Make the Right Pick?Given the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings could be a daunting task.

Sirius also expanded partnership with CDK Global (CDK  -  Free Report) to develop new and innovative connected vehicle solutions.Additionally, Sirius’ effort to reward shareholders through aggressive share buyback is positive. In January 2018, the company’s board of directors cleared an additional buyback program to the tune of $2 billion.However, the company’s high-debt level is a concern. Moreover, increased leverage along with stiff competition might act as headwinds for the company in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates.

741,WDC,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) recently made a few important announcements regarding its strategic initiatives in line with the industry’s evolution at one of its most significant partner event, Executive Forum 2018, in the Americas.  The announcements included the incorporation of “premium features and expressive designs into its convertible, notebook and desktop PCs”. The company also introduced a new range of notebooks, displays and desktops called HP Pavilion Gaming to address the requirements of gamers.Additionally, HP announced the expansion of its “A3 multifunction printer line, now including new PageWide A3 skus for both transactional and contractual channels with external finishing”. It entered into a partnership with ImageNet Consulting, LLC for improvement of efficiency of A3 product line as well.Notably, post the split from the parent company — Hewlett-Packard Company — in November 2015, HP has been focusing on product innovation & differentiation, pricing, and marketing and sales activities to trigger demand for its PC and Printing products in the market. The company has generated high returns for investors over the past year.In a year's time, the stock has appreciated 18.7% outperforming the S&P 500's gain of 13.8%.Meanwhile, HP’s initiatives seem to be paying off. This is evident from a report by IDC which states that in fourth-quarter 2017 the company’s PC shipments registered the seventh quarter of consecutive year-over-year growth after witnessing several quarters of decline. Additionally, Gartner and IDC believes that the PC industry is moving toward stabilization, which is another positive for the company.Moreover, the company’s acquisition of Samsung Electronics’ printer business bodes well for its printing segment, with the addition of 6,500-plus printing patents owned by Samsung. HP’s initiatives toward fortifying its 3D printing business capabilities are also encouraging. Still, the company lags behind 3D Systems (DDD  -  Free Report) and Stratasys (SSYS  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, HP’s initiatives are reflecting in its impressive financials. In the past quarter, the company witnessed sixth consecutive revenue growth after witnessing a prolonged period of decline. Going ahead, we expect this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock to perform even better backed by its strategic initiatives.Key PickAnother stock in the technology sector worth considering is Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Western Digital’s long-term earnings growth rate is projected at 19%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

743,WDC,"Investors always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless you are blessed with Midas touch.When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. So, the chance of outperformance is high when the market moves higher.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we would recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial Health Questions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.What’s the Optimum Strategy?However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book, price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should give you even better results as they eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are four of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), which develops, manufactures and sells data storage devices and solutions, delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.2% in the trailing four quarters. The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 19% for 3-5 years and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Discovery, Inc.

(AER  -  Free Report), an independent aircraft leasing company, has a Zacks Rank #2 and a 12% expected EPS growth rate for 3-5 years.

745,WDC,"Tech stocks recently faced a severe downturn, sparked off by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd.’s (TSM  -  Free Report) weak financial outlook for the second quarter. Adding to investor concerns were persistent worries over weak demand for Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhones.In March, the data privacy scandal which hit Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) triggered a broad selloff in tech shares. These concerns had then spilt over into April, spooking tech investors.However, it now seems that strong earnings from the FAANG group of stocks have dispelled lingering concerns surrounding the sector. Tech stocks have rebounded strongly and are lucrative investment options at present.  Apple Consolidates Winning Streak, Facebook Sparks ReboundAhead of earnings on Tuesday, shares of Apple gained 2.3%, powering a 0.9% increase for the Nasdaq. Apple posted second quarter 2018 earnings of $2.73 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.69.Revenues came in at $61.1 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $61.1 billion. iPhone unit sales were up 3% from the prior-year quarter, with iPhone segment revenue coming in 14% higher. (Read: Apple Posts Earnings Beat & Strong Guidance, Hikes Dividend By 16%)Further, Apple said that it would be raising its dividend by 16% while also announcing “a new $100 billion share repurchase authorization.” Of course, the initial tech rebound was sparked off by stellar results from Facebook which helped tech stocks rebound on Apr 26.The social media giant comfortably surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the first quarter. But more importantly, Monthly Active Users and Daily Active Users both posted year-over-year gains of 13%, an important development after events like the “Delete Facebook” Campaign.

746,WDC,"Micron (MU  -  Free Report) investors certainly ignored the “Sell in May and Go Away” adage in early morning trading Tuesday, with shares of the popular memory chip manufacturer gaining about 1.5%—despite continued volatility throughout the broader market.Shares of Micron have actually struggled to generate momentum since the company’s latest earnings announcement in late March, suggesting that investors are no longer piling into this growth stock en masse.Part of this has to do with muted expectations for the entire memory market going forward, with many bearish traders calling for the expiration of cyclical growth trends to cause a major pullback soon. However, Micron’s outlook was relatively sound just a month and a half ago, and its growth prospects appear strong for at least the next year.This means that Micron has entered an extremely attractive territory for value investors. In fact, it might be one of the strongest value plays in the entire technology sector. Here’s three reasons why Micron looks so cheap right now.Forward 12-Month EarningsMicron shares are currently trading at a significant discount to the company’s peer group in terms of forward 12-month earnings: Micron’s peer group includes Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), Seagate (STX  -  Free Report), and Toshiba. Each of these companies has expertise in different areas and are not always directly competing, but they all reflect the commoditization of the memory business.As we can see, Micron is cheaper than this group when looking at its Forward P/E. This tried-and-true value metric accounts for the company’s expected profits over the next year, so investors can rest assured that they are getting a great price for Micron based on its future outlook.PEG RatioIn addition to the Forward P/E, value investors are always interested in a stock’s PEG ratio. Here’s how Micron has stacked up against its peers recently: The PEG is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company’s expected earnings growth rate. Some investors are willing to pay premiums for companies with explosive growth potential, but the PEG helps value investors find stocks that are both undervalued and set to expand rapidly.As we can see, Micron’s PEG has traded basically in line with its peer group over the past year, but this stills comes in at a noticeable discount to the average of 1.9 displayed by our larger “Computer and Technology” sector.Improving Analyst OutlookThe above metrics have helped Micron earn an “A” grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. Of course, this is only part of the picture for most value investors. Indeed, we have found that “cheap” stocks are the strongest when they are paired with great Zacks Ranks.The proven Zacks Rank model, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions, helps highlight stocks that are poised to provide superior returns over the next one to three months. Micron is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and this is because of the company’s improving analyst earnings outlook.Within the past 60 days, Micron has witnessed nine revisions to its full-year EPS estimates, with 100% agreement to the upside among revising analysts. These positive revisions have lifted our consensus estimate for the company’s 2018 earnings by 48 cents in that time. Micron is now expected to report EPS growth of 122% on revenue growth of nearly 44% this year.Bottom LineMicron has experience volatility lately, but the stock is looking to rebound strongly, and key valuation metrics indicate that shares are likely being underpriced by the market right now. Meanwhile, an improving earnings outlook underscores the company’s strength in the near term. This should make investors optimistic right now.Want more market analysis from this author?

747,WDC,"Waters Corp (WAT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 24.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.17%. In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings of $2.51 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents.Net sales of $687 million beat the consensus mark and increased 9% year over year. The growth was driven by robust performance in the bio/pharmaceutical end markets, and the government and academic market.Shares have returned 8.7% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 0.9%. Factors to ConsiderWaters Corp’s leading position in the high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry markets is its key strength and has acted as a sturdy revenue driver for the past few quarters. The company is anticipated to benefit from strong growth potential in pharmaceutical business.The company is also witnessing encouraging trends in its industrial businesses driven by increasing regulation around food safety and quality, strict conditions for food testing, along with environmental and fine chemical applications. Waters Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Waters Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Waters Corporation Quote The governmental and academic markets have also turned its performance around and looks poised to maintain the growth trend, in the to-be-reported quarter.However, fluctuating demand in the Americas remains a concern. Further, rising outlay on the company’s research & development will push expenses higher and hurt immediate profits. Moreover, intensifying competition is a key concern.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Waters Corp has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of 1.63%, which indicates a likely positive surprise.

750,WDC,"Data compiled by independent research firms — Gartner Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) and International Data Corporation (“IDC”) – shows mixed results for PC shipments in first-quarter 2018. The figures as well as opinions of the two research firms are widely different.The preliminary data released by Gartner depicts that PC shipment in the quarter shrunk 1.4% year over year to 61.7 million units. This also marks the 14th straight quarter of year-over-year fall — the longest duration of decline in the PC industry’s history.Gartner noted that sluggish shipment in the Asia/Pacific region, particularly in China, resulted in the decline. Per Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, “Some state-owned and large enterprises postponed new purchases or upgrades, awaiting new policies and officials’ reassignments after the session of the National People’s Congress in early March” resulting in a lackluster demand across China’s business market.This apart, Kitagawa also mentioned that vendors have been waiting for Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) new eighth generation core processors, thus, taking a cautious approach toward overstocking. Also, some inventory carryover from fourth-quarter 2017 impacted first-quarter 2018 shipment.Nevertheless, IDC has a different view. Per the research firm, the PC market continued to display a stabilizing trend, with shipment remaining flat at 60.4 million units during the quarter as compared with the year-ago quarter.The results indicate that PC vendors have been benefiting from continued upgrades to Windows 10 systems by business community and elevated demand for premium notebooks from consumer as well as commercial segments, per the research firm.We believe the disparity in data and comments might be due to the different techniques used by the firms for tracking PC sales, as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products, specially Chromebooks, which run on Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Chrome operating system.Notably, unlike Gartner, IDC includes Chromebooks. Gartner, on the other hand, takes into account Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) tablets and detachable, such as the iPad Pro and the Asus Transformer.Different Takes on Component PricesThe firms have different take on component prices. Per Gartner, material prices are still rising as “component companies remain cautious about expanding their production capabilities” due to softness in the smartphone market and prevailing uncertainty in the PC market.This has resulted in escalated average selling prices (ASPs) of PCs. Kitagawa further noted, ""With fewer people buying new machines, manufacturers need to get the highest profit margin from each sale. To do that, they are raising the selling points and focusing on customer experience or perception of value.""On the contrary, per IDC, pricing has eased as component supply has improved from the first-quarter 2017 level.Computer - Peripheral Equipment Industry 5YR % Return Computer - Peripheral Equipment Industry 5YR % ReturnRegion-Wise PerformanceTalking about the geographical performance, the firms have a slightly different opinion. Per Gartner, Asia/Pacific and the U.S. regions registered declines of 3.9% and 2.9%, respectively, while all other regions recorded marginal growth. As already discussed above, China chiefly gave rise to the dismal performance in the Asia/Pacific region, registering a 5.7% decline in unit shipment.On the other hand, IDC noted modest growth in the United States, after six straight quarters of decline, while Japan retained its growth momentum for the seventh consecutive quarter. The Latin America region continues to show its recovery trend. However, like Gartner, IDC too stated that the Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) (APeJ) region witnessed a soft performance.Top Vendors ListAlthough both research firms’ data varies, the organizations have similar views when it comes to positioning the top three vendors. The firms agree that HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) continues to be the market leader in this space, followed by Lenovo and Dell.However, for the fourth and fifth spot, the firms’ opinions differ. Per Gartner, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) holds the fourth position and Acer is placed at the fifth spot. On the other hand, IDC ranks Acer fourth and Apple in the fifth position.Both firms agreed that Dell recorded strongest year-over-year growth in the first quarter. Moreover, per Gartner, Dell replaced HP in the United States, climbing up the ladder to the top spot.What’s AheadAlthough the overall PC market is still plagued with challenges, we believe it is moving toward stabilization. According to Gartner’s report, shipment declined for the 14th consecutive quarter, but we note that the fall has moderated.Furthermore, the forward-looking statement of IDC clears the scenario. Neha Mahajan, senior research analyst, Devices & Displays at IDC, stated that ""A likely rise in commercial activity amidst a positive economic environment is expected to further strengthen demand. The retail platform too shows signs of stability especially with a fast-growing gaming community adding to the confidence.""An improving trend in PC shipment will benefit business prospects of companies like HP Inc., Intel, Seagate Technologies (STX  -  Free Report) and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), which continue to depend substantially on PC sales.Of the firms discussed above, Western Digital sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while HP Inc. and Seagate carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Intel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

751,WDC,"The U.S. and China might be closer to resolving their trade issues after President Xi Jinping noted that his country will look to further open the Chinese economy to outsiders. There are no guarantees just yet, but markets seem to be a bit less jittery recently. This means now might be a good time to buy back in on the industry that drove indexes to historic heights.Trade war turmoil and interest-related concerns led the market and some of the best-performing stocks to sink over the last few months, exemplified by major losses from Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and other technology industry powers. However, Facebook’s dive is based mostly on company-specific problems related to its recent data breach scandal. Meanwhile, many tech stocks still boast strong fundamentals that could see them continue to surge as the market calms.With that said, let’s take a look at three of these stocks that currently present pre-selloff positivity when you dig into some of their current metrics.1.     Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report)Applied Materials operates within an industry—memory and data storage—that is only going to grow as the IoT and connected devices ecosystem expands. Shares of this wafer fabrication firm are still up more than 43% over the last year in spite of AMAT’s nearly month-long downturn. Applied Materials’ outlook also remains strong, with our Current Zacks Consensus Estimates calling for revenues to climb 25.5% to reach $4.45 billion this quarter. The company’s bottom line expansion is expected to be even better at 43%.AMAT is also currently trading with a Forward P/E of 12.2, which marks a substantial discount to its industry’s 16.1 average. Investors should be excited to see that they can buy AMAT at a cheaper earnings multiple than many of its peers, while still expecting big year-over-year top and bottom line growth. Lastly, Applied Materials is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that has earned a ton of upward earnings estimate revisions recently.2.       Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report)A few years ago, Western Digital saw its stock price plummet. Today, the data storage solutions firm that helped kick off the computer storage industry looks ready to grow. WDC is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is projected to see it quarterly revenues climb by more than 6% to reach $4.93 billion.Western Digital’s downturn might have forced management to focus more heavily on earnings, which is demonstrated by WDC’s current quarterly and full-year EPS growth projections of 36.4% and 52%, respectively. Western Digital is also currently trading at 7.6x forward earnings, which marks a major discount against the “Computer- Storage Devices” industry’s average Forward P/E of 11.7. Investors might consider buying WDC ahead of its upcoming quarterly earnings report as it is currently trading well below its 52-week high. This means a better price could be hard to come by for some time.3.       Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)Amazon needs no introduction these days as Jeff Bezos’ company seemingly enters a new sector of the economy every other day. Despite its size and strength, AMZN saw its stock price tumble nearly 10% over the last month. Yet while President Donald Trump’s Twitter (TWTR) attacks against Amazon may persist, the company’s revenues are expected to surge 40.4% this quarter to reach $50.16 billion.Furthermore, the recent selloff makes Amazon’s stock price look rather inexpensive considering that the company is expected to expand its bottom line by nearly 87% this year. Amazon is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that can afford to spend money to enter new growth industries, such as fintech, while its AWS cloud business stabilizes its earnings.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

752,WDC,"VeriSign Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26.   We note that the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 2.30%.Last quarter, VeriSign reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 96 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but marked an increase of 4 cents from the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 3.2% year over year to $296 million and came slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $295 million.For the first quarter of 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for VeriSign’s earnings per share and total revenues are pegged at $1.06 and $298 million, respectively, representing an increase of 10.4% and 3.1% from the year-ago period.VeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise VeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | VeriSign, Inc. QuoteDomain Registration to Drive Growth VeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The company is the exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Per the company’s agreement with ICANN, the annual fee for a .net domain name registration has been increased from $8.20 to $9.02 effective Feb. 1, 2018.We believe that increasing domain name registration coupled with price hikes for domain names will drive the top line.According to the company’s latest “The Domain Name Industry Brief”, domain name registrations across all top-level domains (TLDs) signal a positive trend, increasing 0.5% sequentially to approximately 332.4 million across TLDs at the end of the fourth quarter. Domain name registrations increased 3.1 million or 0.9% year over year.On a combined basis, .com and .net domain names improved 2.4% year over year to approximately 146.1 million in the December quarter. Reportedly, new .com and .net registrations were 9 million compared with 8.8 million in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for active domain names ending .com and .net for the first quarter stands at 148 million, indicating an increase of 2.8% from the year-ago figure.We note that the company continues to benefit from strong demand in the United States as well as in international markets. VeriSign reported that .com continued to maintain its position as the largest TLD, followed by .cn (China) and .tk (Tokelau).For the first quarter, VeriSign projects domain name base registration to increase in the range of 1.5 million to 2 million.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) are best avoided.VeriSign has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.83%. This indicates a likely positive surprise.

754,WDC,"Stocks moved slightly lower on Monday as traders grow increasingly cautious about range-bound indexes and fresh volatility in the healthcare and oil sectors, but overall, investors have remained optimistic in recent trading periods thanks to better-than-expected earnings results and strong guidance.Heading into the week, total Q1 earnings for the 154 members of the S&P 500 that had already reported were up 25.4% from the year-ago period on 10.3% higher revenues. About 80% of these companies surpassed EPS estimates, and 72.1% managed to top sales estimates.Among these reporting companies, many have been some of the world’s top technology firms, underscoring the sector’s ability to maintain the strength it has presented over the past few years. Overall, earnings growth expected to surpass 20% in the technology sector.But which technology bellwethers have led the charge so far this report season? Make sure to take a look at these three companies that recently crushed estimates!1. Amazon.com, Inc.

The company reported adjusted earnings of $3.27 per share, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22 per share. Meanwhile, total revenue was up 43% year over year and forecasted Q2 revenue was on the high end of our prior consensus estimate.Amazon also notched net sales of $5.44 billion in its Web Services unit, marking growth of 49% from the prior-year period and coming in ahead of our consensus estimate. Further, the company reported first quarter physical stores sales of $4.26 billion, underscoring the scope of the Whole Foods acquisition.Amazon is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). 2. Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report)Memory solutions giant Western Digital also reported its latest quarterly results last week.

WDC also posted revenue of about $5 billion, edging out our consensus estimate of $4.94 billion and improving 7.5% year over year.Western Digital’s strong results helped relieve some tension in the memory space, with many investors assuming cyclical trends had likely run their course and predicating a pullback soon. Still, the stock has struggled to generate much momentum since its report, indicating that volatility is still lingering.Nevertheless, an improving earnings outlook has earned the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). 3. Baidu Inc. (BIDU  -  Free Report)Chinese internet powerhouse also cruised past earnings estimates recently, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $2.60 that comfortably outpaced our consensus estimate of $1.73.

755,WDC,"Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 25.Earlier this month, CBS Corp (CBS) offered a below market bid for Viacom, which was immediately rejected. The CBS offer of 0.55 shares for each Viacom class B share failed to impress the owner of Nickelodeon and MTV networks.The company believes a market price of 0.62 is suitable. Notably, it expects cost synergy of $1 billion from the merger.Notably, Viacom beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.09%. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. Viacom Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Viacom Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Viacom Inc. Quote Viacom’s top-line has also beaten the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters. In the last quarter, revenues came in at $3.07 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.14 billion and decreased 7.6% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderShares of Viacom have lost 0.4% on a year-to-date basis as compared with the industry’s decline of 2.5%. The decline can be attributed to the ongoing scuffle over the merger with CBS.  Moreover, growth projections are muted. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings of 80 cents per share represents a year-over-year increase of 1.3%. However, the consensus sales expectations for the second quarter stand at $3.03 billion, representing year-over-year decline of 6.91%.Viacom is likely to be hurt by weak affiliate revenues in the United States owing to loss of subscribers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2018 affiliate revenues is pegged at $1.14 billion, unchanged on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, management expects domestic ad revenues to improve sequentially in the second quarter. Ratings improvement, new original programming content, greater carriage benefits from improved distributor penetration and higher contribution from digital initiatives are key catalysts.However, the company’s performance on the international front is anticipated to be much better driven by expanding market share in Latin America and India.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Viacom has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.77%, which indicates a likely positive surprise.

757,WDC,"Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25.In the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 9.79%, beating estimates in each. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.Moreover, Comcast’s top-line has beaten the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters. In the last-quarter, revenues came in at $21.92 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.80 billion and increased 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderComcast has completed the nationwide rollout of its wireless services under the Xfinity Mobile brand. Based on a Mobile Virtual Network Operator agreement with Verizon, Xfinity Mobile uses Verizon's 4G LTE wireless network. Comcast Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Comcast Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Comcast Corporation Quote Comcast continues to add new features like the voice remote (more than 20 million currently deployed) and has integrated YouTube, Pandora and iHeartRadio. These features are likely to improve customer engagement, consequently benefiting top-line growth.Moreover, the company continues to roll out xFi pod extenders to increased Wi-Fi coverage in the home and its xFi app, which offers an unrivaled level of control. Increasing demand for high-speed internet presents significant growth opportunity for Comcast. The company’s broadband penetration currently stands at 45%.Business Services have been witnessing strong momentum and continue to present attractive growth prospects. Comcast has started deploying fiber-based 2 Gbps residential broadband Internet services in certain regions. Known as Gigabit Pro, this new service runs on FTTH technology.Comcast Business has also announced the launch of DOCSIS 3.1-based internet service to business customers.Moreover, Comcast’s strategy of consistent investment in new attractions at the company’s theme parks is expected to drive growth for NBCUniversal in the to-be-reported quarter.However, we remain concerned about the company’s operation in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market. Comcast lost 33,000 video customers and 13,000 voice customers in the fourth-quarter 2017, due to cord-cutting and stiff competition.Additionally, we view the company's high-debt levels and consolidation-related woes as potential hazards.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Comcast has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.42%, which indicates an unlikely positive surprise.

The company expects to deliver growth consistent with the industry rate.Briefing on Joint Venture StatusManagement noted that joint venture (“JV”) with Toshiba Memory Corporation (""TMC"") is proceeding smoothly.In December 2017, Western Digital had settled its dispute with long-time JV partner, Toshiba, over the divestiture of TMC. The company gave consent to the transfer of Toshiba’s equity interests in the JVs to TMC.

762,WDC,"On Apr 10, shares of Seagate Technology Inc. (STX  -  Free Report) rallied about 5.4% to $59.35 per share on the heels of a rating upgrade from Morgan Stanley.Analyst Katy Huberty upgraded Seagate from “equal weight” to “overweight,” with a $72 price target. Huberty stated, ""We believe accelerating IT budget and data storage growth in the Data Era are underappreciated by investors.""The upgrade follows an increased interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Exponential growth in stored data, Nearline’s rapid adoption, stable HDD pricing environment and low inventory levels are positives. We believe this could be a potential long-term growth driver for Seagate, making the stock a lucrative opportunity for investors who want to capitalize on this shift in the storage industry.Strong Demand for HDD: Key CatalystHDD requirement is growing due to strong demand for high-capacity mass-storage solutions. Per management, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, 10-terabyte helium nearline product was one of the major top-line drivers. 12-terabyte helium product is also gaining favor among users. High customer satisfaction is likely to boost the market adoption of these products.Further, stabilization of the PC market per the latest report from Gartner and IDC bodes well for memory shipments, particularly HDDs. According to IDC, worldwide PC shipment has shown signs of growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, during which shipments grew 0.7% on a year-over-year basis to 70.6 million units.Seagate also expects its exabyte shipments to be around 88 exabytes, which reflects drive shipments to be around 40 million and average capacity per drive to be approximately 2.2 terabytes. The company has experienced exabyte growth in all end markets that include PC compute, consumer, surveillance, gaming, and NAS markets.Other PositivesNotably, the shares of this second largest manufacturer of HDDs have returned 22.8% year over year, substantially outperforming the industry’s rally of 19.4%.Additionally, advancement of cloud storage technologies in the industry is a tailwind. This has led to an increase in the deployment of high capacity mass storage products, which bodes well for Seagate.Moreover, the company’s long-term agreement with Toshiba for NAND chips supply will help it to expand product portfolio rapidly. Further, Seagate’s effort to improve areal density with the ramp up of heat assisted magnetic recording (“HAMR”) technology is expected to be shipped in 2019. This is likely to drive revenues in 2019.These factors are expected to keep Seagate’s earnings per share (EPS) on a growth trajectory, which is currently projected at 15.6%. Notably, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters.Currently, Seagate is a Zacks #3 (Hold) Ranked stock with a VGM score of A.Stocks to ConsiderFew better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), Applied Materials, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $1.11.TI shares have returned 0.9% compared with the industry’s year-to-date rally of 13.9%. Key FactorsTI is anticipated to benefit from strength in several high-margin & high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets.The company’s increasing exposure to the industrial and automotive markets is positive. However, weakness in communications equipment and personal electronics markets are likely to negatively impact top-line growth.TI’s analog business has been witnessing growth for the last four quarters driven by robust performance in almost all the product lines.We expect this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter, given TI’s compelling product line and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter analog output.Notably, the company enjoys cost advantage on every wafer that it builds using the 300-millimeter technology against 200-millimeter technology. This competitive advantage is expected to drive growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $2.44 billion. Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Texas Instruments Incorporated Quote Embedded Processing has also benefited from growth across all product lines. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment is currently pegged at $893 million.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates.

(FTNT  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has partnered with IBM’s (IBM  -  Free Report) X-Force Threat Management Services, based on the principles of the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework.Per the press release, “IBM Security has been a Fortinet Fabric-Ready partner since 2017.” The combination of Fortinet Security Fabric and IBM’s expertise in the cyber security domain is expected to be beneficial for the duo’s mutual customers.The combination of integrated threat intelligence and automated response to threats is expected to meet the requirements of digital businesses.

768,WDC,"When considering valuation metrics, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has always been the obvious choice as calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, in case of companies that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profits, price-to-sales (P/S) is a good valuation metric to identify cheap stocks.Other than P/E and P/S, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use tool for zeroing in on low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.What is Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:Barclays plc (BCS  -  Free Report), a major global banking and financial services company, has a projected 3-5 year EPS growth rate of 28.9%.

771,WDC,"Synopsys Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) recently announced that its board of directors has replenished its ongoing share repurchase program to its limit of $500 million.Notably, the stock repurchase program has been in effect since 2002 and the allotted capital has been refilled depending on the availability of funds. However, Synopsys is not obligated to buy back any specific number of shares and the program may be terminated depending on the company’s decision.In fiscal 2017, Synopsys repurchased stock worth $380 million. At the end of fiscal 2017, the company had $400 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization of $500 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company bought back $180 million worth of its common stock, following which the fund was refilled.According to the company, accelerated share repurchase (ASR) arrangements are an integral part of its overall efforts to enhance investors’ worth. In fiscal 2017, the company either initiated or completed $325 million worth of ASR. Prior to that, in December 2015, it initiated a $200 million ASR program while in December 2014, it started a $180 million ASR program that was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.We believe that apart from strategic investments, the company’s continuous focus on such shareholder-friendly initiatives will help the company’s shares rebound going forward. Notably, Synopsys has rallied 16.1% over the past year, underperforming the 30.4% surge of the industry it belongs to.Additionally, the company’s raised fiscal 2018 guidance is encouraging. The company’s recent acquisitions of Black Duck Software and Kilopass Technology are expected to boost the top line in the long run. Moreover, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable Synopsys to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to consumers.However, escalating costs and expenses, which have been dampening margins, remain headwinds. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies and heightening competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems Inc.

That is because WDC recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom.What is a Hammer Chart Pattern? A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting. The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day, but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price.

782,WDC,"Investors always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless you are blessed with Midas touch.When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. So, the chance of outperformance is high when the market moves higher.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we would recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial Health Questions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.What’s the Optimum Strategy?However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book, price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should give you even better results as they eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), which develops, manufactures and sells data storage devices and solutions, delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4% in the trailing four quarters.

Click-to-Messenger Ads also holds promise for advertisers as it helps them get into direct communication with consumers.Stories continues to be a key growth driver, with WhatsApp Status recording highest number of views. The availability of carousel ads in Stories is also a positive.Between WhatsApp and Messenger, people send nearly 100 billion messages every day. Video and voice calling of more than 3 billion minutes per day has made Facebook “the largest network for video calling.”Facebook recently launched WhatsApp Business, an app designed to facilitate communication between small and medium businesses and customers, which has almost 3 million users.Additionally, the company is also running tests of payments in messaging, which is anticipated to help increase efficiency for businesses.Quarterly Numbers in DetailsMonthly active users (MAUs) were up 13% year over year to a staggering 2.20 billion at the end of the quarter.Daily Active Users (DAUs) were 1.45 billion, reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase.

Mobile ad revenues surged 60% year over year to $10.7 billion, contributing 91% to total ad revenues.Facebook has over 6 million active advertisers and Instagram has 2 million.

Facebook hired 2,600 people (highest in history) during the quarter. The company focuses primarily on strengthening its technical team apart from various other fields.

Consequently, this will empower the new cloud businesses with a secure single sign-on and unified access.The company’s mPulse real user monitoring solution is now updated with application delivery, perceived performance and page construction metrics. This will aid Akamai’s platform to deliver fast as well as secure mobile and web experience.According to company's Retail Performance Report, a 2 second delay in loading a web page increases bounce rate by 103%.

All these events have kept the market on tenterhooks with investors scurrying for a safe haven.What’s the Optimum Strategy?Warren Buffett once said, “It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.” The strategy is very simple – find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth.Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. So chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward.There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential. Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company’s business. One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking, if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis – the lower the number, the better.Why Price to Cash Flow?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E).

On the other hand, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio.

787,WDC,"The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is widely considered by investors as a yardstick for evaluating the fair market value of a stock. Many value investors prefer to take the P/E route in their quest for stocks that are trading at bargain prices. However, even this ubiquitously used equity valuation multiple is not devoid of limitations.Is EV/EBITDA a Better Alternative to P/E?While P/E enjoys significant popularity in the value investing world, a more complicated metric called EV/EBITDA gains an upper hand as it offers a clearer image of a firm’s valuation and earnings potential. EV/EBITDA, also referred to as enterprise multiple, determines the total value of a firm while P/E considers just its equity portion.EV/EBITDA is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. In a nutshell, it is the entire value of a company.The other constituent of the ratio, EBITDA is a true reflection of a company’s profitability as it strips out non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Usually, the lower the EV/EBITDA ratio, the more enticing it is. A low EV/EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued.  However, unlike P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet. For this reason, EV/EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets. Stocks with a low EV/EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates.Moreover, P/E can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A company’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. In contrast, EV/EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are EBITDA-positiveEV/EBITDA is also a useful tool in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, the ratio allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels.However, EV/EBITDA is also not without its shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock’s inherent potential and future performance. The ratio varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements.As such, instead of just banking on EV/EBITDA, you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen true value stocks. Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks:EV/EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV/EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 14 stocks that passed the screen:United Natural Foods, Inc.

788,WDC,"Fortinet Inc. (FTNT  -  Free Report) has been an investor favorite for quite some time as evident from its price momentum. The stock has gained 45.9% in the past year, substantially outperforming the 32.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Let’s delve deeper and take a look at the key aspects aiding the company’s performance.The stock has a stellar record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 20.1%.In the last reported fourth-quarter 2017 results, the company’s non-GAAP earnings of 32 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents and also increased from the year-ago figure of 30 cents per share.A large number of deal wins and customer additions  aided top-line growth in the quarter that increased 14.8% year over year to reach $416.7 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $409 million.We believe Fortinet’s initiative to change its business model to a subscription-based service provider will drive the company’s bottom line in the long run. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generates more than 50% of the total revenues from these services, which  led to a 70 bps expansion in 2017 gross margin. We anticipate this strategy to continue to drive the company’s bottom-line performance.Notably, per a recent report by Markets and Markets, the cyber security market is expected to witness CAGR of 11% in the 2017-2022 period. These predictions bode well for Fortinet, which has a diversified product portfolio for PCs, mobile and enterprise security. Furthermore, Fortinet has partnered with Exodus Intelligence, Cisco ACI, NTT Communications and VMware NSX Partner Ecosystem to provide best-in-class cyber security solutions.We believe all these positives make this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock a must have in investors' portfolio.Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) and Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA, Micron and Western Digital have long-term expected EPS growth rates of 10.3%, 10% and 19%, respectively.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

789,WDC,"Pure Storage Inc. (PSTG  -  Free Report) recently announced plans of offering $450 million of convertible senior notes in a private placement.The interest rate, conversion rate and certain other terms of the notes are yet to be determined.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have gained 89.2% in the past year, substantially outperforming the industry’s rally of 25.6%.Delving into the HeadlinesThe notes will be offered to qualified institutional buyers only, and in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The company will also give the initial purchasers of the notes an option to buy up to an additional $67.5 million aggregate principal amount of the notes to cover any over allotment.Interest on the notes will be paid semi-annually and mature in 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.In connection with the pricing of the notes, Pure Storageexpects to enter into more convertible note hedge transactions with the initial purchasers or their affiliates if required.The company also anticipates utilizing certain portion of the net proceeds to pay the cost of the capped call transactions. The remaining net proceeds will be used for working capital, general corporate purposes and to repurchase up to $20 million of shares of its Class A common stock.Cash PositionThe enhanced capital deployment reflects Pure Storage’s strong balance sheet and confidence in long-term business prospects. The company exited the year ended Jan 31, 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $183.7 million.Positive free cash flow for the full-year ended Jan 31, 2018 was reported for the first time in the company’s history at $7.7 million, compared with ($61.2 million) fiscal 2017. This can be attributed to strong performance in the quarter and employee stock purchase worth $11.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.We believe that the company has a strong balance sheet, which will help it in capitalizing on investment opportunities and pursuing strategic acquisitions, further improving growth prospects. Moreover, the senior notes offering will lower its cost of capital, consequently strengthening balance sheet and supporting growth.Bottom LineThe company’s strong product portfolio including the likes of FlashArray, FlashStack and FlashBlade business segments aid in bolstering the top line. Additionally, the company’s data platform for cloud is gaining traction.Pure Storage continues to focus on three major aspects, namely increasing cloud customer base, solidifying the position of its next generation workload related core data infrastructure and tapping large enterprises as they “cloudify” their on-premise IT infrastructure.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.

790,WDC,"After enduring the toughest start to the year in recent times, markets have started the second quarter on a sorry note. U.S. stocks have had their most disappointing start to April since 1929. And now trade war and tech stock related concerns are threatening to cause a deeper correction for the markets.Historically, however, April has been a good month for stock gains. Also, first-quarter earnings are likely to be strong, coming on the back of strong fourth numbers. A flurry of recent reports also suggests that the economy continues to be resilient.And it remains to be seen whether Trump follows up on all the warnings he has issued recently. Taking all these factors into consideration, picking large-cap stocks which promise considerable returns may be a good idea at this point.April Historically Strong for StocksGoing by historical data, April has traditionally been a productive month for U.S. stocks. Data from the Stock Trader’s Almanac for 2018 shows that the Dow has gained 1.9% on average during April since 1950. This means that April is the most profitable month for the Dow, going by average monthly returns.Other major indexes also fair well during April, per the Almanac. For both the small-cap heavy Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, April is the third-best month of the year. Both these indexes have increased 1.5% on the average every April since 1950. April is also the fourth-best month for the Nasdaq. The tech-heavy index has notched up a 1.4% average gain during the month, per historical data.Data from independent broker-dealer LPL Financial shows that gains in April have been particularly notable during the last few years. The S&P 500 has ended April with gains 90% of the time over the past 10 years. The index has notched up an average gain of 2.2% over this period. The success rate of 90% is the highest for any month during this period. Also, average monthly gains are the third highest, after March and July. Strong Economy, Q1 Earnings to Boost StocksThe U.S. economy had finished 2017 on a strong note, growing faster during the fourth quarter than earlier estimated. Business investment expanded during this period even as consumer spending hit a three-year high.The first economic reports for April indicate that the economy continues to be resilient. Though the ISM Manufacturing Index dipped slightly, the economy as a whole expanded for the 107th consecutive month. Construction spending also inched up in February.Meanwhile, the outlook for first-quarter earnings is particularly bright, coming on the back of strong results for the fourth quarter. As of Mar 23, total Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index were expected to be up +15.9% from the same period last year on +7.3% higher revenues. This would follow +13.5% earnings growth on +8.5% revenue growth in the preceding period. (Read: Handicapping the Q1 Earnings Season)Our ChoicesStocks have recently been buffeted by the twin concerns of an impending trade war with China and losses for tech stocks. While losses for tech stocks are likely temporary, it remains to be seen whether Trump follows up on his warnings or opts for a compromise. Meanwhile, April remains a historically good month for stocks. Also, while the economy remains strong, prospects for first-quarter earnings remain encouraging.Given this backdrop, it seems prudent to bet on relatively stable alternatives which hold out the promise of considerable returns. Large-cap stocks are relatively safer bets. At the same time, it is important to consider only those which offer the promise of short-term benefits and the prospect of good long-term performance. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks, each of which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a good VGM Score.

791,WDC,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) appears a promising pick at the moment driven by stellar second-quarter 2018 results, strong product portfolio strength and expanding partner base. Moreover, it has been a favorite with investors, courtesy of its rising share price and strong fundamentals.The companyhas been witnessing upward estimate revisions, reflecting analysts’ optimism. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 1.1% upward, over the last 60 days. Consequently, the stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Itsshares have returned 12.2% over the three months, substantially outperforming the 0.6% rally of the industry.Notably, the companyhas a number of other aspects that make it an lucrative investment option.5 Reasons Why Western Digitalis an Attractive PickUpbeat Q2 Results: Western Digital delivered second-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $3.95 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 cents and soared 71.7% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues also increased 9.2% year over year to $5.34 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.29 billion. The strong top-line growth reflected healthy demand in the company’s end-markets for high capacity enterprise hard drives and flash-based products.Stock Looks Undervalued: From a valuation perspective, the stock looks very attractive as it currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate, which signifies a huge upward potential. Western Digitalcurrently trades at a forward P/E of 6.61x compared with the industry group average of 7.50x.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Western Digitalhas an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 6.4%.Strong Hold in SSD storage market: Western Digital has been expanding into the SSD storage market due to the decline in the PC market. SSDs are faster and more energy efficient than traditional hard drives. The secular growth of digital data, modest improvement in the TAM and higher demand for storage will remain the catalysts for storage in general and especially for SSDs. This persuaded TechNavio to project enterprise SSD market to grow at a CAGR of 17% during 2016-2020. The SSD segment’s growth potential is a major positive for Western Digital because this could mitigate the losses stemming from the secular decline in the PC market, which does not necessarily use SSDs.Active on the Acquisition Front: The acquisition of SanDisk has opened new avenues of growth for Western Digital and will help it boost market traction in the newer storage technology — SSD. The merger will lead to economies of scale, lower costs, greater market reach and acquisitions of new technologies, among other synergies.The Amplidata, sTec, Inc., Velobit, Inc. Arkeia Software Solutions and Virident Systems Inc. acquisitions have not only strengthened its small-to-medium sized business solutions but also expanded its SSD product portfolio. Moreover, the company’s strong cash balance of $6.27 billion and positive operating cash flow of $1.18 billion at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2018 enabled it to expand through acquisitions. These strategic takeovers are expected to provide the company with a competitive edge.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1.Applied Materials, NVIDIA and Seagate Technology have a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 13.26%, 10.25% and 15.6%, respectively.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

792,WDC,"Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY  -  Free Report) has performed well last year. The stock has returned 28.2% during the said time frame, outperforming the industry’s rally of 23.4%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 22% and a market cap of $2.7 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors need to hold on to if they are looking to reap long-term gains.Let’s take a look at the factors aiding the company’s performance.The company’s Software as a Service (SaaS) based human capital management (HCM) services have aided top-line growth. The company’s revenues came in at $86 million, reflecting an increase of 25% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.We also remain positive about Paylocity’s regular investments in SaaS technology as the adoption of SaaS HCM solutions is increasing among corporations driven by its ability to minimize data integrity issues.Notably, during second-quarter fiscal 2018, the company enriched its portfolio with two additions namely, Compensation Management and Surveys. While Compensation Management is aimed at improving the process of rewarding employees, Surveys will assist in increasing organizational communication for gaining employee feedback.According to Gartner, the global SaaS market is expected to increase at a four-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) (2016–2020) of 18.4%. With its SaaS-based applications, we think that Paylocity is well poised to grab the growth opportunity in the market.Also, higher adoption of Paylocity’s ACA dashboard application, specializing in tracking employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability, is a major tailwind for the company.Additionally, the company’s recently announced acquisition of BeneFLEX HR Resources – a privately held employee benefit agency has enriched the company’s product suite with a host of benefit administration related solutions. This inorganic addition is also expected to be a top-line driver going ahead.On the last earnings call, Paylocity management stated that though the company’s R&D expenditure has increased but so has the adoption and usage rate of its platform. Notably, during the quarter, Paylocity had over a million users in a single month and this marked a new record for the company.All these justify the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s retention in investors’ portfolio.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) and Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report). While Western Digital sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Micron and Lam Research carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

793,WDC,"International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 18 after the market closes. Notably, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3.39%.IBM’s significant investments in “Strategic Imperatives” — cloud computing, mobile, cognitive technologies and AI are expected to help the company win customers and drive the top line in to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, IBM has also undertaken a number of blockchain initiatives to capitalize on growth opportunity in the industry which is a significant tailwind.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for IBM’s earnings per share and total revenues are projected to be $5.17 and $21.96 billion representing an increase of 3.2% and 0.9% from fourth-quarter fiscal 2016.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cloud, Security & IoT to Drive GrowthIBM is focusing on cloud computing which is evident from the fact that it continues to open data centers aggressively. Globally, the company owns 60 data centers across 19 countries.Cloud is included in the Cognitive Solutions (including Watson) and Global Business Services (GBS). Notably, cloud revenues surged 20% from the year-ago quarter in the last reported quarter. Security revenues have advanced 49%. Growth can be attributed to robust performance of security software solutions and strong demand for the pervasive encryption capabilities in new z14 mainframe.Internet of Things (IoT) revenues increased double digits. IBM signed almost 40 new clients on its IoT platform. The company also launched new products like IoT for Connected Products during the quarter.Moreover, Strategic Imperatives (cloud, analytics, mobility and security) grew 10% at constant currency from the year-ago quarter.In recent times, IBM’s cloud-based offerings have been selected by the likes of Syniverse, State of Arizona, Codify Academy, Italian airport operator SEA and Germany-based leading automotive supplier Faurecia.The initiatives are anticipated to improve IBM’s competitive position in the cloud computing market currently dominated by Amazon’s Web Services and Microsoft Corp.Notably, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from Cognitive Solutions and GBS are pegged at $6.378 billion and $4.235, up 6.3% and 0.3%, respectively, from the actual figure reported in the prior-year quarter.Blockchain Initiatives Gaining MomentumIBM is involved in a number of Blockchain initiatives as the technology gains rapid mainstream adoption. The company is currently the dominant player in the blockchain market. Recently, CNBC quoted Juniper Research, which placed IBM above Microsoft Corporation in blockchain-related advancements.IBM uses hyperledger technology for blockchain applications and is also a key member of the Hyperledger committee. This enables the company to gain access to prior notification of any changes in the underlying infrastructure.IBM has been winning significant deals in recent times. The company has struck bank guarantee deals with ANZ and Westpac and a multi-line insurance contract with American International Group and Standard Chartered PLC. IBM has also inked a deal with global food suppliers and also one with automobile manufacturer, ZF Friedrichshafen to enhance its Car e-Wallet technology. All these efforts will contribute meaningfully to top-line growth in the upcoming quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model conclusively shows that IBM is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

794,WDC,"F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 25. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 10.8%. Notably, F5 Networks has a mixed earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the company’s results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice, came in line in another and missed in the other. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that F5 Networks is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it possesses the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Price and EPS Surprise | F5 Networks, Inc. QuoteWhat’s Behind This Overwhelming Expectation?F5 Networks is uniquely positioned to benefit from the growth prospects of the application-networking market as enterprises cope with the rapidly increasing capacity and security demands of next-generation applications and architectures. The company enjoys a strong foothold in the Layer 4-7 content switching market.Furthermore, during the fiscal first-quarter conference call, F5 Networks’ management was optimistic about the deployment of solutions by customers on cloud and on-premise environment, which is expected to drive near-term revenues.Additionally, the company is also taking steps to address the rising need of multi-cloud environment and better scaling of applications in an era where organizations are taking up digital transformation at an accelerated pace. To meet the requirement of the “per application based cloud decision” of companies, F5 Networks came up with per application VE solutions in the fiscal first quarter. These offerings are meant to support web-application firewall and management of traffic. The benefits from these moves will likely positively impact F5 Networks’ fiscal second-quarter results.We believe the company’s recently-launched iSeries platform, which is useful for new age applications such as Internet of Things, will have attracted new customers, thereby boosting its top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.30% and a Zacks Rank #1.

795,WDC,"Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) ad revenues are expected to hog the limelight as the company reports its first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25.Facebook has witnessed significant traction in online and mobile advertising spending in a short span of time. Notably, the company’s mobile ad business has fast emerged as a major contributor to its advertising revenues.In the last reported quarter, advertising revenues soared 48.1% year over year to $12.78 billion. Mobile ad revenues surged 57% year over year to $11.4 billion, contributing 89% to total ad revenues. Mobile-first video was 50% of the company’s video ad revenues in the fourth quarter compared with 41% in third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advertising revenues for first quarter 2018 stands at $11.23 billion, up 43% from the year-ago quarter figure but down 12% when compared sequentially.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q1 performance is likely to be.Let’s Delve DeeperFacebook’s huge user base of over 2.13 billion combined with Instagram’s strong user base of more than 800 million presents a much larger canvas for advertisers and makes the platform highly attractive.Facebook’s growing video initiatives are also driving video-based advertisements on the platform. Advertisers prefer video advertisements as these appear to be the most lucrative medium to attract the audience.However, since data misuse allegations surfaced against the company in mid-March, there has been growing tension among investors as to whether it would have an adverse impact on the company’s ad business.CEO Mark Zuckerberg maintains that the company has not witnessed any significant user attrition or decline in ad spend post the Cambridge Analytica data fiasco or the #DeleteFacebook campaign.Per Kenshoo, social ad spending in the quarter increased 37% year over year. Ad spending on Instagram doubled on the back of tripled growth in “clicks”. Instagram Stories is also gaining traction. It also notes that out of the total social spending, video ad spending accounted for 41%.We therefore expect ad revenues to have remained unaffected by the data fiasco, which surfaced toward the end of the quarter.Facebook, Inc.

796,WDC,"Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.97%. In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings of 69 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Although revenues of $2.86 billion lagged the consensus mark, the figure increased 3% year over year driven by solid result from the Wireless segment.Blended ARPU (average revenue per user) in the Wireless segment was $49.94, higher than $47.79 reported in the year-ago quarter.Reported under the Cable segment, Internet revenues increased 9% year over year to $325 million. Rogers Communications added 17K high-speed Internet customers and 9K telephony customers in the quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Intensifying Competition HurtsRogers Communications’ shares have lost 6.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 17% since the announcement of fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25.The decline, although narrower than industry, can be attributed to stiff competition in wireless and cable segment as well as softness in advertising market that is negatively impacting media revenues.Rogers Communications faces fierce wireless competition in Canada from large incumbents like TELUS, BCE Inc. (BCE  -  Free Report) and other small regional carriers. Moreover, Shaw Communications’ decision to venture into the Canadian wireless market with the WIND Mobile acquisition raises competition for Rogers Communications.Cable operations are also facing increased competition from BCE’s entry into cable TV services. Further, Rogers Communications, like many other cable companies, has lost viewers to video streaming service providers like Netflix. In recent times, the viewership of traditional cable TV players has been significantly impacted by the popularity of on-demand online videos.The company’s Media segment has been affected by continued softness in the advertising market. To remain competitive, Rogers Communications needs to invest heavily in new TV programs and channels. This may result in considerable cash drain thereby hurting liquidity.Wireless Strength: Key CatalystRogers Communications is expected to benefit from continuing strong demand for data by consumers and businesses. Improving Wireless penetration rate (87% at the end of the fourth quarter) is anticipated to boost subscriber base.We are bullish about Rogers Communications' wireless growth from the roll out of 700 MHz LTE lower block spectrum and the offering of Internet of Things (IoT) as a service to business enterprises.The roll out of lower block spectrum will provide better in-building penetration and rural LTE coverage. The IoT services include End-to-End Incident Management, Farm & Food Monitoring, and Level Monitoring to business enterprises.Positive Growth ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rogers Communications' full-year 2018 earnings of $3.13 per share represents a year-over-year increase of 15.5%. For the upcoming quarterly report, the company’s earnings are expected to grow 29.2% over the year-ago quarter to 62 cents per share. Rogers Communication, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Rogers Communication, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Rogers Communication, Inc. Quote The earnings growth is expected to come on the back of solid sales. The consensus sales expectations for the first quarter and full year 2018 are $2.75 billion and $11.81 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 8.9% and 8.3%, respectively.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter SaaS revenues stands at $51 million, higher as reported in the previous quarter.Strong Product Portfolio & BuyoutsWe are impressed by the company's efforts to expand its product portfolio.

798,WDC,"Are you still holding shares of Castlight Health Inc. (CSLT  -  Free Report) and waiting for a miracle to take the stock higher in the near term? If yes, then you might end up losing more money as chances of a turnaround appear bleak in the near term. This is apparent from the stock’s decline of 8% in the past year. Moreover, the industry which it belongs to grew 33.8% in the same time frame.Shares of the company also went down 5.5%, yesterday. Let’s delve deeper and try to find out what is taking this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company down the hill.The sharp decline in share price can primarily be attributed to dismal earnings surprise history. Evidently, fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 marked the company’s 10th straight bottom-line loss. The company reported a loss of 4 cents per share in the last quarter, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Non-GAAP gross margin also contracted 710 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 67.7%. Further, the company continues to invest heavily on research & development. Non-GAAP research & development expenses and general & administrative expenses expanded 690 bps and 100 bps, respectively, to 34.3% and 14.2%.Outlook Remains BleakCastlight also provided not so encouraging guidance.For 2018, the company forecasts revenues between $150 million and $155 million. The Zacks Consensus estimates is pegged at $153 million. Non-GAAP loss is expected between 11 cents and 15 cents per share.The company anticipates first-quarter 2018 revenues to decline by about $1 million sequentially. Moreover, gross margin is expected to contract sequentially as company’s investments increases. Operating loss is projected to increase due to revenue seasonality.Management expects to report break-even in fourth-quarter 2018. The company’s higher level of investments on research & development is anticipated to continue, as it focuses on expanding offerings globally.Moreover, adoption of ASC 606 is projected to negatively impact revenues in 2018. The company also expects cost of revenues and operating expense to be slightly lower in the year owing to adoption of the accounting standard.Downward Estimate RevisionLet’s look at Castlight’ earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company. Over the last 60 days, six fiscal 2018 estimates were revised downward with no northward revisions, resulting in the Zacks Consensus Estimate widening from a loss of 9 cents to a loss of 12 cents per share.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 has declined by 75% to 1 cent, over 60 days.So it may not be a good decision to retain this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't intend to wait for a long time.Stocks to ConsiderFew better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc.

799,WDC,"Shares of NETGEAR Inc. (NTGR  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $65.55, eventually closing a tad lower at $65.40 on Jan 12.The stock has returned 18.3% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 34.1%. However, NETGEAR’s expanding product portfolio and dominant position in the consumer WiFi market is expected to boost top-line growth and profitability. This will eventually help the stock rebound in 2018.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings has increased 6 cents to $2.93 over the last 30 days. The figure reflects year-over-year growth of 8.7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 sales is currently pegged at $1.56 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.8%.NETGEAR carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a market capital of $1.70 billion.Expanding Product Portfolio: Key CatalystRecently, at Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2018, NETGEAR launched Nighthawk Pro Gaming WiFi Router (XR500) and Nighthawk Pro Gaming SX10 10G/Multi-Gig LAN Switch (GS810EMX).The company also launched NETGEAR Armor powered by Bitdefender, a security solution that runs on NETGEAR routers and connected devices to actively detect and protect from cyber threats.NETGEAR also announced that Arlo Baby Smart HD Monitoring Camera (ABC1000A) will be compatible with Apple HomeKit later this quarter.Last quarter, the company launched Nighthawk X6S and Orbi Pro solutions with the patented FastLane3 technology.

800,WDC,"Technology stocks had a prolific run in 2017, courtesy of the rapid adoption of cloud-based platforms, increasing demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and significant progress in developing advanced driver assisted system (ADAS) solutions.Moreover, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices became part of the mainstream technology market driven by significant investments from tech bigwigs — Apple, Microsoft, Samsung and Facebook.Further, Internet of Things (IoT) technology made rapid strides in 2017. Consumer as well as industrial products and machines were embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.According to latest Earnings Trend, technology sector’s fourth-quarter earnings are expected to improve 14% from the same period last year on 8.5% higher revenues.Semiconductors Biggest GainersSemiconductors are primarily gaining from strong demand for power-efficient and high-performance chips. These are essential to run cloud-data centers and process massive data by using IoT analytics, machine learning and deep learning applications.Moreover, the rapidly expanding IoT market is driving growth for chip components to power applications, particularly ADAS, medical/healthcare and smart devices. Further, rapid development of 5G platform and technology has evolved as another catalyst for semiconductor providers.We believe that these emerging trends have provided much needed opportunity to semiconductor companies to offset loss of business due to the shrinking PC market which still consumes bulk of chips.According to Gartner’s latest data, PC shipments in the quarter were down 2% year over year to 71.6 million units. The downside marked the 13th straight quarter of year-over-year fall, which is the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry.However, IDC’s data contradicted Gartner’s figures due to different techniques used for tracking PC sales as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products. According to IDC, PC shipments touched 70.6 million units, marking year-over-year growth of 0.7% and outperforming the research firm’s previous prediction of a fall of 1.7%.Cyber Security Stocks in Focus2017 witnessed a plethora of cyber attacks. Two back-to-back ransomware attacks were reported — WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June — followed by the massive data breach at Equifax in September.In addition to these, the data theft and ransom paid by Uber disclosed in November fueled the bullish momentum of the stocks in this space. Notable companies like Mondelez, FedEx, Merck & Co. suffered from cyber attacks during the year, which may have a material impact on their financial performances.The frequency and severity of attacks have exposed the loopholes of the security systems deployed by enterprises worldwide. Further, with rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the “bring your own device” (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.These factors increased demand for advanced cyber security solutions that drove stock prices of cyber security companies in 2017.How to Make the Right Pick?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right technology stocks that have the potential to beat earnings can be a daunting task. However, our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple for investors.You can narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement.

801,WDC,"Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) revelation of software updates slowing iPhones with older batteries last December resulted in an uproar among its users.The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) recently reported that at least 59 separate lawsuits have been filed against Apple by around five dozen customers. Moreover, a legal meeting is scheduled today in Atlanta to possibly combine all the cases into one class-action lawsuit, adds WSJ.Experts find the number of cases filed against the iPhone maker unusual. It is almost thrice than the number filed in 2010 over iPhone 4’s call drop issue.Notably, shares of Apple have returned 15.5% over the last year, underperforming the industry’s16.9% rally.iPhone Losing SteamApple has been apologizing for the lack of transparency relating to the handling of iPhone performance with older batteries but denied of doing anything intentionally to shorten the life of a product. However, nothing seems to pacify consumers.Apple, in order to appease aggrieved customers, lowered the price of an out-of-warranty battery replacement by $50 for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later model.Per Barclays, owing to the offer more users will go for battery replacements rather than upgrading to new iPhones. They project a decline of 16 million in iPhone shipments this year, which equates to nearly $10.3 billion loss in revenues.Moreover, we observe that the spurt in revenues from iPhone in the last reported quarter was due to higher iPhone average selling price (ASP), when total shipments witnessed a decline.However, the expensive price tag might prove an impediment in markets like China, which remains an important market for Apple, given the growing number of middle-class customers. Also, intensifying competition from regional players, who are offering feature-rich smartphones at a much cheaper price, remains a major headwind.Recently, Goldman Sachs trimmed iPhone sales expectations by 1.7 million units to 53 million for the March quarter. For the quarter ending June, the firm forecasts sales of 40.3 million units, a decline of 3.2 million from its previous projection.Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc.

802,WDC,"Investors know that technology stocks have skyrocketed over the last few years, helping lift the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to new heights. They also understand that this recent bearish turn can be attributed, in large part, to investors selling these same tech stocks.The recent market-wide downturn obviously offers investors the chance to buy stocks on the dip. This widely-adopted strategy sounds simple enough, but just because a stock’s price is technically cheaper doesn’t mean it’s automatically attractive to investors.With that said, as market volatility continues, investors should consider looking to the memory and computer storage industries to find newly undervalued stocks.In the past, investors bemoaned this business as far too cyclical. However, these industries are no longer tethered to the historic PC industry. In fact, the rise of connected devices, the IoT, VR, and AI promise to be secular trends that render these concerns somewhat void.Now, let’s take a look at three memory solutions firms that have become even more attractive to value investors amid this downturn.1.      Micron (MU  -  Free Report)  Micron’s post-earnings selloff presents investors with an amazing chance to buy the stock at a newly reduced price. Micron not only sits over 12% below its 52-week high, but it is also now trading at 5.1x forward earnings, which marks a discount to the broader semiconductor space.Meanwhile, analysts have turned more positive regarding Micron’s future earnings. Within the last seven days, we have seen nine revisions to Micron’s full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement to the upside. These revisions lifted the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.36 in this timeframe.Investors should also note that our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Micron’s full-year earnings to soar by 121%, while its revenues are expected to climb by 42.6%. Micron is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means now might not be a bad time to buy Micron stock while it is relatively cheap.2.       Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report)In less than two weeks, this data storage powerhouse sunk from its 52-week high of roughly $106 per share to around $90 per share. However, Western Digital’s current growth projection and valuation make it an inciting stock.Western Digital’s earnings are expected to surge by 36.7% this quarter and 52% in its current full-year. Furthermore, within the last 60 days, WDC has earned three earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the upside.WDC is also currently trading at 7.7x forward earnings, which marks a substantial discount to its industry’s average Forward P/E of 11.0. Lastly, investors should note that Western Digital is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).3.       Seagate (STX  -  Free Report)This data storage solutions firm has not experienced as precipitous of a decline as some of its peers, but a small selloff has made Seagate stock look a tad more affordable.Seagate’s Forward P/E of 11.8, which is only a slight premium to its industry’s average P/E of 11.4 and a discount to the broader chip market.Seagate has also earned six earnings estimate revisions for its current full-year, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 60 days. This has helped the company’s estimate climb from $4.33 per share to $4.87 per share, which would mark an 18% climb from the year-ago period.Seagate is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Growth.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

803,WDC,"Shares of Micron (MU  -  Free Report) have dipped nearly 12% since the company’s earnings announcement last week, and with the stock now down significantly from its mid-March highs, investors are growing concerned that the memory-chip maker’s red-hot run is finally coming to an end.All in all, Micron’s new earnings results were pretty solid. The company posted adjusted profits of $2.82 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76. Meanwhile, quarterly revenue of $7.35 billion was up 58% from the year-ago period and ahead of our consensus estimate of $7.23 billion.Still, investors who are familiar with cyclical trends in the semiconductor memory space clearly felt the time was right to take their profits from this stock, which had gained roughly 90% in the year prior to its most-recent report date (also read: Micron Posts Earnings Beat, 'Secular Trends' Driving Growth).But Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra is clearly trying to shift this rhetoric. In the company’s conference call following the release of its earnings report, Mehrotra carefully selected his words in an effort to paint a new picture of the industry.“The dealer market today is very different from the PC-dominated market of the past,” the chief executive said. “More specifically, memory is making possible applications such as AI and VR, and enabling new cloud-based business models which deliver a fundamental value far in excess of a price per bit.”Memory is a heavily-commoditized segment of the technology sector, thanks in large part to cyclical demand trends that have presented themselves over decades of the aforementioned PC-dominated market.This helps explain why many memory solutions firms trade with lower valuations than many of their other high-tech peers. For example, the group of Micron, Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), Toshiba , and Seagate (STX  -  Free Report) is currently trading with an average Forward P/E of 7.9, which is a significant discount to the 13.2x forward earnings multiple seen in the broader semiconductor market.Still, Mehrotra is right to point out that the technology sector has evolved over the past few years. The decline of the PC has been well documented, and in addition to that, a whole breadth of new consumer electronics—including smart appliances, wearables, and in-home virtual assistants—have emerged.These new products are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of applications for VR, AI, and IoT technology. And on the commercial side, there is plenty of growth left for cloud-based computing and new industrial machinery. All of these new applications create immense amounts of data, meaning memory providers like Micron should continue to see rising demand.“Micron's broad technology portfolio and strong innovation engine position us well for these growth trends. We continue to partner with our customers to ensure our technology and engineering roadmaps deliver the critical features for tomorrow's solutions,” Mehrotra explained.Of course, good CEOs are always trying to rally their company’s stock, and post-earnings conference calls tend to highlight bullish trends instead of lingering on headwinds. Mehrotra is hardly an unbiased spokesperson, but he is not wrong to say that the memory industry could soon defy the cyclical trends that investors have grown accustom to.And if the company’s recent earnings estimate activity is any indication, analysts agree with this sentiment. Within the past 60 days, we have seen nine revisions for Micron’s full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement to the upside. These revisions have lifted the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $1.16 in this timeframe.Micron’s positive revision snapshot has helped the stock earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). It may take some time for this recent tech volatility to cool, but the fundamental picture for MU remains strong, and investors should consider scooping up shares at a discount.Want more market analysis from this author?

804,WDC,"“It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.” – Warren Buffett. The strategy is very simple – find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth.Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. So chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward.There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential. Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company’s business. One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking, if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis – the lower the number, the better.Why Price to Cash Flow?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, one of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. On the other hand, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), which develops, manufactures, and sells data storage devices and solutions, delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 8.4% in the trailing four quarters.

808,WDC,"A stock at a 52-week high level is considered a winner. This level helps investors decide on whether to buy or sell the stock.Investors often wonder if this level has made the stock overpriced. While they are not totally incorrect, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not expensive.In fact, in an attempt to avoid stocks that are near their 52-week high levels, an investor might miss out on top gainers.A stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. Hence a more informed approach for understanding if any further upside is left is beneficial in these cases.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on the catchphrase “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors, who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors’ special attention (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them achieve the level. But that doesn’t always mean an impending decline. The factors — such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions — that motivated investors to bet on these stocks could keep them encouraged if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank <=2No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are five of the 22 stocks that made it through the screen:Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is one of the leading food processing companies in the world. It procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises agricultural commodities and products. The company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 1.7%.Phibro Animal Health Corporation (PAHC  -  Free Report) is a leading global diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company.

810,WDC,"Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results on Jan 18. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.9%.We believe that strong demand for Mellanox’s InfiniBand solutions along with collaborations with the likes of NEC Corporation, Atos, VMware and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are likely to act as catalysts.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 68 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 17.1%. Further, the earnings estimate has not shown any sign of movement of late. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $235 million, up roughly 5.9% from the year-ago quarter.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 ResultsQ3 Earnings HighlightMellanox reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensuses Estimates and the top line missed the same. Revenues improved on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by strong customer adoption of Gigabit EDR solutions in machine learning, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, database, storage and more.Further, InfiBand’s adoption helped the company to maintain its leadership position in the high-performance interconnects space.Moreover, it provided encouraging fourth-quarter revenue guidance. For the fourth quarter, the company anticipates revenues to remain in a range of $230-$240 million. The Zacks Consensuses Estimates is pegged at $235.2 million.Notably, its shares have gained 50.4% year over year, outperforming the 34.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Collaboration & InfiniBand Adoption: Key CatalystThe company recently announced collaboration with NEC Corporation to provide support to NEC’s newly announced SX-Aurora TSUBASA systems with InfiniBand adapters. InfiniBand is highly scalable and its off-loading capabilities that reduce load on CPUs are attracting artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and deep learning providers.The addition of InfiniBand to NEC’s latest high-end high-performance computing (HPC) platform boosts the systems processing performance and scalability.Moreover, InfiniBand has been the preferred interconnect for AI and deep learning systems. Mellanox had announced that leading deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Caffe2, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, and Baidu PaddlePaddle use the company’s offloading capability across multiple AI servers.Mellanox also clinched design contracts on multiple platforms. These design wins include more than 20 AI projects globally, which is significant for the company’s top-line growth.Apart from strong demand for Mellanox’s InfiniBand solutions, collaborations with the likes of Atos, VMware and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have helped the company expand footprint in the cloud and datacenter market.Mellanox’s collaboration with Microsemi Corporation is also expected to reinforce the company’s footprint in the high performance computing market going forward.Further, Mellanox is winning contracts from the likes of NetApp. The network storage provider recently selected Mellanox’s ConnectX 100Gb/s InfiniBand adapters for two of its most advanced storage platforms — the EF570 and E5700.The University of Toronto also selected the Mellanox InfiniBand solutions to accelerate its new leading supercomputer in Canada. Earlier, the NASA Ames Research Center selected the company’s EDR InfiniBand solutions along with HPE SGI 8600 liquid cooled platform to expand its “Electra” supercomputing cluster.These factors are likely to positively impact the to-be-reported quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Zacks ESP: Mellanoxcurrently has an Earnings ESP of -2.37%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at 66 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 68 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Mellanoxcurrently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated Stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Some Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are a few companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +0.83% and a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

813,WDC,"Western Digital Corp.’s (WDC  -  Free Report) shares have climbed 4.1% in yesterday’s trading session, outperforming the market.Western Digital stock has gained 29.4% in the last three months, outperforming the 25.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Will the recent positive trend continue driving the stock over the long haul or is it due for a pullback? Before we discuss how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the fundamentals and trends in order to get a better hold on the important drivers.Growth DriversWestern Digital delivered second-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $3.95 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 cents and soared 71.7% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 9.2% year over year to $5.34 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.29 billion. The strong top-line growth reflected healthy demand in the company’s end-markets for high capacity enterprise hard drives and flash-based products.Western Digital has started deploying 64-layer 3D technology across its product portfolio and the ramp of the 96-layer technology is expected in the later part of 2018. The company MAMR-based capacity enterprise hard drives are anticipated to be available for sampling in the second half of 2018.Product RolloutsWestern Digital recently unveiled two new NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) SSDs namely Western Digital PC SN720 and Western Digital PC SN520. This addresses the need of storage system that enables the fast data applications and new technologies.With such launches, we expect Western Digital to strengthen market position against the likes of Seagate Technology.According to Cisco GCI estimates, the machine, people and other things will require about 850 zettabytes (ZB) of storage by 2021. The growing demand requires a new storage standard and easy accessibility. We believe that the latest Western Digital’s NVMe client architecture and product portfolio will benefit from pent up demand in the storage market.These product additions will enhance the company’s existing product portfolio. It will also aid Western Digital in getting a strong foothold in the global SSD market, which per latest data by TechNavio is expected to witness CAGR of 17% during 2016-2020.Western Digital also unveiled the world’s fastest UHS-I microSD card and PCIe-enabled flash memory card technology, the 400GB SanDisk Extreme UHS-I micro SDXC card at MWC. It will enable users to better capture, preserve, access, share, transform and enjoy their personal content.Joint Venture on TrackIn Dec, 2017, Western Digital settled its dispute with long-time joint venture (JV) partner, Toshiba, over the divestiture of Toshiba Memory Corporation to a consortium led by Bain Capital. The company gave consent to the transfer of Toshiba’s equity interests in the JVs to TMC.The settlement now ensures long-term availability of NAND supply for Western Digital.Western Digital also announced that it will participate in the development of Fab 6 starting with the second investment tranche. Fab 6 operations are expected to commence in the next few months with initial bit output in the third calendar quarter of 2018.The company also expects to participate in the new wafer fab scheduled to be constructed in Iwate.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Western Digital's current quarter and current year witnessed upward revisions. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $3.27 per share, up from earnings of $3.11 per share earlier.

The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 6.43%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 19%.To ConcludeIn our opinion, the stock deserves a place in investor’s portfolio and we are expecting an impressive return from the stock in the next few months.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report).

814,WDC,"Value investors flock to the commoditized market of semiconductor memory to find “cheap” stocks that are still likely to grow on the back of evolving and advancing technology. Many of Wall Street’s favorite high-tech growth companies are trading with stretched valuations, but memory firms like Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) seem to present investors with incredible value opportunities.Micron and Western Digital are not perfectly comparable companies, but ever since WDC’s acquisition of SanDisk in 2016, these two memory solutions giants have been squaring off in the growing NAND and SSD markets.NAND and SSD promise to be the fastest-growing segments of the memory industry over the next few years, and investors looking for exposure to this growth should consider both MU and WDC. But a diversified value portfolio probably does not have room for two stocks to capture the same trend, so which of these companies is the better buy right now? Let’s take a closer look.ValuationTraditional value investors love to look at the price-to-earnings ratio to determine great buying opportunities. After all, buying a stock makes one a partial owner of that company, so investors are inherently interested in profitability.With that said, here is a look at the Forward P/E trend for MU and WDC over the past year:There are at least a couple of things to note here. First of all, both of these stocks are trading at a discount compared to the broader market, as well as the technology sector. As mentioned, memory is commoditized—thanks in part to cyclical sales patterns—and investors tend to keep valuations in check because of this.Still, if your primary value strategy is to find stocks that are undervalued versus their broader sector, both of these companies look like solid options right now.Nevertheless, it is worth noting that WDC has been trading at a noticeable premium to MU for the entirety of the past year. Western Digital is a bit further along in its growth cycle, so investors might be showing a willingness to pay more for what could be perceived as a less-risky option.But Micron’s low valuation still looks attractive here. Investors are getting a great price for a company with plenty of expansion opportunities, including a sizeable share of the budding NAND and SSD markets.PerformanceValue investors should also be interested in a stock’s recent price performance. For instance, if a stock has sold off significantly, its lower valuation might speak to a greater problem that has forced investors to flee.Check out how MU and WDC have performed since this time last year:As we can see, Micron is carrying significantly stronger momentum right now. These stocks were keeping pace with each other until August, and then MU began to take off. This incredible performance also underscores the attractiveness of Micron’s current valuation.Zacks RankWe have proven that both of these stocks are intriguing picks, but the best value opportunities are undervalued companies that are also sporting strong Zacks Ranks. In this case, Micron and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) have another edge over Western Digital, which is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The proven Zacks Rank system puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions. Within the past 60 days, we have seen eight revisions to MU’s full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement to the upside. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s EPS has gained a staggering 74 cents over this timeframe.This improving analyst sentiment, on top of Micron’s attractive valuation and insane momentum, make MU look very interesting right now.Want more market analysis from this author?

815,WDC,"Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) recently announced the availability of 64-layered, second generation 3D NAND storage solutions in three different capacities of 64GB, 128GB and 256GB.These new storage solutions are meant for addressing the needs of new age smartphones. The requirement for efficient data storage is increasing pertaining to accelerated use of artificial intelligence (AI) related applications as well as multimedia sharing tools.Per the press release, the storage capacity for smartphones is expected to grow to a terabyte by 2021. Additionally, citing predictions by Gartner (IT  -  Free Report), Micron stated that “80 percent of all smartphones will have on-device AI capabilities, increasing the requirement to process and store more data locally”, by 2022.Owing to these facts, storage products are anticipated to be much in demand, which will be beneficial for Micron’s revenue growth.Notable FeaturesThe newly launched storage products are based on the company’s “triple level cell (TLC) 3D NAND technology.” Per Micron, mobile optimized architecture of these products is capable of processing very high volume of data messages with minimal delay while consuming lesser power, thereby enriching user experience. It also doubles storage density and offers a 50% increase in speed compared with the previous version of the TLC 3D NAND product.These storage products are based on “the industry’s smallest 32GB TLC 3D NAND die” that measures 59.341sqmm. Moreover, “the UFS 2.1 G3-2L interface specification” enables the product to “deliver up to 200 percent higher bandwidth versus e.MMC 5.1”. This feature accelerates the pace of accessing data.Other Players in the DomainNotably, in May 2017, Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) announced the launch of the industry’s first 64-Layer 3D NAND-based SSDs. The low power consumption feature and non-volatile capacious flash memory gained accelerated adoption. In June 2017, Micron’s NAND foundry partner, Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) launched SSD 545s, which was built on 64-layer 3D NAND flash memory.In a recent announcement, Intel and Micron stated that the duo will complete development of the third-generation of 3D NAND technology, with a target of 2018-end to early 2019 delivery, beyond which the firms will work separately.To ConcludeWe believe the enhancement of the portfolio with the addition of this much in demand storage product will help it to compete better in an industry that includes the likes of Intel and Western Digital. The growing need for high data storage capacity in smartphones will drive demand for Micron’s storage solutions, thereby boosting its top line over the long run.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

816,WDC,"Given the run-up in stocks in the New Year, the importance of value investing has risen considerably. Value investors have, over the years, preferred price-to-earnings ratio or P/E as a means to identify value stocks. However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though used less often, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.This article focuses on the Price-to-Book ratio for finding great stocks at great values.The P/B is simply the ratio of stock price to book valueIt is calculated as given below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityWhat is Book Value?There are several ways by which book value can be defined. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report), a leading processor and distributor of milk and other dairy products in the United States, has a Zacks Rank #2.

818,WDC,"The two independent research firms — Gartner Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) and International Data Corporation (“IDC”) — yesterday reported worldwide PC shipment data for the fourth quarter of 2017. Although the figures reported by both firms are different, they share a similar opinion that the worldwide PC shipment has shown concrete signs of improvement in the quarter.Although the PC shipment declined year over year, Gartner’s data depicts that it is rather modest compared with several previous quarters. On the other hand, as per IDC, PC shipment recorded its “first positive holiday quarter shipment growth in six years.”Decline Moderated – Per GartnerThe preliminary data released by Gartner displayed that PC shipments in the fourth quarter were down 2% year over year to 71.6 million units. The decline marked the 13th straight quarter of year-over-year fall, which is the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry.As per the data compiled by Gartner, the overall PC market was mainly adversely affected by weak demand for consumer PCs. The decline in the segment came despite a record holiday season which signifies that PCs are no longer favorite gift items for the season, Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, said in her note.For the full year, PC shipments declined 2.8% from the prior-year level to 262.5 million units. This independent research firm highlighted a very interesting fact that in the last six or seven years, the PC industry has consolidated heavily. Gartner reported that in 2017, the top four vendors have combined market share of 64% which is much higher than the 45% grabbed by the top four vendors of 2011.First Holiday Growth in Six Years – Per IDCUnlike Gartner, the data compiled by IDC states that worldwide PC shipments registered the first growth in the last six holiday seasons. The difference in data is mainly due to separate techniques used for tracking PC sales, as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products. For example, unlike Gartner, IDC includes Chromebooks, which run on Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Chrome operating system. Gartner, on the other hand, takes into account Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) tablets and ""detachables"" such as the iPad Pro and the Asus Transformer, which are not taken into account by IDC.During the fourth quarter, PC shipments touched 70.6 million units, marking year-over-year growth of 0.7% and outperforming the research firm’s earlier prediction of a fall of 1.7%. The growth was mainly driven by “commercial upgrades and pockets of improving consumer PC demand.”For the full year, although IDC reported a 0.2% year-over-year volume decline in PC shipments, it stated that 2017 marks the most stable year for the industry since 2011. PC shipments were 259.5 million units during 2017.Computer - Mini computers Industry 5YR % Return  Computer - Mini computers Industry 5YR % Return Top Vendors ListAlthough both research firms’ data varies, they have similar views when it comes to ranking of top vendors. The firms agree that HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) continues to be the market leader in the space, followed by Lenovo, Dell, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Asus and Acer Group. Notably, Asus and Acer tied for the fifth spot, according to Gartner as well as IDC.Both firms stated that among the top vendors mentioned above, HP, Dell and Apple registered year-over-year growth in PC shipments, while Asus and Acer marked declines. The firms have different opinion on Lenovo as Gartner states that it registered a decline, while its shipment remained flat year over year, as per IDC.Talking about only the U.S. market, it is only HP which has witnessed increase in PC shipments as well as improvement in market share. Per Gartner, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth for the company in the U.S. market.Moreover, the quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of overall shipment growth for HP. We believe the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets, and cutting jobs to lower costs, are apparently paying off at last.Region-Wise PerformanceTalking about the geographical performance, the firms have a slightly different opinion. Per Gartner, Asia/Pacific, Japan and Latin America registered improvement in PC shipments, while the EMEA region slightly declined. However, the U.S. market witnessed a steep decline as consumers were seen preferring new “popular products, such as voice-enabled speakers, and newly released smartphones” over PCs during the holiday season, per Kitagawa.On the other hand, per IDC, except the United States, all three regions — EMEA, APeJ and Japan — reported growth in the quarter.However, the major thing highlighted by the firms was PC shipment growth in China, mainly driven by the huge success of Single Day promotion and strong demand for commercial PCs. According to Gartner, PC shipment in the country inched up 1.1% in the fourth quarter.What’s Ahead?Although the overall PC market is still very challenging, the forward-looking statements of the research firms indicate that the PC industry is moving toward stabilization. Jay Chou, IDC research manager, noted in a statement that “The fourth quarter results showed some potentially encouraging headway against the difficult environment in retail and consumer PCs.”Both firms agreed that consumers now look for more advanced and quality devices rather than low-priced PCs. Kitagawa of Gartner said that ""the PC will become a more specialized, purpose-driven device.”IDC’s Chou has more or less similar views as he mentioned that ""Enticed by a growing array of products that promise all-day battery life, high portability, and address emerging use cases that require more compute power, pockets of the consumer base are taking a serious look at these revamped PCs.”The aforementioned positive comments on the PC market by the two industry experts will provide a respite to the PC vendors, as well as the companies which are dependent on the PC industry.An improving trend in PC shipments will benefit the business prospects of companies like HP Inc., Microsoft, Intel Corporation, Seagate Technologies (STX  -  Free Report) and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), which continue to depend substantially on PC sales.Currently, Western Digital sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Seagate carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise FactSet Research Systems Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | FactSet Research Systems Inc. QuoteGuidanceThe company reiterated parts of the guidance for fiscal 2018 provided last quarter. GAAP revenues are expected to be between $1.34 billion and $1.36 billion (mid-point $1.35 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.35 billion.Organic ASV for fiscal 2018 is projected to be in the range of $65 million to $85 million, representing year-over-year growth of 4.9% to 6.5%. The anticipated range for adjusted operating margin is 31% and 32.5%.FactSet updated parts of its fiscal 2018 guidance pertaining to the recent tax reforms in the United States. The annual effective tax rate is now expected to be between 18% and 19.5%. Adjusted earnings are expected to be within $8.35 and $8.55, up from the previous range of $8.25 and $8.45. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $8.40 per share.Bottom LineThe company fared well in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on the back of new customer wins across United States, Europe and Asia.Management was particularly optimistic about the analytics segment that accounted for more than 50% of the increased ASV, primarily attributed to the performance of portfolio analytics, risk, fixed income and portfolio services.The ongoing and completed integration of the acquired entities appear promising as these are assisting the company in winning new clients like Alberta Investment Management.Additionally, management stated that the rise of quant-based research work has increased the demand for data feeds. Hence, it is also looking to expand its Data Feeds business to tap the relevant growth opportunity.Moreover, the company’s shareholder-friendly initiative, as reflected in the amendment of its share repurchase program with additional funds, is a positive and is expected to instill investors’ confidence in the stock.However, declining client retention ratio remains a concern for the company. Although, the company has been able to add new clients every quarter, failure to retain old clients may prove to be an overhang in the long run.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderFactset has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some of the top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Paycom Software, Inc.

821,WDC,"Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we would suggest Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio as one of the key metrics.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that make P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. On the other hand, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are four of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), which develops, manufactures, and sells data storage devices and solutions, delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4% in the trailing four quarters.

823,WDC,"Are you still holding shares of Infineon Technologies AG (IFNNY  -  Free Report) in your portfolio? If yes, then it’s the best time to dump the stock as chances of favorable returns in the near term are slim.The stock has underperformed the industry in the past three months. Infineon’s shares have registered a return of 5.4% compared with the industry’s growth of 8.9%.Let’s delve deeper and try to find out what is taking this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company down.Growth ImpedimentsInfineon designs, develops, manufactures and markets semiconductors as well as complete systems solutions. The company reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel. Although, revenues increased 8.7% year over year to $2.15 billion in the quarter, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.17 billion.Moreover, management guidance was disappointing as first-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to decline.The company continues to encounter difficulties with the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry that witnesses price erosion and evolving standards. Further, Infineon faces strong seasonal fluctuations in product supply and demand, and any adversity in seasonal conditions may affect sales, going forward.Further, intensifying competition in the automotive and power market segments is a major concern. Additionally, weak Chip Card & Security (“CCS”) revenues will continue to hurt top-line in the near term.Estimates Moving SouthEstimates for the current year have moved south in the past 60 days. The company’s current year earnings estimates moved down by 11 cents to $1.15 per share. Given its weak fundamentals and an unfavorable Zacks Rank, it is likely to keep underperforming in the quarters ahead.Low ReturnGiven the other unattractive attributes like low return on equity (“ROE”), low return on capital (“ROC”) and low return on assets (“ROA”) the stock looks very unappealing. Infineon currently trades at a ROE of 18%, much lower than the industry’s average of 22.3%. Moreover, the company has a ROA of 10.2%, much lower than the industry’s average of 12.4%. Notably, the company has an ROC of 13.5% compared with the industry’s average of 16.2%.Negative Earnings Surprise HistoryInfineon has an unimpressive earnings surprise history. The company underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording a negative average earnings surprise of 9.1%.Bottom LineWe expect the aforementioned factors to hurt the company’s near-term profitability. Hence, we recommend investors to stay away from Infineon shares until its Zacks Rank and estimates improve.Stocks to ConsiderNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Analog Devices, Inc.

824,WDC,"Shares of Pure Storage Inc. (PSTG  -  Free Report) have been performing well of late. If you haven't taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, its time you hold the stock in your portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Shares of Pure Storage, which provides software-defined all-flash solutions that are uniquely fast and cloud-capable for customers, have returned 40.7% in a year, substantially outperforming the industry's growth of 20.9%.What's Going in Favor of Pure Storage?Pure Storage is rapidly gaining traction in the flash storage market, as evident from its expanding customer base. In the third quarter, the company added more than 300 customers, bringing the total base to 4,000 organizations and reflecting an increase of 54% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, the company’s cloud customers contributed around 25% to business while existing customers contributed 70%. The company’s strong product portfolio with the likes of FlashArray and FlashBlade business segments was the key catalyst. Additionally, its data platform for cloud is gaining traction.Management is optimistic about its scalable storage solutions in an era where the world is typically being driven by big-data, artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics based information. The company is currently focusing on three major aspects, namely increasing cloud customer base, solidifying the position of its next generation workload related core data infrastructure and tapping large enterprises as they “cloudify” their on-premise IT infrastructure.Management is also positive about the company’s partner ecosystem, which assisted it in winning a multimillion dollar deal with a prominent financial services institution.The company stated that the storage market for AI is likely to witness CAGR of 78% over the next five years. Pure Storage is well poised to grab the opportunity. Further, its partnership with NVIDIA, which is a dominant player in AI related computation, is anticipated to be a positive.Notably, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 66.7% in the last quarter.Risks PrevailHowever, Pure Storage faces intensifying competition in the flash-based storage market from the likes of Hitachi, NetApp, Dell EMC, HP Enterprise, Lenovo and IBM.The competition has resulted in a decline in the average selling price (“ASP”). Any decline in ASP will impact the results if shipments do not improve considerably. This will eventually hurt top-line growth going forward.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat in difficult times. Hence, we suggest that investors hold on to the stock at the moment.Zacks Rank & Key PicksPure Storage carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Analog Devices, Inc.

825,WDC,"Shares of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) have been performing well of late. If you haven't taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, its time you hold the stock in your portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Shares of Cadence have returned 69.9% in a year, substantially outperforming the industry's growth of 34.9%.What's Going in Favor of Cadence?Cadence is benefiting from ongoing adoption of its digital and signoff, custom-analog and IP solutions as well as expanding customer base.Further, increasing investments on emerging trends like Internet-of-things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and autonomous vehicle sub-systems present significant growth opportunity for the company in the long haul.Market research firm IDC estimates global IoT spending to grow at a CAGR of 15.6% over 2015-2020 time frame to hit $1.29 trillion in 2020. Moreover, the firm estimates AR/VR spending to accelerate at a CAGR of 198% over the same period to reach $143.3 billion in 2020. This presents significant growth opportunity for semiconductor chip makers as well as electronics sensor developers. We note that these two industries make the majority of customer base. We believe that the company’s expanding product portfolio will help it to win frequent orders as well as new customers from these emerging markets going ahead.The company has also introduced a broad portfolio of interface and memory design IP solutions for automotive applications using TSMC's 16-nanometer FinFET Compact process. We note that the expansion of Renesas agreement reflects the company’s growing influence in the autonomous vehicle market. Of late, the company has won orders from well-known companies like MobilEye and Infineon who are developing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) related technologies. This is a prudent step given the significant growth prospect of the ADAS market, which is estimated to be worth $42.40 billion by 2021, according to data from MarketAndMarkets.We also note that the company is focused on augmenting footprint in the aerospace and defense segment. Apart from having a dedicated team for the sector, Cadence has expanded systems business through partnerships with established sector players like Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems and GE Aviation. We believe that these partnerships will help in driving the company’s market position in the long run.Notably, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.9% in the last quarter. Further, the company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 12%.Risks PersistHowever, intensifying competition, currency volatility, leveraged balance sheet and stretched valuation remain major headwinds.We note that Cadence currently has a trailing 12 month P/B ratio of 12.17, which compares unfavorably with what the industry observed to some extent, in the last year. The ratio is higher than the average level of 11.38 and is closer to the high end of the valuation range. Hence, valuation looks slightly stretched from a P/B perspective.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times.

827,WDC,"Micron (MU  -  Free Report) shares have struggled to generate any positive momentum since the company’s recent earnings announcement, and with new volatility inspiring investors throughout global markets to take their profits from red-hot growth stocks, MU has hit a rare downturn over the past week or so.But Micron’s earnings report included several encouraging signs, with better-than-expected profits and revenues leading management to thank “secular technology trends” for the company’s remarkable growth. Micron might have suffered some profit taking, but paired with these strong results, the stock’s recent selloff feels like a brand-new opportunity to buy at a discount.The semiconductor memory giant continues to display attractive growth prospects at a valuation that should make any investor interested. So is Micron now Wall Street’s cheapest growth stock? Let’s take a closer look.ValuationValue investors have flocked to MU for years, and the stock frequently sports an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. Part of this has to do with the fact that Micron’s core business, computer and mobile memory, has been commoditized by investors in recent years. For whatever underlying reason, the market’s memory giants are simply not treated like other tech stocks.This means that the best way to judge Micron’s valuation is by comparing it to other memory companies, including Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), Seagate (STX  -  Free Report), and Toshiba. Each of these companies has expertise in different areas and are not always directly competing, but they all reflect the commoditization of the memory business.Here’s how Micron’s recent Forward P/E trend compares to this peer group: As we can see, MU has consistently traded at a slight discount to its peer group throughout 2018. Plus, our current Zacks Consensus Estimates calling for Micron to witness EPS growth of 119% and revenue growth of 43% this fiscal year. Investors will not find that type of expansion elsewhere in this peer group, which really underscores the attractiveness of MU’s current earnings multiple.Analyst SentimentJust two weeks ago, Micron received its most-bullish analyst call ever when Nomura Instinet raised its 12-month price target for the stock to $100 from $55. This projection represented an 83% upside from MU’s most-recent close before the note and remains the highest price target out of the 26 research firms that cover the company.And Nomura’s bullish sentiment is just a small part of a broader trend of analysts becoming more optimistic about the stock. Within the past 60 days, we have seen nine revisions to Micron’s full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement to the upside. The Zack Consensus Estimate for the company’s annual earnings has gained a staggering $1.01 over that timeframe.This positive estimate revision activity has helped MU earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We believe the strongest growth and value stocks are those that also sport great Zacks Ranks, and the fact that Micron is displaying a unique combination of all three of these encouraging trends is truly remarkable.Want more market analysis from this author?

828,WDC,"Shares of Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) have soared more than 350% over the past two years, thanks in large part to rapid expansion of the memory-chip maker’s top and bottom lines. This has helped the stock emerge as a favorite among explosive-growth investors looking for tech firms that are outpacing the broader market.But more recently, value investors have flocked to MU and its attractive valuation metrics. Wall Street seemingly cannot keep up with Micron’s lightning-quick growth, leaving the company’s Forward P/E and Earnings Yield figures well within the scope of a value investor. The stock frequently sports an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system, and to many, it is now one of the top value opportunities in the entire technology sector.Micron is currently trading with a Forward P/E of 5.1, which compares incredibly favorably to the average of 17.4 held by the S&P 500, as well as the 21.8 average we see in our “Computers and Technology” sector. Breaking it down even further, MU also appears undervalued compared to the Semiconductors industry, which currently holds an average P/E of 13.7.So how could it be possible for Micron to be trading at such a miniscule earnings multiple? At least part of the answer lies in the fact that Micron’s core business, computer and mobile memory, has been commoditized by investors in recent years. For whatever underlying reason, the market’s memory giants are simply not treated like other tech stocks.When looking at Micron’s key valuation metrics, it probably helps to compare the stock to others in the memory business, including Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), Seagate (STX  -  Free Report), and Toshiba . Each of these companies has expertise in different areas and are not always directly competing, but they all reflect the commoditization of the memory business.Just take a look at how MU’s P/E compares to its peer group:MU is still trading at a discount to the rest of its peers, but we can see that the gap is significantly smaller.Now, it should be clearly stated that the observation of this trend is not a knock on Micron or its business model. Our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 107.9% and sales growth of 40.7% this fiscal year, and that type of year-over-year improvement speaks for itself.But investors should know that this stock is likely to behave differently than other tech companies with triple-digit earnings growth, just as it does not see the price action one would expect from a stock trading a just 5x earnings.Another thing investors might want to consider here is Micron’s P/S ratio. While the P/E ratio has long been a tried-and-true method for valuing stocks, some investors prefer the P/S ratio because revenues are often considered the more-accurate gauge for evaluating the health of a business.Here’s a look at Micron’s P/S versus its peer group:Now we are starting to see that Micron is not the flawless value stock that it might appear to be. Investors should certainly consider the whole picture for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock right now.Want more market analysis from this author?

829,WDC,"At Mobile World Congress (“MWC”) and Embedded World, Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) unveiled two new NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) SSDs namely Western Digital PC SN720 and Western Digital PC SN520. This addresses the need of storage system that enables the fast data applications and new technologies.Western Digital PC SN720 3D NAND will be available in 256GB, 512GB, 1TB and 2TB capacities on a single-sided M.2 2280 form factor. Western Digital PC SN520A with NVMe performance will be available in 128GB, 256GB and 512GB capacities on single-sided M.2 2280, M.2 2242, or M.2 2230 form factors. It is an exceptionally fast and cost-effective addition to the Western Digital 3D NAND portfolio, consequently providing adequate storage.According to the press release, manufacturers of IoT devices, computing devices and monitoring systems will benefit greatly from these two new products. The new products will enable the capture and transformation of the massive quantities of data in real-time at the edge of smart city, smart home and personal data environments.With such launches, we expect Western Digital to strengthen its market position against the likes of Seagate Technology.According to Cisco GCI estimates, the machine, people and other things will require about 850 zettabytes (ZB) of storage by 2021. The growing demand requires a new storage standard and easy accessibility. We believe that the latest Western Digital’s NVMe client architecture and product portfolio will benefit from pent up demand in the storage market.With the increasing use of 5G, fast data applications, VR, 4K video editing etc, comes the demand for power efficient high capacity performance storage solutions. Western Digital NVMe 3D NAND SSDs cater to this need and promises enhanced user experience.These product additions will enhance the company’s existing product portfolio.It will also aid Western Digital in getting a strong foothold in the global SSD market, which per latest data by TechNavio is expected to witness CAGR of 17% during 2016-2020.In a separate press release Western Digital also unveiled the world’s fastest UHS-I microSD card and PCIe-enabled flash memory card technology, the 400GB SanDisk Extreme UHS-I micro SDXC card at MWC. It will enable users to better capture, preserve, access, share, transform and enjoy their personal content.It offers up to 160MB/sec sequential read and write speeds, which is more than 50% faster than its previous SanDisk Extreme UHS-I microSD cards. With A2 specification, this storage device is expected to enhance overall drive capacity, reliability and performance.The company has also expanded its My Cloud solutions with My Cloud EX4, a broader portfolio of network attached storage (“NAS”) hard drives. My Cloud EX4 will help the company meet growing business needs with improved flexibility and security, consequently boosting the top line.The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is another tailwind. Further, the company’s growing footprint in the automotive as well as the connected home and industrial categories are likely to act as a key catalyst.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderWestern Digital carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

830,WDC,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – December 26, 2017 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), ESCO International, Inc. (WCC  -  Free Report), Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS  -  Free Report) and Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report).Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog: 4 Tech Stocks on Sale: Should You Buy for 2018?The United States Senate just passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, marking President Donald Trump’s first major legislative conquest. The highlight of the reform is the slash in corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% that is expected to boost the bottom line of the companies.However, the technology sector is unlikely to benefit much from the reforms owing to the fact that  it already enjoys several tax benefits and therefore has a lower effective tax rate. Citing S&P Global data, Bloomberg stated, “Among sectors, the 18.5 percent effective tax rate enjoyed by the group is the third-lowest among U.S. large caps.”This was also evident from the sector’s not so impressive run in early December 2017 when investors were moving their funds into sectors which had higher scope for gains. As a matter of fact, just after the Republican Senate passed the bill with a 51-49 majority on Dec 2 morning, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) declined approximately 2% in next two trading days.Nevertheless, we believe that the technology sector, which has been benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, augmented/virtual reality devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) related software is capable of  regaining momentum in 2018.In fact, investors also soon realized that the early December plunge across the technology sector is an opportunity to invest in stocks that were too pricey earlier.Here are a few stocks that saw a decline in their prices in early December following a shift in investors’ focus toward other sectors. But these stocks enjoy strong fundamentals and thus are well poised for growth.Broadcom Ltd. is one such stock which is still available at discount compared with with Dec 1 closing price. We believe that the company has several driving factors, which can help it gain going ahead.The company is benefiting from strong demand for its wireless solutions. The trend is expected to continue in fiscal 2018. Moreover, the upcoming launch of the next generation WiFi products is expected to be a growth driver for the segment. Additionally, Broadcom’s focus on multiple target markets mitigates operating risks and lessens the exposure to volatility in any single market. Based on its expanding product portfolio, the company is well-positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like IoT and 5G.The company’s Zack’s Rank #1 and VGM Score of B are further testaments to its upside potential. The VGM Score rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping to identify those with the most attractive value, best growth, and most promising momentum, across the board.Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.Our next choice is WESCO International, Inc., which, like Broadcom, is also available at discount compared with its Dec 1 closing price.We believe the company is benefiting from strength across all end markets and geographic regions, improved sales execution and positive pricing. The company continues with its focus on delivering above-average sales growth, profitability improvement, strong cash flow generation and increasing shareholder value. Moreover, its comprehensive portfolio of products and services, and a sizable global footprint are further tailwinds for the company.The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B, which makes the stock an attractive pick at the moment.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Another stock which is still lower than its Dec 1 closing price is Stratasys Ltd. The significant discount, at which the stock is available when coupled with its strong fundamentals, makes it a good buy.The company seems to be well poised for steady growth backed by its turnaround strategies, which include launching innovative products, strategic partnerships and acquisitions. These initiatives are paving the way for the company to excel in the 3D printing industry, which is anticipated to witness CAGR of 25.76% through 2017 to 2023 and reach $32.78 billion.The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B, which further indicate its upside potential.Western Digital Corp. is one stock that has already covered up its early December loss. The company is poised to benefit from robust demand in end markets as well as strong growth prospects for flash-based storage products. The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is also driving top-line growth. We note that the company is gaining from strong demand for both hard drive and NAND-based products from all categories of customers, largely driven by cloud and mobility based applications.Additionally, the stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of A.Investing in these selected technology stocks can prove to be beneficial for investors in 2018 amid President Donald Trump’s corporate tax rate cut, which is believed to least  favor the sector.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

831,WDC,"Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (MXIM  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 25. The original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of semiconductor analog and mixed signal integrated circuits (ICs) has a wide range of products that allows it to serve a diverse clientele.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.1%, the average beat being 6.34%.The company’s shares have charted a solid trajectory in recent times, increasing 36.7% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 31.9%.Strength in Industrial & Auto End Markets to Drive RevenuesIn the fiscal first quarter, Automotive end market generated 20% of revenues, increasing year over year. Also, Industrial market generated approximately 28%, up year over year. Increasing growth in infotainment content and factory automation products in the areas of interface and power management should continue to drive revenues in the upcoming quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $619.9 million.Customer Concentration a Major HurdleHowever, the concentration of Maxim’s mobility revenues at Samsung is a major concern. Samsung’s projections and announcements, especially those related to its high-end models, where Maxim has greater exposure, could have a significant impact on Maxim’s performance.Moreover, Maxim’s exposure to the consumer and communications markets increases risks.Earnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Maxim will beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Maxim has an Earnings ESP of -0.71%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Maxim has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

832,WDC,"Cree Inc. (CREE  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results on Jan 23. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 33.3%.Cree reported non-GAAP earnings of 4 cents per share in first-quarter fiscal 2018, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.  However, earnings were significantly down from 15 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.The company’s revenues totaled $360 million, down 2.9% year over year. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $361 million by a slight margin.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 1 cent, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 95%. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $350 million, up roughly 0.9% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q2 ResultsGrowing demand for LED products, recovery in utilization rates and continued cost cutting measures from the company’s end is expected to positively impact to-be-reported quarter results.We believe that Cree’s cross licensing agreements will help the company to drive innovation. Further, it will aid the company to gain better traction, resulting in top-line growth.Cree remains focused on driving growth in LED business. The company’s lighting products have been gaining traction among the likes of McLaren Health Care, American Airlines Center, Quest, Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina and Reston Hospital center in the past year.Per another report by MarketsandMarkets, worldwide LED lighting market is projected to be worth a whopping $92.40 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 13.66%.Cree has three reportable segments — Lighting Products, LED Products and Wolfspeed.Lighting Products revenues of $149.7 million, which accounted for 42% of total revenues, were down 19% on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consesus Estimate for Lighting Products is pegged at $140 million.LED Products revenues were $144.5 million, up 5% a year-over-year basis, and accounted for 40% of total revenues. The Zacks Consesus Estimate for LED Products is pegged at $141 million.Wolfspeed revenues surged 33% year over year to $66.2 million and accounted for 18% of total revenues. The Zacks Consesus Estimate for Wolfspeed is pegged at $67 million.Cree, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Cree, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Cree, Inc. QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Cree is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two important ingredients.Zacks ESP: Cree’s Earnings ESP is +40.00%. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cree currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Cree’s Zacks Rank #3 and +40.00% ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.Some Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some other companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +0.83% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

833,WDC,"Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 23 after the bell.We expect the company to perform well driven by strength in several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. It continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars in these areas. This is gradually increasing its exposure to the industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.We observe that shares of Texas Instruments have gained 60% over the past 12 months, outperforming the industry’s 49% rally.Expectations From AnalogTI’s analog business has been witnessing both sequential and year-over-year growth for the last four quarters. This was driven by strong performance in almost all the product lines. Last quarter, this segment generated $2.7 billion, up 12% sequentially and 16% from the year-ago quarter.We expect this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter, given TI’s compelling product line and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $2.5 billion.Expectations From Embedded ProcessingThis segment has also been growing sequentially and year over year for the last four quarters, driven by growth across all product lines. Last quarter, it generated $931 million, up 7% sequentially and 17% year over year.This segment is also expected to do well in the to-be-reported quarter, as product lines remain strong. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $853 million.Overall The company has always executed well. It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), is one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices.Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even when it is expanding. Management remains focused on increasing free cash flow per share and strengthening competitive advantages.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) are best avoided.Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.89%, which indicates a likely positive surprise.

834,WDC,"Investors are well aware of low P/E investing and its positives. The common investor perception is that the lower the P/E, the higher will be the value of the stock. This inference is drawn on the simple logic that a stock’s current market price does not justify (or is not equivalent to) its higher earnings and therefore has room to run.Naturally, there are very few investors who pay attention to stocks with an increasing P/E. But this often-overlooked trend can prove useful in finding great stocks. Let’s dig a little deeper.Why Stocks with Rising P/E Can be Equally PopularInvestors should note that stock prices move in line with earnings performance. If earnings come in stronger, the price of a stock shoots up. Solid quarterly earnings and a forward guidance in turn boost earnings forecasts, leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price.So, if share price is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of the stock’s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it. Also, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P/E, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year’s actual growthPercentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero(These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years.)Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeksPercentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks(These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said time frames.)Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S&P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&P 500Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S&P 500(Here, the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S&P 500.)Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20% higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks, but it should not exceed 100%(A 20% increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend. But a jump of over 100% indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal.)In addition, we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) can get through.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.Just these few factors narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 20.Here are five of 20 stocks that passed the screen:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report): This company provides a portfolio of storage solutions.

837,WDC,"As one of the largest hard disk drive producers in the United States, Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) is riding on its acquisitions and an expanding SSD storage market. Here is why you should add this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock to your portfolio.Western Digital has returned 3.1% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s gain of 2%. The company is experiencing robust demand in end markets as well as strong growth prospects for flash-based storage products.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryWestern Digital outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 8.43%.Further, the company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 25.1%.Expanding SSD Market & Cloud DeploymentWestern Digital has been expanding into the SSD storage market due to declining sales in the PC market. The emergence of thinner laptops, tablets and demand for fast processing storage devices in the past few years has created an ideal market for SSDs. Due to the expansion in digital data, modest growth of TAM and higher demand for storage, Western Digital’s long-term prospects look exciting.Anticipating potential acceleration in cloud deployments, Western Digital is investing heavily to deliver high capacity storage devices that will support expansion of cloud infrastructure and cloud applications. Additionally, the company has expanded its My Cloud solutions with My Cloud EX4, which enables the user to manage and store huge volumes of digital data.Acquisitions Driving GrowthWestern Digital’s acquisition of SanDisk has aided the company’s growth and also helped it to gain traction in SSD.  Additionally it has allowed the company to step in to the NAND products market, which, owing to its strong demand, will drive the company’s revenues.Moreover, the company’s acquisition of Amplidata, sTec, Inc., Velobit, Inc. Arkeia Software Solutions and Virident Systems Inc. have not only strengthened its small-to-medium sized business solutions but also expanded its SSD product portfolio.ValuationMoreover, from a valuation perspective, the stock looks very attractive as it currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate, which signifies a huge upward potential. Western Digital currently trades at a forward P/E of 6.52x as against the industry group average of 16.10x.ConclusionManagement is particularly positive about the company’s flash-based storage segment and joint venture fab operations in Yokkaichi. The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is another tailwind for Western Digital.With expanding product portfolio, secular growth of digital data and growing exposure to the SMB space, shares of Western Digital look well poised for the long term.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NetApp, Inc (NTAP  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1.

The company has launched products to address the growing needs of mid-range market particularly in Asia.Western Digital expects the demand for high and mid-range capacity drives to support the higher rate of Exabyte consumption in calendar 2018. The company’s long-term annual Exabyte growth estimate remains unchanged at 40%.From the Flash industry perspective, Western Digital estimates industry bit growth to be near the high-end of the long-term range (between 35% and 45%) in calendar 2018, primarily due to improving manufacturing yields and continued transition to 3D flash. The company expects to deliver growth consistent with the industry rate.Joint Venture on TrackIn December, 2017, Western Digital settled its dispute with long-time joint venture (JV) partner, Toshiba, over the divestiture of Toshiba Memory Corporation (TMC) to a consortium led by Bain Capital. The company gave consent to the transfer of Toshiba’s equity interests in the JVs to TMC.The settlement now ensures long-term availability of NAND supply for Western Digital.Western Digital also announced that it will participate in the development of Fab 6 starting with the second investment tranche.

841,WDC,"Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results on Jan 29. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.6%. Moreover, we note that Seagate has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.5%.Seagate is gaining from the increasing adoption of its Nearline HDDs. We believe that Nearline’s rapid adoption will boost Seagate’s competitive position against Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report). The company’s efforts in the improvement of areal density with the ramping up of its heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology are yet another positive.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.40 per share, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 1.5%. Further, earnings estimates have moved north over the last 30 days. However, Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.83 billion, down roughly 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Aspects to Influence Q2 ResultsQ1 Earnings HighlightSeagate reported first-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings per share of 96 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents per share.Revenues of $2.63 billion also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.56 billion but decreased 5.9% from the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, both the top and bottom-line figures witnessed a sequential improvement, primarily attributable to strong demand and adoption of Seagate’s storage drives.Notably, its shares have gained 69.5% in the last six months, while the industry recorded growth of 22.3%.Positive Preliminary Q2 ResultsThe stock gained from the positive second-quarter fiscal 2018 preliminary results.Seagate now expects revenues to be approximately $2.9 billion compared with an increase of 3-5% guided previously. The improvement can primarily be attributed to strong growth in exabyte demand.The company expects exabyte shipments to be roughly 88 exabytes, which reflects drive shipments to be around 40 million and average capacity per drive to be approximately 2.2 terabytes.Moreover, the company recently announced a long-term supply agreement with Toshiba, which ensures continuous supply of NAND chips for Seagate’s expanding solid-state drive (SSD) portfolio.Improving HDD DemandHDD (hard disk drives) is improving primarily due to strong demand for high-capacity mass-storage solutions. Increasing adoption of Seagate’s Nearline HDDs is likely to impact the to-be-reported quarter positively.Further, Seagate’s effort to augment areal density with the ramp up of its HAMR technology is a key catalyst.Strong PC Shipments Drives GrowthHints of PC market stabilization as reflected in the latest reports from Gartner and IDC are a positive. Notably, stabilization of the PC market per the latest report from Gartner and IDC bodes well for memory shipments, particularly HDDs. According to IDC, worldwide PC shipment has shown signs of growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, during which shipments touched 70.6 million units, up 0.7% year over year.These factors are likely to positively impact the to-be-reported quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Zacks ESP: Seagate currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.0%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.40 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Seagatecurrently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +0.31% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +7.58% and a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

The company blamed sluggish China CSP demand along with lackluster demand for OEM nearline and mission critical solutions as well as weakness in Cloud storage Systems business behind its fourth-quarter debacle.Notably, revenues declined 9.3% to $2.41 billion and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.55 billion in the quarter. Moreover, non-GAAP earnings declined 5.8% to 65 cents, which also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a massive 34 cents.Seagate Technology PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Seagate Technology PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteSeagate has lost 12.1% of its value year to date versus the 14.2% growth of its industry. Partnership to Boost Big Data FootprintThe deal will help both Seagate and Baidu address the challenges of ongoing data explosion.Market research firm IDC forecasts that by 2025, the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes (trillion gigabytes), which is ten times the 16.1 zettabytes (ZB) of data generated in 2016. More importantly, almost 20% of this will be critical to daily lives and nearly 10% of that will be hypercritical.This massive volume of data presents significant growth opportunity for enterprises. However, effective storage is absolutely necessary to properly harness this data. This presents significant growth opportunity for Seagate in the long term.We also note that Baidu has been a long-time user of Seagate’s enterprise drives in its data center and public cloud platform. The company is considered a pioneer of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques along with Tencent and Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) in China. Moreover, the search giant has also set up Big Data lab in Beijing, which focuses on large-scale machine learning algorithms.We believe the renewal of the deal will boost Seagate’s brand image and recognition in China, which will help it to penetrate this rapidly-growing market going forward.Expanding Portfolio Key CatalystSeagate has been losing hard-disk drive (HDD) market share amid significant competition from Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report). Despite a number of acquisitions, the company also doesn’t have significant presence in the flash memory market.Nevertheless, we expect Seagate’s expanding portfolio to be a game changer going forward. At the 2017 Flash Memory Summit (FMS), the company announced enhanced versions of two flash technologies to boost performance and capacity for mixed data center workloads.These solid-state drives (SSD) effectively address the growing needs of demanding enterprise applications like data mining, weather modeling and online transaction processing, where fast data access and processing power are of utmost priority.Although ramping of its 10 terabyte (TB) helium (nearline) drives have been disappointing, Seagate now expects to ship approximately 1 million 10 TB units in the current quarter. Moreover, management noted that the 12 TB product (shipped in June) has received excellent customer feedback.Seagate now expects to achieve approximately 50% of the exabyte share within the 10TB and 12TB market by the end of 2017.Currently, Seagate has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

844,WDC,"With ever changing market dynamics, investors are often lured into undertaking complex investment strategies. But this may not yield the desired results always. Therefore, using conventional strategies based on key fundamentals to select stocks is always a safe and sound approach for ensuring steady returns.Among several rational and down-to-earth investment strategies, we picked one that is focused on the sales growth of a company. Steady sales growth is the key to survival for a business.Flat or declining sales growth shows obstacles at the company, which will limit scope for sustained growth. Stagnant companies may generate profits for a short period, but they do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business. It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit temporarily, they are valued on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future performance. So, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can turn out to be an apt metric for stock valuation. This metric’s importance further lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues unlike earnings.Focusing solely on sales growth is, however, not desirable. A consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Bethesda, MD, Marriott International, Inc.

845,WDC,"Shares of Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) fell 3.41% to close at $85.75 on Sep 13. The decline followed after Toshiba announced that it is now favoring the Bain Capital-led consortium over Western Digital and Foxconn for its prized NAND flash memory unit.Toshiba stated that it has signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Bain-led consortium that includes South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix as well as Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ) and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ).According to The Wall Street Journal, Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Dell technologies are also part of the consortium. Apple is anticipated to invest 400 billion yen in the consortium.Toshiba is in dire need to raise capital (by the end of March 2018) to remain as a listed entity. The company expects to complete the divestiture by the end of this month. Western Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Western Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Western Digital Corporation QuoteReportedly, Bain’s offer of $22 billion (2.4 trillion yen) not only surpasses its expectation of 2 trillion yen but is also better than what respective consortiums led by Western Digital and Foxconn are willing to pay. Per Reuters, Bain will also invest another 200 billion yen on infrastructure development.Western Digital Fumes over the DecisionWestern Digital promptly protested over the decision and issued a statement that it will continue with the arbitration process against Toshiba. Notably, Western Digital’s division SanDisk and Toshiba jointly run the flash memory operations in Japan.The Japanese conglomerate retaliated immediately (per Reuters) stating that Western Digital had been “persistently” overstating its rights over the memory chip unit.Western Digital and Toshiba had been at loggerheads over the divestiture from the beginning of the auction. Based on the joint-venture (“JV”) agreement, the U.S.-based company had been insisting on its rights to approve or disapprove any transaction involving the partnership, which Toshiba had refused to entertain.Both are now fighting legal suites in the United States as well as Japan.  As per the directive of a California court, Toshiba has to officially notify Western Digital two weeks prior to the closing of the divestiture transaction.Lack of Trust, Apple Warning Hurt Western DigitalThe relationship between Toshiba and Western Digital somewhat mended in August and early September, when Western Digital’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) visited Japan for negotiations related to the disputed unit. Per Reuters, Steve Milligan also apologized to Toshiba’s CEO, Satoshi Tsunakawa, for strained ties.However, negotiation between the companies failed primarily due to lack of trust. Reportedly, Toshiba feared that Western Digital will eventually seek ways to gain a majority stake at the chip business. The company sought to limit the U.S. storage device provider’s future position in the unit that dragged down the deal.Moreover, threat from Apple to not to use Toshiba’s product also hurt the prospects of the deal with Western Digital. The iPhone-maker argued that it would lose pricing power if Western Digital gains control over the chip-unit.    What’s Next for Western Digital?Toshiba has kept options open for negotiation with other bidders, which still gives a slim chance to Western Digital. We do expect a last-minute counter-deal from the U.S.-based company, given the significance of the memory unit to its growth prospects.Notably, Toshiba is the second largest NAND flash memory maker, a technology that is now preferred over legacy hard-drive storage systems due to speed and reliability. Western Digital was keen on acquiring the unit as it would have improved its competitive position against the likes of Micron technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), SK Hynix and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report).However, if a counter deal fails, we expect Western Digital to become more aggressive legally. This may eventually help it to gain more concessions at the JV.Currently, Western Digital has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, the series never had a PC version.With the launch of Destiny 2 on PCs, the company will be able to cater to a broader audience. The title has already received positive feedback from most reviewers including IGN, GameSpot and Metacritic.3. Nintendo and Western Digital partnered to launch Nintendo Switch-licensed microSDXC SanDisk memory cards with capacity of 64 GB and 128 GB.Owing to the limited storage capacity, Nintendo Switch users are unable to enjoy the full gaming experience for certain games that require additional storage due to their large file formats (in the range of 50-100 GB). Games such as NBA 2K18 require the use of memory cards and Nintendo has many such games in the pipeline. Buying memory cards will help users to enjoy the full game versions. Per Nintendo, the memory cards will be available for sale next month.Switch, priced at $300, combines the functionalities of both conventional consoles and handheld devices. Switch is designed to attract casual gamers who are increasingly using mobile. Switch has seen tremendous response.As of Jun 30, 2017, Nintendo sold 4.7 million units and expects to reach 10 million units in the first year. Switch was released in March this year.

848,WDC,"The ever-evolving technology sector has seen quite a few trends in the last couple of years, the notable ones being cloud computing, Big Data, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), Internet of Things, flash storage, social networking and 3D printing.Among these,  flash memory — a non-volatile, electronic computer storage medium that can be re-programmed — is perhaps the most talked about. It is used in solid state drives (SSDs), computer random access memory (RAM), universal serial bus (USB) drives, hybrid drives, digital camera, handsets, memory cards graphics cards and pagers.The key driving force of the worldwide flash memory market is its increasing use in cell phones that have now higher memory capacities. The exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals have compelled several companies to turn to flash memory vendors.There is a radical change in the way people are using devices and communicating with each other, leading to increased adoption of mobile devices. Naturally, demand for flash storage has shot up.Flash Memory: Massive Growth PotentialPer Statista, the flash memory market is expected to be worth $27.6 billion globally in 2020.IDC forecasts that by 2025, the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes (that is a trillion gigabytes), which is 10 times the 16.1 zettabytes (ZB) of data generated in 2016. Due to the high performance and low latency features of flash storage, it has become the ideal storage technology to harness this data explosion.The growing need for storing this massive data as well as faster access is significant for effective utilization of Big Data and business analytics applications. According to market research firm IDC, revenues from these applications are expected to grow from $122 million in 2015 to more than $187 million in 2019 (up more than 50%).Moreover, per Research and Markets projections, worldwide data center storage market will expand at a four-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.01% during 2016-2020.Notably, the growing demand for storage across applications such as consumer electronics and enterprise storage sectors have significantly driven the NAND flash memory market, particularly 3D NAND memory. According to Allied Market Research, the market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 33.7% to $39 billion over 2014-2022.3 Bets in the Flash Memory SpaceWith the flash memory market becoming more lucrative than ever, we bring to you a few promising stocks, which could be interesting long-term investment options.Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), one of the leading worldwide providers of semiconductor memory solutions, offers both DRAM and NAND products. According to a number of industry sources, prices for both of these components have been improving, largely because of improved product mix optimization and higher demand from PCs, servers, and mobile devices.Micron is engaged in developing next-gen memory technologies such as 3D NAND and 3DXPoint with Intel (INTC). We are optimistic about the company’s future, given its acquisition of smaller memory-chip makers such as Inotera Memories Inc.Moreover, Micron is expected to benefit from strong demand for NAND flash memory chips, which are used in smartphones and tablets. Driven by new tablet products and greater adoption of solid state drive (SSD), total demand in the NAND flash memory industry could surpass manufacturing capacity, leading to a periodic shortage and higher pricing in the near term.Rising memory prices are expected to boost Micron's revenues. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will witness around 11% growth in fiscal 2018 year. Its earnings are expected to surge around 30% in 2018.The company currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a long-term EPS growth rate of 10%. You can see the complete list f today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here.The stock has returned approximately 84.8% in the last one year, outperforming the industry’s gain of just 83.8%.Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) is a global data storage technology and solutions leader. The company’s efforts toward expanding its footprint in the flash storage are commendable. In doing so, the company started developing the 96-layer 3-D NAND flash technology in June. Within a month the company also announced its development of X4, flash memory design built on 64-layer 3D NAND, BiCS3 technology.Most recently, the company also signed an agreement to acquire Tegile Systems and completed the acquisition of the assets of Upthere, an app-based cloud-storage startup. We believe these deals will strengthen its foothold in this space and should prove valuable.The common link between the aforementioned acquisitions is that all these companies provide cloud based flash-driven storage solutions which are growing rapidly.The acquisition of SanDisk has opened new avenues of growth for the company, particularly in the NAND and SSD markets.  Also, the acquisitions of other flash-memory players such as Amplidata, sTec, Velobit, Inc., Arkeia Software Solutions are other positives.Hence, the increasing demand for flash storage bodes well for Western Digital, which is taking an inorganic route to bolster flash storage offerings.The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a long-term EPS growth rate of 7.5%. The stock has returned approximately 67.5% in the last one year, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of just 23.9%.Pure Storage, Inc. (PSTG  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of all-flash storage products. Adoption of flash storage is increasing rapidly, particularly in enterprises, due to inherent advantages of speed (i.e. responsiveness), portability, efficiency and reliability over legacy storage systems.The company’s expanding product portfolio (that includes platforms like NVMe, Purity FlashBlade, 75 blades up to 8 PB of storage, Object Storage, and Active Cluster) is the key catalyst, in our view.The company is fast gaining traction in the flash storage market, which is evident from its accelerating customer base. Customer growth has been exemplary. The count witnessed a CAGR of 124%, from 300 in first-quarter fiscal 2015 to 3,350 in first-quarter fiscal 2018. During this period, revenues grew at a CAGR of 157%. Notably, 25% of the total revenue comes from cloud customers. Increasing spending from top 25 customers has been a major growth driver.Moreover, robust demand for FlashArray and FlashBlade products is projected to boost the top line, which is now expected to reach $2 billion by fiscal 2021 (more than 30% CAGR over fiscal 2018–2021 time frame). Pure Storage is considered a pioneer in the all-flash array category and the solid growth projections bode well for long-term growth.The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has returned approximately 32.5% on a year-to-date basis, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of just 12.8%.Looking AheadThe above-mentioned stocks are in the spotlight with striking performances supported by their strong foothold in the flash memory market. Keeping that in mind, we believe these stocks to yield robust returns throughout the rest of this year.Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside?Today's investment ideas are short-term, directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator.

849,WDC,"Japan-based video game developer Nintendo Co. (NTDOY  -  Free Report)) and Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) recently collaborated to launch Nintendo Switch-licensed microSDXC SanDisk memory cards with capacity of 64 GB and 128 GB.Per Nintendo, the memory cards are exclusively for Nintendo Switch video game systems and will be available for sale next month. We believe that the brand value of SanDisk and strong demand for Nintendo Switch console will help these cards to gain traction in a short span.Per Nintendo, as of Jun 30, 2017, 4.7 million units of Nintendo Switch (launched in March) have been sold globally. The company targets to sell around 10 million units in the first year, same as what Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) Xbox One achieved in its first year.The collaboration also augurs well for Western Digital as its customer base will expand. The Switch exclusivity will help the company penetrate the Japanese market faster where Nintendo has a significant presence.Western Digital shares have gained 31.7%, significantly outperforming the 12.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Higher Memory to Boost Demand for Nintendo’s Games In Japan, Nintendo Switch has outperformed Sony’s (SNE  -  Free Report) PS4. In the first 26 weeks, the company sold 1.5 million units of Nintendo Switch in the country, which is more than double the number of PS4 units sold over the same time frame when it was launched in 2013. Reportedly, it took PS4 69 weeks to reach the figure which Nintendo Switch achieved in 26 weeks.Moreover, Nintendo Switch has also fared better than the company’s Wii U gaming console, which took nearly a year to sell 5 million units.Western Digital Corporation Price Western Digital Corporation Price | Western Digital Corporation QuoteHowever, owing to a limited storage capacity of 32 GB, Nintendo Switch users are unable to enjoy the full gaming experience for certain games that require additional storage due to their large file formats (in the range of 50-100 GB).One such game as noted by Nintendo is NBA 2K18, which necessitates the use of the new memory card for accessing its full version. The company has many such advanced games in its pipeline. These include the new Pokemon and Metroid 4 games which it plans to release in 2018. FIFA 18 is also scheduled for launch this month.However, buying an extra memory card for such games will lead to an increase in price for gaming on the console, which is a concern.Currently, Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Western Digital has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

850,WDC,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Western Digital is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for WDC in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $3.80 per share for WDC, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.77 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for WDC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.83% heading into earnings season.Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Western Digital Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that WDC has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

851,WDC,"In the top stories last week, Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) launched its Chrome Enterprise subscription to challenge Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is likely beefing up Apple Music while Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) looks set to acquire a stake in Toshiba Memory and prevent its sale to competitors.Here are the details:    Google’s Chromebook Heads for the EnterpriseGoogle has announced a service called Chrome Enterprise for $50 per chromebook per year. This compares with Microsoft’s $84 per user per year for Windows 10 Enterprise E3. Theoretically, Microsoft may be slightly cheaper because a person may be able to use the service on more than one device. We don’t know yet if Google will offer bulk discounts.But Microsoft didn’t win many friends when it withdrew XP support because not everyone was ready to upgrade. Moreover, enterprises increasingly want to keep their options open and not become overly dependent on any one technology provider. These factors work against Microsoft and seem to indicate that the Google service will lead to chromebook penetration at the enterprise.     The Chrome Enterprise service offers a cloud-based management portal that can help administrators manage a fleet of Chromebooks. It also supports virtualized desktop applications and authentication through Microsoft Active Directory, threat prevention and a host of other features. Additionally, Google is partnering with VMware at launch, meaning that it has the ability to run VMware Airwatch’s enterprise mobility management software and through which it will allow chromebooks to run Microsoft applications as well.RBC Positive About Apple InvestmentApple’s billion dollar earmarking for content has got a lot of speculations going. While a WSJ report earlier said that the amount would be spent for Hollywood content to help Apple compete with stuff from Netflix, Amazon and the like, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani says this is unlikely to be the case. And it makes sense what he says, that the amount is small compared to the $6 billion Netflix is spending or the $4 billion Amazon is spending for content. And Apple’s earlier attempts in the area also haven’t been so successful. So it will most likely be used to beef up Apple Music to better compete against Spotify.True enough, Spotify with its 50 million subscribers and free tier remains well ahead of Apple Music. On the other hand, it’s been around much longer and Apple Music has been growing very fast to its 27 million strong current subscriber base. So Daryanani figures that it will take Apple just three years to recover the cost if it can add 7-8 million more people. Apple already has a larger catalog and more exclusives, so further boosting content could even help it steal away some Spotify customers and help it double services revenue by 2020 (as targeted).   Western Digital Consortium To Buy Toshiba Chip Unit After AllKyodo News reports that Toshiba is finally on the brink of approving a deal to sell a majority stake in its memory chip business Toshiba Memory to Western Digital, KKR & Co., Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, Development Bank of Japan and others. Western Digital has agreed that its voting rights will be limited to a third so it doesn’t play a major role in deciding management issues. Toshiba is in a hurry to sell the business after its American nuclear power unit went bankrupt and the company was forced to report a huge loss.Toshiba Memory will sell for nearly 2 trillion yen, which will help the company stay afloat. It’s expected that Toshiba Memory will also be listed some time in the future. Western Digital may have won this round because it went the litigation route, which generally takes time. Toshiba doesn’t have that time, which is probably why it ultimately chose the WDC-led outfit despite the fact that it took a hard stand against it earlier. TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL+1.50%+16.98%FB-0.65%+22.80%GOOGL+0.47%+9.75%MSFT+0.46%+12.68%INTC-0.97%-5.08%CSCO+3.52%-8.39%AMZN-1.37%+11.83% Other storiesCorporateApple Iowa Data Center: Apple is all set to build a 400,000 square-foot state-of-the-art data center in Waukee, Iowa. It will spend $1.3 billion on the structure and also contribute up to $100 million towards a   Public Improvement Fund for community development, including the revitalization of streets, libraries and parks. The center itself will employ around 50 people, but setting up the structure on the 2,000 acre plot will also create around 550 temporary construction and operations jobs. Apple will get $208 million in state and local tax breaks.Facebook Selects Hardware Chief: Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) veteran Andrew Bosworth, who previously worked as Facebook's VP of ads and business platform, and played important roles in the development of Messenger and News Feed, has now been made the head of its hardware efforts. These include at the moment, its Oculus unit and the secretive Building 8. Oculus is spearheading Facebook’s VR/AR efforts while Building 8 is reportedly working on a video chat service called Aloha as well as an Amazon Echo equivalent.New Products/TechnologyApple Finds Use for Self-Driving Technology: Like Google’s Waymo, Apple has now decided to sell self-driving technology rather than self-driving cars, given the difficulties of getting a new car to market, especially since it is far from its core expertise. According to employees familiar with the matter, the company will be testing its technology to shuttle employees inside the campus.The project is called PAIL (Palo Alto Infinite Loop, after its Cupertino headquarters near Palo Alto, situated on a road called Infinite Loop). Veteran Bob Mansfield was recently put in charge of Apple’s self-driving unit, called Project Titan, after another Apple veteran Steve Zadesky quit in Jan 2016 over disagreements with design chief Jony Ive.Facebook to Broadcast College Football: Facebook has a deal with Stadium, a joint venture between Sinclair Broadcast Group, Silver Chalice, and 120 Sports to live stream 15 games (nine Conference USA matches and six Mountain West games) on its platform. People around the world can catch the games on the Stadium: Live College Football Show Page on Facebook. U.S. users can also see them on Watch, the new Facebook tab dedicated to original video. Needless to say, there will be social elements such as a live, curated chat from football personalities alongside the stream and a team of people to interact with the audience.New Intel Chips for Laptops: The first of Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) eighth generation chips are here, and they’re targeted at thin and light devices like notebooks, laptops, tablets, convertibles, etc. The new “U” series chips double the cores from two to four and supporting threads from four to eight (than its predecessor released last year), meaning that Intel’s new chips are much more powerful now although they consume the same power. Distant rival AMD, which made waves with its Zen architecture, is set to launch its quad core chips called Raven Ridge for laptops later this year. Intel says its chips offer 10 hours of battery life.Microsoft Breakthrough on Speech Recognition: Microsoft’s speech recognition system is reportedly doing better than humans when translating spoken words to transcripts. THE current word error rate is 5.1%, which the company believes is similar to a human error rate and much better than Microsoft’s previous 5.9% error rate achieved a year ago.Microsoft and IBM are going neck to neck in this battle, with IBM having touched 5.5% this March (its previous rate was much higher at 6.9%). Voice recognition technology and the eco system it serves are interdependent and more accurate interpretations by voice assistants will increase their usage. This in turn will help to improve the technology further.Microsoft Building Own AI Hardware: Microsoft has built an artificial intelligence system based on Intel’s Stratix 10 FPGAs to minimize latency and thereby solve artificial intelligence queries in real time. It’s expected that Microsoft and Intel will be able to further improve speed as the technology is further developed. Brainwave, as the deep learning acceleration platform is called consists of a high-performance distributed system architecture; a hardware deep-neural network engine running on FPGAs; and a compiler and runtime for deployment of trained models, according to Microsoft’s blog post.Project Brainwave will be available through Azure cloud services. It currently supports trained models created using Microsoft’s CNTK and Google’s TensorFlow frameworks with other tools like Facebook’s Caffe2 likely to be added soon.Google Search for Indonesia: Google is launching a slimmed down version of its search app in Indonesia, where users are primarily mobile only. Despite the low penetration of desktops in the region compared to mobiles, Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) says the market will grow eightfold from 2016 to 2021, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 53%. Google estimates that smartphone usage will propel the country to the 4th largest market of Internet users by 2020. So it’s a big opportunity that needs to be tapped. If successful, the app can be taken to other emerging markets where Internet connections are spotty.Collaborations and M&ACisco Goes After Hyperconvergence Startup: Cisco is spending $320 million in cash and additional retention-incentive awards to acquire hyperconvergence startup Springpath. Cisco has in the past helped the startup with finances and based its Hyperflex hyperconvergence platform on Springpath technology. The two have been working together for a while and after a deal to supply its technology was reached last year, Springpath stopped distributing its technology to other players.So the acquisition was always in the cards. It also makes perfect sense given the growing need to wrest market share from Nutanix, Hewlett Packard’s Simplivity, Dell, VMware, etc. and especially as the core hardware business continues to shrink.Microsoft-Halliburton: Microsoft has a deal with oil and gas giant Halliburton, under which it will host its iEnergy service for exploration and production. Microsoft is offering its Hololens and Surface devices to deliver voice and image recognition, video processing and AR/VR to create a digital representation of a physical asset.Credit Suisse’s Michael Nemeroff said in a note titled “Not your father’s Microsoft anymore,” that “While the economics of this deal were not disclosed, we view these types of announcements and this one in particular, as a prime example of how MSFT is purposely steering its long-term corporate strategy away from its legacy tools and cyclical PC business, and towards the next generation of software technology that will foster incremental productivity gains to create wider competitive advantages for its early adopter customers, which we expect to become technology standards over time.”Google-Walmart: Walmart’s ecommerce head Marc Lore, who joined the company upon its purchase of jet.com, is doing all he can to grow the retail giant’s ecommerce business. That’s why the company is now partnering with Google, so customers can use Google Assistant, which powers Google Home and also millions of Android devices, to order groceries online. Now, people shopping on Google Express can also order what they need from Walmart, whether they want it delivered or prefer to pick up at the store or curb. So Google is bringing voice technology, which to be honest hasn’t really picked up (because of rotten experience mainly) while Walmart is bringing products and data to the partnership. Both have a common rival is Amazon, which has a 75% share of the voice ordering ecommerce market according to eMarketer, with Google accounting for most of the balance.Some NumbersGartner Data on Smartwatches: Gartner appears to be quite optimistic about smartwatches, saying that the segment will grow at the expense of simpler wristbands from 13% of total wearables in 2017 to 16% by 2021, at which time it will generate $17.4 billion in revenue. Research director Angela McIntyre says, “""The overall ASP of the smartwatch category will drop from $223.25 in 2017 to $214.99 in 2021 as higher volumes lead to slight reductions in manufacturing and component costs, but strong brands such as Apple and Fossil will keep pricing consistent with price bands of traditional watches.""Other important wearables categories include Bluetooth headsets, which will be 48% of the total wearables market this year (dropping to 41% in 2021) and head mounted displays, which the firm says is only in its infancy and will generate just 7% of wearables shipments in 2017 (growing to 13% of the market by 2021). Other fitness monitors are also expected to grow strongly.Facebook Gets Back Its Teens: The market has been speculating for long about whether Facebook has a teen problem or not. A recent report from eMarketer continues this argument. The research firm says that while Facebook usage by teens between 12 and 17 years of age dropped 1.2% in 2016, the number was expected to decline 3.4% this year. But this may not be such a problem for the social network, which has done a pretty good job of aping Snapchat with its Instagram offering. Instagram also has the kind of content that might be easier to monetize than Snapchat. So while Facebook appears to be losing a few teens on its app, it’s also gaining back a few through Instagram.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market. Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

853,WDC,"Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) has entered the race for buying Toshiba Corp.'s chip unit at the eleventh hour. Per reports, Apple has been roped in by a consortium led by Bain Capital to strengthen its offer for the Japanese conglomerate’s lucrative chip business.In June, Bain Capital along with Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ) and Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) reportedly submitted a fresh bid of 2.1 trillion yen (approximately $19 billion).It is reported that Apple will inject around ¥400bn (possibly upfront) while South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix and Bain will provide about ¥1.1 trillion with Toshiba’s banks supplying the remaining funds.Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteWhy is Apple Interested in Toshiba?Notably, Toshiba is the second largest NAND flash memory maker, a technology that is now preferred over legacy hard-drive storage systems due to speed and reliability. Apple sources flash memory for iPhone and iPods from Toshiba.Analysts observe that by acquiring Toshiba’s chip business, Apple can not only reduce its dependence on Samsung but also maintain competitive pricing. Bloomberg quoted Michael Walkley, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, saying “There are supply shortages of that type of memory. They’re always looking to work closely with key suppliers and lock in long-term supply agreements.”Toshiba Fails to Meet Creditors’ DeadlineAt its board meeting held on Thursday morning, Toshiba failed to arrive at any consensus, thereby failing to meet the deadline set by its creditors’ to sell its chip business. Reportedly, in a statement, Toshiba’s board said “While Toshiba exercised its best efforts to reach a mutually satisfactory definitive agreement with one of the consortia seeking to purchase TMC, the negotiations with each consortium have not reached the point which will allow Toshiba's Board of Directors to make a decision.”The chip unit, which Toshiba values at 2 trillion yen, has attracted a number of suitors. With many backing out including Broadcom (AVGO), Toshiba at present is considering three offers, per media reports.One is the abovementioned Bain consortium-led offer. The second bid is led by Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report). Now Western Digital’s division SanDisk and Toshiba jointly run a flash memory factory in Japan. The two have been at loggerheads over the sale of the chip business for quite some time now.Citing the joint venture (JV) agreement, Western Digital insists that it has the rights to approve/disapprove any transaction that involves the JV. However, Toshiba counterclaimed that the JV agreement doesn’t give the right to either party to block the other from selling its share. It also pointed out that Western Digital bought SanDisk without seeking or receiving Toshiba’s approval. There continues to be high level tension between the companies with claims, counterclaims and arbitrations involved.Western Digital is looking to get its hands on the memory business as it will strengthen Western Digital’s competitive position in the profitable NAND flash memory market.The final bid is from a group of buyers, which includes Taiwanese electronics maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, parent company of Foxconn. Chances of Hon Hai striking the deal are relatively low due to its significant presence in China. This is not going to go down well with the Japanese government.Toshiba is in a awful situation. The company needs to raise capital to remain a listed entity. Currently, the company has negative shareholder’s equity after it posted a colossal loss of 950 billion yen (almost $8.6 billion) in the fiscal year ended March. Most of the loss stemmed from write-downs pertaining to its now-defunct Westinghouse nuclear business.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the company has outperformed the industry in a year. Shares of Apple have surged 54% compared with the industry’s 52.3% increase.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader tech space include Garmin Ltd.

854,WDC,"Now that third-quarter earnings season is all but over, a lot of the investment world’s attention begins to shift towards the holiday quarter. With that said, growth-minded investors are likely still on the hunt for new stocks and the tech sector is a great place to start.The likes of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) rightfully garner a lot of attention as their rapid growth has helped spur the rise of technology stocks. But even the most causal of readers know about these giants.For investors looking to find growth in the tech sector outside of putting their money in the biggest names, Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) could be a good place to start.The U.S. tech company manufactures and sells data storage devices and hard drives. The memory and computer storage industry that Western Digital operates in is only set to grow as the amount of data companies and people use grows exponentially.Now, let’s look at what makes Western Digital a great growth stock.Growth Fundamentals Western Digital, which develops and manufactures data storage devices for both personal and corporate use is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.The company was in the news on Monday after its stock price fell nearly 7%. The movement came after Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) lowered its Western Digital rating from overweight to equal weight. Morgan Stanley’s downgrade also included other computer memory and NAND flash memory firms and cited future prices as a reason for the downgrade.Before today’s decline, shares of Western Digital had soared 36.54% in 2017. What’s more, the company has already fought its way back from a major 2015 downturn. And based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, Western Digital’s revenues and earnings are set to jump.Western Digital’s revenues are projected to surge 7.58% in the second quarter of its fiscal 2018 to reach as high as $5.28 billion. On top of that, the company’s full-year revenues are expected to pop nearly 7% to $20.40 billion.The data storage company, which boasts big brands such as SanDisk under its umbrella, is expected to see itsQ2 2018 earnings skyrocket 58.32%. For its full fiscal year, Western Digital’s earnings are set to hit $13.17 per share, which would mark a 43.30% year-over-year gain.In terms of growth, Western Digital’s current cash flow rests at 96%, which crushed the “Computer – Storage Devices” industry’s 2.79% average decline. On top of that, the company’s historic cash flow—the last 3-5 years, annualized—sits at 11.68%, beating its industry’s average, and helps to show that the company has been growing its cash position in recent years.Western Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Western Digital Corporation QuoteFor investors skeptical that Western Digital will be able to match or beat our current consensus estimates for revenue and earnings, the company has met or topped out estimates in seven of the last eight quarters. Lastly, for investors concerned that Western Digital might only be a growth play, the company also currently rocks an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system, helping it earn an overall “A” VGM score. Western Digital is currently trading at just 7.06x earnings, which marks a 50% discount compared to its industry’s average.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

855,WDC,"The United States Senate just passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, marking President Donald Trump’s first major legislative conquest. The highlight of the reform is the slash in corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% that is expected to boost the bottom line of the companies.However, the technology sector is unlikely to benefit much from the reforms owing to the fact that  it already enjoys several tax benefits and therefore has a lower effective tax rate. Citing S&P Global data, Bloomberg stated, “Among sectors, the 18.5 percent effective tax rate enjoyed by the group is the third-lowest among U.S. large caps.”This was also evident from the sector’s not so impressive run in early December 2017 when investors were moving their funds into sectors which had higher scope for gains. As a matter of fact, just after the Republican Senate passed the bill with a 51-49 majority on Dec 2 morning, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) declined approximately 2% in next two trading days.Nevertheless, we believe that the technology sector, which has been benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, augmented/virtual reality devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) related software is capable of  regaining momentum in 2018.In fact, investors also soon realized that the early December plunge across the technology sector is an opportunity to invest in stocks that were too pricey earlier.Here are a few stocks that saw a decline in their prices in early December following a shift in investors’ focus toward other sectors. But these stocks enjoy strong fundamentals and thus are well poised for growth.Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) is one such stock which is still available at discount compared with with Dec 1 closing price. We believe that the company has several driving factors, which can help it gain going ahead.The company is benefiting from strong demand for its wireless solutions. The trend is expected to continue in fiscal 2018. Moreover, the upcoming launch of the next generation WiFi products is expected to be a growth driver for the segment. Additionally, Broadcom’s focus on multiple target markets mitigates operating risks and lessens the exposure to volatility in any single market. Based on its expanding product portfolio, the company is well-positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like IoT and 5G.The company’s Zack’s Rank #1 and VGM Score of B are further testaments to its upside potential. The VGM Score rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping to identify those with the most attractive value, best growth, and most promising momentum, across the board.Broadcom Ltd.

The company continues with its focus on delivering above-average sales growth, profitability improvement, strong cash flow generation and increasing shareholder value. Moreover, its comprehensive portfolio of products and services, and a sizable global footprint are further tailwinds for the company.The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B, which makes the stock an attractive pick at the moment.WESCO International, Inc.

These initiatives are paving the way for the company to excel in the 3D printing industry, which is anticipated to witness CAGR of 25.76% through 2017 to 2023 and reach $32.78 billion.The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B, which further indicate its upside potential.Stratasys, Ltd. Revenue (TTM) Stratasys, Ltd. Revenue (TTM) | Stratasys, Ltd. QuoteWestern Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) is one stock that has already covered up its early December loss. The company is poised to benefit from robust demand in end markets as well as strong growth prospects for flash-based storage products. The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is also driving top-line growth. We note that the company is gaining from strong demand for both hard drive and NAND-based products from all categories of customers, largely driven by cloud and mobility based applications.Additionally, the stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of A.Western Digital Corp.

856,WDC,"Intel Corp.’s (INTC  -  Free Report) initiatives in the Internet of Things (IoT), Non-Volatile Memory Solutions and Programmable Solutions Group along with cloud computing is lowering dependence on the PC market. These rapidly-growing market segments present significant prospects for the semiconductor giant in the near future. The company is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25.Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Intel Corporation QuoteClick here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is expected to be.Segments to Aid Intel’s GrowthInternet of Things Group (5.3% of revenues) — Revenues jumped 23.2% from the year-ago quarter and 17.9% quarter over quarter to $849 million. Growth can be attributed to strength in industrial, retail and video applications.Intel closed the acquisition of Israel-based Mobileye, an autonomous vehicle technology provider. The deal will help the company to penetrate the $70-billion autonomous driving systems, data and services market.At CES event, the company announced few important partnerships — with BMW, Nissan, Volkswagen AG, and Ferrari — which show Intel’s growing dominance in providing AI platforms which will power future vehicles.It will also leverage Intel’s Mobileye-based mapping technology for improving self-driving cars navigation process.Intel also joined forces with SAIC Motor and NavInfo to extend crowdsourced map building to China. SAIC Motor will build cars of Level 3, 4, and 5. These vehicles will be powered by Mobileye technology, which means it will be able to handle most driving situations itself.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Internet of Things Group segment is currently pegged at $859 million.Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (5.5% of revenues) — Revenues jumped 37.3% year over year and 1.9% sequentially to $891 million. Fab 68, Intel’s Dalian factory, continued to beat both ramp rate and yield goal. The factory accounted for more than half of the company’s supply in the quarter where more than 70% of the total bits were 3D NAND.Recently, Intel and Micron have announced a mutual agreement to work separately in order to complete development of its third generation of 3D NAND technology. Intel and Micron will jointly develop the 3D XPoint at the Intel-Micron Flash Technologies (“IMFT”). The product, is expected to sample this year, and could enter production as early as 2019 at their joint facility in Lehigh, UT.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group is currently pegged at $938 million.Programmable Solutions Group (2.9% of revenues) — The Altera business is now the Programmable Solutions Group, which increased 10.4% from the year-ago quarter and 6.6% sequentially to $469 million. Strength in advanced products, data center, automotive and military drove top-line growth.Notably, Microsoft is deploying Intel FPGAs to develop the industry's fastest public cloud network and acceleration of deep neural networks. The company had announced that it would use Intel’s 14-nm Stratix 10 FPGAs for its accelerated deep-learning platform (Project Brainwave).Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba also selected Intel FPGA’s in its Cloud. Moreover, Audi is using Intel’s Cyclone V SoC FPGA technology for the Level 3 autonomous driving system in its upcoming A8.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Programmable Solutions Group is currently pegged at $475 million.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderIntel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) are some better-ranked stocks in the same sector. All the three companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

857,WDC,"It is hard to ignore stocks that scale 52-week highs or hit the lows as such movements are tracked on a daily basis. But the question here is: what importance does such a stock movement hold from an investor’s perspective?In this screening article, we discuss the 52-week investment plan. One of the relatively new entries in the investing rulebook, this strategy relies on the mantra, “buy high and sell higher.” Betting on a stock near its 52-week high has its own pitfalls as there is a possibility of it scaling higher or going downhill without forewarning.While market analysts may be divided in their opinion regarding the 52-week high investment technique, many of them believe that 52-week high stocks which are still undervalued and have strong upside potential can be lucrative bets.An Insight in to 52-Week High StocksStocks near 52-week highs often instill the presumptive “adjustment and anchoring bias” in the minds of investors. This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52-week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor.Many a times, such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors despite bullish growth drivers. Meanwhile, news pertaining to robust sales, surging profit levels, bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive the stock higher.However, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52-week high bar. Wall Street’s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it.Also, recent academic research reveals that if a stock’s current price is near its 52-week high, there are high chances that it will outperform peers in the subsequent period. According to researchers George and Hwang, holding 52-week high stocks for six months resulted in an average monthly gain of 0.45% between 1963 and 2001. Encouragingly, this is twice the gain that can be garnered from similar momentum-based strategies.Setting the Right FiltersOur diligent screening technique has been deployed to find 52-week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries. The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum.These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, which make us believe that they will continue their rally for quite some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks.

858,WDC,"Picking undervalued stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a common investing strategy. The logic is simple — the stock’s current price does not reflect its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside.But very few believe that stocks with a rising P/E are worth buying. Let’s discuss this less-favored strategy in details.Strength of Increasing P/EThe concept is that as earnings rise, so should the price of the stock. As forecasts for expected earnings come in higher, strong demand for the stock should continue to drive its price. After all, a stock's P/E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out per dollar of earnings.Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P/E ratio of 30, it means that he is willing to pay $30 for only $1 worth of earnings. Now if the P/E ratio becomes 35 within a short spell of time, it means that the person is now ready to pay $35 for only $1 worth of earnings. It shows that the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future owing to strong fundamentals.So, if the P/E of a stock is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of its inherent strength and expect some strong positives out of it. Also, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P/E, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year’s actual growthPercentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero(These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years.)Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeksPercentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks(These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes.)Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S&P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&P 500Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S&P 500(Here, the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S&P 500.)Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20% higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks, but it should not exceed 100%(A 20% increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend. But a jump of over 100% indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal.)In addition, we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) can get through.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 11.Here are five of 11 stocks that passed the screen:Fortuna Silver Mines Inc. (FSM  -  Free Report): It is in the exploration, mining and development of silver and base metal properties in Latin America. The stock belongs to a Zacks Sector Rank in the top 19%. It carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ritter Pharmaceuticals Inc.

859,WDC,"Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) is riding high on robust performance from the Client Computing Group (“CCG”) and data-centric portion of business. Data Center Group (“DCG”), Internet-of-Things Group, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions and Programmable Solutions Group form the crux of the company’s data-centric business model. The company is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25.Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Intel Corporation QuoteClick here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is expected to be.CCG — Trend PositiveClient Computing Group (54.9% of revenues) — Revenues remained almost flat on a year-over-year basis but increased 7.9% sequentially to $8.86 billion.The company launched the new 8th Generation Core processor (Coffee Lake), which includes Intel’s first six-core desktop central processing unit (CPU). Management claims Coffee Lake to be its best gaming processor to date, with up to 50% better performance than competitive offerings in the market.During the quarter, Intel shipped its first modem in the auto industry. Modem revenues surged 37% on a year-over-year basis.However, intense competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) based on an expanding product portfolio is a concern.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the CCG segment is currently pegged at $8.745 billion.DCG — Purley Upgrade to Drive GrowthData Center Group (30.2% of revenues) — Revenues increased 7.4% year over year and 11.6% sequentially to $4.88 billion.The company shipped Xeon Scalable (formerly known as Skylake) to more than 200 original equipment manufacturer (OEM) systems in the quarter.The company recently announced Intel Stratix, the industry’s first field programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated with high bandwidth memory to accelerate workloads and keep pace with data explosion.The newly added product will expand the onboard memory pool and add more bandwidth. We believe that the launch will improve scalability, reliability, power and density requirements of future HPC deployments.Intel also announced substantial advances in its wireless product portfolio to accelerate 5G adoptions, alongside introducing Intel XMM 8000 series and Intel XMM 7660 series modems. The launch of Xeon Scalable, Core 8 chips, Myriad X and next-generation desktop processors are also key catalysts.For the data-center group, management still expects revenues to grow in the high-single digits and operating margin greater than the lower end of its long-term guidance range of 40-45% in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the DCG segment is currently pegged at $5.072 billion.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderIntel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) are some better-ranked stocks in the same sector. All the three companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.NVIDIA, Western Digital and Analog Devices have a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3%, 25.1% and 10.4%, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All     Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

860,WDC,"KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLAC  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 25.Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 6.64%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.43%.Notably, on a 12-month basis, KLA’s shares have returned 39.5%, underperforming the industry’s growth of 68.2%.Let’s find out what KLA has to offer investors in this quarter.Expanding Product Portfolio to Drive Top LineWe expect KLA’s top-line growth to benefit from an expanding product portfolio. The company is well poised to gain from strong demand for more efficient manufacturing processes.Moreover, the technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues are anticipated to drive growth from the company’s process control and yield management solutions.We believe solid customer demand for products across the four end-markets — Wafer Inspection (46% of shipments), Service (21%), Non-semi (3%) and Patterning (30%) — is anticipated to drive order growth in the upcoming quarter.For second-quarter fiscal 2018, KLA expects shipments of $945-$1.025 billion. Foundry orders are expected to be approximately 20% of shipments. Memory shipments are anticipated to be 60%, with NAND representing 55% of the mix. Logic is currently projected to be 14% of the shipment.KLA forecasts revenues between $930 million and $990 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $960.2 million.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Product segment is currently pegged at $759 million.Services Growth & China: Key FactorsServices have become a key-growth driver in recent times. Last quarter, services revenues increased 10.5% from the year-ago quarter to $208.8 million, which was also better than the consensus estimate of $202 million. The growth was driven by expanded installed base and increasing demand for the upgrade and maintenance of legacy nodes.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Service is currently pegged at $208 million.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Moreover, our proven model shows that KLA is likely to beat earnings due to the favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and +0.35% Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.

861,WDC,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 earnings results on Jan 25. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.9%.Due to expansion in digital data, modest growth of TAM and higher demand for storage, Western Digital’s growth prospects look exciting. Additionally, the company’s expanding product portfolio, secular growth of digital data, growing exposure to the SMB space and positive synergies derived from the SanDisk acquisition are likely to act as catalysts.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $3.77 per share, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 63.9%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.29 billion, up roughly 8.1% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q2 ResultsQ1 Earnings HighlightThe company reported non-GAAP earnings of $3.56 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 26 cents. The figure also came ahead of the year-ago quarter figure of $1.54 and the guided range of $3.25-$3.35 per share.Revenues also increased 9.9% year over year to $5.18 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.11 billion. The figure was also better than guided.The year-over-year growth can primarily be attributed to growing demand in the company’s end markets. Management was particularly positive about the company’s flash-based storage segment and joint venture fab operations in Yokkaichi. The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is another tailwind.For second-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are anticipated to be within the range of $5.2-$5.3 billion. Management expects non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $3.60–$3.70 per share. It also noted that the synergy targets from the acquisitions of HGST and SanDisk are on track.Expanding SSD Market & Cloud DeploymentWestern Digital has been expanding into the SSD storage market due to declining sales in the PC market. The emergence of thinner laptops, tablets and demand for fast processing storage devices in the past few years has created an ideal market for SSDs.Recently, the company unveiled the world’s smallest 1 TB USB flash drive, voice activated media streaming via home devices, and a new series of high performance SSDs. With the increasing need to capture and share rich content, lens technology and video streaming are becoming more and more immersive.For photographers and drone enthusiasts, the company also released My Passport Wireless SSD and SanDisk Extreme portable SSD. These devices feature a one-touch card copy that enables quick editing as well as third party app integration.Western Digital also announced My Cloud Home device that showcases new voice-activated media streaming features through smart home devices.These product additions will enhance the company’s existing product portfolio and aid Western Digital in gaining a strong foothold in the global SSD market, which per latest data by TechNavio is expected to witness CAGR of 17% during 2016-2020.Anticipating a potential acceleration in cloud deployments, Western Digital is also investing heavily to deliver high-capacity storage devices that will support expansion of cloud infrastructure and cloud applications.The company has expanded its My Cloud solutions with My Cloud EX4, a broader portfolio of network attached storage (NAS) hard drives. My Cloud EX4 will help the company meet growing business needs with improved flexibility and security, consequently boosting the top line.The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is another tailwind. Further, the company’s growing footprint in the automotive as well as the connected home and industrial categories are likely to act as a key catalyst.Acquisitions Driving GrowthWestern Digital’s acquisition of SanDisk has aided the company’s growth and also helped it to gain traction in SSD.  Additionally, it has allowed the company to step in to the NAND products market which owing to its strong demand, will drive revenues.Moreover, the company’s acquisition of Amplidata, sTec, Inc., Velobit, Inc. Arkeia Software Solutions and Virident Systems Inc. have not only strengthened its small-to-medium sized business solutions but also expanded its SSD product portfolio.Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Western Digital Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model conclusively shows that Western Digital is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has higher chance of beating estimates.

862,WDC,"Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 25 after the closing bell.Notably, the company has a positive record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 9.75%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 26.25%.Last quarter, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.01 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21 cents. The figure surged 26.3% from the year-ago quarter and 40.3% sequentially. The strong earnings growth was driven by better-than-expected top-line performance and operating margin expansion. Moreover, Intel Channel Alliance Program (ICAP) contributed 13 cents to quarterly earnings.Revenues totaled $16.15 billion, up 2.4% year over year and 9.4% quarter over quarter. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.71 billion. After adjusting for the McAfee (formerly Intel Security Group) transaction, revenues grew 6%. The top-line growth came on the back of impressive results from the Data Center Group, Internet-of-Things Group, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions and Programmable Solutions Group, which contributed almost 44% of total revenues. These segments form the crux of Intel’s data-centric business model.The company has gained just 21.6% in a year, underperforming the industry's growth of 50.4%.What to ExpectIntel revised 2017 outlook based on double-digit growth expectation from data-centric businesses.Intel guided fourth-quarter 2017 revenues of around $16.3 billion (+/-$500 million), up 3% year over year excluding McAfee. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $16.30 billion. Earnings are anticipated to be 86 cents (+/- 5 cents) per share, up 15% on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 86 cents.For fiscal 2017, management expects revenues of almost $ 62 billion (+/- $500 million), almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $62.02 billion and up $700 million from previous expectation. Earnings are now anticipated to be $3.25 (+/- 5 cents) per share, up from previous guidance of $3.00. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.25 per share.The company’s results will benefit from stable PC trends, anticipated demand for newly launched Xeon Scalable processors and newly added products. Moreover, Intel’s expanding presence in the rapidly-growing autonomous vehicle market along with continued focus on developing more advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for self-diving cars are key catalysts.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Autonomous Vehicles & AI: Key CatalystsIntel’s CEO Brian Krzanich during a ‘Prime Keynote’ in the CES 2018 talked about the company’s initiatives in driverless vehicles and powering AI technology through partnerships and strategic deals.Intel revealed a number of partnerships in the space. At the event, the company announced few important partnerships — with BMW, Nissan, Volkswagen AG, and Ferrari — which exhibit Intel’s growing dominance in providing AI platforms which will power future vehicles.It will also leverage Intel’s Mobileye-based mapping technology for improving self-driving cars navigation process.Intel also joined forces with SAIC Motor and NavInfo to extend crowdsourced map building to China. Additionally, Intel is also moving ahead in the virtual reality (VR) and and non-VR gaming space. It collaborated with Paramount Pictures for the next-generation VR andnon-VR Challenger League.Krzanich also added that Intel is collaborating with Ferrari North America to brings its AI technology to the Ferrari Challenge North America Series races to be held on six courses in the United States this year. The Ferrari Challenge will use Intel Xeon Scalable processors chips to enhance the experience to viewers online.Intel is also partnering with Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD  -  Free Report) Radeon Vega M GPUs with a purpose to utilize the GPUs in its next generation CPUs. All these efforts will contribute meaningfully to top-line growth in the upcoming quarter.Product Rollouts to Drive ResultsThe company recently announced Intel Stratix, the industry’s first field programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated with high bandwidth memory to accelerate workloads and keep pace with data explosion.The newly added product will expand the onboard memory pool and add more bandwidth. We believe that the launch will improve scalability, reliability, power and density requirements of future HPC deployments.Intel also announced substantial advances in its wireless product portfolio to accelerate 5G adoptions, alongside introducing Intel XMM 8000 series and Intel XMM 7660 series modems. The launch of Xeon Scalable, Core 8 chips, Myriad X and next-generation desktop processors are also key catalysts.We believe that growing demand for server chips that are used in data centers from cloud-based service providers like Amazon.com, Alphabet and Microsoft is a key catalyst for Intel. Moreover, the launch of Core 8 is expected to boost its PC market share.Intel’s Security Flaw Poses ChallengesIntel has encountered two major security issues that could let attackers to access security keys, passwords, and cached files of a device's kernel memory. The two security flaws called Meltdown and Spectre could allow programs to steal data including passwords stored in a password manager or browser, personal photos, emails, instant messages and even business-critical documents.The bug is apparently present in nearly every Intel CPU made within the last decade, and upcoming patches will negatively affect hardware performance. However, Microsoft, Apple and Linux programmers are rolling out patches to fix Linux and Windows kernels in order to address the vulnerability.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Intel carries a Zacks Rank #3 but its Earnings ESP is -0.09%.

863,WDC,"Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) Shazam acquisition, its $390 million advance to Finisar (FNSR  -  Free Report) and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) making peace with Toshiba were the top news from last week. Here are the details-Apple Buys ShazamApple has acquired popular music discovery app Shazam for an estimated $400 million. Shazam identifies music playing near the device within a few seconds and directs users to places like Apple’s App Store or Google’s Play Store where they can listen to the whole track later. But despite the billion+ times the app has been downloaded, the company hasn’t been able to monetize its service well, which is probably why it is going this cheap (it has raised a total of $143.5 million in funding rounds, the latest of which, back in 2015, valued the company at $1.2 billion).In 2016, it generated around $54 million in revenue to net a pre-tax loss of $5.3 million. Apple may be expected to integrate the software into Apple Music (or Siri) or in HomePod, its new, high-end smart speaker boasting superior sound quality that will launch in 2018. It’s unlikely that the service will be available to Android users as well, as it is now.Apple Offers $390 Million to FinisarFinisar has obtained a $390 million funding from Cupertino-based Apple that it will use to re-open a long-shuttered, 700,000-sqare-foot manufacturing plant in Sherman, Texas. The plant will be used to manufacture vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), a special kind of semiconductor found in sensors enabling 3D mapping of the external environment. It therefore has very wide-ranging application in things like augmented reality (AR) and self-driving cars. It also enables Apple’s Face ID technology that’s part of its iPhone X.Finisar has said that Apple’s contribution (which comes from a billion dollar fund it set aside for U.S. manufacturing support) is not in the nature of a debt or equity investment, but instead “represents anticipated future business between the companies over a period of time.”VCSEL products are currently in short supply, with the main providers being Finisar, Lumentum and Oclaro where Oclaro is the smallest and Lumentum the leader. But Finisar has been gearing up to increase production manifold. It’s unclear at this stage whether Apple’s agreement with Finisar involves the purchase of its entire production, which would preclude the company from supplying to Android manufacturers like Samsung, etc. thus giving Apple a competitive edge.But Apple no doubt secured the deal at very favorable rates as it usually does with its component suppliers. So it looks like a good deal for Apple and an average one for Finisar because Apple supply agreements usually mean good volumes at very low profit margins.Toshiba, WDC Are Friends AgainToshiba and Western Digital have agreed to settle all disputes between them, which means Western Digital’s withdrawal of all its legal proceedings against Toshiba and allowing the sale of Toshiba’s memory chip business to K.K. Pangea, a special purpose acquisition company formed and controlled by a consortium led by Bain and including Apple and WDC competitors Seagate and Hynix.At the same time, they “agreed on mutual protections for their assets and confidential information in connection with the sale of Toshiba Memory, and on collaborating to ensure the future success of Toshiba Memory as a public company following an eventual IPO.” WDC CEO Steve Milligan expressed satisfaction that “our interests in the JV were sufficiently protected and we had the right kind of protections and the right kind of access.""They also agreed to extend their JV partnerships including Flash Alliance that now runs to December 31, 2029 and Flash Forward to December 31, 2027. Flash Partners was previously extended to December 31, 2029.Additionally, neither party will move ahead with the Yokkaichi fab (Fab 6) without the other, i.e. both will invest in the next-generation of 3D flash memory BiCS FLASH™ and Western Digital will receive chip supply. They will also collaborate on the upcoming wafer fabrication facility in Iwate Japan, for which a new agreement will be drawn up “in due course.” TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL+2.7%+20.6%FB+0.7%+18.2%GOOGL+2.1%+11.3%MSFT+3.2%+22.0%INTC+2.8%+30.2%CSCO+1.5%+20.4%AMZN+1.5%+19.7% Other Stories-CorporateChinese Phone Makers Coming to the U.S.: Bloomberg reports that China’s biggest smartphone vendors Huawei and Xiaomi have their eyes on the U.S. market. While Huawei already sells its Mate 9 through Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other ecommerce channels, it will be much easier to increase sales with stores, carrier partnerships and commercials, so the thinking goes.Xiaomi is looking for a more gradual launch, first building its stores to sell fitness trackers, thermostats and vacuum cleaners while it works on phone details with carriers AT&T, Verizon and Sprint. That could take up to two years, according to Xiaomi executive Wang Xiang. Since wireless carriers are showing less inclination for subsidizing phones, this seems like the right time for Chinese players to make an entry, since they can sell devices much cheaper.Google AI Lab in China: Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google is setting up an artificial intelligence (AI) research team in Beijing, China to make the most of the growing talent in the region. The company hasn’t made much progress doing business in China but chairman Eric Schmidt has said it ""never left"" China. The Beijing-based team will work with AI colleagues in Google offices across the world, including New York, Toronto, London and Zurich.It’s true that competition for AI talent is on the rise since most modern systems will soon be using some form of the technology. So it might be a good idea to grab whatever’s possible. Dr. Fei-Fei Li, Chief Scientist at Google Cloud will be the heading effort and will be joined by Jia Li, who formerly headed research at Snap.Microsoft/Google Don’t Like Qualcomm-Broadcom Match: Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Google have reportedly raised objections to a takeover of Qualcomm by Broadcom. They have said that Broadcom has a history of cutting cost rather than investing in innovation that could hurt their own expansion plans. (Microsoft is currently working on ARM-based Windows 10 PCs that could for the first time help it diversify away from the X86 architecture. Any scale back from Qualcomm’s side could impact this strategy.Most of Google’s Android devices use Qualcomm chips, so it could also be affected by the deal). The other reason is that Broadcom is cozy with prime competitor Apple, which could make matters worse for them. Regulators often collect feedback from the industry to better understand the situation before a deal is approved, so this objection could get in the way. But Qualcomm has reportedly asked companies to shelve public statements to see if Broadcom raises the offer significantly from the current $70-a-share. If that isn’t forthcoming, there could be more press and publicity on the matter.Seagate Job Cuts: Seagate has announced yet another job cut as it continues to struggle against the onslaught of flash memory technology that continues to eat into the HDD market that it has dominated for years along with Western Digital. But while WDC bought leading flash player SanDisk to mitigate its risk, Seagate focused on HDD customers in the enterprise while cutting costs. That strategy hasn’t gone so well. The current plan is to slash 500 jobs by June 2018 to save some $65 million in annualized operating costs (a fraction of the couple of billion it spends annually).Legal/RegulatoryApple Opposes India’s Import Tax on Mobile Parts: India wants to increase domestic manufacturing of smartphone components, which is not an easy task since 90% of the $14 billion market is imported, according to Counterpoint Research. At the end of the day, it doesn’t help to welcome foreign investment in a way that the domestic manufacturing base isn’t strengthened. For this purpose, the government has a phased manufacturing program (PMP) that seeks to increase taxes on a growing number of smartphone components to force domestic production.Apple has held that such imports are necessary at least at the start if its Indian operations are to do well and compete effectively. So it has asked the government to waive the requirement. The government has stated publicly that it is considering Apple’s demand although the IT department has also said that waiving of the PMP may not be feasible. In any case, people familiar with the matter told Reuters that such special treatment isn’t forthcoming and that Apple is coming round.Facebook Changes Revenue Booking in EU: Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) has said that its local operations in each of the EU member nations will start booking revenue and profits locally rather than through its EU headquarters at Dublin. The move should please regulators since it will generate revenues for the country in which the business was transacted and settle disputes that have dragged companies like Google and Apple through courtroom after courtroom as they tried to justify the negligible taxes they paid in the EU through complicated tax avoidance structures. In 2016, Facebook started recording UK sales in Britain, which raised its tax bill somewhat. So this seems  to be  a broader rollout of the changed policy.Products/TechnologyApple Self Driving Car Efforts: While remaining mum on the progress it has made in bringing its self-driving car technology to market, the company has started opening up about some product details. Recently, Apple researchers talked about a 3D sensing system that could work on the basis of LiDAR technology alone, thus allowing a sleeker design. Now, its AI research director Ruslan Salakhutdinov is opening up again.At the Neural Information Processing Systems conference in California, he said that the company’s software is now able to spot cars, cyclists and pedestrians on busy streets and estimate their position even when they are partially obscured, navigate in unfamiliar spaces and build detailed 3D maps of cities. He also said that cars are given directions using a technique, internally dubbed SLAM meaning simultaneous localization and mapping.Click-to-WhatsApp Messaging Buttons: Facebook has been adding click-to-WhatsApp buttons to business pages, so users can directly message companies to contact customer care, fix appointments, know more about products, etc. The feature has been testing for a while now, but last week, the company announced a broader rollout to North and South America, Africa, Australia and most of Asia. Facebook could monetize the feature on the basis of number of clicks.Facebook Tries Measures to Boost Video Revenue: Facebook is doing more to get people to its Watch tab where users can access videos by professional creators. Facebook has been paying creators for the shows, but it is trying to build an advertising model around it, so payments won’t be necessary in the future. For videos accessed through the Watch tab, the company will now be showing commercials before the video starts. Also, videos need to be at least 3 minutes long if they are to have commercials in-between. This is up from 90 seconds allowed previously.Instagram Direct Messaging App: Instagram is testing a standalone messaging app called Direct exclusively for sharing private messages, photos and videos with friends. Like Snachat, it opens directly to the camera instead of your list of messages. It also has four filters: one bleeps you at random while blurring your mouth, another creates a live cut-out of your mouth to superimpose it over your actual mouth giving you a loony look, while a third creates an infinite video loop zooming in on your open mouth as multiple versions of your head swirl around you. Instagram is currently testing Direct in Turkey, Uruguay, Chile, Portugal, Italy and Israel and is expected to roll out broadly sometime next year.Microsoft’s Bing Enhancements: Microsoft is making Bing smarter as it continues its attempt to challenge Google in the space. To an extent, it has succeeded in getting people to use Bing more by making it a part of the Windows 10 experience. Now, it’s adding artificial intelligence to add more context to search results so they become more meaningful and easier to understand. Some questions don’t have straight answers, so Bing offers different perspectives in a pro-and-con format.For other questions, such as those related to numbers, it provides context that can give you a better understanding. For the purpose, Bing is also being paired with Reddit, which organizes into user-created areas of interest into groups called subreddits. Reddit AmA, a forum for user-driven question-and-answer interviews is also being woven into Bing.Amazon Will Now Sell Google Chromecast: Soon after Google pulled YouTube from Amazon devices, the leading online retailer has said that it will start selling Google Chromecast and Apple TV on its online store. Amazon earlier said that it wouldn’t offer TV boxes that didn’t include Amazon Prime Video because it could confuse Amazon customers. All that has changed now it seems. Or maybe it’s just that competition from traditional media is strengthening with Disney’s purchase of 21st Century Fox making a collaborative approach wiser.Twitter Threads: Twitterati have for long been sending a series of tweets commonly referred to as a “tweet storm” when they had more to say. Now, after doubling the character limit to 280 in most markets, Twitter figures that still more needs to be done. So now it’s enabling a feature that will allow people to write to their hearts’ content by simply tapping on the space below the tweet they just completed. They can go back and edit any of the earlier tweets because the whole series remains in draft until you tap tweet all. Once that’s done, Twitter will post the tweets, pacing them out slightly so they don’t all hit at the same moment.  You can also go back to “add another tweet” when (whenever) you want to update a thread.Pandora Video Ads: Pandora is doing a little bit more for its ad-supported listener base. To date, only subscribers of its music service could enjoy on-demand music. But now, anyone wanting to listen to particular songs, albums, or playlists they want but without paying for an upfront subscription, just need to watch a video ad first. Watching the ad unlocks a Pandora Premium listening session, so they can enjoy all the advantages.M&A/CollaborationsAmazon-Ningxia Partner in China: Amazon’s AWS has formed a strategic technology collaboration with Ningxia Western Cloud Data Technology Co Ltd (NWCD), which provides services from the AWS China Ningxia Region, in full compliance with Chinese regulations. Recent new regulations in China require foreign firms to store data locally and outsource hardware elements to local partners. That’s probably the reason AWS announced roughly a month ago that it would sell the hardware assets of its Beijing-registered cloud unit for up to 2 billion yuan ($302.06 million) to its partner Beijing Sinnet Technology Co Ltd. The partnership with NWCD followed.Alibaba to Invest in Indian Grocer: Alibaba is planning to invest $200 million in leading Indian grocer Big Basket. Alibaba is leading the funding round, which seeks to raise $280 million that values the company at $800 million. Following the investment, Alibaba will have a 25% stake in the company subject to approval by the Competition Commission of India. The company currently delivers 18,000 products from over 1,000 brands in more than two dozen Indian cities across the country. Dubai-based Abraaj Group and Sands Capital are existing investors.NVIDIA-Komatsu: Japan’s Komatsu, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of construction and mining equipment, will be adding NVIDIA artificial intelligence (AI) technology to increase safety and efficiency at construction sites. Komatsu has been rolling out its SMARTCONSTRUCTION program to build connected, smart worksites since 2015. Adding NVIDIA’s Jetson platform, which has been enhanced for industrial and commercial applications, will make these much better.   Some NumbersMoody’s Likes Apple, Microsoft: Moody’s has issued an outlook for the global diversified technology industry in 2018 according to which it expects Apple and Microsoft to have an outsized impact. It estimates that the two companies collectively account for about half of the operating profit for the 24 companies serving as a proxy for the diversified IT sector. Aggregate revenue for the group will grow 3.5-4.5% in 2018 and 2.5-3.5% excluding Apple and Microsoft.Similarly, Moody's forecasts operating profit growth of 6-7%, but 5.5%-6.5% when excluding the two companies. Smartphones and software will be strong drivers of growth. The movement to cloud-based systems, particularly the related equipment and software purchases and services will serve as a tailwind in 2018. Software-as-a-Service revenue now more than offset the declines in license revenues.Netflix Usage Hours: Netflix members around the world watched more than 140 million hours per day or a little more one billion hours per week in 2017. Mexico takes the top spot for having the most members to watch Netflix every-single-day. The average member watched around 60 movies on Netflix this year. The top shows were American Vandal, 3%, 13 Reasons Why, Anne with an E, Riverdale, Ingobernable, Travelers, The Keepers, The OA, The Confession Tapes.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

864,WDC,"At times, it is prudent to hold on to certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Flex Ltd. (FLEX  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors need to retain if they are looking to reap long-term benefits. Though the stock is facing a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.Shares of Flex have gained 26.5% year to date, significantly outperforming the 13.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors in Favor of FlexFlex had reported stellar fiscal second-quarter 2018 results, wherein both the top and bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues also increased year over year primarily owing to the company’s focus on Industrial & Emerging Industries (“IEI”) and High Reliability Solutions (“HRS”) segments which improved diversification.The company has a diverse end-market as well as customer base thanks to its “Sketch-to-Scale” approach. Moreover, based on its growing intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio (1,200 patents, 1,100 pending), the company is well positioned to address the needs of customers who are looking to leverage the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous/connected cars, artificial intelligence (“AI”), Industrial automation, augmented & virtual reality (AR/VR), and 5G technologies.Flex thrives on low-cost manufacturing. The low-cost manufacturing improves competitiveness of its customers, which is a key catalyst. At the end of fiscal 2017, almost 80% of its manufacturing footprint was located in low-cost locations, such as Brazil, China, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Romania and Ukraine. It is to be noted that the low-cost strategy along with “Sketch-to-Scale” approach in diversified end-markets has made Flex a ready-to-go partner for brands and companies like Fossil, Skullcandy, Nike, Savari, Caruma Technologies among others.Acquisitions, over time, have been Flex’s most favored mode for expanding manufacturing footprint as well as penetrating new end markets. In the last five years, the company acquired 17 companies, most of which expanded the capabilities of HRS and IEI businesses. Apart from these, the company has made several smaller acquisitions over time, which has expanded capabilities in the medical devices, consumer electronics, household industrial and lifestyle market. The recently acquired AGM Automotive further increases the company’s capabilities in the automotive market. Expanding automotive business driven by a plethora of acquisitions drove HRS revenues in fiscal 2017.The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 16.7%. Notably, the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 1.7%.Risks PersistThe company faces stiff competition from other EMS providers like Jabil Circuit, Benchmark Electronics, Celestica, Sanmina-SCI Corporation and Taiwan-based Original Design Manufacturing (ODM) suppliers like Foxconn. Intensifying competition negatively impacted contract wins, which hurt top-line growth. Moreover, continuing investments on “Sketch-to-Scale” portfolio transition is expected to increase operating expenses. This will eventually keep margins under pressure at least in the near term.Further, Flex’s balance sheet is highly leveraged, which adds to the risk of investing in the company.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Hence, we suggest that investors hold on to the stock for the time being.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NetApp, Inc (NTAP  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

865,WDC,"Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) has been on an acquisition spree lately. Post the company’s buyout of Upthere, an app-based cloud-storage startup, yesterday, this hard disk drive (HDD) producer is set for another strategic acquisition.Western Digital signed an agreement to acquire Tegile Systems (“Tegile”) for an undisclosed amount. The company will integrate Tegile into its Data Center Systems (DCS) business unit. The acquisition deal is anticipated to close in the week of Sep 4, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.California-based Tegile offers flash-driven storage arrays for database, virtualized server and virtual desktop environments. Tegile IntelliFlash storage arrays provide comprehensive data protection, with support for network attached storage (NAS) and storage area network (SAN) connectivity.Synergies from the DealThe acquisition is believed to be in sync with the company’s strategy to push itself further in to the enterprise cloud-based storage space. Apart from, expanding the flash- based product portfolio, the acquisition will fetch over 1,700 new customers to Western Digital.The company’s efforts toward expanding footprint in the flash storage are commendable as its development of the 96-layer 3-D NAND flash technology debuted in June. Consequently, this deal will strengthen its foothold in this space and should prove valuable.Notably, this deal comes at the time when the storage reportedly on the verge of acquiring Toshiba’s flash memory chip business. The common link in the aforementioned acquisitions is that all these companies provide cloud based flash-driven storage solutions which are growing rapidly.The demand for flash-storage has increased immensely in recent times due to exploding volumes of data. The need for storing this data as well as fast access is significant for Big Data and business analytics applications. According to market research firm IDC, revenues from these applications are expected to grow from $122 million in 2015 to over $187 million in 2019 (up more than 50%).Hence, the rising demand for flash storage bodes well for Western Digital, which is taking the inorganic route to bolster flash storage offerings.Moreover, per Research and Markets projections, worldwide data center storage market will expand at a four-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.01% during 2016-2020. Thus, the acquisition is a prudent move as it will help Western Digital strengthen its storage portfolio and increase market share.Acquisitions: Key Catalyst for Western DigitalOver the years, Western Digital has focused on acquisitions to expand total addressable market (TAM) and solidify footprint in growth markets. The acquisition of SanDisk has opened new avenues of growth for the company, particularly in the NAND and SSD markets.The acquisitions of Amplidata, sTec, Velobit, Inc., Arkeia Software Solutions and Virident Systems have not only reinforced Western Digital’s small-to-medium sized business solutions but also expanded its SSD product portfolio.Bottom lineWestern Digital stock has gained 32.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 12.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.We believe that the acquisition strengthens Western Digital’s position in the storage market, especially compared to peers Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report).We believe that the shift toward non-PC applications, secular growth of digital data and increasing exposure to the small and medium business space are the long-term positives for Western Digital. The company’s growing footprint in the automotive as well as the connected home and industrial categories is a significant positive, in our view.We remain encouraged by the company’s launch of a string of storage devices under the mobile and cloud segment. Further, Western Digital’s entry into the wireless devices market comes at a time when storage services related to smartphones and tablets are witnessing large-scale adoption. These factors are anticipated to be growth catalysts, going forward.Zacks Rank & Key PicksWestern Digital currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report). Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA and Applied Optoelectronics has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 10.3% and 17.5%, respectively.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without.

866,WDC,"Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of the assets of Upthere, an app-based cloud-storage startup. The company will integrate Upthere into its Client Solutions business unit. However, financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.Moreover, acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chris Bourdon, will join the Western Digital team as a strategic leader. The company also announced that Barbara Nelson, an executive who joined recently, will lead Western Digital’s cloud services business.Upthere’s Storage Approach: It’s DifferentRedwood City, CA-based Upthere offers cloud storage services which is almost similar to other well-known providers like Dropbox, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) iCloud, Box (BOX  -  Free Report) and Google Drive. The app is available on most platforms including iPhone, iPad and Android devices, as well as Mac operating system (OS) and Windows PCs.Upthere’s “streaming” approach is different as compared to its cloud-storage peers. Per TechCrunch , the service bypasses (almost) local storage and directly “writes”/”reads” into the cloud, which updates documents, files and music on a real-time basis. This feature also makes the app significantly faster during uploading/downloading files.However, Upthere doesn’t sync with a users local file system. So, a user cannot see through Finder or Windows explorer.The acquisition will definitely boost Western Digital’s footprint in the cloud-storage market, which is projected to grow from $23.76 billion in 2016 to $74.94 billion by 2021. However, we believe that the consumer cloud-storage market is already quite oversaturated. Hence, room for further growth may not be significant in our view. Western Digital Corporation Price and Consensus  Western Digital Corporation Price and Consensus | Western Digital Corporation QuoteAcquisitions: Key Catalyst for Western DigitalOver the years, Western Digital has focused on acquisitions to expand total addressable market (TAM) and solidify footprint in growth markets.

867,WDC,"Share price of Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report) dropped to a new 52-week low of $30.60 yesterday, eventually closing a tad bit higher at $31.01.The underperformance can be attributed to the company’s disappointing fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Non-GAAP earnings plunged 41% on a sequential basis, primarily due to a 10% decline in revenues. Revenues amounted to $2.41 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.55 billion.We note that this pulled down current year earnings estimates over the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 declined 18.04% to $3.86 over the last 30 days. For fiscal 2019, the consensus estimate declined 11.9% to $4.07.Seagate has lost 16.4% of its value year to date against 11.6% growth of its industry.What’s Dragging it Down?The decline in the top line was primarily due to sluggish revenues from enterprise storage customers. This includes traditional OEM nearline and mission critical demand, China CSP nearline demand, and the company’s own Cloud Storage Systems business.Moreover, certain intra quarter channel inventory management issues affected the surveillance and NAS markets. Revenues fell 5% short from expectations and management attributed this to the above mentioned factors.Seagate Technology PLC Revenue (TTM) Seagate Technology PLC Revenue (TTM) | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteAdditionally, due to operational issues in the Cloud Systems and Silicon Group (CSSG) division and unfavorable enterprise and surveillance HDD portfolio mix, margins were under pressure. Management also noted that the company is not heading toward achieving the previous guidance of non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.50 for 2017.We believe, all these coupled with intensifying competition in the market post the merger of Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) and SanDisk are headwinds for the company. Further, declining demand in the PC market as evident from Gartner and IDC’s recently released worldwide PC shipments data is a major concern for Seagate.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSeagate has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Applied Materials, Inc.

The mid-point ($3.30 per share) is significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.78.For fiscal 2018, Western Digital forecasts non-GAAP earnings to be excess of $12.00. The company reported non-GAAP earnings of $9.19 in fiscal 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $10.45 per share.Our TakeWe believe that the shift toward non-PC applications, secular growth of digital data and increasing exposure to the small and medium business space are the long-term positives for Western Digital. The company’s growing footprint in the automotive as well as the connected home and industrial categories is a significant positive, in our view.Western Digital will benefit from favorable NAND industry conditions that management believes will persist at least through the first half of calendar 2018. This will also help in gross margin expansion.We remain encouraged by the company’s launch of a string of storage devices under the mobile and cloud segment. Continued investments in product innovation could result in flat margins in the near term.Further, Western Digital’s entry into the wireless devices market comes at a time when storage services related to smartphones and tablets are witnessing large-scale adoption. These factors are anticipated to be growth catalysts, going forward.Moreover, the SanDisk acquisition not only expands Western Digital’s offerings in the SSD segment, but also provides a competitive edge against peers such as Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report).Zacks Rank & Key PicksWestern Digital currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Infineon (IFNNY  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report). Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Infineon is expected to report earnings on Aug 1, while Applied Optoelectronics is set to report on Aug 3.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

869,WDC,"Shares of Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $47.64 on Dec 20, closing marginally lower at $47.56. The company has gained 38.4% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 33%. The stock has a market cap of $202.46 billion. What’s Behind the Rally?Intel is the global leader in the microprocessors market in terms of market share and product performance. The company not only focuses on selling separate components but also on optimizing platform for specific markets, including mobile, enterprise and digital home.The company recently announced Intel Stratix, the industry’s first field programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated with high bandwidth memory to accelerate workloads and keep pace with data explosion.The newly added product will expand the onboard memory pool and add more bandwidth. We believe that the launch will improve scalability, reliability, power and density requirements of future HPC deployments.Intel also announced substantial advances in its wireless product portfolio to accelerate 5G adoptions, alongside introducing Intel XMM 8000 series and Intel XMM 7660 series modems. The launch of Xeon Scalable, Core 8 chips, Myriad X and next-generation desktop processors are also key catalysts for thecompany.The new desktop processors are expected to help Intel's gaming endeavors amid stiff competition from AMD and NVIDIA. Moreover, the launch of Core 8 is expected to boost PC market share.Partnerships and AcquisitionsIntel has also been active on the acquisitions front. Its acquisition of Israel-based Mobileye, an autonomous vehicle technology provider, has enabled it to enter the autonomous car technology market currently dominated by NVIDIA and Qualcomm. The company’s continued investment in Internet of Things (IoT) and non-volatile memory storage, primarily targeting enterprise/data center customers, are also aiding the stock’s momentum.Additionally, the company also partnered with Micron to develop memory technologies. This led to the production of the densest 3D NAND technology. Intel also launched Optane, its non-volatile storage (NVM) product based on 3D XPoint technology this year.EarningsIntel reported third-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings of $1.01 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21 cents. The figure surged 26.3% from the year-ago quarter and 40.3% sequentially.The strong earnings growth was driven by better-than-expected top-line performance and operating margin expansion. Moreover, Intel Channel Alliance Program (ICAP) contributed 13 cents to quarterly earnings.Revenues totaled$16.15 billion, up 2.4% year over year and 9.4% quarter over quarter. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.71 billion. After adjusting for the McAfee (formerly Intel Security Group) transaction, revenues grew 6%.Intel Corporation Revenue (TTM) Intel Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Intel Corporation QuoteTo ConcludeIts diversified product segments form the base of Intel’s data-centric business model.We believe that growing demand for server chips that are used in data centers from cloud-based service providers like Amazon.com, Alphabet and Microsoft is a key catalyst for Intel.Moreover, from a valuation perspective, the stock looks very attractive as it currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate. This signifies huge upward potential. Intel currently trades at a forward P/E of 14.47x as against the industry group average of 23.30x.Intel has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 9.75%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksIntel sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some of the top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NetApp, Inc (NTAP  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corp.

870,WDC,"Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) reported fiscal second-quarter 2018 results wherein the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the bottom line came in line with the same. However, the company registered year-over-year improvement on both the counts.Non-GAAP earnings per share of 59 cents increased 5% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, the stock has returned 10.6% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming 7% growth recorded by the industry.Quarter DetailsPaychex reported total revenues (including interest on funds held for clients) of $826.5 million, up 7% year over year. Excluding interest on funds held for its clients, total services revenues (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) were up 7% year over year to $812.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $823 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 1% from the year-ago period to $444.8 million, primarily on the back of higher revenues per check, which benefited from price increases and net of discounts. However, revenues were negatively impacted by a change in client base mix.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 15% year over year to $367.7 million, chiefly driven by strong growth in client base across the prominent human capital management (HCM) services.Interest on funds held for clients increased 23% on a year-over-year basis to $14 million, mainly benefiting from higher average interest rates earned.Paychex’s total expenses rose 7% from the year-ago quarter to $494.3 million due to increased investments in technology and combined PEO business. Acquisition of HROI accounted for 5% of the total increase in expenses. Total expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 20 basis points (bps) to 59.8%.Operating income grew 7% year over year to $332.2 million. However, Paychex’s operating margin decreased 10 bps to 40.2%.Adjusted net income surged 8% year over year to $437.2 million.Paychex, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Paychex, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Paychex, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowPaychex exited the fiscal second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $338.6 million compared with $323.4 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt. For the first half of fiscal 2018, the company generated operating cash flow of $519.4 million.During the first two quarters, Paychex repurchased 1.6 million shares for $94.1 million. GuidanceThe guidance for fiscal 2018 provided at the end of the first quarter remains unaltered.Total revenues are expected to grow around 6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $3.35 billion.Payroll Services Revenues are anticipated surge between 1% and 2%.Human Resource Services revenues are projected to grow in the range of 12-14%.Operating margin is anticipated to be between 39% and 40%. Effective income tax rate, excluding any potential impact from tax reform legislation, is projected to be 35.0% to 35.5%.Interest on funds held for clients and investment income is expected to grow in the mid-to-upper-teen range.Net income is still likely to advance 5% year over year on a GAAP basis and 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be up in the range of 7-8%, which comes to $2.35-$2.38. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.37.Our TakeThe company’s top-line is benefiting from acquisitions. In the second quarter fiscal 2018, HROI which was acquired in August 2017, added 3% to total service revenue growth.However, the company is facing issues in retaining its customer base for the last few quarters, which is a major concern. Due to a challenging demand environment and modest decline in retention, the company’s payroll client base remained flat in the previous quarter. Additionally, political uncertainty, which in turn impacted outsourcing decision making in the mid-market, affected the company’s client base.Furthermore, increasing competition from industry peers like Automatic Data Processing, Insperity, Intuit, H&R Block, Broadridge Financial Solutions and DST System is another key concern.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report), Axcelis Technologies Inc. (ACLS  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

871,WDC,"For people who are approaching their retirement, investing can be bit of a challenge.Yes, we are talking about baby boomers, the generation born between 1946 and 1964 per the U.S. Census Bureau. This generation is one of the largest in the history of the United States, currently estimated to be 74.1 million in number and accounting for approximately 23% of the country’s population. The oldest members are now 72 years old, while the youngest are just about to turn 54.The first baby boomer officially retired in late 2007 and since then, the number has increased to millions over the past decade, as increasing number of baby boomers continue to reach their retirement age. Over the next 15-20 years, the majority of them will have left the workforce.But are they financially strong enough to maintain their lifestyle and meet healthcare costs post retirement?We Don’t Think SoPer Pew Charitable Trusts’ latest report, only 13% of working baby boomers are currently covered under pension schemes. This means the majority of retirees will need to plan their retirement on their own, making it the most challenging factor for the boomers.Furthermore, this generation is notably believed to be the most active and wealthiest group of their era. Also, baby boomers were the biggest beneficiary of the 1982-2000 secular bull market, which gave them the opportunity to make plenty of money through aggressive investment in stock markets.Despite this, the generation has not saved enough assets due to the boomers’ excessive spending habits and luxurious lifestyle, according to a Paladin Registry report. The report states that about 60% of baby boomers have inadequate assets for post retirement survival.Additionally, the generation is expected to have a longer life span — thanks to the advanced medical science and healthier lifestyles — which again means they need more funds for longer periods. Escalating healthcare costs is another challenge, which boomers have to face with increasing age.Therefore, as the majority of baby boomers are still working, they need to plan their investments to maintain their living standards post retirement.Things to Keep in MindIn our opinion, if one has enough assets to maintain existing lifestyle and meet necessary healthcare expenses, it will be wise to play safe and invest in less risky portfolio. However, the majority of this generation does not have this liberty due to lack of adequate savings.Therefore, they need to invest in assets, which can generate solid regular returns with minimum associated risks. Also, the return should cover the investment and inflation costs.Obviously, baby boomers will never get that return by investing in bonds. So, which investment plan has the potential to generate regular returns and provide them the opportunity to accumulate assets for the future as well?Investment in Blue Chip Dividend Stocks is the Best ChoiceBlue chip dividend stocks boast solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals, and are unperturbed by market turbulence. Such stocks are believed to be safer and more durable than an average stock. Most of these companies consistently raise dividends and are typically large in size as well.The companies’ dominating market position, large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity help them offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis, irrespective of the market direction. As a result, these stocks provide greater stability and offer continued income for investors, as well as more scope for capital appreciation.Our PicksWe have, thus, selected four blue chip dividend stocks for baby boomers that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), and have a dividend yield of more than 2%. The search was also narrowed down with a VGM score of A or B. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. All these four stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 index over the past decade.The first stock is one of the world’s leading semiconductor companies, KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLAC  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank of 1, has a VGM Score of B and a dividend yield of 2.2%.Our next pick is also from the tech sector — Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report). The company sports a Zacks Rank of 1, has a VGM Score of  A and a dividend yield of 2.3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Another stock is Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report), which designs, manufactures, distributes, and services diesel and natural gas engines, and engine-related component products worldwide. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. Its dividend yield is 2.2%.Our fourth selection is the home improvement retailer — Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report). The stock has a Zacks Rank of 2 and a VGM Score of A. Its dividend yield is 2.2%.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

872,WDC,"Technology licensing company Rambus Inc. (RMBS  -  Free Report) recently announced plans of offering $150 million of convertible unsecured senior notes to enhance liquidity.The interest rate, conversion rate and certain other terms of the notes are yet to be determined.Rambus has outperformed the industry it belongs to in the last six months. The company’s shares have rallied 17.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 10.9%.More Into the HeadlinesThe notes will be offered to qualified institutional buyers only and in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The company will also give the initial purchasers of the notes an option to buy up to an additional $22.5 million aggregate principal amount of the notes to cover any over-allotment. This option will be exercisable for 13 days.Interest on the notes will be paid semi-annually and will mature in 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.In connection with the pricing of the notes, Rambus expects to enter into more convertible note hedge transactions with the initial purchasers or their affiliates, if required.The company also expects to use certain portion of the proceeds to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions. The remaining net proceeds will be used to repurchase 1.125% senior convertible notes of up to $60 million in aggregate principal amount (due 2018), working capital and general corporate purposes.Rambus’ Cash PositionThe enhanced capital deployment reflects Rambus’s strong balance sheet and its confidence in long-term business prospects. The company exited third-quarter fiscal 2017 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $183.6 million compared with $167.9 million in the previous quarter.We believe that the company has a strong balance sheet, which will help it in capitalizing on investment opportunities and pursuing strategic acquisitions, further improving its growth prospects. Moreover, the senior notes offering will lower the company’s cost of capital, thus strengthening its balance sheet and supporting growth.Bottom LineRambus has signed a patent licensing agreement with hard disk drive manufacturer, Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report), for an undisclosed sum. We believe this association will support Rambus’ fundamentals in the upcoming quarters.Additionally, licensing agreements, the result of successful monetization of the company’s patents, remains a recurring source of revenues.Going forward, Rambus recently inked a deal with eftpos, an Australian domestic debit network, to help users in Australia secure transactions with Apple.Furthermore, the company has acquired certain serial link assets of Semtech Corporation’s Snowbush IP and Smart Card Software. These deals and acquisitions are likely to boost the company’s top and bottom-line performance. Further, it will enhance its product offerings.Zacks Ranks & Other Key PicksCurrently, Rambus has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology include NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

873,WDC,"Reportedly, Japan-based video game developer Nintendo Co. (NTDOY  -  Free Report)) targets to sell around 25-30 million units of Switch Console next year.For fiscal 2017 ending March 2018, the company had set a sales target of 10 million for Switch, which it later increased to 14 million and subsequently to more than 16 million.The continuous increase in the target reflects the growing adoption of the gaming console.We note that Nintendo has massively outperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. While the stock has returned 86.6%, the industry gained 45.8%.Strong Demand Drives GrowthPer Nintendo, as of Sep 30, 2017, 7.63 million units of Nintendo Switch (launched in March) were sold globally. Apart from Japan, the console is doing really well in the United States and Europe.Moreover, Nintendo Switch has also fared better than the company’s Wii U gaming console, which took nearly a year to sell 5 million units.Geographically, the company has sold nearly 41% of Switch consoles to date in the United States and 26% in Japan.Management noted that the demand for the console in the United States was primarily from male consumers in the age group of 20 to early 30s. The device also garners the interest of 10-19 year olds.Nintendo’s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the top-selling game on the Switch platform, having sold around 4.7 million units to date. It is the most sought-after game in the  United States and Europe.In Japan, Nintendo Switch outperformed Sony’s (SNE  -  Free Report) PS4. In the first 26 weeks, the company sold 1.5 million units of Nintendo Switch in the country, which is more than double the number of PS4 units sold over the same time frame following its launch in 2013. Reportedly, it took PS4 69 weeks to reach the figure which Nintendo Switch achieved in 26 weeks.The company’s Splatoon 2 game is noted to be the “most impressive performer” in Japan. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, launched in April, enjoys high demand globally.The company also has a strong pipeline of new launches on the Switch platform ahead of the upcoming holiday season. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is up for a sequel this winter. Snipperclips - Cut It Out, Together! is also set for a new version.Moreover, continuous free updates of ARMS and Splatoon 2 are also expected to keep the interests of the fans alive.Additionally, the company’s collaboration with Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) in September to create Nintendo Switch-licensed microSDXC SanDisk memory cards with capacity of 64 GB and 128 GB is a positive. It will enable users to enjoy the full gaming experience for certain games that require additional storage due to their large file formats.Market research firm, Newzoo expects consoles to be the second largest revenue generator after mobile gaming with $33.5 billion in 2017. We believe Nintendo is well-poised to cash in on the growing market.However, competition from Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) much-awaited gaming console Xbox One X launched on Nov 7, and PS4 remain concerns.Nintendo Co.

875,WDC,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Western Digital has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.7. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Western Digital’s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint (which is 10.4) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 12.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Western Digital has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 6.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Western Digital’s stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Western Digital has a P/S ratio of about 1.4. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Western Digital currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes WDC a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 5.4, which is noticeably better than the industry average of 11.3. Clearly, WDC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Western Digital might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of D. This gives WDC a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging.

876,WDC,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) reported fiscal first-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $3.56 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 26 cents. The figure also came ahead of the year-ago quarter figure of $1.54 and the guided range of $3.25–$3.35 per share.Revenues increased 9.9% year over year to $5.18 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.11 billion. The figure was also better than guided.The year-over-year growth was primarily attributed to growing demand in the company’s end markets. Management was particularly positive about the company’s flash-based storage segment and joint venture fab operations in Yokkaichi. The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is another tailwind for Western Digital.Shares of Western Digital have gained 31.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 17.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. Segment Revenue DetailsClient Devices soared 13% year over year to $2.7 billion. Accelerated demand for client solid state drives (SSD) and embedded flash products was beneficial for the segment.The company began the ramp up of 64-layer based client SSDs for original equipment manufacturers (OEM) during the quarter. The expansion of the product suite increased the adoption of client SSDs in OEM offerings.Client Solution also surged 16% to $1.1 billion, owing to robust performance of hard disk drive (HDD) and flash-based products. The product launches during the quarter such as iXpand Base and My Cloud Home and a microSD card of 400 gigabytes with the highest capacity to date were the major drivers. These have enhanced the company’s global retail brand value further.Data Center Services and Solutions revenues were $1.4 billion, almost flat on a year-over-year basis. Management noted that the accumulated growth of enterprise SSDs and capacity enterprise hard drives was negated by declining performance enterprise hard drives.In the capacity enterprise segment, shortage of DRAM supply still remains a concern, resulting in slow petabyte growth during the year. The company expects its 12-terabyte offering to be capable of managing varied workloads as DRAM market tightness reduces.Management noted that the acquisition of Tegile Systems, a provider of flash storage, is expected to enhance Western Digital’s product suite, thereby helping it to meet varied customer requirements. The company’s buyout of Upthere, an app-based cloud-storage startup will further enrich its solutions suite.Joint Venture DisputeNotably, management is positive about Western Digital’s flash memory joint venture with Toshiba, which is currently being taken care of by Sandisk, the company’s recently acquired subsidiary. Western Digital intends to seek a court injunction to prevent Toshiba from selling its ownership interests in the joint venture unit to SK Hynix-Bain consortium, without the consent of Sandisk.Management projects supply bit growth rate of 35% to 45% for calendar years 2018 and 2019, backed by its joint venture partnerships, which are legally compelled to provide it with NAND supply till 2029.Operating DetailsNon GAAP gross margin increased to 42.3% from 33.9% in the year-ago quarter, driven by a favorable supply-demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue, and strength in the capacity enterprise HDD product line-up.Non-GAAP operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 250 basis points (bps) to 15.8%.Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.5% compared with 15.6% in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet/Cash FlowWestern Digital ended the quarter with, cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities worth of $7 billion. Net debt decreased around $600 million to $6.3 billion during the quarter, mostly driven by strong cash flow generated from business.GuidanceFor second-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are expected to be within the range of $5.2–$5.3 billion.Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be a bit higher compared with the previous quarter. Total operating expenses are anticipated to be almost $830 million.Interest and other expense is anticipated to be around $205 million.Management expects non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $3.60–$3.70 per share. They also noted that the synergy targets from the acquisitions of HGST and SanDisk are on track.For fiscal 2018, Western Digital forecasts non-GAAP earnings per share to exceed $13.00.Notably, Western Digital expects to take microwave-assisted magnetic recording (MAMR) technology into production in 2019. The commercial availability of this technology will aid in the development of higher capacity drives and prove to be a key growth catalyst in the long run.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderWestern Digital has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (VSH  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

877,WDC,"Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 24. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.81%.The surprise history has been good in Lam’s case. The company surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.3%.The company’s shares have charted a solid trajectory in recent times, increasing 84% in the last year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 68.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLam Research has high exposure to the memory segment, which is likely to witness strong growth in the coming quarters. The strength is driven by cloud computing, big data, mobile devices and IoT.The company is doing well and expects to succeed in areas such as device architecture, process flow and advanced packaging technology inflections.The company also continues to witness increased adoption rates for 3D NAND technology, FinFETs and multi-patterning. The company has undertaken cost-reduction activities and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies. All these factors could positively impact the top-line figure of the company.For the upcoming quarter, the company expects revenues of approximately $2.55 billion (+/- $100 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.56 billion. Shipments are projected to be roughly $2.60 billion (+/- $100 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.61 billion.However, volatility in the PC market remains a major concern. The weakness in the PCs could offset the expansion in the 3D NAND, impacting the upcoming results.Also, the company faces significant competition in all its product and service categories in the semiconductor capital equipment market.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lam Research is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:The Most Accurate estimate stands at $3.66 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $3.67. Hence, the difference is -0.27%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Also,Lamhas a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a -0.27% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Lam Research Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lam Research Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lam Research Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderYou could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank:Applied Materials, Inc.

878,WDC,"Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) recently unveiled the Intel Stratix 10MX FPGA, the industry’s first field programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated with High Bandwidth Memory DRAM (HBM2) for high performance computing (HPC) systems. This will provide users up to 10 times more memory bandwidth compared to stand alone DDR memory solutions.The combination of HBM2 and FPGAs caters to high bandwidth memory interface required for next generation training in deep learning, HPC and routing applications. Intel Stratix 10 MX FPGA provides a memory bandwidth of 512 gigabytes per second for HPC systems and is based on 14-nm technology.The company’s HBM2-based FPGAs are able to compress and accelerate larger data movements compared to stand alone FPGAs. Additionally, the integration of HPDA with FPGA will boost real-time data acceleration in streaming data pipeline frameworks like Apache Kafka and Apache Spark.The company expects the new chip to expand both the onboard memory pool and add more bandwidth, thereby increasing the interconnect performance between the CPU and the associated MIC (Many Integrated Cores). We believe that the launch will improve the scalability, reliability, power and density requirements of future HPC deployments.According to ReynetteAu, vice president of marketing, Intel Programmable Solutions Group, “We designed the Intel Stratix 10 MX family to provide a new class of FPGA-based multi-function data accelerators for HPC and HPDA markets.”To ConcludeWe note that Intel has outperformed the industry over the last six months. While the company’s shares returned 32.7%, the industry gained 31.1%.Intel is riding high on robust performance from the data-centric portion of its business. Data Center Group, Internet-of-Things Group, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions and Programmable Solutions Group form the crux of the company’s data-centric business model.We believe that growing demand for server chips that are used in the data centers from the cloud-based service providers like Amazon.com, Alphabet and Microsoft is a key catalyst for Intel.However, intense competition from Advanced Micro Devices is a concern.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderIntel sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report).

879,WDC,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fiscal first-quarter 2018 results on Oct 26. Notably, the company has a decent record of earnings surprises with an average positive surprise of 9.55% in the trailing four quarters. Last quarter, the company came up with a positive surprise of 3.53%.In fiscal fourth-quarter 2017, the company reported non GAAP earnings of $2.93 per share compared with $1.03 reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues increased 38.5% year over year to $4.84 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.80 billion. Both the top and bottom line figures were better than the guided range.Let’s take a look at the factors that are expected to influence the first-quarter 2018 earnings.Key Growth DriversWe believe Western Digital will benefit from positive synergies derived from the SanDisk acquisition. The latter’s product portfolio is aiding the company’s expansion in the solid state drive (SSD) market. This is also anticipated to provide Western Digital with a competitive advantage against peers like Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report).Further, the continuous enhancement of the company’s product suite is a positive. The development of the industry’s first 3D NAND technology with 96 layers of storage capability in June was significant. The company’s growing footprint in the automotive as well as the connected home and industrial categories is a major tailwind.Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Western Digital Corporation QuoteNotably, the company completed the acquisition of Upthere, an app-based cloud-storage startup during the quarter. The company also entered into a definitive agreement to buy Tegile Systems, a provider of flash-driven storage arrays for database. We believe these acquisitions will help the company in expanding its presence with a wider range of products and solutions.However, the ongoing legal tussle with Toshiba regarding the memory unit in Japan remains a concern. Nevertheless, strong demand for NAND flash memory chips is anticipated to be a key catalyst.Guidance & EstimatesFor fiscal first-quarter 2018, revenues are expected to be approximately $5.10 billion, which is slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.12 billion.Management expects non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $3.25–$3.35 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.30 per share is in line with the mid-point of the guided range.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, non-computable unit shipments are anticipated to amount to $16.7 million, while the computable unit shipments are projected to total $19 million.Zacks Rank and Key PicksWestern Digital currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

880,WDC,"Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 23.Last quarter, the company delivered negative earnings surprise of 34.3%. However, we note that Seagate has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three out of trailing four quarters.We believe that worldwide weak PC shipment will hurt earnings in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, intense competition from Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and lack of significant presence in the flash market are other concerns.However, improving ramp of nearline drives, renewal of existing partnership with Baidu Inc (BIDU  -  Free Report) and stringent cost control are likely to offset the negative trends.Seagate’s stock has declined 10% year to date, substantially underperforming the 15% rally of the industry.Weak PC Shipment Major ConcernWeak PC shipment in the third quarter as evident from Gartner and IDC’s recently released data is a major concern for Seagate. Both agreed that shortage of key components, including DRAM, SSD and LCD panels, is escalating PC prices, thereby thwarting overall demand.Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteSeagate is a hard disk drive (HDD) manufacturer and is primarily dependent on PC sales.We note that a decline in PC shipment reflects weak demand, which doesn't bode well for the company.In the last quarter, total HDD shipment was 62.2 exabytes (EB). More importantly, HDD enterprise revenues represented 37% of total revenue.We believe that improving ramp of its 10 terabyte (TB) helium (nearline) drives is a positive. Seagate expects to ship approximately 1 million 10 TB units in the current quarter. Moreover, management has noted that the 12 TB product (shipped in June) has received excellent customer feedback.Losing HDD market Share Dents ConfidenceSeagate has been losing HDD market share amid significant competition from Western Digital Corporation. Despite a number of acquisitions, the company has no significant presence in the flash memory market.These factors have hurt Seagate’s top-line growth, which declined 9.3% in the previous quarter. Management anticipates revenues in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $2.53 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 9.5%.Negative Earnings ESPWe believe Seagate is unlikely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the first quarter due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of -6.43%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 to beat estimates.We also don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere is a stock you may consider as our proven model shows it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.06% and boasts a Zacks Rank #1.

Product development, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 10 bps, which was fully offset by a 60-bps increase in marketing and administrative expenses sequentially.Seagate exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.54 billion, as compared with $3.02 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $5.02 billion, as compared with $5.07 billion in the preceeding quarter.Zacks Rank & Key PicksWe believe that declining PC shipment – per latest data from Gartner and IDC – doesn’t bode well for Seagate.

884,WDC,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fiscal fourth-quarter  2017 results on Jul 27.The company is unlikely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of +1.99%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.This is because, per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates.We also don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderBetter-than-expected demand for storage products led Western Digital to revise its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 outlook. While the company maintained its revenue guidance of around $4.8 billion, the non-GAAP earnings per share forecast was raised from the range of $2.55–$2.65 to $2.85.Notably, the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the top and the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, revenues increased on a year-over-year basis. The company delivered positive earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 13.5%. The revised fourth-quarter guidance also boosted investors’ confidence.We note that the company has outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 12.1%, the stock returned 41.1% over the same time frame.We believe Western Digital’s strong presence in the flash memory market has been a positive for the company for a while now. Additionally, its product portfolio is being enhanced regularly with the first portable solid state drive (SSD) unveiled in April. It also increased the capacity of its surveillance-class hard drives to 10 TB.Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Western Digital Corporation QuoteMoreover, it also introduced the world’s first Client SSD with 64-Layer 3D NAND technology in May and development of the industry’s first 3D NAND technology 96 layers of storage capability in June. Additionally the SanDisk acquisition has expanded Western Digital’s offerings in the SSD segment and also provided a competitive edge against peers such as Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report).However, the ongoing tussle with Toshiba regarding the flash memory chip joint-venture in Japan is a growing concern.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our proven model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.

885,WDC,"Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 25.The company is unlikely to post a positive earnings surprise due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -2.02%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.This is because, per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 to beat estimates.We also don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Increasing Competition Hurts GrowthYear to date, Seagate has underperformed the S&P 500 Index. The stock has returned 3.3% as compared with the Index’s gain of 10.7%.The dismal performance can be attributed to intensifying competition in the market post the merger of Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) and SanDisk. Western Digital recently revised fourth-quarter estimates upwards driven by better-than-expected demand for its storage products (flash-based storage devices). This also doesn’t bode well for Seagate’s to-be-reported quarter results.Moreover, shift in demand from PCs to inexpensive mobile devices is hurting growth of Seagate, which is primarily a hard disk drive (HDD) manufacturer.Further, declining demand in the PC market as evident from Gartner and IDC’s recently released worldwide PC shipments data is a major concern for Seagate. Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteAdditionally, we also believe that Seagate’s significant investments in HAMR technology, 10 and 12 terabyte Helium HDD and fourth generation SMR technology will take some more time to translate into credible top-line growth.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our proven model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.

886,WDC,"Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 21. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.33%. Also, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.22%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Influencing FactorsPaychex is a provider of payroll and integrated human resource, and employee benefits outsourcing solutions. It caters to the small- to medium-sized businesses (SMB) in the United States and is expected to continue benefiting from its strong domain expertise, going ahead.In fact, Paychex’s investments in product development, technology and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth are impressive. Also, product launches and joint venture initiatives in a less-than-half-penetrated market are encouraging.Meanwhile, the company’s top-line continues to be boosted by its inorganic growth strategies. In this context, Paychex’s acquisition of HROI in August is worth mentioning. This is because this buyout is expected to drive this payroll and human resource solutions provider’s clientele and revenues.However, the company is facing issues in retaining its customer base for the last few quarters, which is a major concern. Due to a challenging demand environment and modest decline in retention, the company’s payroll client base remained flat in the previous quarter. Additionally, political uncertainty, which in turn impacted outsourcing-decision making in the mid-market affected the company’s client base.Furthermore, increasing competition from industry peers like Automatic Data Processing, Insperity, Intuit, H&R Block, Broadridge Financial Solutions and DST System is another key concern.Paychex, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Paychex, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Paychex, Inc. QuoteWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively show that Paychex is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.

887,WDC,"In the Global Week Ahead, it’s all about monetary policy.But this huge talking wave is NOT likely to wash ashore and be market-moving.Nearly all of what is about to happen has already been communicated. And well.Wednesday, the Fed becomes the leader. Here comes that 25 basis point hike.After that fait accompli, four western European central banks surf into global risk markets. They issue policy decisions starting Thursday. Expect none to alter their stances or offer meaningful market effects.Another four Latin American central banks get on their boards after the Fed — to offer their latest decisions for that region. Maybe Mexico gets interesting. But it is not likely.The FOMC meeting on Tuesday into Wednesday culminates in the policy statement at 2 pm ET, along with the Summary of Economic Projections.That summary includes the revised ‘dot plot’ of future rate projections.Any comment on weak U.S. Consumer Price Inflation (the CPI) will be closely watched, to see if there is any change to sentiment.I see penciled in 3 rate hikes for 2018, but 2 is another likely call.This will be Chair Yellen’s last press conference at the helm.  A 25 basis point hike in the Fed Funds rate, from 1.25% to 1.5% is in the cards from the meeting itself.The first order of business is to congratulate Chair Yellen. I agree with covering analyst sentiment. She deserved a second term after a fine performance and can go out with her head held high regarding the leadership she has provided.While she will be back to chair the January 31st 2018 meeting, that will be a statement only event, making this December meeting her last command performance.The Bank of England (BoE) is nearly universally expected by traders to leave policy unchanged at 0.5%.Governor Carney has already guided. A pair of rate hikes through to 2020 may be about the limit to this tightening cycle.His exact quote about a month ago was: “We’ll see how the economy evolves. If it evolves broadly in line with our projections we would probably raise interest rates a couple of times over the next few years.”Tuesday’s U.K. CPI report may further inform BoE policy risks. The expectation is for inflation to be topping out at about 3% and thereby averting the over-3 data that triggers the hand wringing by central bankers the world over.The European Central Bank (ECB) head Mario Draghi is also expected to jawbone while keeping his various ECB policy measures intact.Europe’s central bank is unlikely to be terribly exciting to watch for some time. It has already moved for extending bond purchases through to next September 2018 at a diminished pace — while guiding that rate hikes would follow much later.The ECB is likely to reduce its bond market portfolio reinvestment well after that — if it follows the Fed’s path of reinvesting.All of this will happen — until the ECB rate normalization process is well underway, in just a few years time.In other words, be patient.This global rate ‘normalization’ thing is going to take awhile.Top Zacks #1 Rank Stocks—For active stocks, I am watching info tech plays and mining closely.DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report): This is a $27 billion market-cap stock.

888,WDC,"Rambus Inc. (RMBS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 23.We believe licensing agreements, acquisition synergies, strategic deals and restructuring initiatives arelikelytodrive the company’s overall third-quarter results.Last quarter, the company's adjusted earnings of 14 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The company has an excellent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 6.9% in the trailing four quarters.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 17 cents, which is above the year-ago period figure of 16 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained nearly stable inthe past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $99 million, up 10% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsRambus hassigned a patent licensing agreement with Taiwan-based company Winbond Electronics Corporation and hard disk drive (HDD) manufacturer, Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) for an undisclosed sum.Per the terms of the agreement, both the companies can use Rambus’ patented technology for five years. Rambus will receive royalty payments during the contract period. We believe this association will support Rambus’ fundamentals in the upcoming quarters.Additionally, licensing agreements, the result of successful monetization of the company’s patents, remains a recurring source of revenue.Going forward,Rambus recently inked a deal with eftpos, the Australian domestic debit network, to help users in Australia to secure transactions with Apple.Furthermore, the companyhas acquired certain serial link assets of Semtech Corporation’s Snowbush IP and Smart Card Software. These deals and acquisitions will boost the company’s top and bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter, in our view. Further, it will enhance its product offerings.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted if Rambus will be able to beat earnings estimates in the third quarter. This is because it does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Rambus is 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 17 cents.Zacks Rank: Rambus carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Hence, the combination of Rambus's Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Rambus, Inc.

QuoteStocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.06% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

889,WDC,"The big event last week was Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) product launch event, which was accompanied by fresh news about Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) problems with Russian ads, the EU going after member countries for tax overdues, and more. Here are the top stories:Google Introduces Pixel 2 Google’s Pixel 2 wasn’t a big surprise because most of the details were leaked earlier. To recap, it comes in two sizes, with aluminum bodies and Google follows Apple in a move to remove the headphone jack. The base model is priced at $649 for starters, while the high-end version starts at $849. The phones reportedly start selling on Oct. 19.The new Pixel Bud earphones won’t launch until November. At $149, they aren’t cheap. But they do include a feature that allows real time translation in up to 40 languages, which sets them apart from Apple’s Airpods. Plus they have three kinds of buttons that allow you to turn the volume up or down, switch songs and activate Google Assistant.  There’s also a $249 camera called Clips, which facilitates object detection and automatic recording. The soundless videos last only a few seconds.Next up is a brand new Pixelbook laptop with a keyboard that folds all the way back to turn the 12.3-inch touchscreen into a tablet. It will feature Google Assistant and support Snap’s Snapchat. The device will be in stores on Oct 31.Google also announced a couple of new smart home speakers. The first, called Google Home Mini, is a $49 device pitted against Amazon’s Echo Dot. It will be available on Oct. 19. The second is called Home Max, perhaps because it offers decibels more suitable for parties. The device comes for $399 and should ship by year end.Google is bringing AI to its product range through Assistant. The company is new to the hardware space so has inconsequential market share, but with strengthening prospects in the classroom and at enterprises, a hardware push at this time makes sense on multiple levels. Google also needs to feed the effort if it is to compete effectively with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) in this area.Facebook’s Russia ChapterFacebook has faced some flak after the company announced that there were around 3,000 politically divisive ads on its social media platform by Russian agencies with the apparent purpose of meddling in U.S. elections. Around 46% of these ads were seen before the elections with the balance having been seen thereafter.The thing concerning law makers and others is that around 10 million people have already seen the ads. Facebook is taking steps to try and prevent a recurrence by Russians or others, but it clearly won’t be an easy task given that there are 5 million advertisers on the platform. There’s also the problem of distinguishing between free speech and a malafide intention to influence crowds.At any rate, the company said that it would hire a thousand more people to review ads and ensure they meet its terms. It also stated that its ad review system was being changed with increased focus on not just the content of an ad, but also the context in which it was bought and the intended audience. There will also be an attempt to gather bonafide documentation to clearly identify advertisers.For good measure, Facebook also intends to remove videos showing murder, suicide and other violent acts. It isn’t clear yet if these actions will amount to censorship of the platform by violent groups, thus curbing free speech.Meanwhile, the company, along with other technology players has been called to testify before congressional panels investigating the issue on Nov 1. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg may not attend, however, as it coincides with the day the company is set to report earnings and also because senators are likely to want someone who could most capably describe the technical aspects of what happened, Bloomberg reports.EU Tax Issue Weighs on Technology Companies Technology companies have for years been avoiding tax payments on their European businesses by making use of complicated tax avoidance procedures. Accordingly, they form a subsidiary in a country where tax is exempt or very low. They then transfer some patents to this subsidiary.European headquarters are built in places like Ireland and Luxembourg, which typically attract foreign investors by offering tax incentives. So the companies first lower their taxes by arranging their incidence in a low-tax zone, then transfer the income to the subsidiary set up in a zero-tax country. They don’t repatriate the cash into the U.S. so they don’t have to pay taxes there either.The EU, under its current chief Margrethe Vestager, has been going after member countries one at a time to ensure that taxes are not collected in a way that prevents free competition between the member countries. So it has been initiating and fighting cases in not just Ireland and Luxembourg (though these are the main wrong doers), but also Belgium and the Netherlands.Recently, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), which has since changed its ways to also book sales in Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy, has been asked to pay Luxembourg $295 million in back taxes. It has also taken Ireland to the European Court of Justice for failing to recover up to 13 billion euros of tax due from Apple for the past year. Ireland has said that the action was regrettable. It has taken the stand that while making Apple pay the amount was unjustified, it had taken all necessary follow-up action with both Apple and the EU. TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL+0.77%+8.10%FB+0.80%+22.00%GOOGL+2.04%+17.57%MSFT+2.02%+15.61%INTC+4.07%+9.99%CSCO+0.36%+2.02%AMZN+2.94%+10.16% Other storiesCorporateBain Intends to Make Peace with WDC: After winning the bidding war to acquire Toshiba’s memory chip business, U.S. investor Bain Capital has indicated that it will try to settle things with Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) at the earliest. However, the acquisition will close by the March deadline even without the settlement and the investment firm has already reached out for government approval in China and elsewhere.Western Digital, for its part, continues to say it will challenge the acquisition through arbitration, but some now believe it’s on the back foot given that Toshiba actually owns the operations and technology and now has the right to block WDC out of its new Fab 6, impacting its ability to procure NAND.WDC appears to have really messed up the negotiations, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. So now, it may be in the uncomfortable position of having to share technology with competitors Hynix and Seagate. All of a sudden, its multi-billion dollar SanDisk deal looks wasted.And Seagate, which appeared to have fallen behind in the NAND race, now looks more favorably positioned to cut a supply deal with Toshiba Memory (Pangea). Bain is looking to cash out in three years by floating shares in Pangea and WDC may get in on them. But that still won’t solve its supply problem.Canaccord Upgrades Microsoft: Canaccord analysts Richard Davis and David Hynes are optimistic about Microsoft’s gaming prowess and think that the soon-to-be-launched Xbox One X and eSports prospects are enough to warrant a ratings upgrade from Hold to Buy. The analysts believe that Microsoft has the gaming depth to run its own leagues perhaps growing into a Ticketmaster equivalent of eSports.It’s true that eSports is catching on in a big way, particularly in North America, and Microsoft does have a better chance than many to build its position. But that isn’t the only place it’s likely to gain from: 1) Office Productivity (2) Gaming (3) Marketing, and (4) Azure’s Platform as a Service have been developed under CEO Satya Nadella to generate a period of sustained and accelerating growth, the analysts say.Legal/RegulatoryApple-Qualcomm Dispute in Light of New EU Rules: Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), which charges licensing rates for its standards essential patents on the ""fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory"" (FRAND) licensing model, has been in the midst of patent licensing issues for the last few years. It started in Asia (China, South Korea) and has now spread to the U.S. with Apple playing a key role.The truth is that what was once considered fair and reasonable is now being contested because companies like Apple simply don’t want to pay up. There’s logic in their argument, too. The FRAND is a very low fixed rate that a company charges when its technology becomes part of a standard that all device makers are compelled to use.But because of the growing number of devices, and the varying value of devices, the fixed rate is actually more lucrative when incorporated in a higher-value device than a lower-value one, such as an iPhone versus a cheap Android. Apple’s argument (and that of other device makers) is that companies like Qualcomm, aren’t contributing to the additional value, so they shouldn’t be allowed to claim a share of it.However, this argument overlooks Qualcomm’s viewpoint (and those of other such patent holders like Nokia and Ericsson) that this was what made it possible to charge a low rate in the first place. Raising the rate based on individual negotiations would mean more limited adoption of new technologies, which would be bad for consumers.  The issue gets more interesting because the EU is drawing up new rules fixing the reasonable rate for patent holders given the increasing number of new devices that nowadays also includes IoT (Apple’s Watch for instance uses a Qualcomm technology that finally allows it to be untethered from the iPhone). Naturally, device makers like Apple, Samsung, Huawei and others will be opposing the EU’s decision.Google Moves on Russia:  Following a report from the Director of National Intelligence about Russia Today (RT) being one of the publications close to the Russian government and systematically undermining American trust in the democratic system prevalent in the country, Google took some action.The world’s leading search engine and owner of YouTube, removed RT from its Google Preferred bundle. Advertisers usually pay a premium for ad placements in the Premium section because it comprises what’s most popular on YouTube. In that respect, RT was reportedly the second most popular channel. The company is currently carrying on internal investigations. Note that other state-backed channels like Al-Jazeera and the BBC remain as part of its premium inventory.New Products/TechnologyTrueDepth is Apple iPhone X Differentiator: Famed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that Apple’s Face ID facial identification system, places it up to 2.5 years ahead of its Android peers. Face ID, as the name implies, is a facial recognition system that scans a user’s face in 3D to determine whether the phone should be turned on. It harnesses Apple’s TrueDepth technology sitting inside the camera.Kuo estimates that Apple will sell 30 million to 35 million of the devices over the next year.Separately, RBC Capital Markets, surveyed more than 4,000 people interested in buying an iPhone, finding that 28% were looking for the iPhone X, 17% the iPhone 8, 20% iPhone 8 Plus and the rest older iPhones. This is a slightly smaller percentage than last year but still quite high. It’s also encouraging that the demand for the iPhone 8 series appears higher than iPhone X given the production glitches the company is seeing with the new Face ID camera feature.Some Issues with iPhone 8: A customer each in China, Japan and Taiwan said they received iPhones with the casing cracked open. It’s believed that the problem was caused by a bloated battery although there was no evidence of scorching or an explosion. Apple is looking into the matter but further details aren’t available yet.On the other hand, since Apple has saved most new features for its X phones, iPhone 8 availability has been much better than its previous iteration. Analyst and venture capitalist Gene Munster says that proprietary checks of 190 different Apple stores across the U.S. show that 61% of iPhone 8 SKUs are in stock compared with 20% last year and 50% the year before.Microsoft Bids Adieu to Groove Music: Microsoft’s streaming music service, originally called Zune, then renamed to Xbox Music and finally Groove Music is now being shut down. The company is making available software that will allow users to migrate their play lists and bought music over to rival Spotify but will maintain the app as a music player and part of Windows 10. From Dec 31, users will no longer be able to stream, share or buy new music through the app but will receive refunds for amounts left in their subscriptions or a Microsoft Store gift card for 120% the prorated amount.Amazon Delivery Service: Amazon is increasingly handling greater portions of the goods it sells on its platform. Now, to increase the efficiency of deliveries during the holiday season, the company is bringing Seller Flex, an idea it has used successfully in India for the last two years. Seller Flex basically allows the seller to use own or rented warehouses closer to its area of operations with Amazon overseeing deliveries.This of course eliminates a major function of FedEx and UPS, which had been taking care of these aspects earlier. It doesn’t however mean that Amazon will not use the couriers for the actual deliveries, just that it will now determine the packaging, best route, etc for these goods. This can potentially increase delivery efficiencies, offer free two-day delivery to more people and reduce load on Amazon’s own warehouses.On the other hand, logistics is a booming market. The ecommerce side in particular is estimated to grow 15.7% between 2016 and 2020 while the overall market will grow just 6.0%, according to market researcher Armstrong & Associates. So Amazon grabbing a larger share of this business means additional profits for the company.  Collaborations and M&AWal-Mart Acquires Parcel: In the escalating ecommerce battle between Amazon and Wal-Mart, the company that is still a distant second is making a large number of acquisitions. The latest one is New York-based last-mile delivery startup Parcel, which distributes meal kits, fresh and frozen grocery and ecommerce items 24/7, the same-day, overnight and in scheduled two-hour windows.Wal-Mart, which didn’t say how much it paid for the company, will use the service in New York City for general merchandise and fresh and frozen groceries from Walmart and Jet. Walmart needs to work on all aspects of the ecommerce game, as it is reportedly one of the biggest losers from Amazon’s Whole Foods acquisition. Research firm Thasos Group says that 24% of new Whole Foods customers after the acquisition were earlier Walmart loyals.Alibaba Gets into College Sports: Alibaba has expanded its relationship with Pac-12, a group of 12 leading American colleges, to engage with global counterparts and student athletes in an academic and cultural exchange. Accordingly, Alibaba will now distribute 175 live Pac-12 Networks events annually across China through its linear and digital channels, thus helping them build their brands. The agreement runs through 2024.Some NumbersNetflix Price Hike: The Netflix price hike is now in progress. For new users, the lowest-tier remains same at $7.99 with the most popular standard tier going from $9.99 to $10.99 and the premium tier going from $11.99 to $13.99. Existing subscribers will be notified from Oct 19 with the change going into effect from their next billing cycles.Netflix has been building and improving the quality of its offerings, so it is not expected to see a major fallout from this price hike. It has also earmarked another $7 billion for additional content including its originals. RBC analysts (as reported by Business Insider) therefore expect the price hike to fetch additional revenues of $650 million in 2018.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

890,WDC,"Semiconductor company, Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), upped the size of its recently-announced public offering deal from 1 billion shares to 1.2 billion shares.These offerings were made after the company registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Subject to customary closing conditions, this underwritten public offering is anticipated to close on Oct 16, 2017.According to its filing with the SEC, the company has agreed to sell around 29.3 million shares of its common stock, worth approximately $1.19 billion. In addition to the public offering, the underwriters have been given a 30-day option to purchase an additional 4.4 million shares.Notably, shares of Micron have moved up 146.9% in the last one year, significantly outperforming the industry’s 43.4% rally.Proceeds from the OfferingThe profits from the stock sale are primarily planned to go toward growth efforts. Further, Micron intends to use $476 million of the net proceeds from this offering for the repayment of 7.500% senior secured notes of $438 million in aggregate principal amount (due in 2023) and also pay related fees and expenses.Additionally, the remaining proceeds would be used for general business purposes and repayment of outstanding debts. This public offering will help in diversifying the company's investment options. In fact, as part of the diversification strategy, it will allocate a chunk of the stockholders' equity in a variety of assets.Though a stock offering results in dilution of earnings, prudent investments in strategic assets are likely to help the company navigate through the challenging rate environment.The only underwriter for the offering is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.Other PositivesThe enhanced capital deployment reflects Micron’s strong balance sheet as well asits confidence in long-term business prospects. During the fiscal 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $8.153 billion.The company exited the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and short-term investments of $5.428 billion compared with $4.330 billion in the previous quarter. Based on this performance, Micron expects to spend more on research and development, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and at the same time devote more cash for stock repurchases.The only concern persisting is its liquidity, since Micron’s net cash position remains negative ($4.444 billion in the last reported quarter). Particularly so, since growth opportunities look limited in the near term, given the sluggish demand environment.In the stringent regulatory landscape, this offering is anticipated to further enhance the balance sheet as well as support future growth. Additionally, it will assist the company to bring down its cost of capital.Micron is positive about the product launches and growing demand, particularly that of SSD products. We also believe that any increase in prices will have a favorable impact on the overall results. We anticipate these benefits to be a tailwind for the company, going forward.However, after acquiring SanDisk, Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) has become a key player in the NAND space, which could intensify competition in the industry.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), both flaunting a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA and Applied Materials have a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 10.3% and 17.1%, respectively.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

891,WDC,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.8% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock’s next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsWestern Digital reported fiscal first-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $3.56 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 26 cents. The figure also came ahead of the year-ago quarter figure of $1.54 and the guided range of $3.25–$3.35 per share.Revenues increased 9.9% year over year to $5.18 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.11 billion. The figure was also better than guided.The year-over-year growth was primarily attributed to growing demand in the company’s end markets. Management was particularly positive about the company’s flash-based storage segment and joint venture fab operations in Yokkaichi. The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is another tailwind for Western Digital.Segment Revenue DetailsClient Devices soared 13% year over year to $2.7 billion. Accelerated demand for client solid state drives (SSD) and embedded flash products was beneficial for the segment.The company began the ramp up of 64-layer based client SSDs for original equipment manufacturers (OEM) during the quarter. The expansion of the product suite increased the adoption of client SSDs in OEM offerings.Client Solution also surged 16% to $1.1 billion, owing to robust performance of hard disk drive (HDD) and flash-based products. The product launches during the quarter such as iXpand Base and My Cloud Home and a microSD card of 400 gigabytes with the highest capacity to date were the major drivers. These have enhanced the company’s global retail brand value further.Data Center Services and Solutions revenues were $1.4 billion, almost flat on a year-over-year basis. Management noted that the accumulated growth of enterprise SSDs and capacity enterprise hard drives was negated by declining performance enterprise hard drives.In the capacity enterprise segment, shortage of DRAM supply still remains a concern, resulting in slow petabyte growth during the year. The company expects its 12-terabyte offering to be capable of managing varied workloads as DRAM market tightness reduces.Management noted that the acquisition of Tegile Systems, a provider of flash storage, is expected to enhance Western Digital’s product suite, thereby helping it to meet varied customer requirements. The company’s buyout of Upthere, an app-based cloud-storage startup will further enrich its solutions suite.Joint Venture DisputeNotably, management is positive about Western Digital’s flash memory joint venture with Toshiba, which is currently being taken care of by Sandisk, the company’s recently acquired subsidiary. Western Digital intends to seek a court injunction to prevent Toshiba from selling its ownership interests in the joint venture unit to SK Hynix-Bain consortium, without the consent of Sandisk.Management projects supply bit growth rate of 35% to 45% for calendar years 2018 and 2019, backed by its joint venture partnerships, which are legally compelled to provide it with NAND supply till 2029.Operating DetailsNon GAAP gross margin increased to 42.3% from 33.9% in the year-ago quarter, driven by a favorable supply-demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue, and strength in the capacity enterprise HDD product line-up.Non-GAAP operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 250 basis points (bps) to 15.8%.Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.5% compared with 15.6% in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet/Cash FlowWestern Digital ended the quarter with, cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities worth of $7 billion. Net debt decreased around $600 million to $6.3 billion during the quarter, mostly driven by strong cash flow generated from business.GuidanceFor second-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are expected to be within the range of $5.2–$5.3 billion.Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be a bit higher compared with the previous quarter. Total operating expenses are anticipated to be almost $830 million.Interest and other expense is anticipated to be around $205 million.Management expects non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $3.60–$3.70 per share. They also noted that the synergy targets from the acquisitions of HGST and SanDisk are on track.For fiscal 2018, Western Digital forecasts non-GAAP earnings per share to exceed $13.00.Notably, Western Digital expects to take microwave-assisted magnetic recording (MAMR) technology into production in 2019. The commercial availability of this technology will aid in the development of higher capacity drives and prove to be a key growth catalyst in the long run.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Analysts were quiet during the past month as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.Western Digital Corporation Price and Consensus  Western Digital Corporation Price and Consensus | Western Digital Corporation Quote VGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is more suitable for value and growth investors than those looking for momentum.OutlookThe stock has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We are expecting an above average return from the stock in the next few months.

892,WDC,"Several semiconductor stocks were hit yesterday after Morgan Stanley downgraded several memory chip makers on concerns of falling NAND prices and weak earnings growth projection for 2018.Analyst Shawn Kim of Morgan Stanley noted that NAND flash memory chip prices are peaking but may start declining from the beginning of next year due to a supply glut. Notably, over the past year, NAND prices have been flaring up due to shortage of supply. Kim has a cautious stance as the supply-demand mismatch will diminish over the next few months. He further projects that there will be no material earnings growth for memory chip makers in 2018 due to fall in NAND prices.Based on these projections, Morgan Stanley lowered its ratings for three semiconductor companies which have high exposure in the NAND memory-chip space — Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report), Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM  -  Free Report). In a note to clients, Kim wrote, “We think now is the time to reduce exposure to NAND [flash memory] and Asian semiconductor names as the industry has benefited from sizable demand tailwinds and unprecedented pricing power, which we see reversing soon.”He further stated, ""Given our view of the cycle, we cannot recommend the sector until the market recognizes mounting pressure on NAND prices and slowing logic chip growth momentum in the near term… This reflects our negative view of prospects for the global memory industry, which is currently at a peak.""Semi Stocks Face the BruntThe recent rating downgrade and comments on the future prospects of memory chips adversely impacted several chip makers, sending the companies’ shares to close in the red on Nov 27. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report), which represents the entire semiconductor performance, closed 1.3% lower yesterday.Among stocks, Western Digital and Taiwan Semiconductor were the biggest losers — the companies’ shares plunging 6.7% and 4.4%, respectively. Chip equipment manufacturers like Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) also took the punch, recording a decline of 2.7% and 1.7%, respectively.Another memory-chip maker — Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) — also faced the brunt of the rating downgrade despite having little exposure to NAND. The stock lost approximately 3.3% of its value yesterday even after Morgan Stanley raised its target price. Also, Kim’s encouraging remarks on its main segment —DRAM — failed to boost its performance.Kim noted that investors should not worry about Micron as the supply-demand dynamics for DRAM are still in favour of the company and price of DRAM will top-out in mid 2018. Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating on the stock.Cash in Your Investment Ahead of the FallKim’s recent comments reflect that the industry is nearing end of the super cycle, where memory-chip makers have enjoyed a remarkable run til last Friday. Therefore, it is wise to cash in your investment before the stocks start tumbling drastically.Citing Morgan Stanley’s analysis, Kim mentioned that investors should offload their holdings three to six months before the memory prices peak.Memory-chip providers Western Digital, Taiwan Semiconductor and Micron Technology have rallied 27.4%, 42.8% and 119.2%, respectively, year to date. This implies that exiting here will generate a good return unless you may lose your money.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2%, respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

893,WDC,"By their very nature, growth investors are primarily focused on finding companies whose earnings and revenue are expected grow at a rate that outpaces the market. This investment strategy comes with its fair share of risks, but it also brings the exciting possibility of outsized returns—an end goal that every investor desires.Over the past several years, Wall Street’s most exciting growth stocks have emerged from the technology sector. From industry innovators like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) to exciting foreign stocks such as Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), tech-focused growth investors have been rewarded with massive profits recently.Strong earnings and impressive sales imply that the technology sector’s hot streak could continue throughout 2018—despite recent market-wide volatility. That means that growth investors searching for the next great market-beating stock might want to keep their focus on tech companies.Luckily, we can pair the proven Zacks Rank with our innovative Style Scores system, which includes a “Growth” category, to find strong growth tech stocks. Investors should note that our Growth category values earnings and sales growth, as well as improvements to a company’s financial statements—including strong cash flows and great return on equity.With all of this said, check out these three tech stocks for growth investors to consider now:1. AppFolio, Inc. (APPF  -  Free Report)AppFolio offers cloud-based software solutions for the property management and legal industries. The company’s AppFolio Property Manager is a leading solution for property management, while its MyCase application is ideal for practitioners and small law firms. Currently, the stock is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).AppFolio recently surged into profitability, which is something that investors tend to reward. This fiscal year, current estimates are calling for earnings growth of 66% and net sales growth of 27%. The company is also improving its cash position, generating quadruple-digit cash flow growth and operating with a net margin of nearly 9%.The firm has also proven to be an efficient one, with Return on Equity of 16% crushing its industry average. AppFolio should be able to use this, and its solid margins, to capitalize on its new business opportunities. APPF has also displayed the strength of small caps recently, adding about 32% over the past two months. 2. Twitter, Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report)Twitter operates one of the world’s most popular social media websites, but thanks to a number of new initiatives—including a shift to live, original content and a renewed focus on profitability—the stock is now popping up on our growth screens. What’s more, TWTR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Analysts expect Twitter to witness EPS growth of 71% and sales growth of 20% this year, according to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company is also witnessing cash flow growth of more than 95% currently.Meanwhile, Twitter has a number of new partnerships—with many notable media companies and sports organizations—that it should be able to leverage in an internet industry that has increasingly rewarded original content. 3. eGain Corporation (EGAN  -  Free Report)eGain provides web customer interaction, social customer interaction, and contact center applications. It is a growing name within the expanding customer engagement cloud solutions space. EGAN is holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and looks like another top growth pick right now.Based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates, eGain appears to be on track to report earnings growth of 127% for its full fiscal year, which ends in June. Earnings growth for the upcoming year is projected to be 117% from this year’s estimated total.This is also another stock benefitting from the strength in small caps. EGAN has skyrocketed more than 700% over the past year, including a 60% gain in just the past three months. That should continue if the firm can continue proving its growth possibilities. Want more market analysis from this author?

894,WDC,"The hot and the soaring semiconductor corner of the broad technology market had a rough ride on Nov 27. The decline came as Morgan Stanly raised concerns on soaring memory chip prices and downgraded a number of chipmakers including Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), Samsung Electronics, and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM  -  Free Report).The dual tailwind of strong demand and high price has benefited the industry throughout the year and this trend now seems to be reversing. Morgan Stanley cautioned that the so-called ""super-cycle"" in chip demand may be coming to an end, and prices for memory chips will peak soon. As such, the analyst thinks it is now time to reduce exposure to Nand (flash memory) and Asian semiconductor names.The action took a toll on the industry, leading to profit taking and pushing the chip stocks lower. Samsung tumbled 5.1%, the biggest one-day fall in more than a year, Western Digital plunged 6.7% and Taiwan Semiconductor dropped 4.4%. The weakness has spread to the other players with Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) falling 3% and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) slipping 1.1%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.3%, reflecting the biggest percentage loss in more than two weeks. This suggests some rough trading in the coming days (read: Tap Nvidia Growth Story With These Tech ETFs).ETF ImpactThe awful trading in the stock world also pushed the semiconductor ETF space into the red on the day. In particular, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report), PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Fund (PSI  -  Free Report) and First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL  -  Free Report) stole the show with a nearly 1.5% fall (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Below we profile these ETFs in detail and discuss some of the specifics behind their recent slump:SMHThis fund provides exposure to 26 securities by tracking the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. It is highly concentrated on the top two firms, TSM and Intel (INTC), at over 10% share each while other firms hold no more than 5.61% of assets. The product has managed assets worth $1.5 billion and charges 36 bps in annual fees and expenses. It is heavily traded with a volume of around 3.3 million shares per day.PSIThis fund tracks the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index, holding 30 securities in its basket with none accounting for more than 5.6% of assets. It has AUM of $412.2 million and sees a moderate average daily volume of 82,000 shares. Expense ratio comes in at 0.63% (read: S&P 500 Tops 2600: ETFs & Stocks That Deserve Special Thanks).FTXLThis fund offers exposure to the most-liquid U.S. semiconductor securities based on volatility, value and growth by tracking the Nasdaq US Smart Semiconductor Index. Holding 30 stocks in its basket, it is highly concentrated on MU while other firms hold less than 8.5% share. FTXL has accumulated $27.5 million in AUM and trades in light average daily volume of around 7,000 shares. Expense ratio comes in at 0.60%.What Lies Ahead?Despite the slide, the outlook for the industry is promising. The semiconductor industry and ETFs are clearly outpacing the broad market index and the fund from the year-to-date look. In fact, the industry is enjoying a strong rally this year, gaining about 46%.This trend is likely to continue this year thanks to improved overseas demand and innovative technologies. Rapid adoption of cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence and other advanced information technologies are fueling demand for chips and other semiconductor products. The PC market is also stabilizing and will likely see strong growth in the coming months.Semiconductors have been the most important driver of overall technology growth as it is now used in day-to-day life from cars, electronic gadgets to planes and weapons (read: 7 Top-Ranked Tech ETFs on Unstoppable Rally).Further, the three products detailed above have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), suggesting that these have the potential to outperform in the coming months. About 85% of the industries falling under semiconductors have a solid Zacks Rank in the top 50%.  Given the solid outlook but somewhat bearish near-term sentiments, investors may want to consider staying on the sidelines for the time being. However, risk tolerant long-term investors may want to consider this recent slump a buying opportunity, should they have the patience for extreme volatility.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

895,WDC,"Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) is still recovering from the damage wreaked by the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. It had affected around 87 million users and allegedly influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.Notably, the European Union (EU) had defamed Facebook regarding the data breach fiasco and expressed its interest in initiating an investigation on Mar 20, right after the news went viral. It seems that EU is still sticking to its ground and is unimpressed with Mark Zuckerberg’s sorry image.Per CNBC, EU is planning to intensify the investigation process related to “harvesting of personal information.” The Working Party 29, which takes care of the data-protection authorities of the EU nations, will reportedly form a Social Media Working Group aimed at creating unified strategies for further investigation.Furthermore, a new law related to data privacy called General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is expected to come into existence in the EU on May 25. Per the latest introduction, Europeans will have the rights of knowing which of their personal data businesses are collecting and will have the right to delete those if need be.This law, once implemented, might impact companies which generate most of the revenues from advertisements which, in turn, need a huge amount of personal data for correct targeting of customers.For the social media giant, Facebook, which generated around 98% of its revenues in 2017 from advertisements, this implementation might be a huge drag on its top-line growth. Meanwhile, Facebook’s stock has been hit badly by the alleged data misuse scandal. The company’s shares have lost around 5% since the news surfaced on Mar 19.Facebook Continues to StriveApart from just being apologetic, Facebook is actually adhering to its word of maintaining data privacy as stated in the apology statements.Facebook recently removed more than 270 accounts and pages operated by the Russian organization, Internet Research Agency (IRA), which were aimed at influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The company also announced that only authorized advertisers will be able to post political ads going forward, which will be labeled as “Political Ad” bearing “paid for by” information.Furthermore, Facebook suspended two more data analytics companies, namely CubeYou and AggregateIQ, over unauthorized handling of user data. It is also investing in artificial intelligence (AI), and recruiting more people for handling data security and content.To ConcludeWe believe Facebook’s efforts to plug security loopholes as well as limit fake news will eventually boost trustworthiness. Sequoia Fund’s investment for a minority stake in the company amidst this scenario is a testament to the fact.However, we are apprehensive about this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock’s near-term performance as the eroded brand image will take some time to shine again.Key PicksInvestors interested in the broader technology sector can consider some better-ranked stocks like Paycom Software (PAYC  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report). All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

896,WDC,"Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) recently announced that IronWolf, IronWolf Pro and Barracuda Pro – which are part of the Guardian Series of hard disk drives (HDDs) – are now available in capacity of up to 12 terabyte (TB).The 3.5 inch Barracuda Pro HDD is suitable for high performance desktop, creative pro desktop applications and gaming. The high-speed drive enables faster large file transfers and photo editing.On the other hand, IronWolf and IronWolf Pro are suitable for Network Attached Storage (NAS). The new 12TB drive also support Seagate’s IronWolf Health Management (IHM) software, which helps in improving the overall system reliability by displaying actionable prevention, intervention or recovery options for the user.Capacity Expansion to Boost DemandSeagate believes that the expanded capacity will improve demand for the HDDs among large enterprises, small and medium size businesses (SMBs) and creative professionals. The HDDs are capable to address the growing storage needs amid huge influx of data generated by emerging technology and services like augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), 4K resolution and 360-degree videos.Seagate Technology PLC Price and Consensus  Seagate Technology PLC Price and Consensus | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteMarket research firm IDC forecasts that by 2025, the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes (trillion gigabytes), which is ten times the 16.1 zettabytes (ZB) of data generated in 2016. More importantly, almost 20% of this will be critical to daily lives and nearly 10% of that will be hypercritical.This massive volume of data presents significant growth opportunity for enterprises. However, effective storage is absolutely necessary to properly harness this data. This presents significant growth opportunity for Seagate in the long term.Expanding Portfolio to Boost ResultsSeagate has been losing HDD market share amid significant competition from Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report). Despite a number of acquisitions, the company also doesn’t have significant presence in the flash memory market.Nevertheless, we expect Seagate’s expanding portfolio to be a game changer in the future. At the 2017 Flash Memory Summit (FMS), the company announced enhanced versions of two flash technologies to boost performance and capacity for mixed data center workloads.Although ramping of its 10 terabyte (TB) helium (nearline) drives have been disappointing, Seagate now expects to ship approximately 1 million 10 TB units in the current quarter.We also expect Seagate’s involvement in the Bain Capital-Toshiba deal will improve its presence in the rapidly growing flash storage market.Moreover, collaborations with the likes of Tencent and Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report) is expected to boost Seagate’s foothold in China.Zacks Rank & Key PickSeagate has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Netlist Inc (NLST  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) is a stock worth considering in the same sector.

897,WDC,"Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 26. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 8.7%. Over the last four quarters, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average positive earnings surprise of 23.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderMicron offers both DRAM and NAND products. While DRAM chips are key components in PCs, NAND flash chips are crucial for portable electronic devices. So far, the fiscal 2017 has been marvellous for the company.In the last reported quarter, Micron’s top and bottom lines surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate, as well as marked tremendous year-over-year growth, primarily due to pricing improvement in DRAM and NAND sales volume.We believe that the improving prices for DRAM and NAND chips make investors confident about Micron’s growth. Per various sources, prices for these specific chips have improved chiefly due to a better product-mix optimization and higher-than-expected demand for PCs, servers and mobiles.We believe that any elevation in prices will have a favorable influence on the company’s top line, the benefit of which will likely trickle down to the bottom line. The benefit from improved pricing was well reflected in the company’s last quarterly results as well. We anticipate these benefits to reflect in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.83 on $5.95-billion revenue projection.Micron Technology, Inc.

This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Micron’s Earnings ESP is -0.14%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1. Though a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report), has an Earnings ESP of +0.13%, and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

899,WDC,"The downward trend in the PC industry persisted in third-quarter 2017 as well. According to the recently released worldwide PC shipment data by independent research firms — Gartner Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) and International Data Corporation (“IDC”) — even the back-to-school season failed to lift the PC market.The preliminary data released by Gartner depicts that PC shipments in the quarter were down 3.6% year over year to 67 million units. This also marks the 12th straight quarter of year-over-year fall — the longest duration of decline in the history of PC industry.Though IDC also reported a decline in PC shipments, its reported figures were widely different. Per the research firm, worldwide PC shipment edged down 0.5% on a year-over-year basis and totaled 67.2 million in the third quarter. The decline, however, was lower than IDC’s previous forecast of 1.4%.Although the firms reported a decline in PC shipments, their take on the back-to-school season sales performance is different. Per Gartner, a very weak back-to-school sales season resulted in a 10.3% year-over-year decline in PC sales in the United States, while IDC believes “back-to-school promotions helped boost results”, in the quarter.Chromebook – The Major DifferentiatorIn our opinion, the disparity in data and comments may be due to the different techniques used by the firms for tracking PC sales, as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products, specially Chromebooks, which run on Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Chrome operating system.Notably, unlike Gartner, IDC includes Chromebooks. Gartner, on the other hand, takes into account Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) tablets and detachable, such as the iPad Pro and the Asus Transformer.According to IDC, Chromebooks continued to witness strong growth, while in a reply to MarketWatch’s mail, Mika Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner said that “they did notice “strong growth” for the devices in the quarter, especially in the U.S.”Escalating Prices Upsetting DemandAlthough the firms chose different data-compilation techniques, both highlighted almost similar reasons for the plunge. Both agreed that shortage of key components, including DRAM, SSD and LCD panels, has been flaring up PC prices, in turn thwarting the overall demand. Per Gartner, DRAM shortages worsened during the third quarter when compared with the first half of 2017.Mika Kitagawa observed that to counter higher component cost situation “most vendors generally pass the price hike on to consumers, rather than absorbing the cost themselves”, which adversely affected the overall PC market.Computer - Peripheral Equipment Industry 5YR % Return Computer - Peripheral Equipment Industry 5YR % ReturnRegion-Wise PerformanceTalking about the geographical performance, the firms agreed that overall PC shipments across every region dropped during the quarter. However, as per IDC, which reports Japan’s sales separately, the country witnessed year-over-year growth for the fifth consecutive quarter.Per Gartner, PC shipments in the United States dipped 10.3% year over year to 14.7 million units, primarily due to poor consumer PC demand, partially offset by stable demand in the business segment. Nevertheless, the firm noted that business PC demand “could slow down among SMBs due to PC price increases due to component shortages.""PC shipment in Europe and the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) edged down 1.1% year over year to 19 million units, according to Gartner. The research firm also mentioned that the declining trend in Western Europe is slowing down, therefore it anticipates a potential stability in the last quarter of 2017. In Eastern Europe, Gartner didn’t notice any remarkable positive influence from the Windows 10 migration and thus, demand is not improving.In Asia/Pacific, PC shipments dropped 2.1% year over year to 24 million units, mainly due to dismal demand for consumer PCs, partially offset by steady demand for business PCs, per Gartner. The research firm noted a 5% PC unit sales decline in China.In Japan, the PC industry continued to display strength, according to IDC. Per the firm, “Japan traditional PC market showed stable growth in 3Q17, primarily driven by refresh projects and migration to Windows 10 as well as further notebook adoption.”Top Vendors ListHP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) retained its leading position during the quarter, per Gartner. Also, this was the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth for the company, following five back-to-back quarters of underperformance. The spin-off from its parent, Hewlett-Packard Company, and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets, and cutting jobs to lower costs, are apparently paying off at last.Gartner stated that among the top five vendors, only HP Inc. recorded growth in PC shipment, while Dell, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Lenovo and Asus witnessed declines during the third quarter. With a market share of 30.5%, HP Inc. witnessed year-over-year growth of 4.4% in PC shipment.Lenovo, on the other hand, registered a 1.5% decline and has a market share of 21.4%. Dell holds the third spot, with a market share of 15.2%, and witnessed a 0.4% decline.Apple and Asus also registered year-over-year decline of 5.5% and 9%, respectively. However, in terms of market share, Apple lost its fourth position to Asus, with respective shares of 6.9% and 7.3%.In the top vendors’ list, IDC has a slightly different opinion. While HP Inc., Lenovo and Dell are the top three vendors here also, the research firm has different names for the fourth and fifth position. Per IDC, Apple is in the fourth spot, while Asus holds the fifth position.What’s Ahead?Though both research firms reported a year-over-year decline in global PC shipments, the forward looking statements indicate that the PC industry is moving toward stabilization.IDC’s Loren Loverde, program vice president, Worldwide PCD Trackers, said “The traditional PC market performed much as expected in the third quarter."" He further added, ""Emerging markets rebounded slightly more than anticipated, but overall results reflect the stabilization we expected following component and inventory adjustments. The outlook for the fourth quarter remains cautious, likely with a small decline in volume for the quarter and the year. The gains in emerging regions and potential for more commercial replacements represent some upside potential, although we continue to expect incremental declines in total shipments for the next few years.""Furthermore, Gartner does not include Chromebook shipments in data compilation, which is showing tremendous growth. Last year, Chromebook shipments grew a whopping 38%, while the total PC market dipped 6%.In the second-quarter PC shipment report, Ms. Kitagawa had said, “The Chromebook is not a PC replacement as of now, but it could be potentially transformed as a PC replacement if a few conditions are met going forward.” She further added “For example, infrastructure of general connectivity needs to improve; mobile data connectivity needs to become more affordable; and it needs to have more offline capability”.The aforementioned positive comments on the PC market by the two industry experts will provide a respite to the PC vendors, as well as the companies which are dependent on the PC industry.An improving trend in PC shipments will benefit the business prospects of companies like HP Inc., Microsoft, Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), Seagate Technologies (STX  -  Free Report) and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), which continue to depend substantially on PC sales.Currently, HP Inc. and Intel, both carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

900,WDC,"Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), a semiconductor company, plans to offer an underwriting public offering of $1 billion common shares to enhance liquidity. The company’s shares rose 2.5% in yesterday’s trading session.Further, Micron anticipates the underwriters to be provided with a 30-day option to purchase up to additional $150 million common shares to cover any over-allotments. The offering is subject to customary closing conditions.Micron intends to use $476 million of the net proceeds from this offering for the repayment of 7.500% senior secured notes of $438 million in aggregate principal amount (due in 2023) and also pay related fees and expenses. Additionally, the remaining proceeds would be used for general business purposes and repayment of outstanding debts.The only underwriter for the offering is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. Notably, shares of Micron have moved up 150.2% in the last one year, significantly outperforming the industry’s 41.5% rally.The enhanced capital deployment reflects Micron’s strong balance sheet as well as its confidence in long-term business prospects. During the fiscal 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $8.153 billion.The company exited the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and short-term investments of $5.428 billion compared with $4.330 billion in the previous quarter. Based on this performance, Micron expects to spend more on research and development, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and at the same time devote more cash for stock repurchases.The only concern persisting is its liquidity, since Micron’s net cash position remains negative ($4.444 billion in the last reported quarter). Particularly so, since growth opportunities look limited in the near term, given the sluggish demand environment.In the stringent regulatory landscape, this offering is expected to further enhance the balance sheet as well as support future growth. Additionally, it will assist the company to bring down its cost of capital.Bottom LineIt is worth mentioning that the acquisition of Inotera in December 2016 will have some operational benefits, leading to efficient management of investment levels and cadence, followed by alignment with global manufacturing operations.Micron is positive about the product launches and growing demand, particularly that of SSD products. We also believe that any increase in prices will have a favorable impact on the company’s overall results. We anticipate these benefits to be a tailwind for the company, going forward.However, after acquiring SanDisk, Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) has become a key player in the NAND space, which could intensify competition in the industry.Currently, Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), both flaunting a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA and Applied Materials have a long term-expected EPS growth rate of 10.3% and 17.1%, respectively.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

901,WDC,"Last week was packed with events from Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), China’s GTC, in which NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) participated, news about some business that Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) is moving from NVDA to Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Toshiba signing an agreement to sell its chip business to a group including Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) competitors, plus so much more.So let’s jump right in-    Microsoft Ignite ConferenceAt its Ignite conference in Orlando on Monday, Microsoft announced some interesting changes to its product lineup and that clearly lays out that the company is at the top of its game and not falling behind the pack.Similar to IBM, Intel, Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google and others, Microsoft also started talking about computing based on the quantum theory that seeks to explain the nature and behavior of matter and energy on atomic and sub-atomic levels. The company will soon release to developers a new programming language based on this kind of computing that they can use, along with Microsoft's simulator and application writing tools.It also announced several enhancements to its cloud-computing and productivity software products and services, including the infusion of artificial intelligence, or AI, into its Office 365 productivity suite. Now, Office 365 will also integrate Teams, which will be the primary application for communications, replacing Skype for Business, which will henceforth be focused on customers with on-premise data centers.Teams is now being used by over 125,000 organizations worldwide just six months after its launch. The company did say that it intends to release an updated Skype infrastructure next year that will be targeted to companies that aren't using the cloud and have on-premises data centers. The other major announcement involved LinkedIn integration into its other products like Office 365 and Dynamics 365. As a result, customers will now be able to see LinkedIn information, including things shared on social media for deeper insight on customers or employees they are looking to meet with.Additionally, Microsoft says that its virtual reality headset is increasingly being used to collaborate on projects. As an example it mentioned Ford, which uses the goggles to view virtual versions of car models, instead of constructing the usual 5,000-pound clay models. It also announced some Windows and Office bundles to target enterprise and education segments. Microsoft 365 F1 is one such bundle for customer-facing employees and includes Office 365, Windows 10, Microsoft's Enterprise Mobility and Security suite and StaffHub. It also announced Microsoft 365 for educators, including Office 365, Windows 10, Enterprise Mobility and Security, and Minecraft: Education Edition.NVIDIA’s Cements Position in China’s AI MarketMeanwhile in Beijing, China, NVIDIA announced at the Graphics Technology Conference (GTC), that it remains the favorite with the BAT companies, i.e. Baidu, Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and Tencent. The three Chinese Internet giants will now be migrating from NVIDIA’s Pascal GPU platform to its Volta platform, which means that their cloud customers will be able to harness the greater speed and scalability for inferencing (where the trained neural network is used to predict and classify sample data) and training required for artificial intelligence development.In the words of Jensen Huang: ""AI is the most important technology development of our time, with the greatest potential to help society…As the world's leading cloud providers deploy the world's best AI platform, with Volta GPUs and NVIDIA software, we'll see amazing breakthroughs in medicine, autonomous transportation, precision manufacturing and much more.""Leading Chinese OEMs like Inspur, Huawei and Lenovo are also offering Volta-based accelerators for hyperscale data centers based on NVIDIA HGX reference architecture for those companies looking to deploy artificial intelligence or machine learning in their own data centers.Additionally, JD.com will use the NVIDIA Jetson platform (low-power AI vision) to guide and control its drone delivery systems (the company plans to have a million such drones in service by 2020). It is expected that these drones will ultimately lower delivery costs to rural China.Tesla Switches from NVIDIA to IntelIntel scored a small win in what appeared to be a big announcement last week. Bloomberg reported on the basis of statements from people familiar with the matter that the company will now be supplying the chips powering the infotainment systems in Tesla Model 3s and new versions of other cars. This is big news because Intel displaces NVIDIA, which has been making waves in the automotive segment.On the other hand, NVIDIA continues to supply technology for Tesla’s self-driving system (instead of technology from Intel’s recently-acquired Mobileye), which is a more lucrative business. There are rumors that Tesla is planning to move from NVIDIA to AMD in this area, but since none of the companies have made any official statement to that effect it remains mostly a surmise.Toshiba Finalizes Chip Unit Sale, WDC ObjectsToshiba has signed an agreement to sell its chip business through a special purpose entity called Pangea. Accordingly, it will invest 350.5 billion yen in Pangea, which along with Hoya Corp (27 billion yen) and other Japanese investors, will keep at least 50% of the company with Japanese owners, as preferred by the Japanese government.Pangea itself will raise 600 billion yen in loans. U.S. investors (Bain which alone will invest 212 billion yen, Apple which will invest $3 billion, Seagate which will put in up to $1.25 billion, etc.) will invest 415.5 billion yen, but will not have an equity stake or voting rights. Hynix, which will invest 395 billion yen, will not increase its stake to more than 15% for 10 years.But it’s a very difficult arrangement given that it involves a motley crowd including Western Digital’s competitors, customers and investors, as well as Hynix, which was previously found guilty of stealing trade secrets, for which it paid a fine to WDC and Toshiba. With Apple in the mix, there will also be some heavy pushing (the iPhone maker reportedly delayed the deal by demanding more advantageous wafer supply agreements).But Toshiba is going ahead with it anyway. And if litigation isn’t resolved when it’s time to close (as will likely be the case), Toshiba won’t include its 3 JVs with WDC in the sale and the price will be adjusted accordingly. That is, if WDC doesn’t manage to secure an injunction blocking the sale of the memory business itself.TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL+1.47%+7.28%FB+0.16%+20.25%GOOGL+3.23%+14.84%MSFT+0.11%+13.09%INTC+2.41%+5.57%CSCO+0.78%-0.50%AMZN+0.65%+8.43% Other StoriesCorporateRoku IPO Up: Roku’s IPO was priced at $14 a share, but ROKU shares soared nearly 90% in the following days. The company taps the increasing demand for streamed digital content as the new generation moves away from traditional TV. So it sells some hardware that does the job, but also licenses software that helps you tune in to video from Netflix, Hulu, HBO and the like.Revenue also comes from advertising, which is clumped together with software under the head “platform” and this is the segment growing strongly to offset the slight decline in hardware. Of course, it’s in a crowded market with Amazon, Google, Apple and several others also looking for their shares of the pie.But with 39 million Americans (as of July 2017) already using its service, it might not be that easy to kill. At the same time, it does need to keep investing in the business and can’t keep making losses forever (albeit from rapidly increasing revenues), so the $219 million it raised from the IPO at a valuation of $1.3 billion will clearly come in handy.Apple, Google National Security Requests: The government, in the form of National Security Letters, or NSLs, and requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, made a record number of requests for data. In Apple’s case, there were between 13,250 and 13,499 national security requests affecting between 9,000 and 9,249 users in the first half of 2017, which was up from 2,750 to 2,999 requests affecting 2,000 to 2,249 users in the first half of 2016. In Google’s case, there were 48,941 government data requests affecting 83,345 user accounts, up from 76,713 requests in the year-ago period.   Alibaba May Enter Chinese Games Market: According to a report by chinadaily.com as discussed in Investopedia, Alibaba is gearing up to hit the $15 billion Chinese gaming market (as estimated by IDC). It will operate under its digital media and entertainment group and be headed by ex-Netease COO Zhan Zhonghui who also has some experience founding his own gaming company called EJoy.Chen Wei’an, the product manager for World of Warcraft and Starcraft 2 at Ejoy, and Wu Yunyang, a leading developer for in-house game titles at the company, will also reportedly be part of the group. It is currently working on the R&D side to develop industry-leading games.Legal/RegulatoryGoogle Remedy for EU Antitrust Case: While Google appeals the European Commission’s 2.42 billion euro fine in the Google Shopping case, it has also taken steps to comply with EU requirements. The EU has hired KPMG and Mavens, which have expertise in search engine optimization and marketing to determine whether Google is in compliance.For its part, Google is spinning out Google Shopping as a separate unit within Google that will rely on its own revenues to bid for advertising slots on the top of the search engine results page. Earlier, Google kept the spot for its own comparison shopping service, relegating results from competing comparison shopping services way down the page or on subsequent pages.Lead plaintiffs Foundem and other comparison shopping sites like Kelkoo expressed dissatisfaction with Google’s solution, saying that a solution based on auctions would force rivals to bid away all their profits and wouldn’t generate free traffic. Google’s changes will be monitored and the Commission will see how it works before any decision is taken, which could lead to additional fines, a move to break up the company, or something else. Only 5-6 of the 300 comparison shopping services have reportedly signed up for the service, so tracking may be easier said than done until more companies join in.New Products/TechnologyGoogle Subscription Tools: Google is revising an earlier policy to demote news sites in the search engine rankings if they didn’t offer some news stories for free. This ensured that people wouldn’t be confronted with paywall after paywall in a regular Google search. But news agencies maintained that this was resulting in a growing number of freeloaders and reducing their revenues through subscription services.Google had in the past argued that increased traffic to the sites would bring more subscribers. Now, it’s saying that the number news agencies offering subscription services have reached critical mass, so it makes sense to play ball. So it will offer publishers new online payment tools, methods to target readers and customized features inside Google News for existing subscribers. Bloomberg reported earlier that Google tested these subscription tools with The New York Times and The Financial Times.Google Assistant on NVIDIA Shield: NVIDIA has an important software update for its Shield TV multimedia unit that will bring Google Assistant to the device. So once you get the $60 controller or $200 Shield-plus-controller, you can use voice commands to start or change TV programming, fast forward, or ask the TV to display photos and slideshows from Google Photos.Google can furnish information about what programming is currently running, facilitate shopping on Google’s Play store, check calendars and order ride-hailing services such as Uber. Google is also throwing in a three-month free trial of its YouTube Red offering. The net result is a really great streaming device cum smart home controller. It’s true competition for Apple TV and priced accordingly.Collaborations and M&AGoogle Search for Siri: Apple has replaced Microsoft’s Bing with Google’s search engine to power Siri. An Apple representative was quoted in TechCrunch, saying that ""Switching to Google as the web search provider for Siri, Search within iOS and Spotlight on Mac will allow these services to have a consistent web search experience with the default in Safari."" This means that Google search is the default on over 90% of mobile devices, a big positive considering that most people never change the default. This enables Google to generate very strong advertising revenues.In Apple’s case, a few advantages come to mind. The first and most obvious is that Google search must provide better user experience. And second, since Microsoft integrates Bing in its Windows 10 OS and competes head-on with Apple on devices, the company has an incentive to differentiate its products. This may have made the Google alternative all the more interesting.Cisco Acquires Springpath: Cisco has closed the acquisition of hyperconvergence software maker Springpath for $320 million. The two worked together earlier to launch HyperFlex, Cisco’s solution to address this market. The concept basically looks to provide complete solutions including storage, networking and other software that increases efficiency and economy of operations as corporations move to the cloud. IDC expects the market to represent a $6 billion opportunity by 2020.Microsoft’s Cybersecurity Alliance: To expand their current relationship, Microsoft, Accenture and Avanade have entered into a multi-year, multi-million-dollar agreement to develop, integrate and bring to market improved cyber defense solutions. The goal is to offer managed security operations, incident response support and integrated threat hunting so joint customers can better detect, investigate and respond to cyber threats.Alibaba Stake In Chinese Supermarket, Logistics: Alibaba has taken a 10% stake in Chinese supermarket New Huadu Supercenter, which has traditional retail stores in the Fujian province. Alibaba also invested $5.3 billion to increase its stake in Chinese logistics company Cainiao from 47% to 51%. The company wants to fulfil customer orders in the mainland within 24 hours and overseas orders within 72 hours.The company earlier announced that it will be spending $15 billion to over the next five years for the development of a global logistics network. Cainiao isn’t profitable yet, but Alibaba’s growing business might just make this possible in the next few years.Some NumbersApple Music Subscribers Up: Apple Music has attracted more than 30 million customers, according to Apple. This compares with Spotify’s 60 million (at the end of July), or 140 million is you also count the customers opting for the free ad-supported service. Apple doesn’t have a free tier, which is not necessarily a negative given that the two companies have a different strategy for their businesses.In Spotify’s case, it gets as many new subs as possible through the free tier and migrates as many as possible over to the paid model. In Apple’s case, it sells some expensive hardware and customers buying it like to pay for its services, including music. The thing that’s worth watching in this is the growth rate and Spotify seems to be generating paying customers at a faster rate than Apple. At least as of now.Micron Reports: Micron posted very strong revenue and earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter, up very strongly from the year-ago quarter and better than both management guidance and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

902,WDC,"Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) ended fiscal 2017 on a strong note with reporting outstanding results for the fourth quarter. The memory-chip maker’s quarterly revenues and earnings not only marked a significant year-over-year growth but also came ahead of its own guidance range as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Apart from this, the company’s gross margin, operating income and free cash flow reached to a record level during the quarter. President and CEO of Micron, Sanjay Mehrotra noted that the overwhelming quarterly results were mainly “driven by favorable industry fundamentals and solid execution in deploying our next-generation, lower cost technologies and diversifying our product portfolio toward a richer mix of differentiated, high-value solutions.”Micron shares closed up approximately 4% in the extended trading hours. Notably, Micron has gained 57.9% in the year-to-date period, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 return of just 11.4%.Let’s now discuss fourth quarter in detail.RevenuesMicron’s revenues in the quarter increased nearly 91% on a year-over-year basis to $6.138 billion. Also, reported revenues increased on a quarter-over-quarter basis (up 10%), mainly due to pricing improvement in the DRAM and NAND sales volume. Quarterly revenues also came ahead of the company’s own guidance range of $5.7–$6.1 billion as well as surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.894 billion. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to improved pricing and strong demand environment for DRAM and NAND chips.Sales from DRAM products, which accounted for 66% of total revenue during the quarter, increased over two-folds on a year over year basis and 13% on a sequential basis. The company witnessed a 5% and 8% rise in bit shipments and average selling price (ASP), respectively, on quarter-on-quarter basis. On the other hand, sales from NAND products, which accounted for 30% of total revenues, marked a growth of 81% on year over year basis and 8% on quarter on quarter basis. A 3% rise in bit shipments and 5% increase in ASP drove the sequential revenue growth.Business unit-wise, revenues of computing and networking business (CNBU) unit more than doubled from the year-ago quarter and reached to $2.8 billion. Apart from healthy pricing environment, the increase was led by strong demand from cloud customers as they accelerate “architecting data centers and computing capabilities.”Revenues from the Mobile Business Unit (MBU) reached its highest level at $1.12, registering a year-over-year growth of 76%. Senior vice president and CFO, Ernie Maddock noted that strong revenue growth at MBU was “due in part to the positive progress we have made in qualifying our mobile NAND solutions.”Storage Business Unit (SBU) revenues came in at $1.3 billion, up 71% year over year. However, sequentially the company witnessed a slight decline in revenues mainly due to flash component issue at some selected TLC 3D NAND products.The Embedded business unit delivered record performance with revenues reaching $827 million, up 18% from the last quarter and 61% from the year-ago quarter, mainly due to strong bit demand from the consumer applications and automotive customers.Income and MarginsMicron’s non-GAAP gross profit increased over five-fold on a year-over-year basis to $3.147 billion while margin grew to 51.3% from 18.6% reported in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin also came ahead of the management’s guidance range of 47% to 51%. The robust year over year improvement in gross margin was mainly driven by healthy industry pricing environment and increased adoption of the company’s advanced technology-based products.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased nearly 13% year over year to $601 million, but came within the company’s guidance range of $575–$625 million. Operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 670 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 9.8%.Micron’s non-GAAP operating income came at $2.546 billion compared with just $66 million reported in the year-ago quarter and came well ahead of the company’s own guidance range of $2.1–$2.4 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin improved to 41.5% from 2.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Higher gross margin and reduced operating expenses as a percentage of revenues led this tremendous growth.On a non-GAAP basis, the company reported net income of $2.387 billion. In the year-ago quarter, the company incurred net loss of $9 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share came at $2.02 beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84.

Capital expenditure was $5.1 billion in fiscal 2017.OutlookThe company provided outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

This may be due to the skepticism surrounding over the continuity of healthy demand for memory chips.However, we believe that investors should not worry about this as the demand for memory chips is now not only dependent on PC. The industry is witnessing strong demand from other markets which include smartphone makers and data center operators. Therefore, we expect supply and demand dynamics to remain favorable for the next few years.Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the acquisition of Inotera in Dec 2016 will have some operational benefits, leading to efficient management of investment levels and cadence, followed by alignment with global manufacturing operations.Micron is positive about the product launches and growing demand, particularly that of SSD products. We also believe that any increase in prices will have a favorable impact on the company’s overall results. We anticipate these benefits to be a tailwind for the company, going forward.However, after acquiring SanDisk, Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) has become a key player in the NAND space, which could increase competition in the industry.Currently, Micron has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Some other stocks worth considering in the technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and FormFactor, Inc. (FORM  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA and FormFactor have a long term-expected EPS growth rate of 10.3% and 16%, respectively.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.
